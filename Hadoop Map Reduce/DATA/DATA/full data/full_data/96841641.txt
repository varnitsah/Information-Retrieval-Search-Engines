them the reader may feel assured that all the  information which they contain not only in respect to the countries  visited and to the customs usages and modes of life that are  described but also in

at the wharf     rollo on the atlantic     chapter i  taking passage   when rollo was about twelve years of age he made a voyage to europe under rather extraordinary circumstances he went alone that is to say he had no one to take care of him in fact in addition to being obliged to take care of himself he had also his little sister jane to take care of for she went with hima the way it happened that two such children were sent to sea on such a long voyage without any one to have them in charge was this  footnote a it ought here to be stated that jane was not really rollos sister though he always called her and considered her so she was really his cousin her father and mother had both died when she was about six years old and then mr and mrs holiday had adopted her as their own child so that ever since that time she had lived with rollo and nathan as their sister she was very nearly of the same age with nathan  rollos father and mother had gone to europe to make a tour a year before this time and had taken rollos brother nathan or thanny as rollo used most frequently to call him with them they had gone partly for pleasure but more especially on account of mr holidays health which was not good it was thought that the voyage and the recreation and pleasure of travelling in europe would be a benefit to him in certain cases where a persons health is impaired especially when one is slowly recovering from past sickness nothing is found to have a more beneficial effect upon the patient than for him to go away somewhere and have a good time it was determined to try the effect of this remedy upon mr holiday and so he went to europe mrs holiday went with him they took thanny too to be company for them on the way thanny was at this time about seven years old  a child of that age for a travelling companion is sometimes a source of great pleasure and sometimes on the other hand he is the means of great annoyance and vexation this depends upon whether he is obedient patient quiet and gentle in his manners and demeanor or noisy inconsiderate wilful and intractable a great many children act in such a manner whenever they take a journey or go out to ride with their parents that their parents in selfdefence are obliged to adopt the plan of almost always contriving to leave them behind  it was not so however with nathan he was an excellent boy in travelling and always made the ride or the journey more pleasant for those who took him with them this was the reason why when it was determined that mr and mrs holiday should go to england that mrs holiday was very desirous that nathan should go too and so far as nathan was concerned the voyage and the tour proved to be all that mr and mrs holiday expected or desired in regard to other points however it was less successful mr holiday did not improve in health and he did not have a good time mrs holiday was anxious about her husbands health and she was uneasy too at being separated so long from her other two childrenrollo and little jane especially little janewhom she had learned to love as if she were really her daughter so before the year was ended they both heartily wished themselves back in america again  but now mr holidays health grew worse and he seemed too ill to return this was in the month of may it was decided by the physician that it would not be best for him to attempt to return until september and perhaps not until the following spring mrs holiday was herself very much disappointed at this result she however submitted to it very cheerfully i must be as good as thanny said she he submits patiently to his disappointments and why should not i submit to mine his are as great i suppose for him to bear as mine are for me  when mrs holiday found that she could not go to her children she began to be very desirous that her children should come to her she was at first almost afraid to propose such a thing to her husband as she did not see how any possible plan could be formed for bringing rollo and jane across the wide and boisterous atlantic alone she however at length one day asked mr holiday whether it would not be possible in some way to accomplish it  mr holiday seemed half surprised and half pleased when he heard this proposal at first he did not appear to know exactly what to say or even to think he sat looking into the fire which was blazing in the grate before him lost apparently in a sort of pleasing abstraction there was a faint smile upon his countenance but he did not speak a word  that is an idea he said at length in a tone of satisfaction that is really an idea  mrs holiday did not speak she awaited in silence and with no little anxiety the result of her husbands meditations  that is really quite an idea he said at length let us get rollo and jane here and then we shall feel entirely easy and can return to america whenever we get ready be it sooner or later we shall be at home at once where we are  i suppose it will cost something to have them come over said mrs holiday she was not so anxious to have the children come as to desire that the question should be decided without having all the objections fully considered besides she was afraid that if the question were to be decided hastily without proper regard to the difficulties that were in the way there would be danger that it would be reconsidered after more mature reflection and the decision reversed so she wished that every thing that could be brought against the project should be fully taken into the account at the outset  i suppose said she that their expenses in coming out and in returning and in remaining here with us in the interim would amount to a considerable sum  yes said mr holiday but that is of no consequence  i dont know what we should do about having them taken care of on the passage added mrs holiday  o there would be no difficulty about that said mr holiday george could easily find some passenger coming out in the ship who would look after them while at sea i have no doubt and if he should not find any one it would be of no consequence rollo could take care of himself  and of jane too asked mrs holiday  yes replied mr holiday and of jane too that is with the help of the chambermaids they have excellent chambermaids on board the atlantic steamers  so it was concluded to send for rollo and jane to embark on board the steamer at new york and sail for europe mr holiday wrote to rollos uncle george requesting him to make the necessary arrangements for the voyage and then to take the children to new york and put them on board he was to commit them if possible to the charge of some one of the passengers on board the ship if for any reason he should not succeed in finding any passenger to take care of them he was to state the case to the captain of the ship that he might see to them a little from time to time and in addition to this he was to put them under the special charge of one of the chambermaids promising her that she should be well rewarded for her services on the arrival of the ship in liverpool  the important tidings of the determination which had been made that rollo and jane should actually cross the atlantic were first announced to the children one evening near the end of may they were eating their supper at the time seated on a stone seat at the bottom of the garden where there was a brook their supper as it consisted of a bowl of bread and milk for each was very portable and they had accordingly gone down to their stone seat to eat it as they often did on pleasant summer evenings the stone seat was in such a position that the setting sun shone very cheerily upon it on this occasion rollo had finished his milk and was just going down to the brook by a little path which led that way in order to see if there were any fishes in the water while jane was giving the last spoonful of her milk to their kitten on the stone near where jane was sitting was a small birdcage this cage was one which jane used to put her kitten in the kitten was of a mottled color which gave to its fur somewhat the appearance of spots and so jane called the little puss her tiger as it was obviously proper that a tiger should be kept in a cage jane had taken a canary birdcage which she found one day in the garret and had used it to put the kitten in as she took the precaution never to keep the prisoner shut up long at a time and as she almost always fed it in the cage the kitten generally made no objections to going in whenever jane desired it  here comes uncle george said rollo  jane was so busy pouring the spoonful of milk through the bars of the cage into a little shallow basin which she kept for the purpose within that she could not look up  he is coming down through the garden added rollo and he has got a letter in his hand its from mother i know  so saying rollo began to caper about with delight and then ran off to meet his uncle jane finished the work of pouring out the milk as soon as possible and then followed him they soon came back again however accompanying their uncle and conducting him to the stone seat where the children sat down to hear the letter  rollo said mr george how should you like to go to england  to go to england said rollo in a tone of exultation very much indeed  should you dare to go alone said mr george that is with nobody to take care of you  yes indeed said rollo emphatically i should not need any body to take care of me  i dont know but you will have to go said mr george and not only take care of yourself but of jane besides  why am i to go too asked jane as she said this she began to look quite alarmed  how should you like the plan said mr george  o i should not dare to go said jane shaking her head with a very serious air i should not dare to go at all unless i had somebody to take care of me bigger than rollo  ha exclaimed rollo i could take care of you perfectly well i could buy the tickets and show you down to supper and help you over the plank at the landings and every thing else  rollos experience of steamer life had been confined to trips on long island sound or up and down the hudson river  i suppose you would be dreadfully sick on the way said mr george  o no said rollo i should not be sick whats the use of being sick besides i never am sick in a steamboat  no said jane shaking her head and looking quite anxious i should not dare to go with you at all i should not dare to go unless my mother were here to go with me or my father at least  i am afraid you will have to go said mr george whether you are afraid to or not  that i shall have to go repeated jane  yes replied mr george your father has written me that he is not well enough to come home and i am to send you and rollo out in the next steamer so that you see you have nothing to say or to do about it all you have to do is to submit to destiny  jane did not know very precisely what was meant by the phrase submitting to destiny but she understood very well that in this case it meant that she must go to england to join her father and mother whether she liked the plan or not she was silent a moment and looked very thoughtful she then put forth her hand to her kitten which was just at that moment coming out of the cage having finished drinking the milk which she had put there for it and took it into her lap saying at the same time  well then i will go only you must let me take my tiger with me  that you can do said mr george i am very willing to compromise the matter with you in that way you can take tiger with you if you choose  and the cage too said jane putting her hand upon the ring at the top of it  yes said mr george and the cage too  well said jane speaking in a tone of great satisfaction and joyousness then i will go get into the cage tiger and well go and get ready                                       the steamer was to sail in about a week from this time so mr george proceeded immediately to new york to engage passage when rollos aunt who had had the care of him and jane during the absence of mr and mrs holiday heard how soon the steamer would sail she said that she did not think that that would afford time enough to get the children ready  o it takes no time said mr george to get people ready to go to europe put into a trunk plenty of plain common clothing for the voyage and the work is done as for the rest people can generally find pretty much every thing they want on the other side  mr george went to new york to engage the passage for the children and inasmuch as many of the readers of this book who reside in the country may never have had the opportunity of witnessing the arrangements connected with atlantic steamers they may perhaps like to know how this was done in the first place it was necessary to get a permit to go on board the ship the crowds of people in new york who are always going to and fro are so great and the interest felt in these great steamships is so strong that if every body were allowed free access and egress to them the decks and cabins of the vessels would be always in confusion so they build a barricade across the great pier at which the ships lie with ponderous gates one large one for carts and carriages and another smaller one for people on foot opening through it and no one is admitted without a ticket mr george went to the office in wall street and procured such a ticket which one of the clerks in attendance there gave him on his saying that he wished to go on board to select a state room for some passengers  provided with this ticket mr george took an omnibus at wall street and rode up to canal street at canal street he took another omnibus which carried him nearly to the east river there he left the omnibus and proceeded the rest of the way on foot the crowd of people on the sidewalks going and coming and of carts drays wagons and coaches in the street was immense there was one crossing where for some time mr george could not get over so innumerable and closely wedged together were the vehicles of all descriptions that occupied the way there were many people that were stopped with him on the sidewalk among them was a servant girl with a little boy under her charge whom she was leading by the hand the girl looked very anxious not knowing how to get across the street  let me carry the child across for you said mr george  so saying he took the child up gently but quickly in his arms and watching a momentary opening in the stream of carriages he pressed through the servant girl following him he set the boy down upon the sidewalk the girl said that she was very much obliged to him indeed and then mr george went on  just then a small and ragged boy held out his hand and with a most woebegone expression of countenance and a piteous tone of voice begged mr george to give him a few pennies to keep him from starving mr george took no notice of him but passed on a moment afterward he turned round to look at the boy again he saw him take a top out of his pocket and go to spinning it upon the sidewalk and then suddenly seeing some other boys the young rogue caught up his top and ran after them with shouts of great hilarity and glee he was an impostor mr george knew this when he refused to give him any money  illustration the pier  mr george then went on again he came at length to the great gates which led to the pier there was a man just within the gate walking to and fro near the door of a sort of office or lodge which he kept there mr george attempted to open the gate  please show your ticket sir said he  mr george took out his ticket and gave it to the porter whereupon the porter opened the gate and let him in  mr george found himself under an enormous roof which spread itself like a vast canopy over his head and extended from side to side across the pier under this vast shed laborers were wheeling boxes and bales of merchandise to and fro while small steam engines of curious forms and incessant activity were at work hoisting coal on board the ships from lighters alongside and in other similar operations there were two monstrous steamships lying at this pier one on each side mr george turned toward the one on the left there was a long flight of steps leading up from the pier to the decks of this ship it was formed by a staging which extended from the pier to the bulwarks of the ship like a staircase with a railing on each side mr george ascended these steps to the bulwarks and thence descended by a short flight of steps to the deck itself and then went along the deck till he came to the door leading to the cabins  he found within quite a number of cabins arranged on different floors like the different stories of a house these cabins were very resplendent with gilding and carving and were adorned with curtains and mirrors on every side they presented to mr george as he walked through them a very imposing spectacle along the sides of them were a great many little bed rooms called state rooms these state rooms were all very beautifully finished and were furnished with every convenience which passengers could require mr george selected two of these state rooms they were two that were adjoining to each other and they were connected by a door there were two beds or rather bed places in each state room one above the other mr george chose the lower berth in one state room for rollo and the lower one in the next state room for jane when he had chosen the berths in this manner he wrote the name of each of the children on a card and then pinned the cards up upon the curtains of the respective berths  there said he that is all right now perhaps some lady will take the other berth in janes room and some gentleman that in rollos then they will both have company in their rooms otherwise i must find somebody to take care of them both  mr george then left the ship and went back to the office in wall street to engage the berths and pay the passage money the office was spacious and handsomely furnished and there were several clerks in it writing at desks there were two rooms and in the back room was a table with large plans of the ship upon it on which all the cabins and state rooms of the several decks were represented in their proper positions the names of the various passengers that had engaged passage in the ship were written in the several state rooms which they had chosen the clerk wrote the names master holiday and miss holiday in the state rooms which mr george pointed out to him and when he had done so mr george looked over all the other names that had been written in before to see if there were any persons whom he knew among them to his great gratification he found that there were several such  yes said he as he rose up from the examination of the plan there are several gentlemen there who will be very ready under the circumstances of the case to do mr holiday the favor of looking after his children during the voyage  being thus in a measure relieved of all solicitude mr george walked about the room a few minutes examining the pictures of the several steamers of the line which were hanging on the walls and then went away     chapter ii  the embarkation   the time fixed for the sailing of the steamer was on tuesday morning and mr george in order to have time to communicate with some of the gentlemen to whose care he intended to intrust the two children planned his journey to new york so as to arrive there in good season on monday he supposed that he should be able without any difficulty to find one or the other of them in the afternoon or evening of that day  and if worst comes to the worst added he to himself in his reflections on the subject i can certainly find them at the ship by going on board an hour or two before she sails and watching the plank as the passengers come up from the pier  worst did come to the worst it seems for when mr george came home at nine oclock in the evening on monday and rollo came up to him very eagerly in the parlor of the boarding house to ask him whom he had found to take charge of them he was forced to confess that he had not found any one  i am glad of it exclaimed rollo joyfully i am glad of it i like it a great deal better to take care of ourselves  he then began dancing about the room and finally ran off in great glee to inform jane of the prospect before them rollo was very ambitious of being considered a man  he found jane sitting on the stairs with another child of her own age that she had become acquainted with at the boarding house for it was at a boarding house and not at a hotel that mr george had taken lodgings for his party this childs name was lottie that is she was commonly called lottie though her real name was charlotte she was a beautiful child with beaming black eyes a radiant face and dark glossy curls of hair hanging down upon her neck jane and lottie were playing together in a sort of recess at a landing of the stairs where there was a sofa and a window they had tiger and the cage with them the door was open and tiger was playing about the cage going in and out at her pleasure  jane said rollo uncle george cannot find any body to take care of you and so i am going to take care of you  jane did not answer  are you going to england asked lottie  yes replied jane mournfully and there is nobody to go with us to take care of us  i went to england once said lottie  did you asked jane and did you go across the atlantic ocean  yes said lottie  of course she did said rollo there is no other way  and how did you get along said jane  o very well said lottie we had a very good time playing about the decks and cabins  jane felt somewhat reassured by these declarations of lottie and she even began to think that if there was nothing to be done in crossing the atlantic but to play about the decks and cabins all the way there was a possibility that rollo might be able to take care of her  my uncle is going on a voyage too tomorrow added lottie  what uncle asked jane  my uncle thomas said lottie he lives in this house he is packing up his trunk now he is going to charleston i wish i were going with him  do you like to go to sea asked jane  yes said lottie pretty well i like to see the sailors climb up the masts and rigging and i like the cabins because there are so many sofas in them and so many places to hide  little jane felt much less uneasiness at the idea of going to sea after hearing lottie give such favorable accounts of her own experience still she was not entirely satisfied as for rollo his eagerness to go independent of all supervision did not arise wholly from vanity and presumption he was now twelve years of age and that is an age which fairly qualifies a boy to bear some considerable burdens of responsibility and duty at any rate it is an age at which it ought to be expected that the powers and characteristics of manhood should at least begin to be developed it is right therefore that a boy at that age should begin to feel something like a man and to desire that opportunities should arise for exercising the powers which he finds thus developing themselves and growing stronger every day within him  the fact that lotties uncle thomas was going to embark for charleston on the same day that had been fixed for rollos embarkation for europe might seem at first view a very unimportant circumstance it happened however that it led in fact to very serious consequences the case was this it is necessary however first to explain for the benefit of those readers of this book who may never have had opportunities to become acquainted with the usages of great cities that there are two separate systems in use in such cities for the transportation respectively of baggage and of persons from place to place for baggage and parcels there are what are called expresses the owners of these expresses have offices in various parts of the city where books are kept in which a person may go and have an entry made of any trunk or bag or other package which he may wish to have conveyed to any place he enters in the book what the parcel is where it is and where he wishes to have it taken the express man then who has a great number of wagons employed for this purpose sends for the parcel by the first wagon that comes in  for persons who wish to be conveyed from place to place there are carriages all the time standing at certain points by the sides of the streets ready for any one who calls them and there are also stables where carriages are always in readiness now it so happened that lotties uncle thomas had concluded to have his trunk taken down to the charleston ship by the express intending to walk to the pier himself from his office which was in the lower part of the city not far from the pier where his ship was lying so he went to an express office and there at his dictation the clerk made the following entry in his book       trunk at 780 broadway to steamer carolina pier no 4 north river      tomorrow at half past nine oclock  on the other hand mr george as he required a carriage to take the children down did not go to the express office at all he intended to take their trunk on the carriage so he went to the stable and there at his dictation the clerk made on the book there the following entry       carriage at 780 broadway tomorrow at half past nine oclock  in accordance with this arrangement therefore a little after nine oclock both the trunks were got ready at the boarding house each in its own room the chambermaid in rollos room when she saw that the trunk was ready offered to carry it down which as she was a good strong irish girl she could very easily do she accordingly took it up in her arms and carried it down stairs to the front entry and put it down near the door one of the waiters of the house was standing by when she did this  what is that mary said he  it is a trunk to go to the steamer said mary there is a man coming for it pretty soon  she meant of course that it was to go to the liverpool steamer and the man who was to come for it was the driver of the carriage that mr george had engaged she knew nothing about any other trunk as the room which lotties uncle occupied was attended by another chambermaid  mary having deposited the trunk in its place returned up stairs to assist in getting rollo and jane ready a moment afterward the express man whom lotties uncle had sent for his trunk rang the door bell the waiter opened the door  i came for a trunk said the man to take to the steamer  yes said the waiter here it is all ready they have just brought it down  so the express man took up the trunk and carrying it out put it on his wagon then mounting on his seat he drove away  five minutes afterward the carriage which mr george had engaged arrived at the door mr george and the children came down the stairs mr george as soon as he reached the lower hall inquired  where is the trunk  the man has taken it sir said he  ah he has has he that is all right  so mr george and the children got into the carriage the driver holding the door open for them as they did so as the driver was about to shut the door mr george said  steamer pacific foot of canal street  the driver taking this for his direction mounted his box and drove rapidly away  when the party arrived at the gates which led to the pier they found a great concourse of people and a throng of carts and carriages blocking up the way the great gate was open and a stream of carriages containing passengers and of carts and express wagons conveying baggage was pouring in mr georges carriage was admitted at length in its turn and drove on until it came opposite the long stairway which led on board the ship here it stopped and mr george and the children got out  where is the trunk said mr george looking before and behind the carriage why where is the trunk you have lost the trunk off of the carriage driver in coming down  no sir said the driver there was no trunk  there certainly was said mr george and they told me that you had put it on  no sir said the driver this is the first time i have heard any thing about any trunk  mr george was now quite seriously alarmed he looked about this way and that and did not seem to know what to do in the mean time the line of carriages from behind pressed on and the drivers of them began to call out to clear the way mr george found himself compelled to decide upon something very promptly  drive over to the other side of the pier said he and wait there till i come  then taking the two children by the hand he began to lead them up the long plank by which the people were going on board  mr george said nothing but continued to lead the children along the throng before and behind them being so dense that they could not see at all where they were going when they reached the top of the stairway they descended by a few steps and so came on board the children then found themselves moving along what seemed a narrow passage way amid crowds of people until at length they came to a short and steep flight of steps which led up to what seemed to jane a sort of a roof the balustrade or what served as balustrade for these steps was made of rope and painted green by help of this rope and by some lifting on the part of mr george rollo and jane succeeded in getting up and at length found themselves in a place where they could see  they were on what was called the promenade deck there were masts and a great smokepipe and a great amount of ropes and rigging rising up above them and there were many other curious objects around the children had however no time to attend to these things for mr george led them rapidly along to that part of the promenade deck which was opposite to the long plank where the people were coming up from the pier mr george left the children here for a minute or two while he went and brought two camp stools for them to sit upon he placed these stools near the edge of the deck there was a railing to keep them from falling off  there children said he now you can sit here and see the people come on board it is a very funny thing to see i am going after the trunk you must not mind if i dont come back for a long time the ship will not sail yet for two hours you must stay here however all the time you must not go away from this place on any consideration  so saying mr george went away a moment afterward the children saw him going down the plank to the pier as soon as he reached the pier he forced his way through the crowd to the other side of it where the carriage was standing the children watched him all the time when he reached the carriage they saw that he stopped a moment to say a few words to the driver and then hastily got into the carriage the driver shut the door mounted upon the box and then drove out through the great gate and disappeared  what mr george said to the driver was this  now driver we have got just two hours to find that trunk i pay you full fare for the carriage for the two hours at any rate and if we find the trunk and get it on board that ship before she sails i pay you five dollars over now take me up to 780 broadway as quick as you can go  when the children found themselves thus left they could not help feeling for a moment a very painful sensation of loneliness although they were in fact surrounded with crowds and were in the midst of a scene of the greatest excitement even rollo found his courage and resolution ebbing away he sat for a little time without speaking and gazed upon the scene of commotion which he saw exhibited before him on the pier with a vague and bewildered feeling of anxiety and fear presently he turned to look at jennie he saw that she was trying to draw her handkerchief from her pocket and that tears were slowly trickling down her cheek  jennie said he dont cry uncle george will find the trunk pretty soon and come back  it might perhaps be supposed that rollo would have been made to feel more dispirited and depressed himself from witnessing jennies dejection but the effect was really quite the contrary of this in fact it is found to be universally true that nothing tends to nerve the heart of man to greater resolution and energy in encountering and struggling against the dangers and ills that surround him than to have woman near him and dependent upon him and to see her looking up to him for protection and support it is true that rollo was not a man nor was jennie a woman but even in their early years the instincts and sympathies which exercise so powerful a control over the human heart in later periods of life began to develop themselves in embryo forms so rollo found all his courage and confidence coming back again when he saw jennie in tears  besides he reflected that he had a duty to perform he perceived that the time had now come for him to show by his acts that he was really able to do what he had been so eager to undertake he determined therefore that instead of yielding to the feelings of fear and despondency which his situation was so well calculated to inspire he would nerve himself with resolution and meet the emergencies of the occasion like a man  the first thing to be done as he thought was to amuse jane and divert her attention if possible from her fears so he began to talk to her about what was taking place before them on the pier  here comes another carriage jennie said he look look see what a parcel of trunks they have got on behind that passenger has not lost his trunks at any rate see all these orange women too jennie standing on the edge of the pier how many oranges they have got do you suppose they will sell them all o jennie jennie look there see that great pile of trunks going up into the air  jane looked in the direction where rollo pointed and saw a large pile of trunks and boxes eight or ten in all slowly rising into the air being drawn up by means of a monstrous rope which descended from a system of pulleys and machinery above after attaining a considerable height the whole mass slowly moved over toward the ship and after reaching the centre of the deck it began to descend again with a great rattling of chains and machinery until it disappeared from view somewhere on board  that is the way they get the baggage on board jennie said rollo i never should have thought of getting baggage on board in that way should you jennie i wonder where the trunks go to when the rope lets them down it is in some great black hole i have no doubt down in the ship the next load of trunks that comes i have a great mind to go and see  no no said jane you must not go away uncle george said that we must not move away from here on any account  so he did said rollo well i wont go  after a short time jennie became so far accustomed to her situation as to feel in some degree relieved of her fears in fact she began to find it quite amusing to watch the various phases which the exciting scene that was passing before her assumed rollo endeavored still more to encourage and cheer her by frequently assuring her that their uncle would soon come back he did this indeed from the best of motives but it was not wise or even right to do so for he could not possibly know when his uncle would come back or even whether he would come back at all  in the mean time the crowd of carriages and people coming and going on the pier was continually increasing as the time for the departure of the ship drew nigh there were more than one hundred passengers to come on board and almost every one of these had many friends to come with them to bid them good by so that there was a perpetual movement of carriages coming and going upon the pier and the long plank which led up to the ship was crowded with people ascending and descending in continuous streams the paddle wheels were all the time in motion though the ship being yet fastened to the shore could not move away the wheels however produced a great commotion in the water covering the surface of it with rushing foam and at the same time the steam was issuing from the escapepipe with a roaring sound which seemed to crown and cover as it were without at all subduing the general din  rollo had one very extraordinary proof of the deep and overwhelming character of the excitement of this scene in an accident that occurred in the midst of it which for a moment frightened him extremely the pier where the steamer was lying was surrounded by other piers and docks all crowded with boats and shipping it happened that not very far from him there lay a small vessel a sloop which had come down the north river and was now moored at the head of the dock there was a family on board this sloop and while rollo was by chance looking that way he saw a small child perhaps seven or eight years old fall off from the deck of the sloop into the water the child did not sink being buoyed up by her clothes and as the tide was flowing strong at that time an eddy of the water carried her slowly along away from the sloop toward the shore the child screamed with terror and rollo could now and then catch the sound of her voice above the roaring of the steam the sailors on board the sloop ran toward the boat and began to let it down others on the shore got ready with poles and boat hooks and though they were probably shouting and calling aloud to one another rollo could hear nothing but now and then the scream of the child at length a man came running down a flight of stone steps which led from the pier to the water in a corner of the dock throwing off his coat and shoes as he went down he plunged into the water swam out to the child seized her by the clothes with one hand and with the other swam back with her toward the steps and there they were both drawn out by the bystanders together  illustration the rescue  this scene however exciting as it would have been under any other circumstances produced very little impression upon the great crowd that was engaged about the steamer a few boys ran that way to see how the affair would result some others standing on the decks of the ship or on the pier turned and looked in the direction of the child otherwise every thing went on the same the carriages went and came the people walked eagerly about among each other exchanging farewells the paddle wheels continued their motion the steam pipe kept up its deafening roar and the piles of trunks continued to rise into the air and swing over into the ship without any interruption  the time passed rapidly on and mr george did not return at length but few new carriages came and the stream of people on the great plank seemed to flow all one way and that was from the ship to the pier while the crowd upon the pier had increased until it had become a mighty throng at length the officer in command gave orders to rig the tackle to the great plank stair with a view to heaving it back upon the pier the last lingering visitors to the ship who had come to take leave of their friends hastily bade them farewell and ran down the plank the ship in fact was just on the point of casting off from the pier when suddenly mr georges carriage appeared at the great gate it came in among the crowd at a very rapid rate but still it was so detained by the obstructions which were in the way that before it reached its stoppingplace the plank had begun slowly to rise into the air and the men on the pier had begun to throw off the fastenings  you are too late sir said a man to mr george you cannot get on board  put the trunk on board said mr george thats all  the man took up the trunk which was by no means heavy and just succeeded in passing it through into a sort of porthole near the engine which happened to be open mr george then looked up to the place where he had left the children and shouted out to them  good by children dont be afraid your father will come to the ship for you at liverpool good by jennie rollo will take excellent care of you dont be afraid  by this time the ship was slowly and majestically moving away from the pier and thus it happened that rollo and jennie set out on the voyage to europe without having any one to take them in charge  illustration     chapter iii  departure   the moving away of the steamer from the pier had the effect of producing a striking illusion in janes mind  why rollo she exclaimed looking up to rollo quite alarmed the pier is sailing away from us and all the people on it  o no said rollo the pier is not sailing away we are sailing away ourselves  jane gazed upon the receding shore with a look of bewildered astonishment then she added in a very sorrowful and desponding tone  o rollo you told me that uncle george would certainly come back and now he is not coming back at all  well i really thought he would come back said rollo but never mind jennie we shall get along very well we shall not have to get out of this ship at all till we get to liverpool and we shall find father at liverpool he will come on board for us at liverpool i am sure before we land and mother too i dare say just think of that jennie just think of that  this anticipation would doubtless have had considerable influence in calming jennies mind if she had had any opportunity to dwell upon it but her thoughts were immediately diverted to the spectacle which was exhibiting itself on the pier the great throng of people which had assembled there seemed to be pressing on toward the end of the pier accompanying the ship as it were in its motion as it glided smoothly away as they thus crowded forward all those who had opportunity to do so climbed up upon boxes and bales of merchandise or on heaps of wood or coal or on posts or beams of wood wherever they could find any position which would raise them above the general level of the crowd this scene of course strongly attracted the attention both of rollo and of jane  and here it must be remarked that there are three distinct scenes of bidding farewell that an atlantic steamer passes through in putting to sea in the first place the individual voyagers take leave of their several friends by words of good by and other personal greetings on the decks and in the cabins of the ship before she leaves the pier then secondly the company of passengers as a whole give a good by to the whole company of visitors who have come to see the ship sail and who remain standing on the pier as the vessel goes away this second good by cannot be given by words for the distance is too great to allow of words being used so they give it by huzzas and by the waving of hats and handkerchiefs  this second farewell was now about to be given the gentlemen on the pier took off their hats and waving them in the air shouted hurrah in concert three times with great energy the company of passengers on board the ship then responded by shouting and waving their hats in return the ladies both on the pier and in the ship performed their part in this ceremony by waving their handkerchiefs and clapping their hands by this time the steamer which had been rapidly increasing the speed of its motion all the while was now getting quite out into the stream and was turning rapidly down the river this change in the direction in which the steamer was going carried the pier and all the people that were upon it entirely out of the childrens view and they saw themselves gliding rapidly along the shore of the river which was formed of a long line of piers with forests of masts surmounting them and long ranges of stores and warehouses beyond nearer to the steamer on the water of the river and on either hand were to be seen sloops ships ferry boats scows and every other species of water craft gliding to and fro in all directions while gazing with great interest on this scene as the steamer moved along jane was suddenly startled and terrified at the sound of a heavy gun which seemed to be fired close to her ear it was soon evident that the gun had been fired from on board the steamer for a great puff of smoke rose up into the air from the bows of the vessel and slowly floated away immediately afterward another gun was fired louder than the first  i have said that there were three farewells the first is that of the individual passengers to their individual friends the second is that of the whole company of passengers to the company of spectators on the pier the third is the ships farewell to the city of course for a ship to speak to a city a very loud voice is required so they provide her with a gun in fact a great steamer proceeding to sea may be considered as in some respects like a mighty animal the engine is its heart the paddle wheels are its limbs the guns are its voice the captain is its head and finally there is a man always stationed on the lookout in the extreme forward part of the ship who serves the monster for eyes  jane was quite terrified at the sound of the guns  o rollo exclaimed she i wish they would not fire any more of those dreadful guns  i dont think they will fire any more said rollo in fact i am sure they will not for they have fired two now and they never fire more than two  rollo was mistaken in this calculation though he was right in the general principle that the number of guns usually discharged by a steamer going to sea as its parting salute is two in this case however the steamer in passing on down the river came opposite to a place in jersey city where a steamer of another line was lying moored to her pier waiting for her own sailing day now as the pacific passed by this other steamer the men on board of the latter having previously made every thing ready for the ceremony fired two guns as a salute to her by way of bidding her farewell and wishing her a good voyage of course it was proper to respond to the compliment and this called for two guns more this made in fact a fourth farewell which having been spoken the firing was over the pacific having thus taken leave of the city and also of her sister steamer on the jersey shore had now nothing to do but to proceed as fast as possible down the harbor and out to sea  the scenes which are presented to view on every hand in passing down new york harbor and bay are very magnificent and imposing ships steamers long ferry boats tugs sloops sail boats and every other species of water craft from the little skiff that bobs up and down over the waves made by the steamboat swell to the manofwar riding proudly at anchor in the stream are seen on every hand the shores too present enchanting pictures of rich and romantic beauty there are villas and cottages and smooth grassy lawns and vast fortifications and observatories and lighthouses and buoys and a great many other objects which strongly attract the attention and excite the curiosity of the voyager especially if he has been previously accustomed only to travelling on land  while the children were looking at these scenes with wonder and admiration as the ship passed down the harbor a younglooking man who appeared to belong to the ship came to them and told them that if they wished to remain on deck they had better go and sit upon the settees so saying he pointed to several large and heavylooking settees which were placed near the middle of the deck around what seemed to be a sort of skylight these settees were all firmly secured to their places with strong cords by means of which they were tied by the legs to some of the fixtures of the skylights in obedience to this suggestion the children went and took their places upon a settee jane carried the cage containing tiger which she had kept carefully with her thus far and put it down upon the settee by her side the man who had directed the children to this place and who was a sort of mate as they call such officers at sea looked at the kitten with an expression of contempt upon his countenance but said nothing he took the camp stools which the children had left and carried them away  i am sure i dont know what we are to do next said jane mournfully after sitting for a moment in silence  nor i rejoined rollo and so i am going to follow uncle georges rules  mr george had given rollo this rule as a sort of universal direction for young persons when travelling alone  1 do as you see other people do  2 when you cannot find out in this or in any other way what to do do nothing  in accordance with this advice rollo concluded to sit still upon the settee where the ships officer had placed him and do nothing in the mean time however he amused himself in watching the ships and steamers which he saw sailing to and fro about the harbor and in pointing out to jane all the remarkable objects which he observed from time to time along the shores  illustration the pilot on the paddle box  among other things which attracted his attention he noticed and watched the movements of a man who stood upon the top of one of the paddle boxes on the side of the ship where he walked to and fro very busily holding a speaking trumpet all the time in his hand every now and then he would call out in a loud voice a certain word sometimes it was port sometimes it was starboard and sometimes it was steady rollo observed that it was always one or the other of those three words and what was still more curious rollo observed that whenever the man on the paddle box called out the word the officer on the deck who kept walking about there all the time to and fro would immediately repeat it after him in a loud but in a somewhat singular tone while he was wondering what this could mean a gentleman who seemed to be one of the passengers came and sat down on the settee close by his side rollo had a great mind to ask him who the man on the paddle box was  well my boy said the gentleman you are rather young to go to sea how do you like it  pretty well sir said rollo  we are going out in fine style said the gentleman we shall soon be done with the pilot  the pilot said rollo inquiringly  yes said the gentleman there he is on the paddle box  is that the pilot asked rollo i thought the pilot was the man who steered  no replied the gentleman he is the man who gives directions how to steer he does not steer himself the man who steers is called the helmsman there he is  so saying the gentleman pointed toward the stern of the ship where there was a sort of platform raised a little above the deck with a row of panes of glass like a long narrow window in front of it through this window rollo could see the head of a man the man was standing in a recess which contained the wheel by means of which the ship was steered  the pilot keeps a lookout on the paddle box continued the gentleman watching the changes in the channel and also the movements of the vessels which are coming and going when he wishes the helm to be put to the right he calls out starboard when he wishes it to be put to the left he calls out port and when he wishes the ship to go straight forward as she is he calls out steady  just then the pilot from his lofty lookout on the paddle box called out port  the officer on the deck repeated the command in order to pass it along to the helmsman port  the helmsman then repeated it again by way of making it sure to the officer that he had heard it and was obeying it port  there were two or three dashinglooking young men walking together up and down the dock and one of them on hearing these commands called out not very loud but still in such a manner as that all around him could hear and imitating precisely the tones in which the pilots order had been given sherry  whereupon there was a great laugh among all the passengers around even the stern and moroselooking countenance of the officer relaxed into a momentary smile  now look forward at the bows of the ship said the gentleman and you will see her change her course in obedience to the command of the pilot to port the helm  rollo did so and observed the effect with great curiosity and pleasure  i thought the captain gave orders how to steer the ship said rollo  he does said the gentleman after we get fairly clear of the land it is the captains business to navigate the ship across the ocean but he has nothing to do with directing her when she is going in and out of the harbor the gentleman then went on to explain that at the entrances of all rivers and harbors there were usually rocks shoals sand bars and other obstructions some of which were continually shifting their position and character and making it necessary that they should be studied and known thoroughly by some one who is all the time upon the spot the men who do this are called pilots the pilots of each port form a company and have established rules and regulations for governing all their proceedings they go out to the mouth of the harbor in small vessels called pilot boats where they wait both in sunshine and storm for ships to come in when a ship approaches the coast and sees one of these pilot boats it makes a signal for a pilot to come on board the pilot boat then sails toward the ship and when they get near enough they let down a small boat and row one of the pilots on board the vessel and he guides the ship in in the same manner in going out of port the pilot guides the ship until they get out into deep water and then a pilot boat comes up and takes him off the ship the ship then proceeds to sea while the pilot boat continues to sail to and fro about the mouth of the harbor till another ship appears  and will this pilot get into a pilot boat and go back to new york asked rollo  yes replied the gentleman and the passengers can send letters back by him if they wish they often do  and can i asked rollo  yes replied the gentleman write your letter and i will give it to him  rollo had a small inkstand in his pocket and also a pocket book with note papers folded up and envelopes in it this was an apparatus that he always carried with him when he travelled he took out one of his sheets of note paper and wrote upon it the following letter       dear uncle george       this is to inform you that we have found a good seat and are      getting along very well                   your affectionate nephew                                  r holiday  rollo made his letter shorter than he otherwise would have done on account of having been informed by the gentleman when he had just written the first line that the pilot boat was coming in sight so he finished his writing and then folded his note and put it in its envelope he sealed the envelope with a wafer which he took out of a compartment of his pocket book he then addressed it to his uncle george in a proper manner and it was all ready the gentleman then took it and carried it to the pilot who was just then coming down from the paddle box and putting on his coat  by this time the pilot boat had come pretty near to the ship and was lying there upon the water at rest with her sails flapping in the wind the engine of the ship was stopped a small boat was then seen coming from the pilot boat toward the ship the boat was tossed fearfully by the waves as the oarsmen rowed it along when it came to the side of the ship a sailor threw a rope to it and it was held fast by means of the rope until the pilot got on board the rope was then cast off and the boat moved away the engine was now put in motion again and the great paddle wheels of the ship began to revolve as before rollo watched the little boat as it went bounding over the waves afraid all the time that it would be upset in which case his letter would be lost at length however he had the satisfaction of seeing the skiff safely reach the pilot boat and all the men climb up safely on board  there exclaimed rollo in a tone of great satisfaction now he will go up to the city safe and i am very glad he has got that letter for uncle george  in the mean time the captain mounted the paddle box where the pilot had stood and with his speaking trumpet in his hand began to give the necessary orders for the vigorous prosecution of the voyage the sails were spread the engines were put into full operation the helmsman was directed what course to steer and the ship pressed gallantly forward out into the open sea     chapter iv  getting settled   the gentleman who had so kindly explained the pilot system to rollo did not return to the settee after having given the pilot the letter but went away and for a few minutes rollo and jane were left alone they observed too that a great many of the passengers had disappeared and now there were very few about the deck rollo wondered where they had gone he soon received some light on the subject by overhearing one gentleman say to another as they passed the settee on their promenade  come charley let us go down and get some lunch  they are going to lunch said rollo we will go too i am beginning to be hungry  so am i hungry said jane i did not think of it before but i am and i have no doubt that tiger is hungry too  so jane took up her cage and then she and rollo walking along together followed the gentlemen who had said that they were going down to lunch they walked forward upon the promenade deck till they came to the short flight of stairs with the green rope balustrade which led down to the deck below these stairs were so steep that the children were obliged to proceed with great caution in descending them in order to get down in safety they however at length succeeded and then passing along where they saw that the gentlemen went who preceded them they entered into a long and narrow passage way with doors leading to state rooms on either hand following this passage way they came at length to a sort of entry or hall which was lighted by a skylight above in the middle of this hall and under the skylight was a pretty broad staircase leading down to some lower portion of the ship as the men whom they were following went down these stairs the children went down too when they got down they found themselves in a perfect maze of cabins state rooms and passage ways the openings into which were infinitely multiplied by the large and splendid mirrors with which the walls were every where adorned  put tiger down there said rollo pointing to a place near the end of the sofa and we will bring her something to eat when we come from lunch  jane was very anxious to take the kitten with her but she knew that under the circumstances in which she was placed it was proper that she should follow implicitly all of rollos directions so she put the cage down and then she and rollo went on together through a door where the gentlemen who had preceded them had gone  they found themselves in another long and narrow passage way which led toward the forward part of the ship the passage way was so narrow that they could not walk together so rollo went first and jane came behind the vessel was rocking gently from the motion of the waves and jane had to put her hands out once or twice first to one side and then to the other of the passage way in order to steady herself as she passed along presently they came to a place where they had to go up five or six steps and then to go immediately down again it was the place where the main shaft passed out from the engine to the paddle wheel after getting over this obstruction they went on a a little farther and then came into a large dining saloon where several long tables were spread and a great many passengers were seated eating their luncheons  there were a number of waiters in different parts of the room standing behind the guests at the tables and one of these waiters as soon as he saw rollo and jane come in went to them and said that he would show them where to sit so they followed him and he gave them a good seat at one of the tables as soon as the children were seated the waiter said addressing rollo  will you have soup  yes said rollo  and will the young lady take soup too he asked again  yes said rollo both of us  while the waiter was gone to get the soup rollo and jane had an opportunity of looking around the room and observing how very different it was in its fixtures and furniture from a dining room on land instead of windows there were only round holes in the sides of the ship about a foot in diameter for a sash there was only one round and exceedingly thick and strong pane of glass set in an iron frame and opening inwards on massive hinges on the side of this frame opposite the hinges was a strong clamp and screw by means of which the frame could be screwed up very tight in order to exclude the water in case of heavy seas the tables were fitted with a ledge all around the outside to keep the dishes from sliding off above each table and suspended from the ceiling was a long shelf of beautiful wood with racks and sockets in it of every kind for containing wineglasses tumblers decanters and such other things as would be wanted from time to time upon the table every one of these glasses was in a place upon the shelf expressly fitted to receive and retain it so that it might be held securely and not allowed to fall however great might be the motion of the ship  there were no chairs at the tables the seats consisted of handsomely cushioned settees with substantial backs to them it was upon one of these settees and near the end of it that rollo and jane were seated  when the soup was brought the children ate it with great satisfaction they found it excellent and besides that they had excellent appetites after the soup the waiter brought them some roasted potatoes and butter and also some slices of cold roast beef when the roast beef came jane exclaimed to rollo  ah i am very glad to see that it is just the thing for tiger  then she turned round and said to the waiter  can i take a piece of this meat to give to my kitten  your kitten said the waiter have you got a kitten on board  yes said jane  where is she asked the waiter  i left her in the cabin said jane by the end of a sofa she is in her cage  the waiter smiled to hear this statement jane had been in fact a little afraid to ask for meat for her kitten supposing it possible that the waiter might think that she ought not to have brought a kitten on board but the truth was the waiter was very glad to hear of it he was glad for two reasons in the first place the monotony and dulness of sea life are so great that those who live in ships are usually glad to have any thing occur that is extraordinary or novel then besides he knew that it was customary with passengers when they gave the waiters any unusual trouble to compensate them for it fully when they reached the end of the voyage and he presumed therefore that if he had a kitten to take care of as well as the children themselves their father whom he had no doubt was on board would remember it in his fee so when jane told him where the kitten was he said he would go and bring her out into the dining saloon and give her some of the meat there as soon as the passengers had finished their luncheon so that he could be spared from the table  accordingly when the proper time arrived the waiter went aft to the cabin and very soon returned bringing the cage with him  he seemed quite pleased with his charge and several of the passengers who met him as they were going out of the saloon stopped a moment to see what he had got in the cage and jane was much gratified at hearing one of them say  what a pretty kitten whose is it waiter  the waiter put the cage down upon a side table and then carried a plate of meat to the place and put it in the cage jane and rollo went to see while the kitten was eating her meat the waiter said that he would go and get some milk for her he accordingly went away again but he soon returned bringing a little milk with him in a saucer the kitten having by this time finished eating her meat set herself eagerly at the work of lapping up the milk which she did with an air of great satisfaction  there said the waiter bring her out here whenever she is hungry and i will always have something for her when you come at meal times you will see me at the table if you come at any other time and you dont see me ask for alfred my name is alfred  jane and rollo both said to alfred that they were very much obliged to him and then observing that nearly all the passengers had left the dining saloon and had returned to the cabin they determined to go too so they went back through the same passage way by which they had come  there were two principal cabins in the ship the ladies cabin and the gentlemens cabin the ladies cabin was nearest to the dining saloon the gentlemens cabin being beyond a number of ladies and gentlemen turned into the ladies cabin and so rollo and jane followed them they found themselves when they had entered in quite a considerable apartment with sofas and mirrors all around the sides of it and a great deal of rich carving in the panels and ceiling several splendid lamps too were suspended in different places so hung that they could move freely in every direction when the ship was rolling from side to side in rough seas rollo and jane took their seats upon one of the sofas  well rollo said jane i dont know what we are going to do next  nor i said rollo but we can sit here a little while and perhaps somebody will come and speak to us it must be right for us to sit here for other ladies and gentlemen are sitting in this cabin  jane looked about the cabin on the different sofas to see if there were any persons there that she had ever seen before but there were none  among the persons in the cabin there were two who particularly attracted janes attention they were young ladies of perhaps eighteen or twenty years of age but they were remarkably different from each other in appearance one was very beautiful indeed her hair was elegantly arranged in curls upon her neck and she was dressed quite fashionably her countenance too beamed with an expression of animation and happiness  the other young lady who sat upon the other end of the same sofa was very plain in her appearance and was plainly dressed her countenance too had a sober and thoughtful expression which was almost stern and made jane feel quite disposed to be afraid of her the beautiful girl she liked very much  while the children were sitting thus upon the sofa waiting to see what was next going to happen to them several persons passed along that way taking a greater or less degree of notice of them as they passed some merely stared at them as if wondering how they came there and what they were doing one lady looked kindly at them but did not speak another lady apparently about forty years of age walked by them with a haughty air talking all the time with a gentleman who was with her jane heard her say to the gentleman as soon as she had passed them  what a quantity of children we have on board this ship i hate children on board ship they are so noisy and troublesome  jane did not say any thing in reply to this but she thought that she and rollo at least did not deserve such censures for they had certainly not been noisy or troublesome  presently jane saw the beautiful girl who has been already spoken of rise and come toward them she was very glad to see this for now thought she we have a friend coming the young lady came walking along carelessly toward them and when she came near she looked at them a moment and then said in a pert and forward manner  what are you sitting here for children so long all alone where is your father  my father is in liverpool i suppose said rollo  well your mother then said the young lady or whoever has the care of you  my mother is in liverpool too said rollo and there is nobody who has the care of us on board this ship  why you are not going to cross the atlantic all by yourselves are you said the young lady in a tone of great astonishment  yes said rollo unless we find somebody to be kind enough to help us  la how queer said the young lady i am sure im glad enough that i am not in your places  so saying the beautiful young lady walked on  all the beauty however which she had before possessed in janes eyes was entirely dissipated by this heartless behavior both jane and rollo for all the rest of the voyage thought her one of the ugliest girls they had ever seen  it was some minutes after this before any other person approached the children jane observed however that the other young ladythe one who had appeared to her so plainlooked frequently toward her and rollo with an expression of interest and kindness upon her countenance at length she rose from her seat and came across the cabin and sat down by janes side  may i come and sit by you said she to jane you seem to be all alone  yes said jane we dont know any body in this ship  not any body said the young lady then you may know me my name is maria but your father and mother are on board the ship are they not  no said rollo there is not any body on board this ship that belongs to us  maria seemed very much astonished at hearing this and she asked the children how it happened that they were sent across the atlantic alone upon which rollo in a very clear and lucid manner explained all the circumstances of the case to her he told her about his father being sick in england and about his having sent for him and jane to go to england and meet him there he also explained what mr georges plan had been for providing them with a protector on the voyage and how it had been defeated by the accident of the loss of the trunk he also told her how narrowly they had escaped having the trunk itself left behind he ended by saying that there were several of his fathers friends on board only he did not know of any way by which he could find out who they were  never mind that said maria i will take care of you you need not be at all afraid you will get along very well have you got any state room  no said rollo  well i will go and find the chambermaid and she will get you one then we will have your trunk sent to it and you will feel quite at home there  so maria went away and presently returned with one of the chambermaids  when the chambermaid learned that there were two children on board without any one to take care of them she was very much interested in their case rollo heard her say to maria as they came up together toward the sofa where the children were sitting  o yes i will find them a state room if they have not got one already children she added when she came near are you sure you have not got any state room  yes said rollo i did not know where the captains office was  o you dont go to the captains office said the chambermaid they pay for the passage and get the tickets in wall street  perhaps this is it then said rollo and so saying he took out his wallet and there from one of the inner compartments where his uncle george had placed it away very carefully he produced a paper the chambermaid opened it saying yes this is all right berths sixteen and eighteen come with me and ill show you where they are  so the two children accompanied by maria followed the chambermaid who led the way across the cabin and there entering a passage way she opened a door by means of a beautiful porcelain knob which was upon it they all went in they found themselves in a small room no bigger than a large closet but they saw at a glance that it was very beautifully finished and furnished on the front side was a round window like those they had seen in the dining saloon under this window was a couch with a pillow at the head of it on the back side were two berths one above the other with very pretty curtains before them  there said the chambermaid sixteen that lower berth is yours  and whose is the upper berth asked maria  that is not taken i think said the chambermaid  then i will take it said maria i will come into this state room and then i can look after jennie all the time but where is rollos berth  in the next state room said the chambermaid  so saying she opened a door in the end of the room and found another state room communicating with the first where she pointed out rollos berth there was another entrance to rollos state room from the passage leading into the cabin on the farther side of it  there said the chambermaid now you can settle yourselves here as soon as you please nobody can come in here to trouble you for you have these little rooms all to yourselves ill go and find a porter and get him to look up your trunk and send it in  so rollo went into his state room and jane sat down upon the couch in hers by the side of maria looking very much pleased she opened the door of the cage and let the kitten out the kitten walked all about the room examining every thing with great attention she jumped up upon the marble washstand and from that she contrived to get into the round window where she stood for a few minutes looking out very attentively over the wide sea not knowing however what to make of so extraordinary a prospect she presently jumped down again and selecting a smooth place at the foot of the couch she curled herself up into a ring upon the soft covering of it and went to sleep     chapter v  on deck   as soon as rollo and jane found themselves thus established in their state rooms they began to examine the furniture and fixtures around them with great curiosity they were particularly interested in observing the precautions which had been taken in securing every thing which the state rooms contained from the danger of being thrown about by the motion of the ship the wash basin was made of marble and was firmly set in its place so as to be absolutely immovable there was a hole in the bottom of it with a plug in it so that by drawing out the plug the water could be let off into a pipe which conveyed it away there was a small chain attached to this plug by means of which it could be drawn up when any one wished to let the water off the pitcher was made broad and flat at the bottom and very heavy so that it could not be easily upset and then there was a socket for it in the lower part of the wash stand which confined it effectually and prevented its sliding about when the ship was rolling in a heavy sea  the tumbler was secured in a more curious manner still it was placed in a brass ring which projected from the wall in a corner over the wash stand and which was made just large enough to receive it the soap dish and the brush tray were also placed in sockets cut to receive them in the marble slab which formed the upper part of the wash stand the looking glass was round and was screwed to the wall by means of a stem and a ball or socket joint in such a manner that it could be set in any position required according to the height of the observer and yet it could not by any possibility fall from its place there were very few pegs or pins for hanging clothes upon because when clothes are thus hung they are found to swing back and forth whenever the ship is rolling in a heavy sea in a manner that is very tiresome and disagreeable for sick passengers to see nor were there many shelves about the state room for if there had been the passengers would be likely to put various articles upon them when the sea was smooth and then when the ship came to pitch and roll in gales of wind the things would all slide off upon the floor so instead of shelves there were pockets made of canvas or duck several together one above another these pockets formed very convenient receptacles for such loose articles as the passengers might have in their state rooms and were of course perfectly secure  there were two shelves it is true in jennies state roomone over each of the two wash standsbut they were protected by a ledge about the edges of them which would effectually prevent such things as might be placed upon them from sliding off  by the time that rollo and jane had examined these things a porter came into the state room bringing their trunk upon his shoulder maria told the children that they had better open the trunk and take out all that they would be likely to require while on board and then stow the trunk itself away under the lower berth in one of the state rooms  because said she as soon as we get out upon the heavy seas we shall all be sick and then we shall not wish to move to do the least thing  when will that be asked jane  i dont know replied maria sometimes we have it smooth for a good many days and then there comes a head wind and makes it rough and all the passengers get sick and very wretched  i dont think that i shall be sick said rollo  you cant tell said maria nobody can tell any thing about it beforehand  in obedience to marias directions rollo opened the trunk and took out from it all the clothing both for day and night which he thought that he and jennie would require during the voyage the night dresses he put under the pillows in the berths the cloaks and coats and shawls which might be required on deck in the day he placed on the couches those which belonged to him he put in his state room and those that belonged to jennie in hers while engaged in these operations he pulled up from one of the lower corners of his trunk a small leather purse or bag full of money  what shall i do with this he asked holding it up to maria  what is it asked maria  money said rollo  how much is there said maria  i dont know replied rollo uncle george put it in here he said i ought to have some money to carry with me in case of accidents i dont suppose it is much  you had better count it then said maria so as to ascertain how much it is you and jane may count it together  so rollo and jane sat down upon the couch and rollo poured out the money into jennies lap it was all gold maria said that the coins were sovereigns and half sovereigns the large ones were sovereigns and the small ones were half sovereigns rollo proposed that he should count the sovereigns and that jennie might count the half sovereigns it proved when the counting was completed that there were thirty sovereigns and twenty half sovereigns  that makes forty sovereigns in all said maria that is a great deal of money  how much is it asked rollo  why in american money said maria it makes about two hundred dollars  two hundred dollars repeated rollo with astonishment what could uncle george think i could want of all this money  it was in case of accidents said maria for example suppose this ship should be cast away on the coast of nova scotia and all the passengers and baggage be saved what could you do there without any money  why i should think that somebody there would take care of us replied rollo  yes said maria i suppose they would but it is a great deal better to have money of your own besides suppose that when you get to liverpool for some reason or other your father should not be there then having plenty of money you could go to a hotel and stay there till your father comes or you could ask some one of the passengers who is going to london to let you go with him and you could tell him that you had plenty of money to pay the expenses  yes said rollo though i dont think there is any doubt that my father will be in liverpool when we arrive  i hope he will be i am sure said maria but now put up the money again in the purse tie it up securely and replace it in the trunk then you must keep the trunk locked all the time and keep the key in your pocket  rollo felt quite proud of being intrusted with so much money so he replaced the bag in the trunk with great care and locked it safely  now said maria this is your home while you are on board this ship when you choose you can come here and be alone and you can lie down and rest here whenever you are tired at other times you can ramble about the ship in all proper places  how shall i know what the proper places are asked rollo  why you will see where the other passengers go replied maria and wherever you see them go you can go yourself that is as good a rule as you can have  well said rollo and now jane let us go up on deck and see what we can see  jane was pleased with this proposal so she followed rollo to the deck maria said that she would come by and by but for the present she wished to go and see her brother she said that she had a brother on board who was quite out of health he was going to europe in hopes that the voyage would restore him at present however he was very unwell and was confined to his berth and she must go and see him  so rollo and jane went to see if they could find their way up on deck alone rollo went before and jane followed they ascended the steep stairs where they had gone up at first and then walked aft upon the deck until they came to the settees where they had been sitting before the luncheon they sat down upon one of these settees where they had a fine view not only of the wide expanse of sea on every hand but also of the whole extent of the decks of the ship they remained here nearly two hours observing what was going on around them and they saw a great many things that interested them very much indeed  the first thing that attracted their attention was the sound of a bell which struck four strokes very distinctly and in a very peculiar manner near where the helmsman stood in steering the ship this bell has already been mentioned it hung directly before the helmsmans window and it had a short rope attached to the clapper of it the helmsman or the man at the wheel as he is sometimes called from the fact that he steers the ship by means of a wheel with handles all around the periphery of it had opened his window just after rollo and jane had taken their seats and had pulled this clapper so as to strike four strokes upon the bell the strokes being in pairs thus  dingding dingding  in a minute afterward rollo and jane heard the sound repeated in precisely the same manner from another bell that seemed to be far in the forward part of the ship  dingding dingding  i wonder what that means said rollo  i expect it means that it is four oclock said jane  i should not think it could be so late as four oclock said rollo  i have a great mind to go and ask the helmsman what it means he added after a moments pause  no said jane you must not go  it is difficult to say precisely why jane did not wish to have rollo go and ask the helmsman about the bell but she had an instinctive feeling that it was better not to do it so rollo sat still his attention was very soon turned away from the bell by janes calling out to him to see some sailors go up the rigging there were regular shrouds as they are called that is ladders formed of ropes which led up on each side of the masts part way to where the sailors seemed to wish to go above the top of the shrouds there were only single ropes and rollo wondered what the sailors would do when they came to these they found no difficulty however for when they reached the top of the shrouds they continued to mount by the ropes with very little apparent effort they would take hold of two of the ropes that were a little distance apart with their hands and then curling their legs round them in a peculiar manner below they would mount up very easily they thus reached the yard as it is called which is a long round beam extending along the upper edge of the sail and spreading themselves out upon it in a row they proceeded to do the work required upon the sail leaning over upon the yard above and standing upon a rope which was stretched for the purpose along the whole length of it below  i wonder if i could climb up there said rollo do you suppose they would let me try  no indeed said jane very earnestly you must not try by any means  i believe that i could climb up there said rollo that is if the vessel would stop rocking to and fro and hold still  presently however a boy who appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen years of age and who was upon another mast accomplished a feat which even rollo himself admitted that he should not dare to undertake it seemed that he had some operation to perform upon a part of the rigging down some fifteen feet from where he was so with a rope hung over his shoulder he came down hand over hand by a single rope or cable called a stay until he reached the place where the work was to be performed here he stopped and clinging to the rope that he had come down upon with his legs and one hand he contrived with the other hand to fasten one end of the short rope which he had brought with him to the stay and then carrying the other end across he fastened it to another cable which was near he then seated himself upon this cross rope as upon a seat and clinging to his place by his legs he had his hands free for his work when he had finished his work he untied the cross rope and then went up the cable hand over hand a he had come down  illustration  i am sure i could not do that said rollo and i should not think that any body but a monkey could do it or a spider  in fact the lines of rigging as seen from the place where rollo and jane were seated looked so fine and the men appeared so small that the whole spectacle naturally reminded one of a gigantic spiders web with black spiders of curious forms ascending and descending upon them so easily and adroitly did the men pass to and fro and up and down attaching new lines to new points and then running off with them as a spider would do with her thread wherever they were required but after all in respect to the power of running about among lines and rigging the spider is superior to man she can not only run up and down far more easily and readily wherever she wishes to go but she can make new attachments with a touch and make them strong enough to bear her own weight and all other strains that come upon them while the sailor as rollo and jane observed on this occasion was obliged in his fastenings to wind his ropes round and round and tie them into complicated knots and then secure the ends with spun yarn  while rollo and jane were watching the sailors they saw them unfurl one after another of the sails and spread them to the wind for the wind was now fair and it was fresh enough to assist the engines considerably in propelling the ship through the water still as the ship was going the same way with the wind the breeze was scarcely felt upon the deck the air was mild and balmy and the surface of the sea was comparatively smooth so that the voyage was beginning very prosperously rollo looked all around the horizon but he could see no land in any direction there was not even a ship in sight nothing but one wide and boundless waste of waters  i should think that there would be some other ships going to england today he said besides ours  jane did not know what to think on such a subject and so she did not reply  let us watch for whales said rollo perhaps we shall see a whale you watch the water all along on that side and i will on this side and if you see any whale spout tell me  so they both kept watch for some time but neither of them saw any spouting jane gave one alarm having seen some large blacklooking monsters rise to the surface not far from them on one side of the ship she called out eagerly to rollo to look he did so but he said that they were not whales they were porpoises he had seen porpoises often before in bays and harbors  just then the bell near the helmsmans window struck again though in a manner a little different from before for after the two pairs of strokes which had been heard before there came a single stroke making five in all thus  dingding dingding ding  immediately afterward the sound was repeated in the forward part of the ship as it had been before  dingding dingding ding  i wonder what that means said rollo  just then an officer of the ship in his walk up and down the deck passed near to where rollo was sitting and rollo instinctively determined to ask him  will you please tell me sir what that striking means  its five bells said the man and so walked on  illustration     chapter vi  a conversation   rollo at first felt quite disappointed that the officer seemed so little disposed to give him information but immediately after the officer had gone another man came by one of the passengers as rollo supposed who proved to be more communicative he wore a glazed cap and a very shaggy greatcoat he sat down by the side of jennie rollo being on the other side and said  he does not seem inclined to tell you much about the bells does he rollo  no sir replied rollo but how did you know that my name was rollo  o i heard about you down in the cabin replied the stranger and about you too jennie and your beautiful little kitten but i will explain the meaning of the bells to you i know all about them i belong on board this ship i am the surgeon  are you said rollo i did not know that there was any surgeon in the ship  yes replied the gentleman it is quite necessary to have a surgeon sometimes the seamen get hurt and require attendance and then sometimes there are cases of sickness among the passengers i have got quite a little apothecarys shop in my state room i will show it to you by and by but now about the bells  you must know continued the surgeon that people strike the time at sea in a very different manner from that which is customary on land in the first place they have a man to strike it they cannot have a clock  i do not see why not said rollo  because at sea rejoined the surgeon the time changes every day and no clock going regularly can keep it time depends upon the sun and when the ship is going east she goes to meet the sun and it becomes noon that is midday earlier when the ship is going west she goes away from the sun and then it becomes noon later thus noon has to be fixed every day anew and a clock going regularly all the time would be continually getting wrong then besides the rolling and pitching of the ship would derange the motion of the weights and pendulum of the clock in fact i dont believe that a clock could be made to go at allunless indeed it were hung on gimbals  what are gimbals asked rollo  they are a pair of rings replied the surgeon one within the other and each mounted on pivots in such a manner that any thing hung within the inner ring will swing any way freely the lamps down in the cabin are hung on gimbals  yes said rollo i saw them  then besides continued the surgeon if the men strike the bells themselves the sound coming regularly every half hour proves that they are at their posts and attending to their duties so that even if a machine could be invented to strike the time on board ship ever so truly i do not think they would like to adopt it  another difference in striking the time on board ship continued the surgeon is that they strike it by half hours instead of by hours scarcely any of the ships company have watches in fact watches are of very little use at sea the time is so continually changing from day to day the sailors therefore and nearly all on board depend wholly on the bells and it is necessary accordingly that they should be struck often every two bells therefore means an hour and a single bell at the end means half an hour now i will strike the bells for you and you may tell me what oclock it is we begin after twelve oclock  ding  half past twelve said rollo  dingding said the surgeon again imitating the sound of the bell with his voice  one oclock said rollo  dingding ding said the surgeon  half past one oclock  dingding dingding  two oclock  dingding dingding ding  half past two  dingding dingding dingding  three  dingding dingding dingding ding  half past three  dingding dingding dingding dingding  four oclock  yes said the surgeon that is eight bells and that is the end now they stop and begin again with one bell which means half past four and so they go on to eight bells again which makes it eight oclock the next eight bells is twelve oclock at night and the next is at four oclock in the morning and the next at eight oclock so that eight bells means four oclock and eight oclock and twelve oclock by day and four oclock and eight oclock and twelve oclock by night  yes said rollo now i understand it  eight bells is a very important striking continued the surgeon it is a curious fact that almost every thing important that is done at sea is done at some eight bells or other  how is that asked rollo  why in the first place replied the surgeon at eight bells in the morning the gong sounds to wake the passengers up then the watch changes too that is the set of men that have been on deck and had care of the ship and the sails since midnight go below and a new watch that is a new set of men that have been asleep since midnight take their places then the next eight bells which is twelve is luncheon time at this time too the captain finds out from the sun whereabouts we are on the ocean and also determines the ships time for the next twentyfour hours the next eight bells is at four oclock and that is dinner time the next eight bells is at eight oclock and that is tea time at all these times the watches change too and so they do at the eight bells which sound at midnight  yes said rollo now i understand it i wished to know very much what it meant and i had a great mind to go and ask the helmsman  it was well that you did not go and ask him said the surgeon  why asked rollo  because the officers and seamen on board ships replied the surgeon dont like to be troubled with questions from landsmen while they are engaged in their duties even the sensible questions of landsmen appear very foolish to seamen and then besides they commonly ask a great many that are absolutely very foolish they ask the captain when he thinks they will get to the end of the voyage or if the wind is ahead they ask him when he thinks it will change and all such foolish questions as if the captain or any body else could tell when the wind would change sailors have all sorts of queer answers to give to these questions to quiz the passengers who ask them and amuse themselves for instance if the passengers ask when any thing is going to happen the sailors say the first of the month that is a sort of proverb among them and is meant only in fun but if it happens to be near the end of the month the passenger supposing the answer is in earnest goes away quite satisfied while the sailors wink at each other and laugh  yes said rollo i heard a lady ask the captain a short time since when he thought we should get to liverpool  and what did the captain say asked the surgeon  he said replied rollo that she must go and ask boreas and neptune and some of those fellows for they could tell a great deal better than he could  the captain does not like to be asked any such questions continued the surgeon he cannot possibly know how the wind and sea are going to be during the voyage and he does not like to be teased with foolish inquiries on the subject there is no end to the foolishness of the questions which landsmen ask when they are at sea once i heard a man stop a sailor as he was going up the shrouds to inquire of him whether he thought they would see any whales on that voyage  and what did the sailor tell him asked rollo  he told him replied the surgeon that he thought there would be some in sight the next morning about sunrise so the passenger got up early the next morning and took his seat on the deck watching every where for whales while the sailors on the forecastle who had told the story to one another were all laughing at him  rollo himself laughed at this story  these questions after all are not really so foolish as they seem said the surgeon for instance if a passenger asks about seeing whales he means merely to inquire whether there are whales in that part of the ocean and whether they are usually seen from the ships that pass along and if so how frequently in ordinary cases the sight of them may be expected all this rightly understood is sensible and proper enough but sailors are not great philosophers and they generally see nothing in such inquiries but proofs of ridiculous simplicity and chances for them to make fun  you can tell just how it seems to them yourself rollo continued the surgeon by imagining that some farmers boys lived on a farm where sailors who had never been in the country before came by every day and asked an endless series of ridiculous questions for instance on seeing a sheep the sailor would ask what that was the farmers boys would tell him it was a sheep the sailor would ask what it was for the boys would say they kept sheep to shear them and get the wool then presently the sailor would see a cow and would ask if that was a kind of sheep the farmers boys would say no it was a cow then the sailor would ask if they sheared cows to get the wool no the boys would say we milk cows then presently he would see a horse and he would ask whether that was a cow or a sheep they would say it was neither it was a horse then the sailor would ask whether they kept horses to milk them or to shear them and so on forever  rollo laughed loud and long at these imaginary questionings at last he said  but i dont think we ask quite such foolish questions as these  they do not seem so foolish to you replied the surgeon but they do to the sailors the sailors you see know all the ropes and rigging of the ship and every thing seen at sea just as familiarly as boys who live in the country do sheep and cows and wagons and other such objects seen about the farm and the total ignorance in regard to them which landsmen betray whenever they begin to ask questions on board seems to the sailors extremely ridiculous and absurd so they often make fun of the passengers who ask them and put all sorts of jokes upon them for instance a passenger on board a packet ship once asked a sailor what time they would heave the log the log said the sailor they always heave the log at nine bells when you hear nine bells strike go aft and youll see them so the passenger watched and counted the bells every time they struck all the morning in the hopes to hear nine bells whereas they never strike more than eight bells it was as if a man had said on land that such or such a thing would happen at thirteen oclock  rollo and jennie laughed  so you must be careful continued the surgeon what questions you ask of the officers and seamen about the ship and you must be careful too what you believe in respect to the things they tell you perhaps it will be the truth they will tell you and perhaps they will be only making fun of you you may ask me however any thing you like i will answer you honestly i am at leisure and can tell you as well as not besides i like to talk with young persons like you i have a boy at home myself of just about your rating  where is your home asked rollo  it is up on the north river said the surgeon about one hundred miles from new york and now i must go away for it is almost eight bells and that is dinner time i shall see you again by and by theres one thing more though that i must tell you before i go and that is that you had better not go to any strange places about the ship where you do not see the other passengers go for instance you must not go up upon the paddle boxes  no said rollo i saw a sign painted saying that passengers were not allowed to go up on the paddle boxes  and you must not go forward among the sailors or climb up upon the rigging continued the surgeon  why not asked rollo  because those parts of the ship are for the seamen alone and for others like them who have duties to perform on shipboard what should you think continued the surgeon if some one who had come to make a visit at your house were to go up stairs looking about in all the chambers or down into the kitchen examining every thing there to see what he could find  i should think it was very strange said jennie  certainly said the surgeon and it is the same on board ship there are certain parts of the ship such as the cabins the state rooms and the quarter decks which are appropriated to the passengers and there are certain other parts such as the forecastle the bows and the rigging which are the domains of the seamen it is true that sometimes a passenger may go into these places without impropriety as for example when he has some business there or when he is specially invited just as there may be circumstances which would render it proper for a gentleman to go into the kitchen or into the garret at a house where he is visiting but those are exceptions to the general rules and boys especially both when visiting in houses and when they are passengers on board ships should be very careful to keep in proper places  i am glad i did not go climbing up the rigging said rollo  yes replied the surgeon once i knew a passenger go climbing up the shrouds on board an east indiaman and when he had got half way up to the main top and began to be afraid to proceed the sailors ran up after him and under pretence of helping him they tied him there hand and foot with spun yarn  ha said rollo and what did he do  he begged them to let him down but they would not they said it was customary whenever a landsman came up into the rigging for him to pay for his footing by a treat to the sailors and that they would let him down if he would give them a dollar for a treat  illustration the passenger on the rigging  and did he give it to them asked rollo  yes he said he would replied the surgeon if they would untie one of his hands so that he could get the dollar out of his pocket so they untied one of his hands and he gave them the dollar then they untied his other hand and his feet and so let him go down  why did not he call the captain asked rollo  o the captain would not have paid any attention to such a case replied the surgeon if he had been on deck at the time he would have looked the other way and would have pretended not to see what was going on but he would really have been pleased he would have considered the passenger as justly punished for climbing about where he had no business to go  rollo was greatly interested in this narrative he thought what a narrow escape he had had in deciding that he would not attempt to climb up the shrouds and he secretly determined that he would be very careful not only while he was on board the steamer but also on all other occasions not to violate the proprieties of life by obtruding himself into places where he ought not to go  the surgeon now went away leaving rollo and jane on the settee together  i wish said rollo that i had asked him what he meant by heaving the log  no said jane you must not ask any questions  yes replied rollo i may ask him questions he said that i might ask any questions that i pleased of him  well said jane then you must ask him the nest time you see him  i will said rollo and now let us go down into our state room and find maria and get ready to go to dinner  well said jane only let me go first alone i want to see if i cannot find my way to the state room alone  rollo acceded to this proposal and he accordingly remained on the settee himself while jane went down jane looked up toward him when she turned to go down the steep flight of stairs which led from the promenade deck with a smile upon her countenance which seemed to say you see i am right so far and then descending the stepsholding on carefully all the time by the green ropeshe soon disappeared from view rollo waited a proper time and then followed jane he found her safe upon the couch in her state room with maria seated by her side  in a very few minutes after rollo came into the state room eight bells struck and so they all went out to dinner at first jennie said that she did not wish to go she did not wish for any dinner in fact rollo perceived in looking at her that she was beginning to be a little pale maria told her however that she had better go and take some dinner  the rule at sea said maria always is to go to the table if you possibly can  so they all went out into the dining saloon through the long and narrow passages that have been already described they were obliged to put their hands up to the sides of the passage ways first to one side and then to the other to support themselves on account of the rolling of the ship for there now began to be considerable motion when they reached the saloon they staggered into their places and there sat rocking gently to and fro on the long swell of the sea and prepared to eat their dinner  the dinner was very much like a dinner in a fine hotel on land except that as every thing was in motion it required some care to prevent the glasses and plates from sliding about and spilling what they contained besides the ledges along the sides of the tables there were also two running up and down in the middle of it partitioning off the space where the various dishes were placed in the centre from the space along the sides where the plates and knives and forks and tumblers of the several guests were laid this arrangement served in some measure to keep every thing in its place but notwithstanding this there was a good deal of sliding and jingling among the glasses whenever an unusual sea came rolling along in one case a tumbler which the person whom it belonged to had not properly secured came sliding down toward him while his hands were busy taking care of his soup plate and when it came to the ledge which formed the edge of the table the bottom of it was stopped but the top went over and poured all the water into the gentlemans lap upon this all the passengers around the place laughed very heartily  there rollo said jane you had better be careful and not let your tumbler get upset  why it is nothing but water replied rollo it wont do any harm i would as lief have a little water spilled on me as not  i should not care about the water so much replied jennie but i would not as lief have every body laughing at me as not  this was a very important distinction and rollo concluded that it was after all better to be careful he watched the movements of the other passengers when the seas came and observed the precautions which they took to guard against such accidents and by imitating these he soon became quite adroit the dinner took a good deal of time as there were many courses all served with great regularity first there was soup then fish of various kinds then all sorts of roasted meats such as beef mutton chickens and ducks with a great variety of vegetables then came puddings pies jellies ice creams and preserves and finally a dessert of nuts raisins apples almonds and oranges in fact it was a very sumptuous dinner and what was very remarkable when at last it was ended and the party rose from the table to go back to the cabin jennie said that she had a better appetite at the end of the dinner than she had had at the beginning  illustration     chapter vii  incidents   by the time that rollo and jennie had been two days at sea they had become accustomed to their novel position and they began to feel quite at home on board the ship they formed acquaintance with several of the passengers and they went to and fro about the cabins and decks and visited their friends in their state rooms quite freely sometimes alone and sometimes together the sky was clear and the water was comparatively smooth it is true that there was a long swell upon the surface of the sea which produced a continual though gentle rocking of the ship that made many of the passengers sick and uncomfortable rollo and jane however felt for the most part quite well sometimes for a short period one or the other of them looked pale and seemed dispirited at such times they would lie down upon the couch in their state room or upon a sofa in one of the saloons and remain quietly there an hour at a time jennie usually in such cases was accustomed to lie on the couch in her state room on account of the seclusion of it while rollo on the other hand seemed to prefer the saloon he being a boy did not care so much about the seclusion on the contrary it amused him to see the people going to and fro and to watch the reflections of their forms in the mirrors about him sometimes also it would happen that there were two or more of the passengers seated near him and engaged in conversation that it entertained him to hear especially when it related as it often did to adventures and incidents that they had met with at sea on former voyages it was necessary however that persons thus conversing should be seated very near in order that rollo should hear them for the ship kept up a continual creaking in all its joints from the rolling of the sea which made it very difficult to hear what was said across the cabin  the mirrors however and the reflections in them produced the most singular illusions and were a source of continual interest to rollos mind as he lay upon the sofa surrounded by them there were so many of these mirrors that the saloon and all that pertained to it were reflected a great many times and thus produced the most wonderful effects long passages were seen running off in all directions and cabin beyond cabin in an endless perspective so bright and distinct too were the reflections that it was difficult to tell whether what you were looking at was real or only an imaged reflection of it sometimes rollo would see apparently at a great distance a man walking along among carved columns in some remote passage way and then in an instant the man would pass directly by his sofa he had been near all the time and it was only some third or fourth reflection of him that rollo had seen  on the afternoon of the second day of rollos voyage just before eight bells which would be the time for dinner as rollo was lying on a sofa in the saloon feeling very miserably and extremely disinclined to speak or to move two young men came along talking in a loud and somewhat noisy manner they stopped opposite to him and one of them began punching rollo with the curved head of his cane saying  well rollo whats the matter with you sick o get up boy and drive about dont lie moping here like a landlubber get up and go and eat some dinner it is almost eight bells  rollo wished very much that these visitors would leave him alone he made very little reply to them only saying that he did not wish for any dinner in fact he felt sure that if he were to go to the table he could not eat any thing  the men after laughing at him and punching him and teasing him a little longer went away  a few minutes after this maria and jennie came into the saloon they were ready to go to dinner and so they came into the saloon to wait there till the gong should sound when they saw rollo lying upon the sofa they went up to him but did not speak rollo opened his eyes and looked at them maria smiled but still did not speak rollo smiled in return though somewhat faintly and then shut his eyes again then maria led jennie away gently  you see said maria to jennie when they had gone out of rollos hearing he feels a little sick and when persons feel seasick they do not like to talk i am going to get him a bowl of broth  well said jennie let me go and ask him if he would like some  no said maria if you were to ask him he would say no he would think that he could not eat it and yet if i bring it to him without saying any thing about it when he tastes it perhaps he will like it in fact when people are sick it is always better not to ask them too much about what they would like it is better to consider what we think they would like and bring it to them without saying any thing about it beforehand  so saying maria rang the saloon bell the chambermaid came in answer to the summons maria then sent the chambermaid to the dining saloon to bring a bowl of chicken broth to her the chambermaid went out and presently returned bringing the broth just as the gong was sounding for dinner maria carried the broth to rollo  when she offered it to him rollo thought at first that he should not be able to take but two or three spoonfuls of it but on tasting it he found that he liked it very much he ate it all and as he lay down again upon his sofa he said that he felt a great deal better  maria then told him that he might lie still there as long as he pleased adding that she and jennie were going to dinner maria and jennie then went away leaving rollo alone again  rollo felt so much better for the broth that he had taken that pretty soon he rose from his recumbent position and began to sit up presently he said to himself how much better i do feel i believe i will go and get some dinner  so he rose from the sofa and began to stagger along toward the door of the saloon he found however that after all he felt somewhat giddy and light headed and he concluded therefore that instead of going to dinner he would go up on deck and see how the wind was he accordingly turned to the staircase which led up to the main deck and steadying himself by the hand rail as he ascended the steps he went up  at the head of the stairs was a passage way and at the end of the passage way there was a space upon the deck which was half enclosed it being shut in by an awning on the windy side and open on the other this place was often resorted to by passengers who were sick and who wished for more fresh air than they could have below there was a row of settees on one side of this space and at the time that rollo came up there there was a lady lying on one of these settees apparently in a very forlorn condition she looked very pale and her eyes were shut she was lying upon a mattress which had been put upon the settee for her and was covered up with blankets and shawls  a gentleman who seemed to be her husband was standing before her attempting to persuade her to get up he did this however as rollo thought in rather a rough and heartless manner  o get up get up said he you never will be well if you lie here come go with me and get some dinner  the lady said in a mournful tone that she could not get up and that she had no appetite for dinner  well said her husband i am going  i wish you could tell me something about hilbert said the lady i feel very anxious about him i am afraid that he will get into some trouble he is so careless  o no said her husband dont disturb yourself about him hes safe enough somewhere i dare say  so saying the gentleman went away  rollo immediately conceived the idea of performing for this lady the kind service which maria had so successfully performed for him so without speaking to her at all he went immediately down into the cabin again and thence followed the long passages which led to the dining saloon until he came to the door of it he looked in and saw that the people were all seated at the table eating their dinners he went to one of the waiters and asked him if he would bring him a bowl of chicken broth to carry to a lady who was sick  the waiter said that he would do so and immediately went to get the broth when he came back with it he said to rollo  you had better let me take it to the lady  no said rollo i can take it myself i know exactly where she is  so rollo took the bowl and began to carry it along he did this without much difficulty for it was not by any means full bowls of broth intended to be carried about ship at sea are never entirely full  when finally he came to the place where the lady was lying on the settee he stood there a moment holding the bowl in his hand without speaking as he thought the lady was asleep for her eyes were shut in a moment however she opened her eyes rollo then said to her  would not you like a bowl of broth lady i have brought some for you  the lady gazed at rollo a moment with a sort of bewildered look and then raising herself up upon the settee she took the broth and began to eat it with the spoon at first she seemed to take it cautiously and with doubt but presently finding that she liked it she took spoonful after spoonful with evident pleasure rollo was extremely delighted at the success of his experiment the lady said nothing to him all the time though she looked up at him repeatedly with a very earnest gaze while she was taking the broth at length she finished it and then gave rollo back the bowl saying as she did it  did my husband send you with that bowl of broth to me  no said rollo i brought it myself  and what put it into your head to do that added the lady  why maria brought some to me when i was sick replied rollo and it did me good and so i thought it would do you good  the lady looked at him a moment more with an earnest gaze and then lay down again and shut her eyes  presently she opened them a moment and said  do you know my son hilbert  i have seen a boy about the ship said rollo not quite so big as i am is that he  with a blue jacket said the lady  yes said rollo and a bow and arrows  thats he said the lady if you will go and find out where he is and ask him to come to me you will do me a great deal of good  rollo had seen this boy several times in different places about the ship but as he seemed to be rather rude and boisterous in his manners and very forward and free withal in his intercourse with the passengers who chanced to speak to him from time to time rollo had not felt much disposed to form an acquaintance with him the boy had a bow and arrows with which he had often amused himself in shooting about the decks he did this with so little consideration that at last one of the officers of the ship told him that he must not shoot any more in those parts of the ship where the ladies were but that he must go forward among the sailors if he wished to practise archery so the boy went forward and from that time he spent most of his time on the forward deck among the sailors and in the midst of the ropes and the rigging  rollo now went in pursuit of him and after looking for him in many places both before and aft he finally went down into the dining saloon and there he found hilbert seated at the table eating dinner with his father his bows and arrows were on the seat by his side  rollo went up to the place where hilbert was sitting and in a timid and cautious manner informed him that his mother wished to see him  my mother repeated hilbert looking up surprised  yes replied rollo she asked me to tell you but i suppose that she can wait until you have finished your dinner  o no said hilbert i cant go at all go tell her i cant come  rollo was greatly astonished at receiving such a message as this from a boy to his mother  hilbert said his father in a very stern and threatening manner go to your mother directly  no said hilbert in a sort of begging and whining tone no if i do shell make me stay there all the afternoon  no matter for that said his father go directly  hilbert did not move but went on eating his dinner  at least said his father you must go immediately when you have done your dinner  hilbert muttered something in reply but rollo did not hear what it was in fact he did not wish to hear any more of such a dialogue as this between a child and his father so he went away he was not at all inclined to go back to the lady and inform her what hilbert had said but he thought that he ought at least to go and tell her that he had found hilbert as he had been taught that it was always his duty to go back with a report when sent on a message so he went back to the lady and told her that he had found hilbert and that he was at dinner with his father  and what did he say about coming to me asked the lady  his father told him that he must come as soon as he had finished his dinner replied rollo  very well said the lady that will do  so saying she turned her head away and shut her eyes again and so rollo withdrew  it would be a very nice and delicate point to determine whether rollos answer in this case was or was not as full as strict honesty required he certainly did not state any thing that was not true nor did he in what he said convey any false impression he however withheld a very important part of what the lady must have desired to know it is undoubtedly sometimes right for us to conceal or withhold the truth sometimes indeed it is our imperious duty to do so rollos motive for doing as he did in this case was to avoid giving a sick mother pain by reporting to her the undutiful conduct of her son whether it would or would not have been better for him to have communicated the whole truth is a point which must be left for the readers of this book to discuss and settle among themselves  after dinner hilbert instead of going to his mother went up upon the deck leaving his bow and arrows however down in the cabin as rollo and jennie were at that time seated near the after part of the promenade deck he came and sat down near them rollo had a great desire to get up and go away taking jennie with him but he feared that it would be impolite for him to do so and while he was considering what he should do the surgeon came along that way and said to them  children have you seen the little bird  what bird exclaimed the children all together  why there has a bird come on board replied the surgeon he belongs in nova scotia i suppose that is the nearest land he is forward somewhere among the sailors  the children immediately hurried out to the most forward part of the promenade deck near the great smoke pipe to a place from which they could look down upon the forward deck there they saw the little bird perched upon a coil of rigging he was perfectly still some sailors were standing near looking at him the bird however appeared to take no notice of them  poor little thing said rollo i expect he is tired flying so far i wonder how far it is to nova scotia  rollo turned round as he said this to see if the surgeon was near in order to ask him how far the poor bird was from home the surgeon was not there but he saw that both jennie and hilbert had suddenly started together to go back toward the stairway as if they were going below  jennie said rollo where are you going  jennie did not answer but hurried on hilbert seemed equally eager in fact it was evident that they had both been seized with some new idea though rollo could not at first imagine what it was at length he said  ah i know they are going down where the bird is to see it nearer ill go with them  so saying rollo hurried away too  he was mistaken however in supposing that hilbert and jennie were merely going to the forward deck so as to get nearer the bird jennie was going down into the cabin to shut up her kitten the instant that she saw the bird she was reminded of tiger having sometimes seen tiger run after little birds in the yards and gardens at home they could escape from her by flying away but this poor bird seemed so tired that jennie was afraid the kitten would catch it and kill it if she came near and so she ran off very eagerly to shut the kitten up  she found the kitten asleep on a sofa in the cabin she immediately seized her waking her up very suddenly by so doing and hurried her off at once to her cage jennie put the kitten into the cage and then shut and fastened the door  there tiger said she you must stay in there there is something up stairs that you must not see  then jennie took the cage up by means of the ring which formed the handle at the top and carried it into her state room she pushed aside the curtains of the lower berth and putting the cage in she deposited it upon a small shelf in the end of the berth then drawing the curtains again very carefully she came out of the state room and shut the door  now tiger said she as she tried the door to see if it was fast you are safe and you must stay there until the little bird goes away  the kitten when she found herself thus left alone in such a seclusion stood for a moment on the floor of the cage looking toward the curtains in an attitude of great astonishment then knowing well from past experience that it was wholly useless for her to speculate on the reasons of jennies doings she lay down upon the floor of the cage curled herself into a ring and went to sleep again  illustration  as for hilbert who had set off from the smoke pipe deck at the same time with jennie and in an equally eager manner his going below had been with an entirely different intent from hers he was going to get his bow and arrows in order to shoot the little bird he found them on the seat where he had left them he seized them hastily and ran up by the forward gangway which brought him out upon the forward deck not very far from where the bird was resting upon the coil of rigging he crept softly up toward him and adjusted as he went his arrow to his bow several of the sailors were near and one of them a man whom they called hargo immediately stopped the operation that he was engaged in and demanded of hilbert what he was going to do  i am going to pop one of my arrows into that bird said hilbert  no such thing said the sailor you pop an arrow into that bird and ill pop you overboard  sailors will never allow any one to molest or harm in any way the birds that alight upon their ships at sea  overboard repeated hilbert in a tone of contempt and defiance you would not dare to do such a thing  so saying he went on adjusting his arrow and creeping up toward the bird began to take aim  hargo here made a signal to some of his comrades who in obedience to it came up near him in a careless and apparently undesigned manner hargo then by a sudden and unexpected movement pulled the bow and arrow out of hilberts hand and passed them instantly behind him to another sailor who passed them to another each standing in such a position as to conceal what they did entirely from hilberts sight the thing was done so suddenly that hilbert was entirely bewildered his bow and arrow were gone but he could not tell where each sailor the instant that he had passed the bow and arrow to the next assumed a careless air and went on with his work with a very grave and unmeaning face as if he had not been taking any notice of the transaction the last man who received the charge was very near the side of the ship and as he stood there leaning with a careless air against the bulwarks he slyly dropped the bow and arrow overboard they fell into the water just in advance of the paddle wheel as the ship was advancing through the water all this time with tremendous speed the paddle struck both the bow and the arrow the instant after they touched the water and broke them both into pieces the fragments came out behind and floated off unseen in the foam which drifted away in a long line in the wake of the steamer hilbert was perfectly confounded he knew nothing of the fate which his weapons had met with all he knew was that they had somehow or other suddenly disappeared as if by magic hargo had taken them he was sure but what he had done with them he could not imagine he was in a great rage and turning to hargo with a fierce look he demanded in a loud and furious tone  give me back my bow and arrow  i have not got your bow and arrow said hargo  so saying hargo held up both hands by way of proving the truth of his assertion  hilbert gazed at him for a moment utterly at a loss what to do or say and then he looked at the other sailors who were near first at one and then at another but he could get no clew to the mystery  you have got them hid behind you said hilbert again addressing hargo  no said he see  so saying he turned round and let hilbert see that the bow and arrow were not behind him  well you took them away from me at any rate said hilbert and saying this he turned away and walked off seemingly very angry he was going to complain to his father  he met his father coming up the cabin stairs and began as soon as he came near him to complain in very bitter and violent language of the treatment that he had received hargo had taken away his bow and arrow and would not them back to him  very well replied his father quietly you had been doing some mischief with them i suppose  no said hilbert i had not been doing any thing at all  then you were going to do some mischief with them i suppose said his father  no said hilbert i was only going to shoot a little bird  a little bird repeated his father surprised what little bird  why a little bird that came on board from nova scotia they said replied hilbert he came to rest  and you were going to shoot him said his father in a tone of surprise then after pausing a moment he added here come with me  so saying hilberts father turned and walked down the cabin stairs again he led the way to his state room which as it happened was on the opposite side of the cabin from that which jennie occupied when he reached the door of the state room he opened it and standing on one side he pointed the way to hilbert saying sternly  go in there  hilbert went in  you will stay there now said his father as long as that bird sees fit to remain on board it wont do i see for you both to be on deck together  so saying hilberts father shut the state room door and locked it and then putting the key in his pocket went away  the bird was now safe his two enemiesthe only enemies he had on board the steamerbeing shut up in their respective state rooms as prisoners one on one side of the cabin and the other on the other he did not however rest any the more quietly on this account for he had not at any time been conscious of the danger that he had been in either from the kitten or the boy he went on reposing quietly at the restingplace which he had chosen on the coil of rigging until at last when his little wings had become somewhat reinvigorated he came down from it and went hopping about the deck jennie and maria then went down below and got some bread for him this they scattered in crums before him and he came and ate it with great satisfaction in about two hours he began to fly about a little and finally he perched upon the bulwarks and looked all over the sea perceiving that he was now strong enough to undertake the passage home to his mate he flew off and ascending high into the air until he obtained sight of the coast he then set forth with great speed in that direction  it was several hundred miles to the shore and he had to rest two or three times on the way once he alighted on an english shipofwar that was going into halifax the next time upon a small fishing boat on the banks he was not molested at either of his restingplaces and so in due time he safely reached the shore and joined his mate at the nest in a little green valley in nova scotia he was very glad to get home he had not intended to have gone so far to sea he was blown off by a strong wind which came up suddenly while he was playing in the air about five miles from shore  the two prisoners were liberated from their state rooms after having been kept shut up about two hours tiger did not mind this confinement at all for her conscience being quiet she did not trouble herself about it in the least but slept nearly the whole time it was however quite a severe punishment to hilbert for his mind was all the time tormented with feelings of vexation selfreproach and shame     chapter viii  the storm   the navigation of the atlantic by means of the immense seagoing steamers of the present day with all its superiority in most respects is attended with one very serious disadvantage at least for all romantic people and those who particularly enjoy what is grand and sublime to passengers on board an atlantic steamer a storm at seathat spectacle which has in former times been so often described as the most grand and sublime of all the exhibitions which the course of nature presents to manis divested almost entirely of that imposing magnificence for which it was formerly so renowned  there are several reasons for this  first the height of the waves appears far less impressive when seen from on board an atlantic steamer than from any ordinary vessel for the deck in the case of these steamers is so high that the spectator as it were looks down upon them any one who has ever ascended a mountain knows very well what the effect is upon the apparent height of all smaller hills when they are seen from an elevation that is far higher than they in fact a country that is really quite hilly is made to appear almost level by being surveyed from any one summit that rises above the other elevations the same is the case with the waves of the sea when seen from the promenade deck of one of these vast steamers  the waves of the sea are never more than twelve or fifteen feet high although a very common notion prevails that they run very much higher it has been well ascertained that they never rise more than twelve or fifteen feet above the general level of the water and if we allow the same quantity for the depth of the trough or hollow between two waves we shall have from twentyfive to thirty feet as the utmost altitude which any swell of water can have reckoning from the most depressed portions of the surface near it now in a firstclass atlantic steamer there are two full stories so to speak above the surface of the sea and a promenade deck above the uppermost one this brings the head of the spectator when he stands upon the promenade dock and surveys the ocean around him to the height of twentyfive or thirty feet above the surface of the water the elevation at which he stands varies considerably it is true at different portions of the voyage when the ship first comes out of port she is very heavily laden as she has on board in addition to the cargo all the coal which she is to consume during the whole voyage this is an enormous quantityenough for the full lading of what used to be considered a large ship in former days this coal being gradually consumed during the voyage the steamer is lightened and thus she swims lighter and lighter as she proceeds being four or five feet higher out of the water when she reaches the end of her voyage than she was at the beginning  thus the height at which the passenger stands above the waves when walking on the promenade deck of an atlantic steamer varies somewhat during the progress of the voyage but it is always or almost always so great as to bring his head above the crests of the waves thus he looks down as it were upon the heaviest seas and this greatly diminishes their apparent magnitude and elevation on the contrary to one going to sea in vessels as small as those with which columbus made the voyage when he discovered america the loftiest billows would rise and swell and toss their foaming crests far above his head as he clung to the deck to gaze at them they would seem at times ready to overwhelm him with the vast and towering volumes of water which they raised around him then when the shock which was produced by the encounter of one of them was passed and the ship trembling from the concussion rose buoyantly over the swell being small in comparison with the volume of the wave she was lifted so high that she seemed to hang trembling upon the brink of it ready to plunge to certain destruction into the yawning gulf which opened below  all this is however now changed the mighty steamer twice as long and nearly four times as massive as the ship surpasses the seas now as it were in magnitude and momentum as well as in power she not only triumphs over them in the contest of strength but she towers above and overtops them in position the billow can now no longer toss her up so lightly to the summit of its crest nor when the crest of it is passed will she sink her so fearfully into the hollow of the sea the spectator raised above all apparent danger and moving forward through the scene of wild commotion with a power greater far than that which the foaming surges can exert surveys the scene around him with wonder and admiration it is true but without that overpowering sensation of awe which it could once inspire  then there is another thing a sailing vessel which is always in a great measure dependent upon the wind is absolutely at its mercy in a storm when the gale increases beyond a certain limit she can no longer make head at all against its fury but must turn and flyor be drivenwherever the fury of the tempest may impel her in such cases she goes bounding over the seas away from her course toward rocks shoals breakers or any other dangers whatever which may lie in the way without the least power or possibility of resistance she goes howling on in such a case over the wide waste of waters before her wholly unable to escape from the dreadful fury of the master who is driving her and with no hope of being released from his hand until he chooses of his own accord to abate his rage  all this too is now changed this terrible master has now found his master in the seagoing steamer she turns not aside to the right hand or to the left for all his power boreas may send his gales from what quarter he pleases and urge them with whatever violence he likes to display the steamer goes steadily on pointing her unswerving prow directly toward her port of destination and triumphing easily and apparently without effort over all the fury of the wind and the shocks and concussions of the waves the worst that the storm can do is to retard in some degree the swiftness of her motion instead of driving her as it would have done a sailing vessel two or three hundred miles out of her course away over the sea it can only reduce her speed in her own proper and determined direction to eight miles an hour instead of twelve  now this makes a great difference in the effect produced upon the mind by witnessing a storm at sea if the passenger as he surveys the scene feels that his ship and all that it contains has been seized by the terrific power which he sees raging around him and that they are all entirely at its mercythat it is sweeping them away over the sea perhaps into the jaws of destruction without any possible power on their part of resistance or escapehis mind is filled with the most grand and solemn emotions such a flight as this extending day after day perhaps for five hundred miles over a raging sea is really sublime  the atlantic steamer never flies she never yields in any way to the fury of the gale unless she gets disabled while her machinery stands she moves steadily forward in her course and so far as any idea of danger is concerned the passengers in their cabins and state rooms below pay no more regard to the storm than a farmers family do to the whistling and howling of the wind among the chimneys of their house in a blustering night on land  so much for the philosophy of a storm at sea as witnessed by the passengers on board an atlantic steamer                                       one night when the steamer had been some time at sea rollo awoke and found himself more than usually unsteady in his berth sometimes he slept upon his couch and sometimes in his berth this night he was in his berth and he found himself rolling from side to side in it very uneasily the croaking of the ship too seemed to be much more violent and incessant than it had been before rollo turned over upon his other side and drew up his knees in such a manner as to prevent himself from rolling about quite so much and then went to sleep again  his sleep however was very much broken and disturbed and he was at last suddenly awakened by a violent lurch of the ship which rolled him over hard against the outer edge of his berth and then back against the inner edge of it again there was a sort of cord with large knobs upon it at different distances which was hung like a bell cord from the back side of the berth rollo had observed this cord before but he did not know what it was for he now however discovered what it was for as by grasping these knobs in his hands he found that the cord was an excellent thing for him to hold on by in a heavy sea by means of this support he found that he could moor himself as it were quite well and keep himself steady when a heavy swell came  he was not long however at rest for he found that his endeavors to go to sleep were disturbed by a little door that kept swinging to and fro in his state room as the ship rolled this was the door of a little cupboard under the wash stand when the door swung open it would strike against a board which formed the front side of the couch that has already been described then when the ship rolled the other way it would come to and strike again upon its frame and sill rollo endured this noise as long as he could and then he resolved to get up and shut the door so he put his feet out of his berth upon the floorwhich he could easily do as the berth that he was in was the lower oneand sat there watching for a moment when the ship should be tolerably still when the right moment came he ran across to the little door shut it and crowded it hard into its place then darted back to his berth again getting there just in time to save a tremendous lurch of the ship which would have perhaps pitched him across the state room if it had caught him when he was in the middle of the floor  rollo did not have time to fasten the little door with its lock and this seemed in fact unnecessary for it shut so hard and tight into its place that he was quite confident that the friction would hold it and that it would not come open again to his great surprise therefore a few minutes afterwards he heard a thumping sound and on turning over to see what the cause of it was he found that the little door was loose again and was swinging backward and forward as before the fact was that although the door had shut in tight at the moment when rollo had closed it the space into which it had been fitted had been opened wider by the springing of the timbers and framework of the ship at the next roll and thus set the door free again so rollo had to get up once more and this time he locked the door when he had shut it and so made it secure  still however he could not sleep as soon as he began in the least degree to lose consciousness so as to relax his hold upon the knobs of his cord some heavy lurch of the sea would come and roll him violently from side to side and thus wake him up again he tried to brace himself up with pillows but he had not pillows enough he climbed up to the upper berth and brought down the bolster and pillow that belonged there and thus he packed and wedged himself in but the incessant rolling and pitching of the ship kept every thing in such a state of motion that the pillows soon worked loose again  after making several ineffectual attempts to secure for himself a quiet and fixed position in his berth rollo finally concluded to shift his quarters to the other side of the state room and try the couch the couch had a sort of side board which passed along the front side of it and which was higher somewhat than the one forming the front of the berth this board was made movable so that it could be shifted from the front to the back side and vice versa at pleasure by putting this side board back the place became a sort of sofa or couch and it was usually in this state during the day but by bringing it forward which was done at night it became a berth and one somewhat larger and more comfortable than the permanent berths on the other side  so rollo began to make preparations for a removal he threw the bolster and pillows across first and then getting out of the berth and holding firmly to the edge of it he waited for a moments pause in the motion of the ship and then when he thought that the right time had come he ran across it happened however that he made a miscalculation as to the time for the ship was then just beginning to careen violently in the direction in which he was going and thus he was pitched head foremost over into the couch where he floundered about several minutes among the pillows and bolsters before he could recover the command of himself  at last he lay down and attempted to compose himself to sleep but he soon experienced a new trouble it happened that there were some cloaks and coats hanging up upon a brass hook above him and as the ship rolled from side to side the lower ends of them were continually swinging to and fro directly over rollos face he tried for a time to get out of the way of them by moving his head one way and the other but they seemed to follow him wherever he went and so he was obliged at last to climb up and take them all off the hook and throw them away into a corner then he lay down again thinking that he should now be able to rest in peace  at length when he became finally settled and began to think at last that perhaps he should be able to go to sleep he thought that he heard something rolling about in jennies state room and also at intervals a mewing sound he listened the door between the two state rooms was always put open a little way every night and secured so by the chambermaid so that either of the children might call to the other if any thing were wanted it was thus that rollo heard the sound that came from jennies room after listening a moment he heard jennies voice calling to him  rollo said she are you awake  yes said rollo  then i wish you would come and help my kitten here she is shut up in her cage and rolling in it all about the room  it was even so jennie had put tiger into the cage at night when she went to bed as she was accustomed to do and then had set the cage in the corner of the state room the violent motion of the ship had upset the cage and it was now rolling about from one side of the state room to the otherthe poor kitten mewing piteously all the time and wondering what could be the cause of the astonishing gyrations that she was undergoing maria was asleep all the time and heard nothing of it all  rollo said he would get up and help the kitten so he disengaged himself from the wedgings of pillows and bolsters in which he had been packed and clinging all the time to something for support he made his way into jennies state room there was a dim light shining there which came through a pane of glass on one side of the state room near the door this light was not sufficient to enable rollo to see any thing very distinctly he however at length succeeded by holding to the side of jennies berth with one hand while he groped about the floor with the other in finding the cage and securing it  ive got it said rollo holding it up to the light it is the cage and tiger is in it poor thing she looks frightened half to death would you let her out  o no said jennie shell only be rolled about the rooms herself  why she could hold on with her claws i should think said rollo  no said jennie keep her in the cage and put the cage in some safe place where it cant get away  so rollo put the kitten into the cage and then put the cage itself in a narrow space between the foot of the couch and the end of the state room where he wedged it in safely with a carpet bag having done this he was just about returning to his place when he was dreadfully alarmed at the sound of a terrible concussion upon the side of the ship succeeded by a noise as of something breaking open in his state room and a rush of water which seemed to come pouring in there like a torrent and falling on the floor rollos first thought was that the ship had sprung a leak and that she was filling with water and would sink immediately jennie too was exceedingly alarmed while maria who had been sound asleep all this time started up suddenly in great terror calling out  mercy on me whats that  im sure i dont know said rollo unless the ship is sinking  maria put out her hand and rung the bell violently in the mean time the noise that had so alarmed the children ceased and nothing was heard in rollos room but a sort of washing sound as of water dashed to and fro on the floor of course the excessive fears which the children had felt at first were in a great measure allayed  in a moment the chambermaid came in with a light in her hand and asked what was the matter  i dont know said maria something or other has happened in rollos state room please look in and see  the chambermaid went in and exclaimed as she entered  what a goose  whos a goose said rollo following her  i am said the chambermaid for forgetting to screw up your light but go back youll get wet if you come here  rollo accordingly kept back in jennies state room though he advanced as near to the door as he could and looked in to see what had happened he found that his little round window had been burst open by a heavy sea and that a great quantity of water had rushed in his couch which was directly under the window was completely drenched and so was the floor though most of the water except that which was retained by the bedding and the carpet had run off through some unseen opening below when rollo got where he could see the chambermaid was busy screwing up his window tight into its place it has already been explained that this window was formed of one small and very thick pane of glass of an oval form and set in an iron frame which was attached by a hinge on one side and made to be secured when it was shut by a strong screw and clamp on the other  there said the chambermaid it is safe now only you cant sleep upon the couch any more it is so wet you must get into your berth again i will make you up a new bed on the couch in the morning  rollo accordingly clambered up into his berth again and the chambermaid left him to himself presently however she came back with a dry pillow and bolster for him  what makes the ship pitch and toss about so said rollo  head wind and a heavy sea said the chambermaid thats all  the chambermaid then bidding rollo go to sleep passed on into jennies state room on her way to her own place of repose as she went by maria asked if there was not a storm coming on  yes said the chambermaid a terrible storm  how long will it be before morning asked jennie  o it is not two bells yet said the chambermaid and you had better not get up when the morning comes youll only be knocking about the cabins if you do ill bring you some breakfast when it is time  so saying the chambermaid went away and left the children and maria to themselves  rollo tried for a long time after this to get to sleep but all was in vain he heard two bells strike and then three and then four he turned over first one way and then the other his head aching and his limbs cramped and benumbed from the confined and uncomfortable positions in which he was obliged to keep them in fact when jennie on one occasion just after four bells struck being very restless and wakeful herself ventured to speak to him in a gentle tone and ask him whether he was asleep he replied that he was not that he had been trying very hard but he could not get any thing of him asleep except his legs  at length the gray light of the morning began to shine in at his little round window this he was very glad to see although it did not promise any decided relief to his misery for the storm still continued with unabated violence at length when breakfast time came the chambermaid brought in some tea and toast for maria and for both the children they took it and felt much better for itso much so that rollo said he meant to get up and go and see the storm  well said the chambermaid you may go if you must dress yourself and go on the next deck above this and walk along the passage way that leads aft and there youll find a door that you can open and look out youll be safe there  which way is aft asked rollo  that way replied the chambermaid pointing  so rollo got up and holding firmly to the side of his berth with one hand and bracing himself between his berth and the side of his wash stand cupboard with his knees as the ship lurched to and fro he contrived to dress himself though he was a long time in accomplishing the feat he then told jennie that he was going up stairs to look out at some window or door in order to see the storm jennie did not make much reply and so rollo went away  the ship rolled and pitched so violently that he could not stand alone for an instant if he attempted to do so he would be thrown against one side or the other of the cabin or passage way by the most sudden and unaccountable impulses he finally succeeded in getting up upon the main deck where he went into the enclosed space which has already been described this space was closely shut up now on all sides there were however two doors which led from it out upon the deck in order to go up upon the promenade deck it was necessary to go out at one of these doors and then ascend the promenade deck stairway rollo had however no intention of doing this though he thought that perhaps he might open one of the doors a little and look out  while he was thinking of this he heard steps behind him as of some one coming up stairs and then a voice saying  halloo rollo are you up here  rollo turned round and saw hilbert he was clinging to the side of the doorway rollo himself was upon one of the settees  just then one of the outer doors opened and a man came in he was an officer of the ship a terrible gust of wind came in with him the officer closed the door again immediately and seeing the boys he said to them  well boys you are pretty good sailors to be about the ship such weather as this  im going up on the promenade deck said hilbert  no said the officer you had better do no such thing you will get pitched into the lee scuppers before you know where you are  is there any place where we can look out and see the sea said rollo  yes replied the officer go aft there along that passage way and you will find a door on the lee quarter where you can look out  so saying the officer went away down into the cabin  hilbert did not know what was meant by getting pitched into the lee scuppers and rollo did not know what the lee quarter could be he however determined to go in the direction that the man had indicated and see if he could find the door  as for hilbert he said to rollo that he was not afraid of the lee scuppers or any other scuppers and he was going up on the promenade deck there was an iron railing he said that he could cling to all the way  rollo in the mean time went along the passage way bracing his arms against the sides of it as he advanced the ship was rolling over from side to side so excessively that he was borne with his whole weight first against one side of the passage way and then against the other so heavily that he was every moment obliged to stop and wait until the ship came up again before he could go on at length he came into a small room with several doors opening from it in the back side of this room was the compartment where the helmsman stood with his wheel there were several men in this place with the helmsman helping him to control the wheel rollo observed too that there were a number of large rockets put away in a sort of frame in the coil overhead  he went to one of the doors that was on the righthand side of this room and opened it a little way but the wind and rain came in so violently that he thought he would go to the opposite side and try that door this idea proved a very fortunate one for being now on the sheltered side of the ship he could open the door and look out without exposing himself to the fury of the storm he gazed for a time at the raging fury of the sea with a sentiment of profound admiration and awe the surface of the ocean was covered with foam and the waves were tossing themselves up in prodigious heaps the crests as fast as they were formed being seized and hurled away by the wind in a mass of driving spray which went scudding over the water like drifting snow in a wintry storm on land  after rollo had looked upon this scene until he was satisfied he shut the door and returned along the passage way intending to go down and give jennie an account of his adventures as he advanced toward the little compartment where the landing was from the stairs he heard a sound as of some one in distress and on drawing near he found hilbert coming in perfectly drenched with sea water he was moaning and crying bitterly and as he staggered along the water dripped from his clothes in streams rollo asked him what was the matter but he could get no answer hilbert pressed on sullenly crying and groaning as he went down to find his father  illustration  the matter was that in attempting to go up on the promenade deck he had unfortunately taken the stairway on the weather side and when he had got half way up a terrible sea struck the ship just forward of the paddle box a portion of the wave and an immense mass of spray dashed up on board the ship and a quantity equal to several barrels of water came down upon the stairs where hilbert was ascending the poor fellow was almost strangled by the shock he however clung manfully to the rope railing and as soon as he recovered his breath he came back into the cabin     chapter ix  the passengers lottery   one morning a few days after the storm described in the last chapter rollo was sitting upon one of the settees that stood around the skylight on the promenade deck secured to their places by lashings of spun yarn as has already been described and was there listening to a conversation which was going on between two gentlemen that were seated on the next settee the morning was very pleasant the sun was shining the air was soft and balmy and the surface of the water was smooth there was so little wind that the sails were all furledfor in the case of a steamer at sea the wind even if it is fair cannot help to impel the ship at all unless it moves faster than the rate which the paddle wheels would of themselves carry her and if it moves slower than this of course the steamer would by her own progress outstrip it and the sails if they were spread would only be pressed back against the masts by the onward progress of the vessel and thus her motion would only be retarded by them  the steamer on the day of which we are speaking was going on very smoothly and rapidly by the power of her engines alone and all the passengers were in excellent spirits there was quite a company of them assembled at a place near one of the paddle boxes where smoking was allowed some were seated upon a settee that was placed there against the side of the paddle box and others were standing around them they were nearly all smoking and as they smoked they were talking and laughing very merrily hilbert was among them and he seemed to be listening very eagerly to what they were saying rollo was very strongly inclined to go out there too to hear what the men were talking about but he was so much interested in what the gentlemen were saying who were near him that he concluded to wait till they had finished their conversation and then go  the gentlemen who were near him were talking about the rocketsthe same rockets that rollo had seen when he went back to the stern of the ship to look out at the sea on the day of the storm one of the men who had often been at sea before and who seemed to be well acquainted with all nautical affairs said that the rockets were used to throw lines from one ship to another or from a ship to the shore in case of wrecks or storms he said that sometimes at sea a steamer came across a wrecked vessel or one that was disabled while yet there were some seamen or passengers still alive on board these men would generally be seen clinging to the decks or lashed to the rigging in such cases the sea was often in so frightful a commotion that no boat could live in it and there was consequently no way to get the unfortunate mariners off their vessel but by throwing a line across and then drawing them over in some way or other along the line he said that the sailors had a way of making a sort of sling by which a man could be suspended under such a line with loops or rings made of rope and so adjusted that they would run along upon it and that by this means men could be drawn across from one ship to another at sea if there was only a line stretched across for the rings to run upon  now the rockets were used for the purpose of throwing such a line a small light line was attached to the stick of the rocket and then the rocket itself was fired being pointed in such a manner as to go directly over the wrecked ship if it was aimed correctly it would fall down so as to carry the small line across the ship then the sailors on board the wrecked vessel would seize it and by means of it would draw the end of a strong line over and thus effect the means of making their escape it was however a very dreadful alternative after all for the rope forming this fearful bridge would of course be subject all the time to the most violent jerkings from the rolling and pitching of the vessels to which the two extremities of it were attached and the unhappy men who had to be drawn over by means of it would be perhaps repeatedly struck and overwhelmed by the foaming surges on the way  while rollo was listening to this conversation hilberts father and another gentleman who had been walking with him up and down the deck came and sat down on one of the settees very soon hilbert seeing his father sitting there came eagerly to him and said holding out his hand  father i want you to give me half a sovereign  half a sovereign repeated his father what do you want of half a sovereign  a sovereign is the common gold coin of england the value of it is a pound or nearly five dollars and half a sovereign is of course in value about equal to two dollars and a half of american money  i want to get a ticket said hilbert come father make haste he added with many impatient looks and gestures and still holding out his hand  a ticket what ticket asked his father as he asked these questions he put his hand in his pocket and drew out an elegant little purse  why they are going to have a lottery about the ships run today replied hilbert and i want a ticket the tickets are half a sovereign apiece and the one who gets the right one will have all the half sovereigns there will be twenty of them and that will make ten pounds  nearly fifty dollars said his father and what can you do with all that money if you get it o no hibby i cant let you have any money for that and besides these lotteries and the betting about the run of the ship are as bad as gambling they are gambling in fact  why father said hilbert you bet very often  mr livingston for that was his fathers name and his companion the gentleman who was sitting with him laughed at hearing this and the gentleman said  ah george he has you there  even hilbert looked pleased at the effect which his rejoinder had produced in fact he considered his half sovereign as already gained  o let him have the half sovereign continued the gentleman hell find some way to spend the ten pounds if he gets them ill guaranty  so mr livingston gave hilbert the half sovereign and he receiving it with great delight ran away  the plan of the lottery which the men at the paddle box were arranging was this in order however that the reader may understand it perfectly it is necessary to make a little preliminary explanation in respect to the mode of keeping what is called the reckoning of ships and steamers at sea when a vessel leaves the shore at new york and loses sight of the highlands of neversink which is the land that remains longest in view the mariners that guide her have then more than two thousand miles to go across a stormy and trackless ocean with nothing whatever but the sun and stars and their own calculations of their motion to guide them now unless at the end of the voyage they should come out precisely right at the lighthouse or at the harbor which they aim at they might get into great difficulty or danger they might run upon rocks where they expected a port or come upon some strange and unknown land and be entirely unable to determine which way to turn in order to find their destined haven  the navigators could however manage this all very well provided they could be sure of seeing the sun every day at proper times particularly at noon the sun passes through different portions of the sky every different day of the year rising to a higher point at noon in the summer and to a lower one in the winter the place of the sun too in the sky is different according as the observer is more to the northward or southward for inasmuch as the sun to the inhabitants of northern latitudes always passes through the southern part of the sky if one person stands at a place one hundred or five hundred miles to the southward of another the sun will of course appear to be much higher over his head to the former than to the latter the farther north therefore a ship is at sea the lower in the sky that is the farther down toward the south the sun will be at noon  navigators then at sea always go out upon the deck at noon if the sun is out with a very curious and complicated instrument called a sextant in their hands and with this instrument they measure exactly the distance from the sun at noon down to the southern horizon this is called making an observation when the observation is made the captain takes the number of degrees and minutes and goes into his state room and there by the help of certain tables contained in books which he always keeps there for the purpose he makes a calculation and finds out the exact latitude of the ship that is where she is in respect to north and south there are other observations and calculations by which he determines the longitude that is where the ship is in respect to east and west when both these are determined he can find the precise place on the chart where the vessel is and soinasmuch as he had ascertained by the same means where she was the day beforehe can easily calculate how far she has come during the twentyfour hours between one noon and another these calculations are always made at noon because that is the time for making the observations on the sun it takes about an hour to make the calculations the passengers on board the ship during this interval are generally full of interest and curiosity to know the result they come out from their lunch at half past twelve and then they wait the remaining half hour with great impatience they are eager to know how far they have advanced on their voyage since noon of the day before  in order to let the passengers know the result when it is determined the captain puts up a written notice thus  latitude 44° 26 longitude 16° 31 distance 270  the passengers on seeing this notice which is called a bulletin know at once from the first two items whereabouts on the ocean they are and from the last they learn that the distance which the ship has come since the day before is 270 miles  this plan of finding out the ships place every day and of ascertaining the distance which she has sailed since the day before would be perfectly successful and amply sufficient for all the purposes required if the sun could always be seen when the hour arrived for making the observation but this is not the fact the sky is often obscured by clouds for many days in succession and in fact it sometimes happens that the captain has scarcely an opportunity to get a good observation during the whole voyage there is therefore another way by which the navigator can determine where the ship is and how fast she gets along on her voyage  this second method consists of actually measuring the progress of the ship through the water by an instrument called the log and line the logwhich however is not any log at all but only a small piece of board loaded at one edge so as to float upright in the waterhas a long line attached to it which line is wound upon a light windlass called a reel the line except a small portion of it at the beginning is marked off into lengths by small knots made in it at regular intervals there are little rags of different forms and colors tied into these knots so that they may easily be seen and may also be distinguished one from the other  when the time comes for performing the operation of heaving the log as they call it the men appointed for the purpose bring the log and the reel to the stern of the ship one man holds the log and another man the reel there are two handles one at each end of the reel by which the man who serves it can hold it up over his head and let the line run off from it besides the two men who hold the log and the reel there is a third who has a minute glass in his hand the minute glass is like an hour glass only there is but just sand enough in it to run a minute the man who has the minute glass holds it upon its side at first so as not to set the sand to running until all is ready  illustration heaving the log  at length the man who holds the log throws it over into the water and the ship sailing onward all the time leaves it there floating edge upwards the man who holds the reel lifts it up high so that the line can run off easily as the ship moves on as soon as the first rag runs off which denotes the beginning of the marked point of the line he calls out suddenly  turn  this is the command to the man who holds the minute glass to turn it so as to set the sand to running he accordingly instantly changes the position of the glass and holds it perpendicularly and immediately sets himself to watching the running out of the sand the instant it is gone he calls out  stop  the man who is holding the reel and another who stands by ready to help him instantly stop the line and begin to draw it in they observe how many knots have run out and they know from this how many miles an hour the ship is going each knot goes for a mile  they do not have to count the knots that have run out they can always determine by the form and color of the last one that passed what knot it is one of the men goes immediately and reports to the captain that the ship is going so many knots and the captain makes a record of it the other men at once begin to draw in the line which brings the log in also at the end of it this line comes in very hard for the friction of so long a cord dragged so swiftly through the water is very great it generally takes four or five men to pull the line in these men walk along the deck one behind the other with the line over their shoulders and at first they have to tug very hard the reel man winds the line upon the reel as fast as they draw it in it comes in more and more easily as the part that is in the water grows shorter and at length the log itself is soon skipping through the foam in the wake of the ship until it comes up out of the water and is taken on board  they heave the log every two hoursthat is twelve times for every twentyfour hoursand from the reports which the captain receives of the results of those trials it is easy for him to calculate how far the ship has come during the whole period as he knows too exactly how far the pilot has been steering by the compass all this time he has both the direction in which the ship has been sailing and the distance to which she has come and of course from these data he can calculate where she must now be this mode of determining the ships place is called by the reckoning the other is called by observation  the intelligent and reflecting boy who has carefully read and understood the preceding explanations will perceive that the two operations which we have been describing are in some sense the reverse of each other by the former the navigator ascertains by his measurements where the ship actually is today and then calculates from that how far and in what direction she has come since yesterday whereas by the latter method his measurements determine directly how far and in what direction the ship has come and then he calculates from these where she now is each method has its advantages the former that by observation is the most sure and exact but then it is not always practicable for it may be cloudy on the other hand the latterthat is by the reckoningnever fails for the log can always be thrown be the weather what it may but it cannot be fully relied upon on account of the currents in the water and the drifting of the vessel consequently on board all ships they keep the reckoning regularly every day then if they get a good observation they rely upon that if they do not they go by the reckoning  we now return to the story and here i suppose is the place where those sagacious children who when they are reading a book in which entertainment and instruction are combined always skip all the instruction and read only the story will begin to read again after having turned over the leaves of this chapter thus far seeing they contain only explanations of the mode of navigating a ship and saying nothing about hilbert and rollo now before going any farther i wish to warn all such readers that they will not be able to comprehend at all clearly the complicated difficulties which hilbert and the others got into in respect to the lottery without understanding all that has been explained in the preceding pages of this chapter i advise them therefore if they have skipped any of it to go back and read it all and to read it slowly too and with the utmost attention and i advise them moreover if they do not perfectly understand it all to ask some older person to read it over with them and explain it to them if they are not willing to do this but insist on skipping the first part of the chapter i advise them to make complete work of it and skip the last half too for they certainly will not understand it  when hilbert went back to the paddle box with his half sovereign it was about eleven oclock the observation was to be made at twelve and the results both in respect to the observation and the reckoning were to be calculated immediately afterward the lottery which the men were making related to the number of miles which the ship would have made during the twentyfour hours the men were just making up the list of subscribers to the tickets when hilbert went up to them he gave his half sovereign to the man who had the list this man whom they called the colonel took the money saying thats right my lad and put it in a little leather purse with the other half sovereigns  whats your name bob said he  livingston said hilbert  bobby livingston said the colonel writing down the name on his list  no said hilbert contemptuously not bobby livingston hilbert livingston  o never mind said the colonel its all the same thing bobby means boy  the plan of the lottery was this it was generally supposed that the ships run would be about 270 miles and it was considered quite certain as has already been stated that it would not be more than 280 nor less than 260 so they made twenty tickets by cutting five of the colonels visiting cards into quarters which tickets were to represent all the numbers from 261 to 280 inclusive they wrote the numbers upon these cards omitting however the first figure namely the 2 in order to save time for as that figure came in all the numbers it was considered unnecessary to write it when the numbers were written thus upon the cards the cards themselves were all put into a capb and shaken up and then every one who had paid a half sovereign drew out one the colonel holding the hat up high all the time so that no one could see which number he drew this operation was performed in the midst of jokes and gibes and loud shouts of laughter which made the whole scene a very merry one when hilbert came to draw the merriment was redoubled some called on the colonel to hold down the cap lower so that bob could reach it others said that he was sure to get the lucky number and that there was no chance at all for the rest of them others still were asking him what he would take for his ticket or for half of it quarter of it and so on hilbert was half pleased and half ashamed at being the object of so much coarse notoriety while rollo who had drawn up toward the place and was looking on from a safe distance as the proceedings that were going on was very glad that he was not in hilberts place  footnote b gentlemen always wear caps on board ship hats are in the way and would moreover be in danger of being blown off by the wind in which case as they would go overboard at once there would be no possibility of recovering them  the ticket that hilbert drew was marked 67 it denoted of course the number 267 and that being pretty near to the number of miles which it was thought the ship would probably make was considered quite a valuable ticket the owners of the several tickets as soon as the drawing was completed began to compare them and talk about them and to propose bargains to one another for buying and selling them or exchanging them in these negotiations each man was endeavoring to outwit and circumvent his friend in hopes of buying his ticket for a moderate sum and drawing the whole prize with it others were engaged in betting on particular tickets these bets when they were made they recorded in little memorandum books kept for the purpose in fact a very noisy and tumultuous scene of bargaining and betting and barter ensued  hilbert was very much pleased with his ticket he went to show it to rollo he said he verily believed that he had got the exact ticket to draw the prize he did not think the ship would go quite 270 miles  and if she does not said he and should happen to go only 267 miles then i shall have ten pounds and that is almost fifty dollars  so saying hilbert began to caper about the deck in the exuberance of his joy  his antics were however suddenly interrupted by the colonel who just then came up to him and asked to see his ticket hilbert held it up so that the colonel could see the number upon it  sixtyseven said the colonel that is not worth much nobody thinks shell go less than 270 however he added in a careless tone ill give you twelve shillings for it that is two shillings over what you paid for itnearly half a dollarc youd better make sure of half a dollar than run the risk of losing every thing on such a poor ticket as that  footnote c the colonel meant english shillings which are twentyfour cents each in value  would you said hilbert turning to rollo  i dont know replied rollo shaking his head i dont know any thing about it  no said hilbert turning to the colonel again i believe i will keep my ticket and take my chance  the colonel said very well just as you please and then went away hilbert had after this several other offers all which he declined and in about a quarter of an hour the colonel met him again as if accidentally and began to talk about his ticket he said that all the tickets under 270 were selling at a low price as almost every body believed that the ships run would be more than that but still he said he would give a pound for hilberts ticket if he wished to sell it thus said he youll get back the half sovereign you paid and another half sovereign besides and make sure of it  but the more the people seemed to wish to buy hilberts ticket the less inclined he was to part with it so he refused the colonels offer and put the card safely away in his wallet in one sense he was right in refusing to sell his chance for as the whole business of making such a lottery and buying and selling the tickets afterward and betting on the result is wrong the less one does about it the better every new transaction arising of it is a new sin it could easily be shown by reasoning on the philosophy of the thing why it is wrong if there were time and space for it here but this is not necessary as every man has a feeling in his own conscience that there is a wrong in such transactions it is only bad characters in general that seek such amusements when others adventure in them a little they make apologies for it they say they are not in the habit of betting or of venturing in lotteries or that they dont approve of itbut will do it this once then when people lose their money the chagrin which they feel is always deepened and imbittered by remorse and selfcondemnation while the pleasure which those feel who gain is greatly marred by a sort of guilty feeling which they cannot shake off at having taken the money of their friends and companions by such means all these indications and many others which might be pointed out show that there is a deepseated and permanent instinct in the human heart which condemns such things and nobody can engage in them without doing violence to this instinct and thus committing a known wrong  in regard to most of the men who were engaged in the lottery they had so often done such things before that their consciences had become pretty well seared and hardened there was one man however who decided to take a ticket against considerable opposition that was made to it by the moral sentiments of his heart this was marias brother he had been confined to his berth most of the voyage but was now better and he had been walking up and down the deck with a friend he looked pale and dejected however and seemed still quite feeble  his friend whom he called charles seeing that they were going on with a lottery near the paddle boxes proposed that they should both go and buy tickets  come said he chauncy that will amuse you  o no said mr chauncy  yes come said charles besides we ought to do our part to assist in entertaining one another  so saying charles led mr chauncy along and partly by persuasion and partly by a little gentle force he made him take out his purse and produce a half sovereign too he also subscribed himself and then drew both the tickets he gave one of them to mr chauncy and the other he kept himself and then the two friends walked away mr chauncys ticket was 66 the number immediately below that which hilbert had drawn  mr chauncy being now tired of walking went to sit down upon one of the settees next to where hilbert and rollo had just gone to take a seat mr chauncy was next to hilbert he immediately began to talk with hilbert about the lottery  have you got a ticket in this lottery he asked  yes said hilbert mine is 267 what is yours  i dont know said mr chauncy i did not observe as he said this however he took his ticket out of his pocket and said reading it ninetynine  he was holding it wrong side upward and so it read 99  ho said hilbert that will not get the prize we shall not go 299 miles i would not exchange mine for yours on any account  no said mr chauncy nor would i exchange mine for yours  why said hilbert do you think there is any chance of the ships making 299  no replied mr chauncy and that is the very reason i like my ticket if i had yours i should be afraid i might get the prize  afraid repeated hilbert  yes said mr chauncy  why should you be afraid asked hilbert much surprised  because said mr chauncy i should not know what to do with the money i would not put it in my purse for i dont let any thing go in there but honest money i dont know who i could give it to besides i should not like to ask any body to take what i should be ashamed to keep myself i should really be in a very awkward situation  as he said this mr chauncy held his ticket between his thumb and finger and looked at the number neither he nor hilbert suspected for a moment that there was any mistake in reading it for not having paid any attention to the scheme as it is called of the lottery they did not know how high the numbers went  there is a possibility that i may get it after all said mr chauncy at length musing we have had fine weather and have been coming on fast the best thing for me to do is to get rid of the ticket have you got a ticket rollo said he turning to rollo  no sir said rollo  i have a great mind to give it to you then  no sir said rollo i would rather not have it  that is right said mr chauncy i like you the better for that i know what i will do with it do you remember an irishwoman that you see sitting on the forward deck sometimes with her two children  yes said rollo she is there now  very well said mr chauncy carry this to her and tell her it is a ticket in a lottery and it may possibly draw a prize have you any conscientious scruples about doing that  no sir said rollo  then take the ticket and go added mr chauncy tell her she had better sell the ticket for two shillings if she gets a chance there may be somebody among the gamblers that will buy it  so rollo took the ticket and carried it to the irishwoman she was a woman who was returning to ireland as a deck passenger she was quite poor when rollo tendered her the ticket she was at first much surprised rollo explained the case fully to her and concluded by repeating mr chauncys advicethat she should sell the ticket if she could get a chance to sell it for as much as two shillings the woman having been at sea before understood something about such lotteries and seemed to be quite pleased to get a ticket she asked rollo to tell such gentlemen as he might meet that she had 99 to sell for two shillings this however rollo did not like to do and so he simply returned to the settee and reported to mr chauncy that he had given the woman the ticket and delivered the message  mr chauncy said he was very much obliged to him and then rising from his seat he walked slowly away and descended into the cabin  illustration     chapter x  the end of the lottery   in almost all cases of betting and lotteries the operation of the system is that certain persons called the knowing ones contrive to manage the business in such a way by secret manoeuvres and intrigues as to make the result turn out to their advantage at the expense of those parties concerned who are ignorant and inexperienced or as they term it green very deep plans were laid for accomplishing this object in respect to the lottery described in the last chapter though as it happened in this case they were fortunately frustrated  the principal of these manoeuvres were the work of the man whom they called the colonel he had formed the plan with another man of secretly watching the operation of heaving the log every time it was performed and making a note of the result by doing this he thought he could calculate very nearly how many miles the ship would make while all the other passengers would have nothing to guide them but such general estimates as they could make from recollection he accordingly arranged it with his confederates that one or the other of them should be on deck whenever the men were called to heave the log and without appearing to pay any particular attention to the operation carefully to obtain the result and make a memorandum of it this plan was sufficient for the daytime for the nightinasmuch as it might excite suspicion for them to be up at unseasonable hours to watch the operationthey resorted to another method they bribed one of the seamen of each watch to find out the result of each trial during his watch and to give them the answers in the morning when the last time for heaving the log previous to making up the accounts for the day came which was at ten oclock they took that result and then shutting themselves up in their state room they made a calculation and ascertained pretty certainly as they thought that the distance would be about 267 miles it might possibly be 266 or 268 but they thought that they were sure that it would be one of those three numbers the next thing was to circulate statements and to express opinions in private conversation here and there among the passengers in a careless sort of way to produce a general impression that the rate of the ship would be not less than 270 miles this was to lead the owners of the tickets and the betters generally not to attach a high value to the numbers below 270 by doing this they expected to depress the value of these tickets in the general estimation so that they could buy then easily they calculated that if their plans succeeded they could buy 266 267 and 268 for about a sovereign apiecethe holders of them being made to suppose by their manoeuvres that those numbers would have very little chance of obtaining the prize  the plan was very deeply laid and very skilfully executed and the men were so far successful in their efforts that they did produce a general impression that the ships run could not be below 270 they also bought ticket 268 though they had to give two sovereigns for it it has already been shown how their attempts to get possession of 267 failed by hilberts refusal to sell it they of course also failed to get 266 for that ticket was not to be found they could not make any very open and public inquiries for it as it was necessary that every thing which they did should be performed in a very unconcerned and careless manner they however made repeated inquiries privately for this ticket but could not get any tidings of it a certain sailor told some of the betters that an irishwoman on the forward deck had a ticket which she offered to sell for two shillings but when on being asked what the number was he answered 99 they laughed at him supposing that somebody had been putting a hoax upon the poor irishwoman as there was no such number as that in the lottery  besides the manoeuvres of these two confederates there was another man who was devising a cunning scheme for obtaining the prize this was the mate of a merchant ship that had put into the port of new york in a damaged condition and had there been sold the mate being thus left without a vessel was now returning as a passenger in the steamer to scotland where he belonged  this man was accustomed to navigation and he had the necessary books for making the computations in his trunk he conceived the idea of being present on deck at twelve oclock when the captain made his observation and of learning from him as it were accidentally what the suns altitude was observed to be this he could very easily do for it was customary to have the observation made not only by the captain but by one or two of the chief officers of the ship also at the same time who are all always provided with sextants for the purpose the results when obtained are compared together to see if they agreeeach observer telling the others what altitude he obtains thus they are more sure of getting the result correctly besides it is important that these officers should have practice so that they may be able to take the observation when the captain is sick or when they come to command ships themselves  now the mate above referred to thought that by standing near the captain and his officers when they made the observations he could overhear them in comparing their results and then that he could go down into his state room immediately and that there by working very diligently he could ascertain the run of the ship before it should be reported on the captains bulletin and so know beforehand what ticket would gain the prize or if he could not determine absolutely what the precise ticket would besince his computation might not agree precisely with that made by the captainhe could determine within two or three of the right one and then buy three ticketsthat is the one which agreed with his calculation and also the one above and below itfor perhaps a sovereign or so apiece he would thus get the ten sovereigns by an expenditure of three or four his plan in fact was similar to that of the colonel only his estimate was to be based on the observation while that of the colonel was based on the dead reckoning they both performed their computations in a very skilful manner and they came to nearly the same result the mate came to the conclusion that the run of the ship would be 266 miles while the colonel as has already been stated made it 267 while therefore the colonel to make sure of the prize wished to buy tickets 266 267 and 268 the mate wished to secure 265 266 and 267 the mate after making some inquiry found who had 265 and after some bargaining succeeded in buying it for two sovereigns and a half but he could not hear any thing of 266 as for 267 he discovered that hilbert had it just as the bell rang for luncheon he told hilbert that if he wished to sell his ticket he would give him thirty shillings for it which is a sovereign and a half but hilbert said no  it is however time that this story of the lottery should draw to a close were it not so a great deal more detail might have been given of the manoeuvres and contrivances which both the colonel and the mate resorted to to induce hilbert to sell his ticket these efforts attracted no special attention for all the others were buying and selling tickets continually and making offers for those which they could not buy some were put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder amid jokes and gibes and continual shouts of laughter  at length when the time drew nigh for the captains bulletin to appear the mate offered hilbert three pounds for his ticket and hilbert went and asked his fathers advice about accepting this offer his father hesitated for some time but finally advised him not to sell his ticket at all hilbert was satisfied with this advice for he now began to be quite sure that he should get the prize  at length about fifteen minutes after the party had come up from luncheon and were all assembled around the paddlebox settee a gentleman came up one of stairways with a slip of paper in his hands and advancing to the group he attempted to still the noise they were making by saying  order gentlemen order ive got the bulletin  every bodys attention was arrested by these words and all began to call out order and silence until at length something like quiet was restored the persons assembled were all very much interested in learning the result for in addition to the prize of the lottery there were a great many bets some of them quite large pending all of which were to be decided by the bulletin  when at length the gentleman found that he could be heard he began to read in a very deliberate voice  latitude fortyeight thirtyone  never mind the latitude exclaimed the company the distance lets have the distance  longitude continued the reader ten fourteen  nonsense said the company whats the distance  distance continued the reader in the same tone two hundred and sixtysix  sixtysix they all exclaimed together and great inquiries were immediately made for the missing ticket but nobody knew any thing about it at last mr chauncys companion charles who happened to be there said  why chauncy had 66 i believe then calling out aloud to mr chauncy who had come up on the deck after luncheon and was now sitting on one of the settees that stood around the skylight he added  chauncy here come here where is your ticket you have got the prize  no said mr chauncy in a careless tone without however moving from his seat i have not any ticket  two or three of the gentlemen then headed by charles went to the place where mr chauncy was sitting to question him more particularly  wheres your ticket said charles  i gave it to one of the deck passengers said mr chauncy  you did said charles well it has drawn the prize what was the number of it  ninetynine i believe said mr chauncy  ninetynine repeated charles contemptuously nonsense there was no ninetynine it was sixtysix  then shouting with laughter he said o dear me thats so exactly like chauncy he gives half a sovereign for a ticket then reads it upside down and gives it away to an irishwoman o gemini  so saying charles and those with him went away laughing vociferously at chauncys expense  the remainder of the adventurers in the lottery had in the mean time dispersed having slunk away as is usual in such cases to conceal their mortification and chagrin it was not merely that they had each lost a half sovereign but they had all calculated with greater or less certainty on getting the prize and the vexation which they experienced at the disappointment was extreme some of them had bought up several tickets in order to make sure of the prize these were of course doubly and trebly chagrined some had been offered good prices for their tickets but had refused to accept them hoping by keeping the tickets to get the prize these persons were now vexed and angry with themselves for not accepting these offers then there was a feeling of guilt and condemnation which mingled with their disappointment and made it very bitter and hard to bear  the colonel and the mate when they learned that the irishwoman held the winning ticket both immediately began to saunter slowly along toward the stairways that led down to the forward deck each having formed the plan of going and buying the ticket of the woman before she should hear that it had gained the prize they moved along with a careless and unconcerned air in order not to awaken any suspicion of their designs they were suspected however both of them by mr chauncy he accordingly walked forward too and he reached a part of the promenade deck that was near the smoke pipe where he could look down upon the place where the woman was sitting he reached the spot just as the two men came before her one having descended by one staircase and the other by the other when they met each other close before where the woman was sitting they each understood in an instant for what purpose the other had come they knew too that it would defeat the object altogether if they both attempted to buy the ticket and yet there was no time or opportunity to make any formal stipulation on the subject between them such men however are always very quick and cunning and ready for all emergencies the mate without speaking to the woman gave a wink to the colonel and said in an undertone as he sauntered slowly along by him  colonel half  done said the colonel  so the mate passed carelessly on leaving the colonel to manage the negotiation with the understanding that they were to share the profits of the transaction between them  just at this moment mr chauncy who was looking down upon this scene from above called out to the woman  my good woman your ticket has drawn the prize the colonel has come to pay you the money  the colonel was overwhelmed with astonishment and vexation at this interruption he looked up with a countenance full of rage to see from whom the sound proceeded there were one or two other gentlemen standing with chauncy as witnesses of the scene and the colonel saw at once that his scheme was defeated so he made a virtue of necessity and taking out the purse he poured the ten sovereigns into the poor womans lap she was overwhelmed and bewildered with astonishment at finding herself suddenly in possession of so much money  as for hilbert there were no bounds to the vexation and anger which he experienced in the failure of all his hopes and expectations  what a miserable fool i was said he i might have had that very ticket he as good as offered to exchange with me such a stupid dolt as i was not to know when it was upside down then besides i was offered two pounds for my ticket sureand i believe i should have taken it if my father had not advised me not to do it that would have come to almost fifteen dollars and that i should have been sure of so much for taking my fathers advice i hope theyll get up another lottery tomorrow and then ill buy a ticket and do just as i please with it and not take any bodys advice i shall be sure to make fifteen dollars at least if i dont do any better than i might have done today  the rest of the company felt very much as hilbert did about their losses and disappointments though the etiquette of gambling which they understood better than he forbade their expressing their feelings so freely in fact one source of the illusion which surrounds this vice is that the interest which it excites and the hilarity and mirth which attend it during its progress are all open to view while the disappointment the mortification the chagrin and the remorse are all studiously concealed the remorse is the worst ingredient in the bitter cup it not only stings and torments those who have lost but it also spoils the pleasure of those who win that is in fact always the nature and tendency of remorse it aggravates all the pain and suffering that it mingles with and poisons all the pleasure     chapter xi  the arrival   day after day of the voyage thus glided away the time being beguiled by the various incidents which occurred until at length the ship began to draw near toward the land as the time passed on the interest which the passengers felt in their approach toward the land began to be very strong some of them were crossing the atlantic for the first time and they of course anticipated their first view of the shores of the old world with great anticipations of delight the first land to be made as the sailors say that is to be seen was cape clearthe southern point of ireland there is a lighthouse on this point and so well had the captain kept his reckoning and so exact had been his calculations in his progress over the mighty waste of waters that on the morning of the last day he could venture to predict to an hour when the light would come into view he said it would be between nine and ten when maria and the two children went to their berths maria asked the chambermaid to come and tell them when the light was in sight she accordingly did so rollo in order to know how near the captain was in his calculations asked her what oclock it was she said twentyfive minutes after eight how astonishing must be the accuracy of the instruments and the calculations which can enable a man to guide a ship across so utterly trackless a waste aiming at a lighthouse three thousand miles away and not only come out exactly upon it but come there too so exactly at the time predicted by the calculation  when the children went on deck the next morning the southern coast of ireland was all in full view those who feel an interest in seeing the track of the ship will find by turning to a map of great britain and ireland that her course in going in from the atlantic toward liverpool lay at first along the southern coast of ireland and then along the western coast of wales this route though it seems but a short distance on the map requires really a voyage of several hundred miles and more than a day in time for the performance of it the voyage of the ship is therefore by no means ended when she reaches the land at cape clear there is still a day and a night more for the passengers to spend on board the vessel the time is however very much beguiled during this last days sail by the sight of the land and the various objects which it presents to viewthe green slopes the castlecovered hills the cliffs the lines of beach with surf and breakers rolling in upon them and sometimes when the ship approaches nearer to the shore than usual the pretty little cottages covered with thatch and adorned with gardens and shrubbery  the children stood by the railing of the deck for some time after they came up from below gazing at the shores and admiring the various pictures of rural beauty which the scene presented to the eye at length becoming a little tired they went and sat down upon one of the settees where they could have a more comfortable position and still enjoy a good view not long afterward the captain who had been walking up and down the deck for some time came and sat down by them  well children said he are you glad to get to the end of the voyage  yes sir replied jennie i am glad to get safe off of the great sea  and i suppose that you must be very glad sir added rollo to get to the end of your responsibility  ah but i have not got to the end of my responsibility yet by any means said the captain  as he said this he rose from his seat and looked out very attentively forward for a minute or two at length he seemed satisfied and sat down again  well you have got through all the danger at any rate said rollo now that we are inside the land  on the contrary said the captain we are just coming into the danger there is very little danger for a good ship whether it is a sailing ship or a steamer out in the open sea it is only when she comes among the rocks and shoals and currents and other dangers which thicken along the margin of the land that she has much to fear ships are almost always cast away when they are cast away at all near or upon the land  is that the way replied rollo i thought they were cast away at sea i am sure it looks a great deal safer here than it does out in the middle of the ocean  i suppose so to your eyes replied the captain but you will see by reflecting on the subject that it is in fact just the contrary if a very violent storm comes up when the ship is out in the open sea it can ordinarily do no harm only to drive the ship off her course or perhaps carry away some of her spars or sails if there is no land in the way she is in very little danger but it is very different if a gale of wind comes up suddenly in such a place as this  and how is it here asked rollo  why in the case of a good steamer like this said the captain it makes no great difference here for we go straight forward on our course as long as we can see let it blow as it will but a sailing vessel would very probably not be able to stand against it but would be driven off toward any rocks or sand banks or shores that might happen to be in the way  and so she would certainly be wrecked said rollo  no not certainly replied the captain as soon as they found that the water was shoaling they would anchor  how do they know when the water is shoaling asked rollo  by the lead replied the captain did you never sound with the lead and line  no sir replied rollo  well they have a lead and a long line rejoined the captain and they let the lead down to the bottom by means of the line and so learn how deep the water is the lead is round and long it is about as large round and about as long as jennies arm from her elbow to her wrist and there is a small cavity in the lower end of it  what is that for asked rollo  that is to bring up some of the sand or mud or gravel or whatever it may be that forms the bottom replied the captain they put something into the hole before they let the lead down to make the sand or gravel stick when they see the nature of the bottom in this way it often helps them to determine where they are in case it is a dark night or a foggy day and they have got lost it is very easy to measure the depth of the sea in this way where it is not over a few hundred fathoms  how much is a fathom asked rollo  six feet replied the captain that is as far as a man can reach by stretching out both hands along a wall if the water is only a few hundred fathoms deep continued the captain we can sound but if it is much deeper than that it is very difficult to get the lead down  why i should think said rollo that the lead would go down to the bottom of itself no matter how deep the water was  it would said the captain were it not for the line but the line has some buoyancy and besides it makes a great deal of friction in being drawn through the water so that when the line begins to get very long it becomes very difficult for the lead to get it down as they let out the line from the ship it goes more and more slowly until at last it does not seem to move at all  then the lead must be on the bottom said rollo  no that is not certain said the captain it may be only that the quantity of line that is out is sufficient to float the lead besides that the currents in the water which may set in different directions at different depths carry the line off to one side and the other so that it lies very crooked in the water and the weight of the lead is not sufficient to straighten it  then they ought to have a heavier lead i should think said rollo  yes said the captain and for deepsea soundings they do use very heavy sinkers sometimes they use cannon balls as heavy as a man can lift then they take great pains too to have a very light and small line still with all these precautions it is very difficult after some miles of the line are run out to tell when the shot reaches the bottom in some of the deepest places in the sea the line when they attempt to sound is all day running out i knew one case where they threw the shot overboard in the morning and the line continued to run out though slower and slower of course all the time until night it changed its rate of running so gradually that at last they could not tell whether it was running or not it seemed to float idly in the water sinking slowly all the time and yet they could not tell whether it was drawn in by the drifting of the portion of the line already down or by the weight of the shot so they could not tell certainly whether they had reached bottom or not  there is another thing that is curious about it added the captain and that is that when a line is let out to such a length they can never get it back again  why not asked rollo  it is not strong enough said the captain to bear the strain of drawing such an immense length out of the water there is a very considerable degree of friction produced in drawing a line of any kind through the water and when the line is some miles in length and has besides a heavy ball at the end of it the resistance becomes enormous whenever they attempt to draw up a sounding line of such a length it always parts at a distance of a few hundred fathoms from the surface so that only a small part of the line is ever recovered  i should not suppose it would be so hard to draw up the line said rollo i should have thought that it would come up very easily  no said the captain if you draw even a whiplash through the water you will find that it draws much harder than it does on the grass and if a boys kite were to fall upon a pond at a great distance from the shore i dont think he could draw it in by the string the string would break on account of the friction of the string and of the kite in the water sometimes in naval battles when a ship is pretending to try to escape in order to entice another ship to follow her away from the rest of the fleet they tow a rope behind and this rope dragging in the water retards the ship and prevents her from going very fast notwithstanding that all the sails are set and she seems to be sailing as fast as she can  thats a curious way of doing it said rollo isnt it jennie  jennie thought that it was a very curious way indeed  there is no difficulty said the captain resuming his explanations in finding the depth of the sea in harbors and bays or at any place near the shore for in all such places it is usually much less than a hundred fathoms so when in a dark night or in a fog the ship is driven by the wind in a direction where they know there is land they sound often and when they find that the water is shoal enough they let go the anchor  and so the anchor holds them said jennie i suppose and keeps them from going against the land  yes said the captain generally but not always sometimes the bottom is of smooth rock or of some other hard formation which the flukes of the anchor cannot penetrate and then the ship drifts on toward the land dragging the anchor with her  and what do they do in that case asked rollo  very often there is nothing that they can do said the captain except to let out more cable cautiously so as to give the anchor a better chance to catch in some cleft or crevice in the bottom sometimes it does catch in this manner and then the ship is stopped and for a time the people on board think they are safe  and are they safe asked rollo  perhaps so replied the captain and yet there is still some danger the anchor may have caught at a place where the cable passes over the edge of a sharp rock which soon cuts it off in consequence of the motion then the ship must go on shore  at other times continued the captain the ground for the anchor is too soft instead of being too hard and the flukes therefore do not take a firm hold of it then the anchor will drag every sea that strikes the ship drives her a little in toward the shore and she is of course in great danger  the captain would perhaps have gone on still further in his conversation with the children had it not happened that just at this time on rising to look out forward he saw a large ship under full sail coming down the channel so he rose and went up upon one of the paddle boxes to see that a proper lookout was kept to avoid a collision  the seas which lie between england and ireland are so wide and they are so provided with lighthouses and buoys that no pilot is necessary for the navigation of them and the pilot boats therefore which contain the pilot who is to take the vessel into port generally await the arrival of the ship off the month of the mersey at a place which the steamer reaches about twentyfour hours after making cape clear when the steamer in which rollo made his voyage arrived at this place almost all the passengers came on deck to witness the operation of taking the pilot on board there were ships and steamers to be seen on every side proceeding in different directionssome going across to ireland some southwardly out to sea and there were others still which were like the steamer bound in to liverpool among these there was a small vessel at a distance from the steamer with a certain signal flying this signal was to show that this boat was the one which contained the pilot whose turn it was to take the steamer in the captain gave the proper orders to the helmsman and the steamer gradually turned from her course so as to approach the spot where the pilot boat was lying as she came near a little skiff was seen at the stern of the pilot boat with men getting into it in a moment more the skiff pushed off and rowed toward the steamer a sailor stood on a sort of platform abaft the wheel house to throw the men in the skiff a rope when they came near the engine was stopped and the monstrous steampipe commenced blowing off the steam which being now no longer employed to work the engine it would be dangerous to keep pent up the steam in issuing from the pipe produced a dense cloud of smoke and a terrific roaring  in the mean time the skiff approached the ship and the men on board of it caught the rope thrown to them by the sailor on the platform by this rope they were drawn up to the side of the ship at a place where there was a ladder and then the pilot leaving the skiff clambered up and came on board the men in the skiff then pushed off and turned to go back toward the pilot boat the roaring of the steam suddenly ceased the paddle wheels began again to revolve and the ship recommenced her motion the pilot went up upon the paddle box and gave orders to the helmsman how to steer while the captain came down his responsibility and care in respect to the navigation of the ship for that voyage was now over  in fact the passengers began to consider the voyage as ended they all went to work packing up their trunks adjusting their dress changing their caps for hats and making other preparations for the land  as the time drew nigh for going on shore jennie began to feel some apprehension on the subject inasmuch as judging from all the formidable preparations which she saw going on around her she inferred that landing in liverpool from an atlantic steamer must be a very different thing from going on shore at new york after a voyage down the hudson as for rollo his feelings were quite the reverse from jennies he not only felt no solicitude on the subject but he began to be quite ambitious of going ashore alonethat is without any one to take charge of him  we shall get along jennie very well indeed said rollo i asked one of the passengers about it the customhouse officers will come and look into our trunks to see if we have got any smuggled goods in them they wont find any in ours i can tell them then all i have got to do is to ask one of the cabmen to take us in his cab and carry us to a hotel  to what hotel asked jennie  whyi dont know said rollo rather puzzled to the best hotel ill just tell him to the best hotel  well said jennie and what then  welland thensaid rollo looking a little perplexed again and speaking rather doubtinglythenwhy i suppose that father will send somebody there to find us  jennie was not convinced but she had nothing more to say and so she was silent  rollos plan however of taking care of himself in the landing seemed not likely to be realized for there were not less than three different arrangements made on the evening of the arrival for taking care of him in the first place his father and mother were at the adelphi hotel in liverpool awaiting the arrival of the steamer and intending to go on board as soon as the guns should announce her coming in the second place mr chauncy marias brother said that they should go with him and maria he would take the children he said to a hotel and then take immediate measures to find out where mr holiday was in the third place the captain came to rollo just after sunset and made a similar proposal  rollo not knowing any thing about his fathers plan accepted mr chauncys offer and then when the captain came he thanked him for his kindness but said that he was going with mr chauncy and maria  then you will go in the night said the captain for mr chauncy is the bearer of despatches  rollo did not understand what the captain meant by this though it was afterward explained to him the explanation was this every steamer besides the passengers carries the mails the mails containing all the letters and papers that are passing between the two countries are conveyed in a great number of canvas and leather bags and sometimes in tin boxes enough often to make several cartloads besides these mails which contain the letters of private citizens the government of the united states has always a bag full of letters and papers which are to be sent to the american minister in london for his instruction these letters and papers are called the government despatches they are not sent with the mails but are intrusted usually to some one of the passengersa gentleman known to the government as faithful and trustworthy this passenger is called the bearer of despatches  now the steamers when they arrive at liverpool cannot usually go directly up to the pier because the water is not deep enough there except at particular states of the tide they accordingly have to anchor in the stream at some distance from the shore as soon as they anchor whether it is by day or by night a small steamer comes alongside to get the mails and the despatches for they must be landed immediately so as to proceed directly to london by the first train the bearer of despatches together with his family or those whom he has directly under his charge are of course allowed to go on shore in the small steamer with the despatch bag but the rest of the passengers have to wait to have their trunks and baggage examined by the customhouse officers if the vessel gets to liverpool in the night they have to wait until the next morning this was what the captain meant by saying that if the children went on shore with mr chauncy they would go in the night for he then expected to get to his anchoring ground so that the boat for the mails would come off to the ship at about half past twelve  accordingly that evening when bedtime came maria and the children did not go to bed but they lay down upon the couches and in their berths in their dayclothes awaiting the summons which they expected to receive when the small steamer should come in the mean time the ship went on sometimes going very slowly and sometimes stopping altogether in order to avoid a collision with some other vessel which was coming in her way the night was foggy and dark so that her progress to be safe was necessarily slow at length maria and the children tired of waiting and watching all three fell asleep they were however suddenly aroused from their slumbers about midnight by the chambermaid who came into their state room and told them that mr chauncy was ready  they rose and hurried up on deck their trunks had been taken up before them when they reached the deck they found mr chauncy there and the captain and with them two or three rather roughlooking men in shaggy coats examining their trunks by the light of lanterns which they held in their hands the examination was very slight the men merely lifted up the things in the corners a little and finding that there appeared to be nothing but clothing in the trunks they said all right and then shut them up again all this time the steampipe of the little steamer alongside kept up such a deafening roar that it was almost impossible to hear what was said  the way of descent to get down from the deck of the great steamer to the little one was very steep and intricate and it seemed doubly so on account of the darkness and gloom of the night in the first place you had to climb up three or four steps to get to the top of the bulwarks then to go down a long ladder which landed you on the top of the paddle box of the steamer from this paddle box you walked along a little way over what they called a bridge and then there was another flight of stairs leading to the deck as all these stairs and also the sides of both the steamers were painted black and as the water looked black and gloomy too the whole being only faintly illuminated by the lurid glare of the lanterns held by the men the prospect was really very disheartening maria said when she reached the top of the bulwark and looked down that she should never dare to go down there in the world  she was however a sensible girl and as she knew very well that there could not be any real danger in such a case she summoned all her resolution and went on men stood below at the different landingplaces to help her and her brother handed her down from above mr chauncy as soon as he saw that she had safely descended was going to attend to the children but just at that instant he missed his despatch bag he asked where it was some said they believed it had gone down the slide there was a sort of slide by the side of the ladder where the mails and trunks had been sent down some said it had gone down this slide others did not know so he directed the children to wait a moment while he went down to see he accordingly descended the ladder and began to look about in a hurried manner to see if he could find it the men on board the steamer in the mean while were impatient to cut loose from the ship the mail agent having called out to them to make haste or they would be too late for the train accordingly some of them stood by the ladder ready to take it down while others seized the ropes and prepared to cast them off at a moments notice as soon as they should hear that the despatch bag was found they did not know that the children were at the top of the ladder waiting to come on board for it was so dark that nothing could be seen distinctly except where the lanterns were directly shining and the noise made by the roaring of the steamer was so great that very little could be heard  mr chauncy found the despatch bag very soon in the after part of the vessel where somebody had put it in a safe place as soon as he saw it he said ah here it is all right  all right all right said the sailors around him repeating his words in a loud tone when they heard him say that the despatch bag was found mr chauncy immediately hurried back to go up the ladder to the children but he was too late on hearing the words all right the men had immediately drawn down the ladder and cast off the fastenings so that by the time that mr chauncy reached the paddle box the noise of the steampipe had suddenly stopped the paddle wheels were beginning to revolve and the little steamer was gliding rapidly away from the vast and towering mass under which it had been lying  the children exclaimed mr chauncy the children  never mind said the captain in a very quiet tone its too late now ill take care of them tomorrow morning  the captain spoke in a manner as calm and unconcerned as if the children being left in this way was not a matter of the slightest consequence in the world in fact the commanders of these steamships being accustomed to encounter continually all sorts of emergencies difficulties and dangers get in the habit of taking every thing very coolly which is indeed always the best way  then turning to the children he said  its all right children go below and get into your berths again and i will send you on shore tomorrow morning when the rest of the passengers go  so rollo and jennie went below again the chambermaid was surprised to see them coming back and when she heard an explanation of the case she advised them to undress themselves and go to bed regularly this they did and were soon fast asleep  the next morning very soon after sunrise another steamer came off from the shore bringing several customhouse officers to examine the passengers baggage by the time that this steamer had arrived a great many of the passengers were up and had their trunks ready on deck to be examined among the rest was hilbert with his trunk though his father and mother were not yet ready hilbert was very anxious to get on shore and so he had got his trunk up and was all ready on the deck half an hour before the steamer came  when the tugd came alongside hilbert who was looking down upon her from the promenade deck observed a neatlydressed looking man on board of it who seemed to be looking at him very earnestly this was mr holidays servant his name was alfred when mr holiday had gone to bed the night before he had given alfred orders that in case the steamer should come in in the night or at a very early hour in the morning before it would be safe for him as an invalid to go out he alfred was to go on board find the children and bring them on shore accordingly when alfred saw hilbert and observed that he was of about the same size as rollo had been described to him to be he supposed that it must be rollo accordingly as soon as the tug was made fast he came up the ladder and immediately made his way to the promenade deck to the place where hilbert was standing as he approached hilbert he touched his hat and then said in a very respectful tone  footnote d they often call these small steamers that ply about harbors tugs from the fact that they are employed in towing vessels sometimes they are called tenders  beg pardon sir is this master holiday  rollo do you mean said hilbert no rollo went ashore last night with the bearer of despatches  hilbert knew that this was the arrangement which had been made and he supposed that it had been carried into effect  alfred who was a very faithful and trustworthy man and was accustomed to do every thing thoroughly was not fully satisfied with this information coming as it did from a boy but he waited some little time and made inquiries of other passengers at last one gentleman told him that he was sure that rollo had gone on shore for he saw him and his sister pass up out of the cabin when the mail tug came he was sitting up in the cabin reading at the time alfred was satisfied with this explanation and so he called a small boat which was alongside and engaged the boatman to row him ashore  thus the second plan for taking care of rollo and jennie in the landing failed  all this time rollo and jennie were both asleepfor the chambermaid thinking that they must be tired from having been up so late the night before concluded to let them sleep as long as possible while they were sleeping the waiters on board the ship were all employed in carrying up trunks and boxes and carpet bags and bundles of canes and umbrellas from all the state rooms and spreading them about upon the decks where the customhouse officers could examine them the decks soon of course presented in every part very bustling and noisy scenes passengers were hurrying to and fro some were getting their baggage together for examination some were unstrapping their trunks and others having unstrapped theirs were now fumbling in their pockets in great distress to find the keys it is always an awkward thing to lose a trunk key but the most unfortunate of all possible times for meeting with this calamity is when a customhouse officer is standing by waiting to examine what your trunk contains those who could not find their keys were obliged to stand aside and let others take their turn as fast as the trunks were inspected the lid of each was shut down and it was marked with chalk and then as soon as it was locked and strapped again a porter conveyed it to the tug where the owner followed it ready to go on shore  in the midst of this scene the captain came on deck and began to look around for the children whom he had promised to take care of he made some inquiries for them and at length was told that they had gone ashore  at least i think they have gone said his informant i saw mr holidays coachman here inquiring for them a short time ago and he seems to be gone i presume he has taken them ashore  he cant have taken them ashore said the captain there is nothing to go ashore till this tug goes however i presume he has got them under his charge somewhere  so the captain dismissed the subject from his mind and after remaining a few minutes on deck and seeing that every thing was going on well he went below into his state room in order to write a letter to the owners of the ship to inform them of the safe termination of the voyage  it was about this time that the chambermaid waked rollo and jennie they rose immediately and were soon dressed on going up upon the deck they were somewhat surprised to witness the bustling scenes that were enacting there and they stood for a few minutes surveying the various groups and watching with great interest the process of examining the baggage at length after following the process through in the case of one of the passengers who was just opening his trunk when they came up rollo turned to jennie and said  it is nothing at all jennie i can do it as well as any body  so he looked about till he found his trunk and leading jennie there he took his station by the side of it and immediately proceeded to unstrap and unlock it he took out some of the largest things from the top of the trunk and put them on a settee near so that the officer could easily examine the rest by the time he had done this an officer was ready  is this your trunk my lad said the officer at the same time lifting up the clothes a little at the corners  yes sir said rollo  all right said the officer and he shut down the lid and marked the top with a p  rollo opened his trunk again to put the other things in and then locked and strapped it a porter then took it and carried it on board the tender rollo and jennie followed him  in about half an hour the tender put off from the steamer and went to the shore on the way jennie who could not help feeling some anxiety about the result of these formidable proceedings said timidly  i dont see what we are going to do rollo when we get to the shore  we will do what the rest do said rollo  as soon as the steamer touched the pier and began to blow off her steam a terrific scene of noise and confusion ensued rollo and jennie stood near their trunk overawed and silenced but yet rollo was not after all much afraid for he felt confident that it would all come out right in the end he was right in this supposition for as soon as some fifty of the most impatient and eager of the passengers had got their baggage and had gone ashore the tumult subsided in a great measure at length a porter after taking away a great many trunks near rollo asked him if that trunk pointing to rollos was to go on shore rollo said that it was so the porter took it up and went away rollo and jennie following him  they made their way through the crowd and across the plank to the pier when they had got upon the pier the porter turned and said do you want a carriage rollo answered yes and then the porter immediately put the trunk upon the top of a small carriage which was standing there in a line with many others he then opened the door and rollo and jennie got in  how much to pay sir said rollo  sixpence if you please sir said the porter  rollo who had had the precaution to provide himself with silver change so as to be ready gave the man a sixpence of course it was an english sixpence  thank you sir said the porter where shall he drive  to the hotel said rollo  to what hotel said the porter  whyi dont know said rollo toto the best hotel  to the adelphi said the porter to the coachman so saying he shut the door and the coachman drove away  when they arrived at the door of the hotel the landlord who came out to see who had come supposed at once that his new guests must be mr holidays children so he sent them up immediately to their fathers parlor where the breakfast table had been set and their father and mother and thanny were waiting for them the joy of their parents at seeing them was unbounded and they themselves were almost equally rejoiced in finding their long voyage brought thus to a safe and happy termination  in respect to tiger however the end of the voyage was unfortunately not so propitious in the confusion of the landing she was forgotten and left behind and jennie was so excited and overjoyed at meeting her mother that it was nearly noon before she thought of the kitten at all her father then sent alfred on board the ship to see if he could get her he came back with the cage but he said that the kitten was nowhere to be found he made diligent inquiry but he could obtain no tidings of herand no tidings were ever afterward heard whether she fell overboard and was drowned or whether the waiters on the ship took a fancy to her and hid her away somewhere in the forecastle in order to keep her for their pet and plaything in future voyages or whether she walked over the plank to the pier when the ship came alongside of it and there got enticed away by the liverpool cats into the various retreats and recesses which they resort to among the docks and sewerscould never be known at all events neither jennie nor rollo ever saw or heard of her again                                         taggard  thompson  publish the following  popular juvenile books  rollos tour in europe  ten volumes 16mo cloth being a new series of rollo
