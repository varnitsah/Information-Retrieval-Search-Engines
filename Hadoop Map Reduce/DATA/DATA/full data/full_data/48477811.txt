48477811	literary friends and acquaintancesliterary boston as i knew it  by william dean howells    literary boston as i knew it  among my fellowpassengers on the train from new york to boston when i went to begin my work there in 1866 as the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly was the late samuel bowles of the springfield republican who created in a subordinate city a journal of metropolitan importance i had met him in venice several years earlier when he was suffering from the cruel insomnia which had followed his overwork on that newspaper and when he told me that he was sleeping scarcely more than one hour out of the twentyfour his worn face attested the misery which this must have been and which lasted in some measure while he lived though i believe that rest and travel relieved him in his later years he was always a man of cordial friendliness and he now expressed a most gratifying interest when i told him what i was going to do in boston he gave himself the pleasure of descanting upon the dramatic quality of the fact that a young newspaper man from ohio was about to share in the destinies of the great literary periodical of new england     i  i do not think that such a fact would now move the fancy of the liveliest newspaper man so much has the west since returned upon the east in a refluent wave of authorship but then the west was almost an unknown quality in our literary problem and in fact there was scarcely any literature outside of new england even this was of new england origin for it was almost wholly the work of new england men and women in the splendid exile of new york the atlantic monthly which was distinctively literary was distinctively a new england magazine though from the first it had been characterized by what was more national what was more universal in the new england temperament its chief contributors for nearly twenty years were longfellow lowell holmes whittier emerson doctor hale colonel higginson mrs stowe whipple rose terry cooke mrs julia ward howe mrs prescott spofford mrs phelps ward and other new england writers who still lived in new england and largely in the region of boston occasionally there came a poem from bryant at new york from mr stedman from mr stoddard and mrs stoddard from mr aldrich and from bayard taylor but all these except the last were not only of new england race but of new england birth i think there was no contributor from the south but mr m d conway and as yet the west scarcely counted though four young poets from ohio who were not immediately or remotely of puritan origin had appeared in early numbers alice cary living with her sister in new york had written now and then from the beginning mr john hay solely represented illinois by a single paper and he was of rhode island stock it was after my settlement at boston that mark twain of missouri became a figure of worldwide fame at hartford and longer after that mr bret harte made that progress eastward from california which was telegraphed almost from hour to hour as if it were the progress of a prince miss constance f woolson had not yet begun to write mr james whitcomb riley mr maurice thompson miss edith thomas octave thanet mr charles warren stoddard mr h b fuller mrs catherwood mr hamlin garland all whom i name at random among other western writers were then as unknown as mr cable miss murfree mrs rives chanler miss grace king mr joel chandler harris mr thomas nelson page in the south which they by no means fully represent  the editors of the atlantic had been eager from the beginning to discover any outlying literature but as i have said there was in those days very little good writing done beyond the borders of new england if the case is now different and the best known among living american writers are no longer newenglanders still i do not think the south and west have yet trimmed the balance and though perhaps the news writers now more commonly appear in those quarters i should not be so very sure that they are not still characterized by new england ideals and examples on the other hand i am very sure that in my early day we were characterized by them and wished to be so we even felt that we failed in so far as we expressed something native quite in our own way the literary theories we accepted were new england theories the criticism we valued was new england criticism or more strictly speaking boston theories boston criticism  of those more constant contributors to the atlantic whom i have mentioned it is of course known that longfellow and lowell lived in cambridge emerson at concord and whittier at amesbury colonel higginson was still and for many years afterwards at newport mrs stowe was then at andover miss prescott of newburyport had become mrs spofford and was presently in boston where her husband was a member of the general court mrs phelps ward as miss elizabeth stuart phelps dwelt in her fathers house at andover the chief of the bostonians were mrs julia ward howe doctor holmes and doctor hale yet boston stood for the whole massachusetts group and massachusetts in the literary impulse meant new england i suppose we must all allow whether we like to do so or not that the impulse seems now to have pretty well spent itself certainly the city of boston has distinctly waned in literature though it has waxed in wealth and population i do not think there are in boston today even so many talents with a literary coloring in law science theology and journalism as there were formerly though i have no belief that the boston talents are fewer or feebler than before i arrived in boston however when all talents had more or less a literary coloring and when the greatest talents were literary these expressed with ripened fulness a civilization conceived in faith and brought forth in good works but that moment of maturity was the beginning of a decadence which could only show itself much later new england has ceased to be a nation in itself and it will perhaps never again have anything like a national literature but that was something like a national literature and it will probably be centuries yet before the life of the whole country the american life as distinguished from the new england life shall have anything so like a national literature it will be long before our larger life interprets itself in such imagination as hawthornes such wisdom as emersons such poetry as longfellows such prophecy as whittiers such wit and grace as holmess such humor and humanity as lowells  the literature of those great men was if i may suffer myself the figure the socinian graft of a calvinist stock their faith in its varied shades was unitarian but their art was puritan so far as it was imperfectand great and beautiful as it was i think it had its imperfectionsit was marred by the intense ethicism that pervaded the new england mind for two hundred years and that still characterizes it they or their fathers had broken away from orthodoxy in the great schism at the beginning of the century but as if their heterodoxy were consciencestricken they still helplessly pointed the moral in all they did some pointed it more directly some less directly but they all pointed it i should be far from blaming them for their ethical intention though i think they felt their vocation as prophets too much for their good as poets sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon though not always nor nearly always it was in poetry and in romance that they excelled in the novel so far as they attempted it they failed i say this with the names of all the bostonian group and those they influenced in mind and with a full sense of their greatness it may be ungracious to say that they have left no heirs to their peculiar greatness but it would be foolish to say that they left an estate where they had none to bequeath one cannot take account of such a fantasy as judds margaret the only newenglander who has attempted the novel on a scale proportioned to the work of the newenglanders in philosophy in poetry in romance is mr de forest who is of new haven and not of boston i do not forget the fictions of doctor holmes or the vivid inventions of doctor hale but i do not call them novels and i do not forget the exquisitely realistic art of miss jewett or miss wilkins which is free from the ethicism of the great new england group but which has hardly the novelistss scope new england in hawthornes work achieved supremacy in romance but the romance is always an allegory and the novel is a picture in which the truth to life is suffered to do its unsermonized office for conduct and new england yet lacks her novelist because it was her instinct and her conscience in fiction to be true to an ideal of life rather than to life itself  even when we come to the exception that proves the rule even to such a signal exception as uncle toms cabin i think that what i say holds true that is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose and it is the work of a new england woman writing from all the inspirations and traditions of new england it is like begging the question to say that i do not call it a novel however but really is it a novel in the sense that war and peace is a novel or madame flaubert or lassommoir or phineas finn or dona perfecta or esther waters or marta y maria or the return of the native or virgin soil or david grieve in a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first but its chief virtue or its prime virtue is in its address to the conscience and not its address to the taste to the ethical sense not the aesthetical sense  this does not quite say the thing but it suggests it and i should be sorry if it conveyed to any reader a sense of slight for i believe no one has felt more deeply than myself the value of new england in literature the comparison of the literary situation at boston to the literary situation at edinburgh in the times of the reviewers has never seemed to me accurate or adequate and it holds chiefly in the fact that both seem to be of the past certainly new york is yet no london in literature and i think boston was once vastly more than edinburgh ever was at least in quality the scotch literature of the palmy days was not wholly scotch and even when it was rooted in scotch soil it flowered in the air of an alien speech but the new england literature of the great day was the blossom of a new england root and the language which the bostonians wrote was the native english of scholars fitly the heirs of those who had brought the learning of the universities to massachusetts bay two hundred years before and was of as pure a lineage as the english of the mothercountry     iii  the literary situation which confronted me when i came to boston was then as native as could well be and whatever value i may be able to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy i will not pretend that i saw it in its entirety and i have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it what i can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it and i shall wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that it was in a state of transition as everything is always and everywhere it was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so and i became a witness of it after the change had begun the publishing house which so long embodied new england literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions and one of these had brought mr t b aldrich from new york a few weeks before i arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which i think never impressed any one but mr bowles mr aldrich was the editor of every saturday when i came to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly we were of nearly the same age but he had a distinct and distinguished priority of reputation insomuch that in my western remoteness i had always ranged him with such elders and betters of mine as holmes and lowell and never imagined him the blond slight youth i found him with every imaginable charm of contemporaneity it is no part of the office which i have intended for these slight and sufficiently wandering glimpses of the past to show any writer in his final place and above all i do not presume to assign any living man his rank or station but i should be false to my own grateful sense of beauty in the work of this poet if i did not at all times recognize his constancy to an ideal which his name stands for he is known in several kinds but to my thinking he is best in a certain nobler kind of poetry a serious sort in which the thought holds him above the scrupulosities of the art he loves and honors so much sometimes the file slips in his hold as the file must and will it is but an instrument at the best but there is no mistouch in the hand that lays itself upon the readers heart with the pulse of the poets heart quick and true in it there are sonnets of his grave and simple and lofty which i think of with the glow and thrill possible only from very beautiful poetry and which impart such an emotion as we can feel only         when a great thought strikes along the brain         and flushes all the cheek  when i had the fortune to meet him first i suppose that in the employ of the kindly house we were both so eager to serve our dignities were about the same for if the atlantic monthly was a somewhat prouder affair than an eclectic weekly like every saturday he was supreme in his place and i was subordinate in mine the house was careful in the attitude of its senior partner not to distinguish between us and we were not slow to perceive the tact used in managing us we had our own joke of it we compared notes to find whether we were equally used in this thing or that and we promptly shared the fun of our discovery with fields himself  we had another impartial friend no less a friend of joy in the life which seems to have been pretty nearly all joy as i look back upon it in the partner who became afterwards the head of the house and who forecast in his bold enterprises the change from a new england to an american literary situation in the end james r osgood failed though all his enterprises succeeded the anomaly is sad but it is not infrequent they were greater than his powers and his means and before they could reach their full fruition they had to be enlarged to men of longer purse and longer patience he was singularly fitted both by instinct and by education to become a great publisher and he early perceived that if a leading american house were to continue at boston it must be hospitable to the talents of the whole country he founded his future upon those generous lines but he wanted the qualities as well as the resources for rearing the superstructure changes began to follow each other rapidly after he came into control of the house misfortune reduced the size and number of its periodicals the young folks was sold outright and the north american review long before mr rice bought it and carried it to new york was cut down onehalf so that aldrich said it looked as if destiny had sat upon it his own periodical every saturday was first enlarged to a stately quarto and illustrated and then under stress of the calamities following the great boston fire it collapsed to its former size then both the atlantic monthly and every saturday were sold away from their old ownership and every saturday was suppressed altogether and we two ceased to be of the same employ there was some sort of evening rite more funereal than festive the day after they were sold and we followed osgood away from it under the lamps we all knew that it was his necessity that had caused him to part with the periodicals but he professed that it was his pleasure and he said he had not felt so lighthearted since he was a boy we asked him how could he feel gay when he was no longer paying us our salaries and how could he justify it to his conscience he liked our mocking and limped away from us with a rheumatic easing of his weight from one foot to another a figure pathetic now that it has gone the way to dusty death and dear to memory through benefactions unalloyed by one unkindness     iv  but when i came to boston early in 1866 the atlantic monthly and harpers then divided our magazine world between them the north american review in the control of lowell and professor norton had entered upon a new life every saturday was an instant success in the charge of mr aldrich who was by taste and training one of the best editors and our young folks had the field of juvenile periodical literature to itself  it was under the direction of miss lucy larcom and of mr j t trowbridge who had come from western new york where he was born and must be noted as one of the first returners from the setting to the rising sun he naturalized himself in boston in his later boyhood and he still breathes boston air where he dwells in the street called pleasant on the shore of spy pond at arlington and still weaves the magic web of his satisfying stories for boys he merges in their popularity the fame of a poet which i do not think will always suffer that eclipse for his poems show him to have looked deeply into the heart of common humanity with a true and tender sense of it  miss larcom scarcely seemed to change from date to date in the generation that elapsed between the time i first saw her and the time i saw her last a year or two before her death a goodness looked out of her comely face which made me think of the madonnas in titians assumption and her whole aspect expressed a mild and friendly spirit which i find it hard to put in words she was never of the fine world of literature she dwelt where she was born in that unfashionable beverly which is not beverly farms and was of a simple seafaring godfearing race as she has told in one of the loveliest autobiographies i know a new england girlhood she was the author of many poems whose number she constantly enlarged but she was chiefly and will be most lastingly famed for the one poem hannah binding shoes which years before my days in boston had made her so widely known she never again struck so deep or so true a note but if one has lodged such a note in the ear of time it is enough and if we are to speak of eternity one might very well hold up ones head in the fields of asphodel if one could say to the great others there i wrote hannah binding shoes her poem is very very sad as all who have read it will remember but miss larcom herself was above everything cheerful and she had a laugh of mellow richness which willingly made itself heard she was not only of true new england stock and a boston author by right of race but she came up to that city every winter from her native town  by the same right and on the same terms another new england poetess whom i met those first days in boston was a boston author when i saw celia thaxter she was just beginning to make her effect with those poems and sketches which the sea sings and flashes through as it sings and flashes around the isles of shoals her summer home where her girlhood had been passed in a freedom as wild as the curlews she was a most beautiful creature still very young with a slender figure and an exquisite perfection of feature she was in presence what her work was fine frank finished i do not know whether other witnesses of our literary history feel that the public has failed to keep her as fully in mind as her work merited but i do not think there can be any doubt but our literature would be sensibly the poorer without her work it is interesting to remember how closely she kept to her native field and it is wonderful to consider how richly she made those seabeaten rocks to blossom something strangely full and bright came to her verse from the mystical environment of the ocean like the luxury of leaf and tint that it gave the narrower flowerplots of her native isles her gift indeed could not satisfy itself with the terms of one art alone however varied and she learned to express in color the thoughts and feelings impatient of the pallor of words  she remains in my memories of that far boston a distinct and vivid personality as the authoress of amber gods and in a cellar and circumstance and those other wild romantic tales remains the gentle and somewhat evanescent presence i found her miss prescott was now mrs spofford and her husband was a rising young politician of the day it was his duties as member of the general court that had brought them up from newburyport to boston for that first winter and i remember that the evening when we met he was talking of their some time going to italy that she might study for imaginative literature certain italian cities he named i have long since ceased to own those cities but at the moment i felt a pang of expropriation which i concealed as well as i could and now i heartily wish she could have fulfilled that purpose if it was a purpose or realized that dream if it was only a dream perhaps however that sumptuous and glowing fancy of hers which had taken the fancy of the young readers of that day needed the cold new england background to bring out all its intensities of tint all its splendors of light its effects were such as could not last or could not be farther evolved they were the expression of youth musing away from its environment and smitten with the glories of a world afar and beyond the great world the fine world the impurpled world of romantic motives and passions but for what they were i can never think them other than what they appeared the emanations of a rarely gifted and singularly poetic mind i feel better than i can say how necessarily they were the emanations of a new england mind and how to the subtler sense they must impart the pathos of revolt from the colorless rigidities which are the long result of puritanism in the physiognomy of new england life  their author afterwards gave herself to the stricter study of this life in many tales and sketches which showed an increasing mastery but they could not have the flush the surprise the delight of a young talent trying itself in a kind native and so far as i know peculiar to it from time to time i still come upon a poem of hers which recalls that earlier strain of music of color and i am content to trust it for my abiding faith in the charm of things i have not read for thirty years     v  i speak of this one and that as it happens and with no thought of giving a complete prospect of literary boston thirty years ago i am aware that it will seem sparsely peopled in the effect i impart and i would have the reader always keep in mind the great fames at cambridge and at concord which formed so large a part of the celebrity of boston i would also like him to think of it as still a great town merely where every one knew every one else and whose metropolitan liberation from neighborhood was just begun  most distinctly of that yet uncitified boston was the critic edwin p whipple whose sympathies were indefinitely wider than his traditions he was a most generous lover of all that was excellent in literature and though i suppose we should call him an oldfashioned critic now i suspect it would be with no distinct sense of what is newer fashioned he was certainly as friendly to what promised well in the younger men as he was to what was done well in their elders and there was no one writing in his day whose virtues failed of his recognition though it might happen that his foibles would escape whipples censure he wrote strenuously and of course conscientiously his point of view was solely and always that which enabled him best to discern qualities i doubt if he had any theory of criticism except to find out what was good in an author and praise it and he rather blamed what was ethically bad than what was aesthetically bad in this he was strictly of new england and he was of new england in a certain general intelligence which constantly grew with an interrogative habit of mind  he liked to talk to you of what he had found characteristic in your work to analyze you to yourself and the very modesty of the man which made such a study impersonal as far as he was concerned sometimes rendered him insensible to the sufferings of his subject he had a keen perception of humor in others but he had very little humor he had a love of the beautiful in literature which was perhaps sometimes greater than his sense of it  i write from a cursory acquaintance with his work not recently renewed of the presence of the man i have a vivider remembrance a slight short ecclesiasticized figure in black with a white neckcloth and a silk hat of strict decorum and between the two a square face with square features intensified in their regard by a pair of very large glasses and the prominent myopic eyes staring through them he was a type of outdated new england scholarship in these aspects but in the hospitable qualities of his mind and heart the sort of man to be kept fondly in the memory of all who ever knew him  out of the vague of that faroff time another face and figure as essentially new enland as this and yet so different relieve themselves charles f browne whose drollery wafted his pseudonym as far as the english speech could carry laughter was a westernized yankee he added an ohio way of talking to the maine way of thinking and he so became a literary product of a rarer and stranger sort than our literature had otherwise known he had gone from cleveland to london with intervals of new york and the lecture platform four or five years before i saw him in boston shortly after i went there we had met in ohio and he had personally explained to me the ducatless wellmeaning of vanity fair in new york but many men had since shaken the weary hand of artemus ward when i grasped it one day in front of the tremont temple he did not recognize me but he gave me at once a greeting of great impersonal cordiality with how do you do when did you come and other questions that had no concern in them till i began to dawn upon him through a cloud of other half remembered faces then he seized my hand and wrung it all over again and repeated his friendly demands with an intonation that was now why how are you how are you for me alone it was a bit of comedy which had the fit pathetic relief of his impending doom this was already stamped upon his wasted face and his gay eyes had the deathlook his large loose mouth was drawn for all its laughter at the fact which he owned his profile which burlesqued an eagles was the profile of a drooping eagle his lank length of limb trembled away with him when we parted i did not see him again i scarcely heard of him till i heard of his death and this sad image remains with me of the humorist who first gave the world a taste of the humor which characterizes the whole american people  i was meeting all kinds of distinguished persons in my relation to the magazine and early that winter i met one who remains in my mind above all others a person of distinction he was scarcely a celebrity but he embodied certain social traits which were so characteristic of literary boston that it could not be approached without their recognition the muses have often been acknowledged to be very nice young persons but in boston they were really ladies in boston literature was of good family and good society in a measure it has never been elsewhere it might be said even that reform was of good family in boston and literature and reform equally shared the regard of edmund quincy whose race was one of the most aristocratic in new england i had known him by his novel of wensley it came so near being a firstrate novel and by his life of josiah quincy then a new book but still better by his boston letters to the new york tribune these dealt frankly in the old antislavery days between 1850 and 1860 with other persons of distinction in boston who did not see the right so clearly as quincy did or who at least let their interests darken them to the ugliness of slavery their fault was all the more comical because it was the error of men otherwise so correct of characters so stainless of natures so upright and the quincy letters got out of it all the fun there was in it quincy himself affected me as the finest patrician type i had ever met he was charmingly handsome with a nose of most fit aquilinity smoothshaven lips educated whiskers and perfect glasses his manner was beautiful his voice delightful when at our first meeting he made me his reproaches in terms of lovely kindness for having used in my venetian life the briticism directly for as soon as  lowell once told me that quincy had never had any calling or profession because when he found himself in the enjoyment of a moderate income on leaving college he decided to be simply a gentleman he was too much of a man to be merely that and he was an abolitionist a journalist and for conscience sake a satirist of that political mood of society which he satirized was an eminent man whom it was also my good fortune to meet in my early days in boston and if his great sweetness and kindness had not instantly won my liking i should still have been glad of the glimpse of the older and statelier boston which my slight acquaintance with george ticknor gave me the historian of spanish literature the friend and biographer of prescott and a leading figure of the intellectual society of an epoch already closed dwelt in the fine old square brick mansion which yet stands at the corner of park street and beacon though sunk now to a variety of business uses and lamentably changed in aspect the interior was noble and there was an air of scholarly quiet and of lettered elegance in the library where the host received his guests which seemed to pervade the whole house and which made its appeal to the imagination of one of them most potently it seemed to me that to be master of such circumstance and keeping would be enough of life in a certain way and it all lingers in my memory yet as if it were one with the gentle courtesy which welcomed me  among my fellowguests one night was george s hillard now a faded reputation and even then a life defeated of the high expectation of its youth i do not know whether his six months in italy still keeps itself in print but it was a book once very well known and he was perhaps the more gracious to me as our host was because of our common italian background he was of the old silvergray whig society too and i suppose that order of things imparted its tone to what i felt and saw in that place the civil war had come and gone and that order accepted the result if not with faith then with patience there were two young english noblemen there that night who had been travelling in the south and whose stories of the wretched conditions they had seen moved our host to some open misgiving but the englishmen had no question in spite of all they defended the accomplished fact and when i ventured to say that now at least there could be a hope of better things while the old order was only the perpetuation of despair he mildly assented with a gesture of the hand that waived the point and a deeply sighed perhaps perhaps  he was a presence of great dignity which seemed to recall the past with a steadfast allegiance and yet to relax itself towards the present in the wisdom of the accumulated years his whole life had been passed in devotion to polite literature and in the society of the polite world and he was a type of scholar such as only the circumstances of boston could form those circumstances could alone form such another type as quincy and i wish i could have felt then as i do now the advantage of meeting them so contemporaneously     vii  the historian of spanish literature was an old man nearer eighty than seventy when i saw him and i recall of him personally his dark tint and the scholarly refinement of his cleanshaven face which seemed to me rather english than american in character he was quite exterior to the atlantic group of writers and had no interest in me as one of it literary boston of that day was not a solidarity as i soon perceived and i understood that it was only in my quality of stranger that i saw the different phases of it i should not be just to a vivid phase if i failed to speak of mrs julia ward howe and the impulse of reform which she personified i did not sympathize with this then so much as i do now but i could appreciate it on the intellectual side once many years later i heard mrs howe speak in public and it seemed to me that she made one of the best speeches i had ever heard it gave me for the first time a notion of what women might do in that sort if they entered public life but when we met in those earlier days i was interested in her as perhaps our chief poetess i believe she did not care much to speak of literature she was alert for other meanings in life and i remember how she once brought to book a youthful matron who had perhaps unduly lamented the hardships of housekeeping with the sharp demand child where is your religion after the many years of an acquaintance which had not nearly so many meetings as years it was pleasant to find her at the latest as strenuous as ever for the faith of works and as eager to aid stepniak as john brown in her beautiful old age she survives a certain literary impulse of boston but a still higher impulse of boston she will not survive for that will last while the city endures     viii  the cambridge men were curiously apart from others that formed the great new england group and with whom in my earlier ignorance i had always fancied them mingling now and then i met doctor holmes at longfellows table but not oftener than now and then and i never saw emerson in cambridge at all except at longfellows funeral in my first years on the atlantic i sometimes saw him when he would address me some grave rather retrorsive civilities after i had been newly introduced to him as i had always to be on these occasions i formed the belief that he did not care for me either in my being or doing and i am far from blaming him for that on such points there might easily be two opinions and i was myself often of the mind i imagined in him  if emerson forgot me it was perhaps because i was not of those qualities of things which even then it was said he could remember so much better than things themselves in his later years i sometimes saw him in the boston streets with his beautiful face dreamily set as he moved like one to whose vision         heaven opens inward chasms yawn         vast images in glimmering dawn         half shown are broken and withdrawn  it is known how before the end the eclipse became total and from moment to moment the record inscribed upon his mind was erased some years before he died i sat between him and mrs rose terry cooke at an atlantic breakfast where it was part of my editorial function to preside when he was not asking me who she was i could hear him asking her who i was his great soul worked so independently of memory as we conceive it and so powerfully and essentially that one could not help wondering if after all our personal continuity our identity hereafter was necessarily trammeled up with our enduring knowledge of what happens here his remembrance absolutely ceased with an event and yet his character his personality his identity fully persisted  i do not know whether the things that we printed for emerson after his memory began to fail so utterly were the work of earlier years or not but i know that they were of his best there were certain poems which could not have been more electly more exquisitely his or fashioned with a keener and juster selfcriticism his vision transcended his time so far that some who have tired themselves out in trying to catch up with him have now begun to say that he was no seer at all but i doubt if these form the last court of appeal in his case in manner he was very gentle like all those great new england men but he was cold like many of them to the newcomer or to the oldcomer who came newly as i have elsewhere recorded i once heard him speak critically of hawthorne and once he expressed his surprise at the late flowering brilliancy of holmess gift in the autocrat papers after all his friends supposed it had borne its best fruit but i recall no mention of longfellow or lowell or whittier from him at a dinner where the talk glanced upon walt whitman he turned to me as perhaps representing the interest posterity might take in the matter and referred to whitmans public use of his privately written praise as something altogether unexpected he did not disown it or withdraw it but seemed to feel not indignantly that there had been an abuse of it     ix  the first time i saw whittier was in fieldss room at the publishing office where i had come upon some editorial errand to my chief he introduced me to the poet a tall spare figure in black of quaker cut with a keen cleanshaven face black hair and vivid black eyes it was just after his poem snow bound had made its great success in the modest fashion of those days and had sold not two hundred thousand but twenty thousand and i tried to make him my compliment i contrived to say that i could not tell him how much i liked it and he received the inadequate expression of my feeling with doubtless as much effusion as he would have met something more explicit and abundant if he had judged fit to take my contract off my hands in any way i think he would have been less able to do so than any of his new england contemporaries in him as i have suggested the quaker calm was bound by the frosty puritanic air and he was doubly cold to the touch of the stranger though he would thaw out to old friends and sparkle in laugh and joke i myself never got so far with him as to experience this geniality though afterwards we became such friends as an old man and a young man could be who rarely met our better acquaintance began with some talk at a second meeting about bayard taylors story of kennett which had then lately appeared and which he praised for its fidelity to quaker character in its less amiable aspects no doubt i had made much of my own quaker descent which i felt was one of the few things i had to be proud of and he therefore spoke the more frankly of those traits of brutality into which the primitive sincerity of the sect sometimes degenerated he thought the habit of plainspeaking had to be jealously guarded to keep it from becoming rudespeaking and he matched with stories of his own some things i had heard my father tell of friends in the backwoods who were foes to good manners  whittier was one of the most generous of men towards the work of others especially the work of a new man and if i did anything that he liked i could count upon him for cordial recognition in the quiet of his country home at danvers he apparently read all the magazines and kept himself fully abreast of the literary movement but i doubt if he so fully appreciated the importance of the social movement like some others of the great antislavery men he seemed to imagine that mankind had won itself a clear field by destroying chattel slavery and he had no sympathy with those who think that the man who may any moment be out of work is industrially a slave this is not strange so few men last over from one reform to another that the wonder is that any should not that one should not whittier was prophet for one great need of the divine to man and he spoke his message with a fervor that at times was like the trembling of a flame or the quivering of midsummer sunshine it was hard to associate with the man as one saw him still shy stiff the passion of his verse this imbued not only his antislavery utterances but equally his ballads of the old witch and quaker persecution and flashed a far light into the dimness where his interrogations of mystery pierced whatever doubt there can be of the fate of other new england poets in the great and final account it seems to me that certain of these pieces make his place secure  there is great inequality in his work and i felt this so strongly that when i came to have full charge of the magazine i ventured once to distinguish he sent me a poem and i had the temerity to return it and beg him for something else he magnanimously refrained from all show of offence and after a while when he had printed the poem elsewhere he gave me another by this time i perceived that i had been wrong not as to the poem returned but as to my function regarding him and such as he i had made my reflections and never again did i venture to pass upon what contributors of his quality sent me i took it and printed it and praised the gods and even now i think that with such men it was not my duty to play the censor in the periodical which they had made what it was they had set it in authority over american literature and it was not for me to put myself in authority over them their fame was in their own keeping and it was not my part to guard it against them  after that experience i not only practised an eager acquiescence in their wish to reach the public through the atlantic but i used all the delicacy i was master of in bowing the way to them sometimes my utmost did not avail or more strictly speaking it did not avail in one instance with emerson he had given me upon much entreaty a poem which was one of his greatest and best but the proofreader found a nominative at odds with its verb we had some trouble in reconciling them and some other delays and meanwhile doctor holmes offered me a poem for the same number i now doubted whether i should get emersons poem back in time for it but unluckily the proof did come back in time and then i had to choose between my poets or acquaint them with the state of the case and let them choose what i should do i really felt that doctor holmes had the right to precedence since emerson had withheld his proof so long that i could not count upon it but i wrote to emerson and asked as nearly as i can remember whether he would consent to let me put his poem over to the next number or would prefer to have it appear in the same number with doctor holmess the subjects were cognate and i had my misgivings he wrote me back to return the proofs and break up the forms i could not go to this iconoclastic extreme with the electrotypes of the magazine but i could return the proofs i did so feeling that i had done my possible and silently grieving that there could be such ire in heavenly minds     x  emerson as i say i had once met in cambridge but whittier never and i have a feeling that poet as cambridge felt him to be she had her reservations concerning him i cannot put these into words which would not oversay them but they were akin to those she might have refined upon in regard to mrs stowe neither of these great writers would have appeared to cambridge of the last literary quality their fame was with a world too vast to be the test that her own          one entire and perfect crysolite  would have formed whittier in fact had not arrived at the clear splendor of his later work without some earlier turbidity he was still from time to time capable of a false rhyme like morn and dawn as for the author of uncle toms cabin her syntax was such a snare to her that it sometimes needed the combined skill of all the proofreaders and the assistant editor to extricate her of course nothing was ever written into her work but in changes of diction in correction of solecisms in transposition of phrases the text was largely rewritten on the margin of her proofs the soul of her art was present but the form was so often absent that when it was clothed on anew it would have been hard to say whose cut the garment was of in many places in fact the proofreading of the atlantic monthly was something almost fearfully scrupulous and perfect the proofs were first read by the under proofreader in the printingoffice then the head reader passed them to me perfectly clean as to typography with his own abundant and most intelligent comments on the literature and then i read them making what changes i chose and verifying every quotation every date every geographical and biographical name every foreign word to the last accent every technical and scientific term where it was possible or at all desirable the proof was next submitted to the author when it came back to me i revised it accepting or rejecting the authors judgment according as he was entitled by his ability and knowledge or not to have them the proof now went to the printers for correction they sent it again to the head reader who carefully revised it and returned it again to me i read it a second time and it was again corrected after this it was revised in the office and sent to the stereotyper from whom it came to the head reader for a last revision in the plates  it would not do to say how many of the first american writers owed their correctness in print to the zeal of our proofreading but i may say that there were very few who did not owe something the wisest and ablest were the most patient and grateful like mrs stowe under correction it was only the beginners and the more ignorant who were angry and almost always the proofreading editor had his way on disputed points i look back now with respectful amazement at my proficiency in detecting the errors of the great as well as the little i was able to discover mistakes even in the classical quotations of the deeply lettered sumner and i remember in the earliest years of my service on the atlantic waiting in this statesmans study amidst the prints and engravings that attested his personal resemblance to edmund burke with his proofs in my hand and my heart in my mouth to submit my doubts of his latinity i forget how he received them but he was not a very gracious person  mrs stowe was a gracious person and carried into age the inalienable charm of a woman who must have been very charming earlier i met her only at the fieldses in boston where one night i witnessed a controversy between her and doctor holmes concerning homoeopathy and allopathy which lasted well through dinner after this lapse of time i cannot tell how the affair ended but i feel sure of the liking with which mrs stowe inspired me there was something very simple very motherly in her and something divinely sincere she was quite the person to take au grand serieux the monstrous imaginations of lady byrons jealousy and to feel it on her conscience to make public report of them when she conceived that the time had come to do so  in francis parkman i knew much later than in some others a differentiation of the new england type which was not less characteristic he like so many other boston men of letters was of patrician family and of those easy fortunes which clio prefers her sons to be of but he paid for these advantages by the suffering in which he wrought at what is i suppose our greatest history he wrought at it piecemeal and sometimes only by moments when the terrible head aches which tormented him and the disorder of the heart which threatened his life allowed him a brief respite for the task which was dear to him he must have been more than a quarter of a century in completing it and in this time as he once told me it had given him a daylaborers wages but of course money was the least return he wished from it i read the regularly successive volumes of the jesuits in north america the old regime in canada the wolfe and montcalm and the others that went to make up the whole history with a sufficiently noisy enthusiasm and our acquaintance began by his expressing his gratification with the praises of them that i had put in print we entered into relations as contributor and editor and i know that he was pleased with my eagerness to get as many detachable chapters from the book in hand as he could give me for the magazine but he was of too fine a politeness to make this the occasion of his first coming to see me he had walked out to cambridge where i then lived in pursuance of a regimen which i believe finally built up his health that it was unsparing i can testify from my own share in one of his constitutionals in boston many years later  his experience in laying the groundwork for his history and his researches in making it thorough were such as to have liberated him to the knowledge of other manners and ideals but he remained strictly a bostonian and as immutably of the boston social and literary faith as any i knew in that capital of accomplished facts he had lived like an indian among the wild western tribes he consorted with the canadian archaeologists in their mousings among the colonial archives of their fallen state every year he went to quebec or paris to study the history of new france in the original documents european society was open to him everywhere but he had those limitations which i nearly always found in the boston men i remember his talking to me of the rise of silas lapham in a somewhat troubled and uncertain strain and interpreting his rise as the achievement of social recognition without much or at all liking it or me for it i did not think it my part to point out that i had supposed the rise to be a moral one and later i fell under his condemnation for certain high crimes and misdemeanors i had been guilty of against a wellknown ideal in fiction these in fact constituted lesemajesty of romanticism which seemed to be disproportionately dear to a man who was in his own way trying to tell the truth of human nature as i was in mine his displeasures passed however and my last meeting with our greatest historian as i think him was of unalloyed friendliness he came to me during my final year in boston for nothing apparently but to tell me of his liking for a book of mine describing boylife in southern ohio a halfcentury ago he wished to talk about many points of this which he found the same as his own boylife in the neighborhood of boston and we could agree that the life of the anglosaxon boy was pretty much the same everywhere he had helped himself into my apartment with a crutch but i do not remember how he had fallen lame it was the end of his long walks i believe and not long afterwards i had the grief to read of his death i noticed that perhaps through his enforced quiet he had put on weight his fine face was full whereas when i first knew him he was almost delicately thin of figure and feature he was always of a distinguished presence and his face had a great distinction  it had not the appealing charm i found in the face of james parton another historian i knew earlier in my boston days i cannot say how much his books once so worthily popular are now known but i have an abiding sense of their excellence i have not read the life of voltaire which was the last but all the rest from the first i have read and if there are better american biographies than those of franklin or of jefferson i could not say where to find them the greeley and the burr were younger books and so was the jackson and they were not nearly so good but to all the author had imparted the valuable humanity in which he abounded he was never of the fine world of literature the world that sniffs and sneers and abashes the simplerhearted reader but he was a true artist and english born as he was he divined american character as few americans have done he was a man of eminent courage and in the days when to be an agnostic was to be almost an outcast he had the heart to say of the mysteries that he did not know he outlived the condemnation that this brought and i think that no man ever came near him without in some measure loving him to me he was of a most winning personality which his strong gentle face expressed and a cast in the eye which he could not bring to bear directly upon his visavis endeared i never met him without wishing more of his company for he seldom failed to say something to whatever was most humane and most modern in me our last meeting was at newburyport whither he had long before removed from new york and where in the serene atmosphere of the ancient puritan town he found leisure and inspiration for his work he was not then engaged upon any considerable task and he had aged and broken somewhat but the old geniality the old warmth glowed in him and made a summer amidst the storm of snow that blinded the wintry air without a new light had then lately come into my life by which i saw all things that did not somehow tell for human brotherhood dwarfish and ugly and he listened as i imagined to what i had to say with the tolerant sympathy of a man who has been a long time thinking those things and views with a certain amusement the zeal of the fresh discoverer  there was yet another historian in boston whose acquaintance i made later than either parkmans or partons and whose very recent death leaves me with the grief of a friend no ones indeed could meet john codman ropes without wishing to be his friend or without finding a friend in him he had his likes and his dislikes but he could have had no enmities except for evil and meanness i never knew a man of higher soul of sweeter nature and his whole life was a monument of character it cannot wound him now to speak of the cruel deformity which came upon him in his boyhood and haunted all his after days with suffering his gentle face showed the pain which is always the part of the hunchback but nothing else in him confessed a sense of his affliction and the resolute activity of his mind denied it in every way he was as is well known a very able lawyer in full practice while he was making his studies of military history and winning recognition for almost unique insight and thoroughness in that direction though i believe that when he came to embody the results in those extraordinary volumes recording the battles of our civil war he retired from the law in some measure he knew these battles more accurately than the generals who fought them and he was of a like proficiency in the european wars from the time of napoleon down to our own time i have heard a story which i cannot vouch for that when foreknowledge of his affliction at the outbreak of our civil war forbade him to be a soldier he became a student of soldiership and wreaked in that sort the passion of his most gallant spirit but whether this was true or not it is certain that he pursued the study with a devotion which never blinded him to the atrocity of war some wars he could excuse and even justify but for any war that seemed wanton or aggressive he had only abhorrence  the last summer of a score that i had known him we sat on the veranda of his cottage at york harbor and looked out over the moonlit sea and he talked of the high and true things with the inextinguishable zest for the inquiry which i always found in him though he was then feeling the approaches of the malady which was so soon to end all groping in these shadows for him he must have faced the fact with the same courage and the same trust with which he faced all facts from the first i found him a deeply religious man not only in the ecclesiastical sense but in the more mystical meanings of the word and he kept his faith as he kept his youth to the last every one who knew him knows how young he was in heart and how he liked to have those that were young in years about him he wished to have his house in boston as well as his cottage at york full of young men and young girls whose joy of life he made his own and whose society he preferred to his contemporaries one could not blame him for that or for seeking the sun wherever he could but it would be a false notion of him to suppose that his sympathies were solely or chiefly with the happy in every sort as i knew him he was fine and good the word is not worthy of him after some of its uses and associations but if it were unsmutched by these and whitened to its primitive significance i should say he was one of the most perfect gentlemen i ever knew     etext editors bookmarks     celia thaxter    charles f browne    dawn upon him through a cloud of
