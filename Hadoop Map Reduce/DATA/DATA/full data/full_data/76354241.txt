76354241	queen shebas ring  by h rider haggard     chapter i  the coming of the ring  every one has read the monograph i believe that is the right word of my dear friend professor higgsptolemy higgs to give him his full namedescriptive of the tableland of mur in north central africa of the ancient underground city in the mountains which surrounded it and of the strange tribe of abyssinian jews or rather their mixed descendants by whom it is or was inhabited i say every one advisedly for although the public which studies such works is usually select that which will take an interest in them if the character of a learned and pugnacious personage is concerned is very wide indeed not to mince matters i may as well explain what i mean at once  professor higgss rivals and enemies of whom either the brilliancy of his achievements or his somewhat abrupt and pointed methods of controversy seem to have made him a great many have risen up or rather seated themselves and written him downwell an individual who strains the truth indeed only this morning one of these inquired in a letter to the press alluding to some adventurous traveller who i am told lectured to the british association several years ago whether professor higgs did not in fact ride across the desert to mur not upon a camel as he alleged but upon a land tortoise of extraordinary size  the innuendo contained in this epistle has made the professor who as i have already hinted is not by nature of a meek disposition extremely angry indeed notwithstanding all that i could do he left his london house under an hour ago with a whip of hippopotamus hide such as the egyptians call a koorbash purposing to avenge himself upon the person of his defamer in order to prevent a public scandal however i have taken the liberty of telephoning to that gentleman who bold and vicious as he may be in print is physically small and i should say of a timid character to get out of the way at once to judge from the abrupt fashion in which our conversation came to an end i imagine that the hint has been taken at any rate i hope for the best and as an extra precaution have communicated with the lawyers of my justly indignant friend  the reader will now probably understand that i am writing this book not to bring myself or others before the public or to make money of which i have no present need or for any purpose whatsoever except to set down the bare and actual truth in fact so many rumours are flying about as to where we have been and what befell us that this has become almost necessary as soon as i laid down that cruel column of gibes and insinuations to which i have alludedyes this very morning before breakfast this conviction took hold of me so strongly that i cabled to oliver captain oliver orme the hero of my history if it has any particular hero who is at present engaged upon what must be an extremely agreeable journey round the worldasking his consent ten minutes since the answer arrived from tokyo here it is  do what you like and think necessary but please alter all names et cetera as propose returning via america and fear interviewers japan jolly place then follows some private matter which i need not insert oliver is always extravagant where cablegrams are concerned  i suppose that before entering on this narration for the readers benefit i had better give some short description of myself  my name is richard adams and i am the son of a cumberland yeoman who married a welshwoman therefore i have celtic blood in my veins which perhaps accounts for my love of roving and other things i am now an old man near the end of my course i suppose at any rate i was sixtyfive last birthday this is my appearance as i see it in the glass before me tall spare i dont weigh more than a hundred and forty poundsthe desert has any superfluous flesh that i ever owned my lot having been like falstaff to lard the lean earth but in a hot climate my eyes are brown my face is long and i wear a pointed white beard which matches the white hair above  truth compels me to add that my general appearance as seen in that glass which will not lie reminds me of that of a rather aged goat indeed to be frank by the natives among whom i have sojourned and especially among the khalifas people when i was a prisoner there i have often been called the white goat  of my very commonplace outward self let this suffice as for my record i am a doctor of the old school think of it when i was a student at barts the antiseptic treatment was quite a new thing and administered when at all by help of a kind of engine on wheels out of which disinfectants were dispensed with a pump much as the advanced gardener sprays a greenhouse today  i succeeded above the average as a student and in my early time as a doctor but in every mans life there happen things which whatever excuses may be found for them would not look particularly well in cold print nobodys record as understood by convention and the pharisee could really stand cold print also something in my blood made me its servant in short having no strict ties at home and desiring to see the world i wandered far and wide for many years earning my living as i went never in my experience a difficult thing to do for i was always a master of my trade  my fortieth birthday found me practising at cairo which i mention only because it was here that first i met ptolemy higgs who even then in his youth was noted for his extraordinary antiquarian and linguistic abilities i remember that in those days the joke about him was that he could swear in fifteen languages like a native and in thirtytwo with common proficiency and could read hieroglyphics as easily as a bishop reads the times  well i doctored him through a bad attack of typhoid but as he had spent every farthing he owned on scarabs or something of the sort made him no charge this little kindness i am bound to say he never forgot for whatever his failings may be personally i would not trust him alone with any object that was more than a thousand years old ptolemy is a good and faithful friend  in cairo i married a copt she was a lady of high descent the tradition in her family being that they were sprung from one of the ptolemaic pharaohs which is possible and even probable enough also she was a christian and well educated in her way but of course she remained an oriental and for a european to marry an oriental is as i have tried to explain to others a very dangerous thing especially if he continues to live in the east where it cuts him off from social recognition and intimacy with his own race still although this step of mine forced me to leave cairo and go to assouan then a littleknown place to practise chiefly among the natives god knows we were happy enough together till the plague took her and with it my joy in life  i pass over all that business since there are some things too dreadful and too sacred to write about she left me one child a son who to fill up my cup of sorrow when he was twelve years of age was kidnapped by the mardis people  this brings me to the real story there is nobody else to write it oliver will not higgs cannot outside of anything learned and antiquarian he is hopeless so i must at any rate if it is not interesting the fault will be mine not that of the story which in all conscience is strange enough    we are now in the middle of june and it was a year ago last december that on the evening of the day of my arrival in london after an absence of half a lifetime i found myself knocking at the door of professor higgss rooms in guildford street wc it was opened by his housekeeper mrs reid a thin and saturnine old woman who reminded and still reminds me of a reanimated mummy she told me that the professor was in but had a gentleman to dinner and suggested sourly that i should call again the next morning with difficulty i persuaded her at last to inform her master that an old egyptian friend had brought him something which he certainly would like to see  five minutes later i groped my way into higgss sittingroom which mrs reid had contented herself with indicating from a lower floor it is a large room running the whole width of the house divided into two by an arch where once in the georgian days there had been folding doors the place was in shadow except for the firelight which shone upon a table laid ready for dinner and upon an extraordinary collection of antiquities including a couple of mummies with gold faces arranged in their coffins against the wall at the far end of the room however an electric lamp was alight in the bowwindow hanging over another table covered with books and by it i saw my host whom i had not met for twenty years although until i vanished into the desert we frequently corresponded and with him the friend who had come to dinner  first i will describe higgs who i may state is admitted even by his enemies to be one of the most learned antiquarians and greatest masters of dead languages in europe though this no one would guess from his appearance at the age of about fortyfive in build short and stout face round and highcoloured hair and beard of a fiery red eyes when they can be seenfor generally he wears a pair of large blue spectaclessmall and of an indefinite hue but sharp as needles dress so untidy peculiar and worn that it is said the police invariably request him to move on should he loiter in the streets at night such was and is the outward seeming of my dearest friend professor ptolemy higgs and i only hope that he wont be offended when he sees it set down in black and white  that of his companion who was seated at the table his chin resting on his hand listening to some erudite discourse with a rather distracted air was extraordinarily different especially by contrast a tall wellmade young man rather thin but broadshouldered and apparently five or six and twenty years of age face cleancutso much so indeed that the dark eyes alone relieved it from a suspicion of hardness hair short and straight like the eyes brown expression that of a man of thought and ability and when he smiled singularly pleasant such was and is captain oliver orme who by the way i should explain is only a captain of some volunteer engineers although in fact a very able soldier as was proved in the south african war whence he had then but lately returned  i ought to add also that he gave me the impression of a man not in love with fortune or rather of one with whom fortune was not in love indeed his young face seemed distinctly sad perhaps it was this that attracted me to him so much from the first moment that my eyes fell on himme with whom fortune had also been out of love for many years  while i stood contemplating this pair higgs looking up from the papyrus or whatever it might be that he was reading i gathered later that he had spent the afternoon in unrolling a mummy and was studying its spoils caught sight of me standing in the shadow  who the devil are you he exclaimed in a shrill and strident voice for it acquires that quality when he is angry or alarmed and what are you doing in my room  steady said his companion your housekeeper told you that some friend of yours had come to call  oh yes so she did only i cant remember any friend with a face and beard like a goat advance friend and alls well  so i stepped into the shining circle of the electric light and halted again  who is it who is it muttered higgs the face is the face ofofi have itof old adams only hes been dead these ten years the khalifa got him they said antique shade of the longlost adams please be so good as to tell me your name for we waste time over a useless mystery  there is no need higgs since it is in your mouth already well i should have known you anywhere but then your hair doesnt go white  not it too much colouring matter direct result of a sanguine disposition well adamsfor adams you must bei am really delighted to see you especially as you never answered some questions in my last letter as to where you got those first dynasty scarabs of which the genuineness i may tell you has been disputed by certain envious beasts adams my dear old fellow welcome a thousand timesand he seized my hands and wrung them adding as his eye fell upon a ring i wore why whats that something quite unusual but never mind you shall tell me after dinner let me introduce you to my friend captain orme a very decent scholar of arabic with a quite elementary knowledge of egyptology  mr orme interrupted the younger man bowing to me  oh well mr or captain whichever you like he means that he is not in the regular army although he has been all through the boer war and wounded three times once straight through the lungs heres the soup mrs reid lay another place i am dreadfully hungry nothing gives me such an appetite as unrolling mummies it involves so much intellectual wear and tear in addition to the physical labour eat man eat we will talk afterwards  so we ate higgs largely for his appetite was always excellent perhaps because he was then practically a teetotaller mr orme very moderately and i as becomes a person who has lived for months at a time on datesmainly of vegetables which with fruits form my principal dietthat is if these are available for at a pinch i can exist on anything  when the meal was finished and our glasses had been filled with port higgs helped himself to water lit the large meerschaum pipe he always smokes and pushed round the tobaccojar which had once served as a sepulchural urn for the heart of an old egyptian  now adams he said when we also had filled our pipes tell us what has brought you back from the shades in short your story man your story  i drew the ring he had noticed off my hand a thick band of rather lightcoloured gold of a size such as an ordinary woman might wear upon her first or second finger in which was set a splendid slab of sapphire engraved with curious and archaic characters pointing to these characters i asked higgs if he could read them  read them of course he answered producing a magnifying glass cant you no i remember you never were good at anything more than fifty years old hullo this is early hebrew ah ive got it and he read  the gift of solomon the rulerno the great oneof israel beloved of jah to maqueda of shebaland queen daughter of kings child of wisdom beautiful  thats the writing on your ring adamsa really magnificent thing queen of shebabathmelachim daughter of kings with our old friend solomon chucked in splendid quite splendidand he touched the gold with his tongue and tested it with his teeth humwhere did you get this intelligent fraud from adams  oh i answered laughing the usual thing of course i bought it from a donkeyboy in cairo for about thirty shillings  indeed he replied suspiciously i should have thought the stone in it was worth more than that although of course it may be nothing but glass the engraving too is firstrate adams he added with severity you are trying to hoax us but let me tell you what i thought you knew by this timethat you cant take in ptolemy higgs this ring is a shameless swindle but who did the hebrew on it hes a good scholar anyway  dont know i answered wasnt aware till now that it was hebrew to tell you the truth i thought it was old egyptian all i do know is that it was given or rather lent to me by a lady whose title is walda nagasta and who is supposed to be a descendant of solomon and the queen of sheba  higgs took up the ring and looked at it again then as though in a fit of abstraction slipped it into his waistcoat pocket  i dont want to be rude therefore i will not contradict you he answered with a kind of groan or indeed say anything except that if any one else had spun me that yarn i should have told him he was a common liar but of course as every schoolboy knows walda nagastathat is child of kings in ethiopicis much the same as bathmelachimthat is daughter of kings in hebrew  here captain orme burst out laughing and remarked it is easy to see why you are not altogether popular in the antiquarian world higgs your methods of controversy are those of a savage with a stone axe  if you only open your mouth to show your ignorance oliver you had better keep it shut the men who carried stone axes had advanced far beyond the state of savagery but i suggest that you had better give doctor adams a chance of telling his story after which you can criticize  perhaps captain orme does not wish to be bored with it i said whereon he answered at once  on the contrary i should like to hear it very muchthat is if you are willing to confide in me as well as in higgs  i reflected a moment since to tell the truth for sundry reasons my intention had been to trust no one except the professor whom i knew to be as faithful as he is rough yet some instinct prompted me to make an exception in favour of this captain orme i liked the man there was something about those brown eyes of his that appealed to me also it struck me as odd that he should happen to be present on this occasion for i have always held that there is nothing casual or accidental in the world that even the most trivial circumstances are either ordained or the result of the workings of some inexorable law whereof the end is known by whatever power may direct our steps though it be not yet declared  certainly i am willing i answered your face and your friendship with the professor are passport enough for me only i must ask you to give me your word of honour that without my leave you will repeat nothing of what i am about to tell you  of course he answered whereon higgs broke in  there that will do you dont want us both to kiss the book do you who sold you that ring and where have you been for the last dozen years and whence do you come now  i have been a prisoner of the khalifas among other things i had five years of that entertainment of which my back would give some evidence if i were to strip i think i am about the only man who never embraced islam whom they allowed to live and that was because i am a doctor and therefore a useful person the rest of the time i have spent wandering about the north african deserts looking for my son roderick you remember the boy or should for you are his godfather and i used to send you photographs of him as a little chap  of course of course said the professor in a new tone i came across a christmas letter from him the other day but my dear adams what happened i never heard  he went up the river to shoot crocodiles against my orders when he was about twelve years oldnot very long after his mothers death and some wandering mahdi tribesmen kidnapped him and sold him as a slave i have been looking for him ever since for the poor boy was passed on from tribe to tribe among which his skill as a musician enabled me to follow him the arabs call him the singer of egypt because of his wonderful voice and it seems that he has learned to play upon their native instruments  and now where is he asked higgs as one who feared the answer  he is or was a favourite slave among a barbarous halfnegroid people called the fung who dwell in the far interior of north central africa after the fall of the khalifa i followed him there it took me several years some bedouin were making an expedition to trade with these fung and i disguised myself as one of them  on a certain night we camped at the foot of a valley outside a great wall which encloses the holy place where their idol is i rode up to this wall and through the open gateway heard some one with a beautiful tenor voice singing in english what he sang was a hymn that i had taught my son it begins  abide with me fast falls the eventide  i knew the voice again i dismounted and slipped through the gateway and presently came to an open space where a young man sat singing upon a sort of raised bench with lamps on either side of him and a large audience in front i saw his face and notwithstanding the turban which he wore and his eastern robeyes and the passage of all those yearsi knew it for that of my son some spirit of madness entered into me and i called aloud roderick roderick and he started up staring about him wildly the audience started up also and one of them caught sight of me lurking in the shadow  with a howl of rage for i had desecrated their sanctuary they sprang at me to save my life coward that i was i fled back through the gates yes after all those years of seeking still i fled rather than die and though i was wounded with a spear and stones managed to reach and spring upon my horse then as i was headed off from our camp i galloped away anywhere still to save my miserable life from those savages so strongly is the instinct of selfpreservation implanted in us from a distance i looked back and saw by the light of the fired tents that the fung were attacking the arabs with whom i had travelled i suppose because they thought them parties to the sacrilege afterwards i heard that they killed them every one poor men but i escaped who unwittingly had brought their fate upon them  on and on i galloped up a steep road i remember hearing lions roaring round me in the darkness i remember one of them springing upon my horse and the poor beasts scream then i remember no more till i found myselfi believe it was a week or so laterlying on the verandah of a nice house and being attended by some goodlooking women of an abyssinian cast of countenance  sounds rather like one of the lost tribes of israel remarked higgs sarcastically puffing at his big meerschaum  yes something of that sort the details i will give you later the main facts are that these people who picked me up outside their gates are called abati live in a town called mur and allege themselves to be descended from a tribe of abyssinian jews who were driven out and migrated to this place four or five centuries ago briefly they look something like jews practise a very debased form of the jewish religion are civilized and clever after a fashion but in the last stage of decadence from interbreedingabout nine thousand men is their total fighting force although three or four generations ago they had twenty thousandand live in hourly terror of extermination by the surrounding fung who hold them in hereditary hate as the possessors of the wonderful mountain fortress that once belonged to their forefathers  gibraltar and spain over again suggested orme  yes with this differencethat the position is reversed the abati of this central african gibraltar are decaying and the fung who answer to the spaniards are vigorous and increasing  well what happened asked the professor  nothing particular i tried to persuade these abati to organize an expedition to rescue my son but they laughed in my face by degrees i found out that there was only one person among them who was worth anything at all and she happened to be their hereditary ruler who bore the highsounding titles of walda nagasta or child of kings and takla warda or bud of the rose a very handsome and spirited young woman whose personal name is maqueda  one of the names of the first known queens of sheba muttered higgs the other was belchis  under pretence of attending her medically i went on for otherwise their wretched etiquette would scarcely have allowed me access to one so exalted i talked things over with her she told me that the idol of the fung is fashioned like a huge sphinx or so i gathered from her description of the thing for i have never seen it  what exclaimed higgs jumping up a sphinx in north central africa well after all why not some of the earlier pharaohs are said to have had dealings with that part of the world or even to have migrated from it i think that the makreezi repeats the legend i suppose that it is ramheaded  she told me also i continued that they have a tradition or rather a belief which amounts to an article of faith that if this sphinx or god which by the way is lion not ramheaded and is called harmac  harmac interrupted higgs again that is one of the names of the sphinxharmachis god of dawn  if this god i repeated should be destroyed the nation of the fung whose forefathers fashioned it as they say must move away from that country across the great river which lies to the south i have forgotten its name at the moment but i think it must be a branch of the nile  i suggested to her that in the circumstances her people had better try to destroy the idol maqueda laughed and said it was impossible since the thing was the size of a small mountain adding that the abati had long ago lost all courage and enterprise and were content to sit in their fertile and mountainringed land feeding themselves with tales of departed grandeur and struggling for rank and highsounding titles till the day of doom overtook them  i inquired whether she were also content and she replied certainly not but what could she do to regenerate her people she who was nothing but a woman and the last of an endless line of rulers  rid me of the fung she added passionately and i will give you such a reward as you never dreamed the old cavecity yonder is full of treasure that was buried with its ancient kings long before we came to mur to us it is useless since we have none to trade with but i have heard that the peoples of the outside world worship gold  i do not want gold i answered i want to rescue my son who is a prisoner yonder  then said the child of kings you must begin by helping us to destroy the idol of the fung are there no means by which this can be done  there are means i replied and i tried to explain to her the properties of dynamite and of other more powerful explosives  go to your own land she exclaimed eagerly and return with that stuff and two or three who can manage it and i swear to them all the wealth of mur thus only can you win my help to save your son  well what was the end asked captain orme  this they gave me some gold and an escort with camels which were literally lowered down a secret path in the mountains so as to avoid the fung who ring them in and of whom they are terribly afraid with these people i crossed the desert to assouan in safety a journey of many weeks where i left them encamped about sixteen days ago bidding them await my return i arrived in england this morning and as soon as i could ascertain that you still lived and your address from a book of reference called whos who which they gave me in the hotel i came on here  why did you come to me what do you want me to do asked the professor  i came to you higgs because i know how deeply you are interested in anything antiquarian and because i wished to give you the first opportunity not only of winning wealth but also of becoming famous as the discoverer of the most wonderful relics of antiquity that are left in the world  with a very good chance of getting my throat cut thrown in grumbled higgs  as to what i want you to do i went on i want you to find someone who understands explosives and will undertake the business of blowing up the fung idol  well thats easy enough anyhow said the professor pointing to captain orme with the bowl of his pipe and adding he is an engineer by education a soldier and a very fair chemist also he knows arabic and was brought up in egypt as a boyjust the man for the job if he will go  i reflected a moment then obeying some sort of instinct looked up and asked  will you captain orme if terms can be arranged  yesterday he replied colouring a little i should have answered certainly not today i answer that i am prepared to consider the matterthat is if higgs will go too and you can enlighten me on certain points but i warn you that i am only an amateur in the three trades that the professor has mentioned though it is true one with some experience  would it be rude to inquire captain orme why twentyfour hours have made such a difference in your views and plans  not rude only awkward he replied colouring again this time more deeply still as it is best to be frank i will tell you yesterday i believed myself to be the inheritor of a very large fortune from an uncle whose fatal illness brought me back from south africa before i meant to come and as whose heir i have been brought up today i have learned for the first time that he married secretly last year a woman much below him in rank and has left a child who of course will take all his property as he died intestate but that is not all yesterday i believed myself to be engaged to be married today i am undeceived upon that point also the lady he added with some bitterness who was willing to marry anthony ormes heir is no longer willing to marry oliver orme whose total possessions amount to under £10000 well small blame to her or to her relations whichever it may be especially as i understand that she has a better alliance in view certainly her decision has simplified matters and he rose and walked to the other end of the room  shocking business whispered higgs been infamously treated and he proceeded to express his opinion of the lady concerned of her relatives and of the late anthony orme shipowner in language that if printed would render this history unfit for family reading the outspokenness of professor higgs is well known in the antiquarian world so there is no need for me to enlarge upon it  what i do not exactly understand adams he added in a loud voice seeing that orme had turned again and what i think we should both like to know is your exact object in making these proposals  i am afraid i have explained myself badly i thought i had made it clear that i have only one objectto attempt the rescue of my son if he still lives as i believe he does higgs put yourself in my position imagine yourself with nothing and no one left to care for except a single child and that child stolen away from you by savages imagine yourself after years of search hearing his very voice seeing his very face adult now but the same the thing you had dreamed of and desired for years that for which you would have given a thousand lives if you could have had time to think and then the rush of the howling fantastic mob the breakdown of courage of love of everything that is noble under the pressure of primæval instinct which has but one songsave your life lastly imagine this coward saved dwelling within a few miles of the son whom he had deserted and yet utterly unable to rescue or even to communicate with him because of the poltroonery of those among whom he had refuged  well grunted higgs i have imagined all that highfaluting lot what of it if you mean that you are to blame i dont agree with you you wouldnt have helped your son by getting your own throat cut and perhaps his also  i dont know i answered i have brooded over the thing so long that it seems to me that i have disgraced myself well there came a chance and i took it this lady walda nagasta or maqueda who i think had also brooded over things made me an offeri fancy without the knowledge or consent of her council help me she said and i will help you save my people and i will try to save your son i can pay for your services and those of any whom you may bring with you  i answered that it was hopeless as no one would believe the tale whereon she drew from her finger the thronering or state signet which you have in your pocket higgs saying my mothers have worn this since the days of maqueda queen of sheba if there are learned men among your people they will read her name upon it and know that i speak no lie take it as a token and take also enough of our gold to buy the stuffs whereof you speak which hide fires that can throw mountains skyward and the services of skilled and trusty men who are masters of the stuff two or three of them only for more cannot be transported across the desert and come back to save your son and me thats all the story higgs will you take the business on or shall i try elsewhere you must make up your mind because i have no time to lose if i am to get into mur again before the rains  got any of that gold you spoke of about you asked the professor  i drew a skin bag from the pocket of my coat and poured some out upon the table which he examined carefully  ring money he said presently might be anglosaxon might be anything date absolutely uncertain but from its appearance i should say slightly alloyed with silver yes there is a bit which has oxydizedundoubtedly old that  then he produced the signet from his pocket and examined the ring and the stone very carefully through a powerful glass  seems all right he said and although i have been greened in my time i dont make many mistakes nowadays what do you say adams must have it back a sacred trust only lent to you all right take it by all means i dont want the thing well it is a risky job and if any one else had proposed it to me id have told him to go tomur but adams my boy you saved my life once and never sent in a bill because i was hard up and i havent forgotten that also things are pretty hot for me here just now over a certain controversy of which i suppose you havent heard in central africa i think ill go what do you say oliver  oh said captain orme waking up from a reverie if you are satisfied i am it doesnt matter to me where i go    chapter ii  the advice of sergeant quick  at this moment a fearful hubbub arose without the front door slammed a cab drove off furiously a policemans whistle blew heavy feet were heard trampling then came an invocation of in the kings name answered by yes and the queens and the rest of the royal familys and if you want it take it you chuckleheaded flatfooted potbellied peelers  then followed tumult indescribable as of heavy men and things rolling down the stairs with cries of fear and indignation  what the dickens is that asked higgs  the voice sounded like that of samueli mean sergeant quick answered captain orme with evident alarm what can he be after oh i know it is something to do with that infernal mummy you unwrapped this afternoon and asked him to bring round after dinner  just then the door burst open and a tall soldierlike form stalked in carrying in his arms a corpse wrapped in a sheet which he laid upon the table among the wine glasses  im sorry captain he said addressing orme but ive lost the head of the departed i think it is at the bottom of the stairs with the police had nothing else to defend myself with sir against their unwarranted attacks so brought the body to the present and charged thinking it very stiff and strong but regret to say neck snapped and that deceaseds head is now under arrest  as sergeant quick finished speaking the door opened again and through it appeared two very flurried and dishevelled policemen one of whom held as far as possible from his person the grizzly head of a mummy by the long hair which still adhered to the skull  what do you mean by breaking into my rooms like this wheres your warrant asked the indignant higgs in his high voice  there answered the first policeman pointing to the sheetwrapped form on the table  and here added the second holding up the awful head as in duty bound we ask explanation from that man of the secret conveyance of a corpse through the open streets whereon he assaults us with the same for which assault pending investigation of the corpse i arrest him now guvnor addressing sergeant quick will you come along with us quietly or must we take you  the sergeant who seemed to be inarticulate with wrath made a dash for the shrouded object on the table with the intention apparently of once more using it as a weapon of offence and the policemen drew their batons  stop said orme thrusting himself between the combatants are you all mad do you know that this woman died about four thousand years ago  oh lord said the policeman who held the head addressing his companion it must be one of them mummies what they dig up in the british museum seems pretty ancient and spicy dont it and he sniffed at the head then set it down upon the table  explanations followed and after the wounded dignity of the two officers of the force had been soothed with sundry glasses of port wine and a written list of the names of all concerned including that of the mummy they departed  you take my advice bobbies i heard the indignant sergeant declaim outside the door and dont you believe things is always what they seem a party aint necessarily drunk because he rolls about and falls down in the street he may be mad or ungry or epileptic and a body aint always a body jest because its dead and cold and stiff why men as youve seen it may be a mummy which is quite a different thing if i was to put on that blue coat of yours would that make me a policeman good heavens i should hope not for the sake of the army to which i still belong being in the reserve what you bobbies need is to study human nature and cultivate observation which will learn you the difference between a newlaid corpse and a mummy and many other things now you lay my words to heart and youll both of you rise to superintendents instead of running in daily drunks until you retire on a pension goodnight  peace having been restored and the headless mummy removed into the professors bedroom since captain orme declared that he could not talk business in the presence of a body however ancient we resumed our discussion first of all at higgss suggestion i drew up a brief memorandum of agreement which set out the objects of the expedition and provided for the equal division amongst us of any profit that might accrue in the event of the death of one or more of us the survivors or survivor to take their or his share  to this arrangement personally i objected who desired neither treasure nor antiquities but only the rescue of my son the others pointed out however that like most people i might in future want something to live on or that if i did not in the event of his escape my boy certainly would so in the end i gave way  then captain orme very sensibly asked for a definition of our respective duties and it was settled that i was to be guide to the expedition higgs antiquarian interpreter and on account of his vast knowledge general referee and captain orme engineer and military commander with the proviso that in the event of a difference of opinion the dissentient was to loyally accept the decision of the majority  this curious document having been copied out fair i signed and passed it to the professor who hesitated a little but after refreshing himself with a further minute examination of shebas ring signed also remarking that he was an infernal fool for his pains and pushed the paper across the table to orme  stop a minute said the captain i forgot something i should like my old servant sergeant quick to accompany us hes a very handy man at a pinch especially if as i understand we are expected to deal with explosives with which he has had a lot to do in the engineers and elsewhere if you agree i will call him and ask if he will go i expect hes somewhere round  i nodded judging from the episode of the mummy and the policeman that the sergeant was likely to be a useful man as i was sitting next to it i opened the door for the captain whereon the erect shape of sergeant quick who had clearly been leaning against it literally fell into the room reminding me much of an overset wooden soldier  hullo said orme as without the slightest change of countenance his retainer recovered himself and stood to attention what the deuce are you doing there  sentry go captain thought the police might change their minds and come back any orders captain  yes i am going to north central africa when can you be ready to start  the brindisi mail leaves tomorrow night captain if you travel by egypt but if you go by tunis 715 am saturday is the time from charing cross only as i understand that high explosives and arms have to be provided these might take awhile to lay in and pack so as to deceive customs  you understand said orme pray how do you understand  doors in these old houses are apt to get away from their frames captain and the gentleman thereand he pointed to the professorhas a voice that carries like a dogwhistle oh no offence sir a clear voice is an excellent thingthat is if the doors fitand although sergeant quicks wooden face did not move i saw his humorous grey eyes twinkle beneath the bushy eyebrows  we burst out laughing including higgs  so you are willing to go said orme but i hope you clearly understand that this is a risky business and that you may not come back  spion kop was a bit risky captain and so was that business in the donga where every one was hit except you and me and the sailor man but we came back for all that begging your pardon captain there aint no such thing as risk man comes here when he must and dies when he must and what he does between dont make a haporth of difference  hear hear i said we are much of the same way of thinking  there have been several who held those views sir since old solomon gave the lady thatand he pointed to shebas ring which was lying on the table but excuse me captain how about local allowances not having been a marrying man myself ive none dependent upon me but as you know ive sisters that have and a soldiers pension goes with him dont think me greedy captain he added hastily but as you gentlemen understand black and white at the beginning saves bother at the endand he pointed to the agreement  quite right what do you want sergeant asked orme  nothing beyond my pay if we get nothing captain but if we get something would five per cent be too much  it might be ten i suggested sergeant quick has a life to lose like the rest of us  thank you kindly sir he answered but that in my opinion would be too much five per cent was what i suggested  so it was written down that sergeant samuel quick was to receive five per cent of the total profits if any provided that he behaved himself and obeyed orders then he also signed the agreement and was furnished with a glass of whisky and water to drink to its good health  now gentlemen he said declining the chair which higgs offered to him apparently because from long custom he preferred his woodensoldier attitude against the wall as a humble fivepercent private in this very adventurous company ill ask permission to say a word  permission was given accordingly and the sergeant proceeded to inquire what weight of rock it was wished to remove  i told him that i did not know as i had never seen the fung idol but i understood that its size was enormous probably as large as st pauls cathedral  which if solid would take some stirring remarked the sergeant dynamite might do it but it is too bulky to be carried across the desert on camels in that quantity captain how about them picrates you remember those new boer shells that blew a lot of us to kingdom come and poisoned the rest  yes answered orme i remember but now they have stronger stuffsazoimides i think they call themterrific new compounds of nitrogen we will inquire tomorrow sergeant  yes captain he answered but the point is wholl pay you cant buy hellfire in bulk for nothing i calculate that allowing for the purchase of the explosives and say fifty military rifles with ammunition and all other necessaries not including camels the outfit of this expedition cant come to less than £1500  i think i have that amount in gold i answered of which the lady of the abati gave me as much as i could carry in comfort  if not said orme although i am a poor man now i could find £500 or so in a pinch so dont let us bother about the money the question isare we all agreed that we will undertake this expedition and see it through to the end whatever that may be  we answered that we were  then has anybody anything more to say  yes i replied i forgot to tell you that if we should ever get to mur none of you must make love to the walda nagasta she is a kind of holy person who can only marry into her own family and to do so might mean that our throats would be cut  do you hear that oliver said the professor i suppose that the doctors warning is meant for you as the rest of us are rather past that kind of thing  indeed replied the captain colouring again after his fashion well to tell you the truth i feel a bit past it myself and so far as i am concerned i dont think we need take the fascinations of this black lady into account  dont brag captain please dont brag said sergeant quick in a hollow whisper woman is just the one thing about which you can never be sure today shes poison and tomorrow honeygod and the climate alone know why please dont brag or we may live to see you crawling after this one on your knees with the gent in the specs behind and samuel quick who hates the whole tribe of them bringing up the rear tempt providence if you like captain but dont tempt woman lest she should turn round and tempt you as she has done before today  will you be so good as to stop talking nonsense and call a cab said captain orme coldly but higgs began to laugh in his rude fashion and i remembering the appearance of bud of the rose when she lifted her veil of ceremony and the soft earnestness of her voice fell into reflection black lady indeed what i wondered would this young gentleman think if ever he should live to set his eyes upon her sweet and comely face  it seemed to me that sergeant quick was not so foolish as his master chose to imagine captain orme undoubtedly was in every way qualified to be a partner in our venture still i could have wished either that he had been an older man or that the lady to whom he was recently affianced had not chosen this occasion to break her engagement in dealing with difficult and dangerous combinations my experience has been that it is always well to eliminate the possibility of a love affair especially in the east    chapter iii  the professor goes out shooting  of all our tremendous journey across the desert until we had passed the forest and reached the plains which surrounded the mountains of mur there are i think but few incidents with which the reader need be troubled the first of these was at assouan where a letter and various telegrams overtook captain orme which as by this time we had become intimate he showed to me they informed him that the clandestine infant whom his uncle left behind him had suddenly sickened and died of some childish ailment so that he was once again heir to the large property which he thought he had lost since the widow only took a life interest in some of the personalty i congratulated him and said i supposed this meant that we should not have the pleasure of his company to mur  why not he asked i said i was going and i mean to go indeed i signed a document to that effect  i daresay i answered but circumstances alter cases if i might say so an adventure that perhaps was good enough for a young and wellborn man of spirit and enterprise without any particular resources is no longer good enough for one who has the ball at his feet think what a ball it is to a man of your birth intelligence record and now great fortune come to you in youth why with these advantages there is absolutely nothing that you cannot do in england you can go into parliament and rule the country if you like you can become a peer you can marry any one who isnt of the blood royal in short with uncommonly little effort of your own your career is made for you dont throw away a silver spoon like that in order perhaps to die of thirst in the desert or be killed in a fight among unknown tribes  oh i dont know he answered i never set heart much on spoons silver or other when i lost this one i didnt cry and now that i have found it again i shant sing anyway i am going on with you and you cant prevent me under the agreement only as i have got such a lot to leave i suppose i had better make a will first and post it home which is a bore  just then the professor came in followed by an arab thief of a dealer with whom he was trying to bargain for some object of antiquity when the dealer had been ejected and the position explained to him higgs who whatever may be his failings in small matters is unselfish enough in big ones said that he agreed with me and thought that under the circumstances in his own interest orme ought to leave us and return home  you may save your breath old fellow answered the captain for this reason if for no other and he threw him a letter across the table which letter i saw afterwards to be brief it was from the young lady to whom he had been engaged to be married and who on his loss of fortune had jilted him now she seemed to have changed her mind again and although she did not mention the matter it is perhaps not uncharitable to suppose that the news of the death of the inconvenient child had something to do with her decision  have you answered this asked higgs  no answered orme setting his mouth i have not answered and i am not going to answer it either in writing or in person i intend to start tomorrow for mur and to travel as far on that road as it pleases fate to allow and now i am going to look at the rock sculptures by the cataract  well thats flat said higgs after he had departed and for my part i am glad of it for somehow i think he will be a useful man among those fung also if he went i expect that the sergeant would go too and where should we be without quick i should like to know  afterwards i conversed with the said quick about this same matter repeating to him my opinions to which the sergeant listened with the deference which he was always kind enough to show to me  begging your pardon sir he said when i had finished but i think you are both right and wrong everything has two ends hasnt it you say that it would be wicked for the captain to get himself killed there being now so much money for him to live for seeing that life is common as dirt while money is precious rare and hard to come by it aint the kings we admire its their crowns it aint the millionaires its their millions but after all the millionaires dont take their millions with them for providence that like nature hates waste knows that if they did theyd melt so one man dead gives another bread as the saying goes or praps i should say gingerbread in such cases  still on the whole sir i admit you are right as to the sinfulness of wasting luck but now comes the other end i know this young lady what the captain was engaged to which he never would have been if he had taken my advice since of all the fishblooded little serpents that ever i set eyes on shes the serpentest though pretty i allow solomon said in his haste that an honest woman he had not found but if he had met the honourable misswell never mind her namehed have said it at his leisure and gone on saying it now no one should never take back a servant what has given notice and then says hes sorry for if he does the sorrow will be on the other side before its all done and much less should he take back a fiancée quick said a finance on the whole hed better drown himselfi tried it once and i know so thats the tail of the business  but he went on it has a couple of fins as well like that eel beast i caught in the nile one of them is that the captain promised and vowed to go through with this expedition and if a mans got to die hed better die honest without breaking his word and the other is what i said to you in london when i signed on that he wont die a minute before his time and nothing wont happen to him but whats bound to happen and therefore it aint a haporth of use bothering about anything and thats where the easts well ahead of the west  and now sir ill go and look after the camels and those halfbred jew boys what you call abati but i call rotten sneaks for if they get their thieving fingers into those canisters of picric salts thinking theyre jam as i found them trying to do yesterday something may happen in egypt thatll make the pharaohs turn in their graves and the ten plagues look silly  so having finished his oration quick went and in due course we started for mur  the second incident that is perhaps worth recording was an adventure that happened to us when we had completed about two of our four months journey  after weeks of weary desert travelif i remember right it was exactly a fortnight after the dog pharaoh of which i shall soon have plenty to say had come into ormes possessionwe reached an oasis called zeu where i had halted upon my road down to egypt in this oasis which although not large in extent possesses springs of beautiful water and groves of datetrees we were as it chanced very welcome since when i was there before i had been fortunate enough to cure its sheik of an attack of ophthalmia and to doctor several of his people for various ailments with good results so although i was burning to get forward i agreed with the others that it would be wise to accede to the request of the leader of our caravan a clever and resourceful but to my mind untrustworthy abati of the name of shadrach and camp in zeu for a week or so to rest and feed our camels which had wasted almost to nothing on the scant herbage of the desert  this shadrach i may add here whom his companions for some reason unknown to me at that time called the cat was remarkable for a triple line of scars upon his face which he informed me had been set there by the claws of a lion now the great enemies of this people of zeu were lions which at certain seasons of the year i suppose when food grew scarce descended from the slopes of a range of hills that stretched east and west at a distance of about fifty miles north of the oasis and crossing the intervening desert killed many of the zeu sheep camels and other cattle and often enough any of the tribe whom they could catch as these poor zeus practically possessed no firearms they were at the mercy of the lions which grew correspondingly bold indeed their only resource was to kraal their animals within stone walls at night and take refuge in their huts which they seldom left between sunset and dawn except to replenish the fires that they lit to scare any beast of prey which might be prowling through the town  though the lion season was now in full swing as it happened for the first five days of our stay at zeu we saw none of these great cats although in the darkness we heard them roaring in the distance on the sixth night however we were awakened by a sound of wailing which came from the village about a quarter of a mile away and when we went out at dawn to see what was the matter were met by a melancholy procession advancing from its walls at the head of it marched the greyhaired old chief followed by a number of screaming women who in their excitement or perhaps as a sign of mourning had omitted to make their toilette and by four men who carried something horrid on a wickerwork door  soon we learned what had happened it seemed that hungry lions two or three of them had broken through the palmleaf roof of the hut of one of the sheiks wives she whose remains were stretched upon the door and in addition to killing her had actually carried off his son now he came to implore us white men who had guns to revenge him on the lions which otherwise having once tasted human flesh would destroy many more of his people  through an interpreter who knew arabic for not even higgs could understand the peculiar zeu dialect he explained in excited and incoherent words that the beasts lay up among the sandhills not very far away where some thick reeds grew around a little spring of water would we not come out and kill them and earn the blessing of the zeus  now i said nothing for the simple reason that having such big matters on hand although i was always fond of sport i did not wish any of us to be led off after these lions there is a time to hunt and a time to cease from hunting and it seemed to me except for the purposes of food that this journey of ours was the latter however as i expected oliver orme literally leaped at the idea so did higgs who of late had been practising with a rifle and began to fancy himself a shot he exclaimed loudly that nothing would give him greater pleasure especially as he was sure that lions were in fact cowardly and overrated beasts  from that moment i foreboded disaster in my heart still i said i would come too partly because i had not shot a lion for many a day and had a score to settle with those beasts which it may be remembered nearly killed me on the mountain of mur and partly because knowing the desert and also the zeu people much better than either the professor or orme i thought that i might possibly be of service  so we fetched our rifles and cartridges to which by an afterthought we added two large waterbottles and ate a hearty breakfast as we were preparing to start shadrach the leader of the abati cameldrivers that man with the scarred face who was nicknamed the cat came up to me and asked me whither we were going i told him whereon he said  what have you to do with these savages and their troubles lords if a few of them are killed it is no matter but as you should know o doctor if you wish to hunt lions there are plenty in that land whither you travel seeing that the lion is the fetish of the fung and therefore never killed but the desert about zeu is dangerous and harm may come to you  then accompany us broke in the professor between whom and shadrach there was no love lost for of course with you we should be quite safe  not so he replied i and my people rest only madmen would go to hunt worthless wild beasts when they might rest have we not enough of the desert and its dangers as it is if you knew all that i do of lions you would leave them alone  of the desert we have plenty also but of shooting very little remarked the captain who talked arabic well lie in your beds we go to kill the beasts that harass the poor people who have treated us so kindly  so be it said shadrach with a smile that struck me as malicious a lion made thispointing to the dreadful threefold scar upon his face may the god of israel protect you from lions remember lords that the camels being fresh again we march the day after tomorrow should the weather hold for if the wind blows on yonder sandhills no man may live among them and putting up his hand he studied the sky carefully from beneath its shadow then with a grunt turned and vanished behind a hut  all this while sergeant quick was engaged at a little distance in washing up the tin breakfast things to all appearance quite unconscious of what was going on orme called him whereupon he advanced and stood to attention i remember thinking how curious he looked in those surroundingshis tall bony frame clothed in semimilitary garments his wooden face perfectly shaved his irongrey hair neatly parted and plastered down upon his head with pomade or some equivalent after the old private soldier fashion and his sharp ferretlike grey eyes taking in everything  are you coming with us sergeant asked orme  not unless ordered so to do captain i like a bit of hunting well enough but with all three officers away some one should mount guard over the stores and transport so i think the dog pharaoh and i had best stop behind  perhaps you are right sergeant only tie pharaoh up or hell follow me well what do you want to say out with it  only this captain although i have served in three campaigns among these here arabians to quick all african natives north of the equator were arabians and all south of it niggers i cant say i talk their lingo well still i made out that the fellow they call cat dont like this trip of yours and begging your pardon captain whatever else cat may be he aint no fool  cant help it sergeant for one thing it would never do to give in to his fancies now  thats true captain when once its hoist right or wrong keep the flag flying and no doubt youll come back safe and sound if youre meant to  then having relieved his mind the sergeant ran his eye over our equipment to see that nothing had been forgotten rapidly assured himself that the rifles were in working order reported all well and returned to his dishes little did any of us guess under what circumstances we should next meet with him  after leaving the town and marching for a mile or so along the oasis accompanied by a mob of the zeus armed with spears and bows we were led by the bereaved chief who also acted as tracker out into the surrounding sands the desert here although i remembered it well enough was different from any that we had yet encountered upon this journey being composed of huge and abrupt sandhills some of which were quite three hundred feet high separated from each other by deep windcut valleys  for a distance while they were within reach of the moist air of the oasis these sandmountains produced vegetation of various sorts presently however we passed out into the wilderness proper and for a while climbed up and down the steep shifting slopes till from the crest of one of them the chief pointed out what in south africa is called a pan or vlei covered with green reeds and explained by signs that in these lay the lions descending a steep declivity we posted ourselves i at the top and higgs and orme a little way down either side of this vlei this done we dispatched the zeus to beat it out towards us for although the reeds grew thick along the course of the underground water it was but a narrow place and not more than a quarter of a mile in length  scarcely had the beaters entered the tall reeds evidently with trepidation for a good many of them held back from the adventure when a sound of loud wailing informed us that something had happened a minute or two later we saw two of them bearing away what appeared to be the mangled remains of the chiefs son who had been carried off on the previous night  just then too we saw something else for halfway down the marsh a great male lion broke cover and began to steal off toward the sandhills it was about two hundred yards from higgs who chanced to be nearest to it and therefore as any biggame hunter will know for practical purposes far out of shot but the professor who was quite unaccustomed to this or indeed any kind of sport and like all beginners wildly anxious for blood lifted his rifle and fired as he might have done at a rabbit by some marvellous accident the aim was good and the bullet from the express striking the lion fair behind the shoulder passed through its heart and knocked it over dead as a stone  by jingo did you see that screamed higgs in his delight then without even stopping to reload the empty barrel he set off at the top of his speed toward the prostrate beast followed by myself and by orme as fast as our astonishment would allow  running along the edge of the marsh higgs had covered about a hundred yards of the distance when suddenly charging straight at him out of the tall reeds appeared a second lion or rather lioness higgs wheeled round and wildly fired the left barrel of his rifle without touching the infuriated brute next instant to our horror we saw him upon his back with the lioness standing over him lashing her tail and growling  we shouted as we ran and so did the zeus although they made no attempt at rescue with the result that the lioness instead of tearing higgs to pieces turned her head confusedly first to one side and then to the other by now i who had a long start of orme was quite close say within thirty yards though fire i dared not as yet fearing lest should i do so i might kill my friend at this moment the lioness recovering her nerves squatted down on the prostrate higgs and though he hit at her with his fists dropped her muzzle evidently with the intention of biting him through the head  now i felt that if i hesitated any more all would be finished the lioness was much longer than higgsa short stout manand her hind quarters projected beyond his feet at these i aimed rapidly and pressing the trigger next second heard the bullet clap upon the great beasts hide up she sprang with a roar one hind leg dangling and after a moments hesitation fled toward the sandhill  now orme who was behind me fired also knocking up the dust beneath the lionesss belly but although he had more cartridges in his rifle which was a repeater before either he or i could get another chance it vanished behind a mound leaving it to go where it would we ran on towards higgs expecting to find him either dead or badly mauled but to our amazement and delight up jumped the professor his blue spectacles still on his nose and loading his rifle as he went charged away after the wounded lioness  come back shouted the captain as he followed  not for joe yelled higgs in his high voice if you fellows think that im going to let a great cat sit on my stomach for nothing you are jolly well mistaken  at the top of the first rise the longlegged orme caught him but persuade him to return was more than he or i when i arrived could do beyond a scratch on his nose which had stung him and covered him with blood we found that he was quite uninjured except in temper and dignity but in vain did we beg him to be content with his luck and the honours he had won  why he answered adams wounded the beast and id rather kill two lions than one also i have a score to square but if you fellows are afraid you go home  well i confess i felt inclined to accept the invitation but orme who was nettled replied  come come that settles the question doesnt it you must be shaken by your fall or you would not talk like that higgs look here runs the spoorsee the blood well lets go steady and keep our wind we may come on her anywhere but dont you try any more long distance shots you wont kill another lion at two hundred and fifty yards  all right said higgs dont be offended i didnt mean anything except that i am going to teach that beast the difference between a white man and a zeu  then we began our march following the blood tracks up and down the steep sandslopes when we had been at it for about halfanhour our spirits were cheered by catching sight of the lioness on a ridge five hundred yards away just then too some of the zeus overtook us and joined the hunt though without zeal  meanwhile as the day grew the heat increased until it was so intense that the hot air danced above the sand slopes like billions of midges and this although the sun was not visible being hidden by a sort of mist a strange silence unusual even in the desert pervaded the earth and sky we could hear the grains of sand trickling from the ridges the zeus who accompanied us grew uneasy and pointed upward with their spears then behind toward the oasis of which we had long lost sight finally when we were not looking they disappeared  now i would have followed them guessing that they had some good reason for this sudden departure but higgs refused to come and orme in whom his foolish taunt seemed still to rankle only shrugged his shoulders and said nothing  let the black curs go exclaimed the professor as he polished his blue spectacles and mopped his face they are a whitelivered lot of sneaks look there she is creeping off to the left if we run round that sandhill we shall meet her  so we ran round the sandhill but we did not meet her although after long hunting we struck the blood spoor afresh and followed it for several miles first in this direction and then in that until orme and i wondered at higgss obstinacy and endurance at length when even he was beginning to despair we put up the lioness in a hollow and fired several shots at her as she hobbled over the opposing slope one of which hit her for she rolled over then picked herself up again roaring as a matter of fact it came from the captains rifle but higgs who like many an inexperienced person was a jealous sportsman declared that it was his and we did not think it worth while to contradict him  on we toiled and just beyond the ridge walked straight into the lioness sitting up like a great dog so injured that she could do nothing but snarl hideously and paw at the air  now it is my turn old lady ejaculated higgs and straightway missed her clean from a distance of five yards a second shot was more successful and she rolled over dead  come on said the exultant professor and well skin her she sat on me and i mean to sit on her for many a day  so we began the job although i who had large experience of this desert and did not like the appearance of the weather wished to leave the beast where it lay and get back to the oasis it proved long for i was the only one of us who had any practical knowledge of flaying animals and in that heat extremely unpleasant  at length it was done and having doubled the hide over a rifle for two of us to carry in turns we refreshed ourselves from the waterbottles i even caught the professor washing the blood off his face and hands with some of the precious fluid then we started for the oasis only to discover though we were all sure that we knew the way that not one of us had a slightest idea of its real direction in the hurry of our departure we had forgotten to bring a compass and the sun that would have been our guide in ordinary circumstances and to which we always trusted in the open desert was hidden by the curious haze that has been described  so sensibly enough we determined to return to the sand crest where we had killed the lioness and then trace our own footprints backward this seemed simple enough for there within halfamile rose the identical ridge  we reached it grumbling for the lionskin was heavy only to discover that it was a totally different ridge now after reflection and argument we saw our exact mistake and made for what was obviously the real ridgewith the same result  we were lost in the desert    chapter iv  the death wind  the fact is said higgs presently speaking with the air of an oracle the fact is that all these accursed sandhills are as like each other as mummy beads on the same necklace and therefore it is very difficult to know them apart give me that waterbottle adams i am as dry as a limekiln  no i said shortly you may be drier before the end  what do you mean oh i see but thats nonsense those zeus will hunt us up or at the worst we have only to wait till the sun gets out  as he spoke suddenly the air became filled with a curious singing sound impossible to describe caused as i knew who had often heard it before by millions and millions of particles of sand being rubbed together we turned to see whence it came and perceived far away rushing towards us with extraordinary swiftness a huge and dense cloud preceded by isolated columns and funnels of similar clouds  a sandstorm said higgs his florid face paling a little bad luck for us thats what comes of getting out of bed the wrong side first this morning no its your fault adams you helped me to salt last night in spite of my remonstrances the professor has sundry little superstitions of this sort particularly absurd in so learned a man well what shall we do get under the lee of the hill until it blows over  dont suppose it will blow over cant see anything to do except say our prayers remarked orme with sweet resignation oliver is i think the coolest hand in an emergency of any one i ever met except perhaps sergeant quick a man of course nearly old enough to be his father the game seems to be pretty well up he added well you have killed two lions higgs and that is something  oh hang it you can die if you like oliver the world wont miss you but think of its loss if anything happened to me i dont intend to be wiped out by a beastly sandstorm i intend to live to write a book on mur and higgs shook his fist at the advancing clouds with an air that was really noble it reminded me of ajax defying the lightning  meanwhile i had been reflecting  listen i said our only chance is to stop where we are for if we move we shall certainly be buried alive look there is something solid to lie on and i pointed to a ridge of rock a kind of core of congealed sand from which the surface had been swept by gales down with you quick i went on and lets draw that lionskin over our heads it may help to keep the dust from choking us hurry men its coming  coming it was indeed with a mighty wailing roar scarcely had we got ourselves into position our backs to the blast and our mouths and noses buried after the fashion of camels in a similar predicament the lionskin covering our heads and bodies to the middle with the paws tucked securely beneath us to prevent it from being blown away when the storm leaped upon us furiously bringing darkness in its train there we lay for hour after hour unable to see unable to talk because of the roaring noise about us and only from time to time lifting ourselves a little upon our hands and knees to disturb the weight of sand that accumulated on our bodies lest it should encase us in a living tomb  dreadful were the miseries we sufferedthe misery of the heat beneath the stinking pelt of the lion the misery of the dustladen air that choked us almost to suffocation the misery of thirst for we could not get at our scanty supply of water to drink but worst of all perhaps was the pain caused by the continual friction of the sharp sand driven along at hurricane speed which incredible as it may seem finally wore holes in our thin clothing and filed our skins to rawness  no wonder the egyptian monuments get such a beautiful shine on them i heard poor higgs muttering in my ear again and again for he was growing lightheaded no wonder no wonder my shinbones will be very useful to polish quicks tall ridingboots oh curse the lions why did you help me to salt you old ass why did you help me to salt its pickling me behind  then he became quite incoherent and only groaned from time to time  perhaps however this suffering did us a service since otherwise exhaustion thirst and dust might have overwhelmed our senses and caused us to fall into a sleep from which we never should have awakened yet at the time we were not grateful to it for at last the agony became almost unbearable indeed orme told me afterwards that the last thing he could remember was a quaint fancy that he had made a colossal fortune by selling the secret of a new torture to the chinesethat of hot sand driven on to the victim by a continuous blast of hot air  after a while we lost count of time nor was it until later that we learned that the storm endured for full twenty hours during the latter part of which notwithstanding our manifold sufferings we must have become more or less insensible at any rate at one moment i remembered the awful roar and the stinging of the sand whips followed by a kind of vision of the face of my sonthat beloved longlost son whom i had sought for so many years and for whose sake i endured all these things then without any interval as it were i felt my limbs being scorched as though by hot irons or through a burningglass and with a fearful effort staggered up to find that the storm had passed and that the furious sun was blistering my excoriated skin rubbing the caked dirt from my eyes i looked down to see two mounds like those of graves out of which projected legs that had been white just then one pair of legs the longer pair stirred the sand heaved up convulsively and uttering wandering words in a choky voice there arose the figure of oliver orme  for a moment we stood and stared at each other and strange spectacles we were  is he dead muttered orme pointing to the still buried higgs  fear so i answered but well look and painfully we began to disinter him  when we came to it beneath the lionskin the professors face was black and hideous to see but to our relief we perceived that he was not dead for he moved his hand and moaned orme looked at me  water would save him i said  then came the anxious moment one of our waterbottles was emptied before the storm began but the other a large patent flask covered with felt and having a screw vulcanite top should still contain a good quantity perhaps three quartsthat is if the fluid had not evaporated in the dreadful heat if this had happened it meant that higgs would die and unless help came that soon we should follow him orme unscrewed the flask for my hands refused that office and used his teeth to draw the cork which providentially enough the thoughtful quick had set in the neck beneath the screw some of the water which although it was quite hot had not evaporated thank god flew against his parched lips and i saw him bite them till the blood came in the fierceness of the temptation to assuage his raging thirst but he resisted it like the man he is and without drinking a drop handed me the bottle saying simply  you are the oldest take care of this adams  now it was my turn to be tempted but i too overcame and sitting down laid higgss head upon my knee then drop by drop let a little of the water trickle between his swollen lips  the effect was magical for in less than a minute the professor sat up grasped at the flask with both hands and strove to tear it away  you cruel brute you cruel selfish brute he moaned as i wrenched it from him  look here higgs i answered thickly orme and i want water badly enough and we have had none but you might take it all if it would save you only it wouldnt we are lost in the desert and must be sparing if you drank everything now in a few hours you would be thirsty again and die  he thought awhile then looked up and said  beg pardoni understand im the selfish brute but theres a good lot of water there lets each have a drink we cant move unless we do  so we drank measuring out the water in a little indiarubber cup which we had with us it held about as much as a port wine glass and each of us drank or rather slowly sipped three cupfuls we who felt as though we could have swallowed a gallon apiece and asked for more small as was the allowance it worked wonders in us we were men again  we stood up and looked about us but the great storm had changed everything where there had been sandhills a hundred feet high now were plains and valleys where there had been valleys appeared sandhills only the high ridge upon which we had lain was as before because it stood above the others and had a core of rock we tried to discover the direction of the oasis by the position of the sun only to be baffled since our two watches had run down and we did not know the time of day or where the sun ought to be in the heavens also in that howling wilderness there was nothing to show us the points of the compass  higgs whose obstinacy remained unimpaired whatever may have happened to the rest of his vital forces had one view of the matter and orme another diametrically opposed to it they even argued as to whether the oasis lay to our right or to our left for their poor heads were so confused that they were scarcely capable of accurate thought or observation meanwhile i sat down upon the sand and considered through the haze i could see the points of what i thought must be the hills whence the zeus declared that the lions came although of course for aught i knew they might be other hills  listen i said if lions live upon those hills there must be water there let us try to reach them perhaps we shall see the oasis as we go  then began our dreadful march the lionskin that had saved our lives and was now baked hard as a board we left behind but the rifles we took all day long we dragged ourselves up and down steep sandslopes pausing now again to drink a sip of water and hoping always that from the top of the next slope we should see a rescue party headed by quick or perhaps the oasis itself indeed once we did see it green and shining not more than three miles away but when we got to the head of the hill beyond which it should lie we found that the vision was only a mirage and our hearts nearly broke with disappointment oh to men dying of thirst that mirage was indeed a cruel mockery  at length night approached and the mountains were yet a long way off we could march no more and sank down exhausted lying on our faces because our backs were so cut by the driving sand and blistered by the sun that we could not sit by now almost all our water was gone suddenly higgs nudged us and pointed upwards following the line of his hand we saw not thirty yards away and showing clear against the sky a file of antelopes trekking along the sandridge doubtless on a night journey from one pasturage to another  you fellows shoot he muttered i might miss and frighten them away for in his distress poor higgs was growing modest  slowly orme and i drew ourselves to our knees cocking our rifles by this time all the buck save one had passed there were but six of them and this one marched along about twenty yards behind the others orme pulled the trigger but his rifle would not go off because as he discovered afterwards some sand had worked into the mechanism of the lock  meanwhile i had also covered the buck but the sunset dazzled my weakened eyes and my arms were feeble also my terrible anxiety for success since i knew that on this shot hung our lives unnerved me but it must be now or never in three more paces the beast would be down the dip  i fired and knowing that i had missed turned sick and faint the antelope bounded forward a few yards right to the edge of the dip then never having heard such a sound before and being overcome by some fatal curiosity stopped and turned around staring at the direction whence it had come  despairingly i fired again almost without taking aim and this time the bullet went in beneath the throat and raking the animal dropped it dead as a stone we scrambled to it and presently were engaged in an awful meal of which we never afterwards liked to think happily for us that antelope must have drunk water not long before  our hunger and thirst assuaged after this horrible fashion we slept awhile by the carcase then arose extraordinarily refreshed and having cut off some hunks of meat to carry with us started on again by the position of the stars we now knew that the oasis must lie somewhere to the east of us but as between us and it there appeared to be nothing but these eternal sandhills stretching away for many miles and as in front of us toward the range the character of the desert seemed to be changing we thought it safer if the word safety can be used in such a connection to continue to head for that range all the remainder of this night we marched and as we had no fuel wherewith to cook it at dawn ate some of the raw meat which we washed down with the last drops of our water  now we were out of the sandhills and had entered on a great pebbly plain that lay between us and the foot of the mountains these looked quiet close but in fact were still far off feebly and ever more feebly we staggered on meeting no one and finding no water though here and there we came across little bushes of which we chewed the stringy and aromatic leaves that contained some moisture but drew up our mouths and throats like alum  higgs who was the softest of us gave out the first though to the last he struggled forward with surprising pluck even after he had been obliged to throw away his rifle because he could no longer carry it though this we did not notice at the time when he could not support himself upon his feet orme took him by one arm and i by the other and helped him on much as i have seen two elephants do by a wounded companion of the herd  halfanhour or so later my strength failed me also although advanced in years i am tough and accustomed to the desert and hardships who would not be who had been a slave to the khalifa but now i could do no more and halting begged the others to go on and leave me ormes only answer was to proffer me his left arm i took it for life is sweet to us all especially when one has something to live fora desire to fulfil as i had though to tell the truth even at the time i felt ashamed of myself  thus then we proceeded awhile resembling a sober man attempting to lead two drunken friends out of reach of that stern policeman death ormes strength must be wonderful or was it his great spirit and his tender pity for our helplessness which enabled him to endure beneath this double burden  suddenly he fell down as though he had been shot and lay there senseless the professor however retained some portion of his mind although it wandered he became lightheaded and rambled on about our madness in having undertaken such a journey just to pot a couple of beastly lions and although i did not answer them i agreed heartily with his remarks then he seemed to imagine that i was a clergyman and kneeling on the sand he made a lengthy confession of his sins which so far as i gathered though i did not pay much attention to them for i was thinking of my own appeared chiefly to consist of the unlawful acquisition of certain objects of antiquity or of having overmatched others in the purchase of such objects  to pacify him for i feared lest he should go raving mad i pronounced some religious absolution whereon poor higgs rolled over and lay still by orme yes he the friend whom i had always loved for his very failings were endearing was dead or at the point of death like the gallant young man at his side and i myself was dying tremors shook my limbs horrible waves of blackness seemed to well up from my vitals through my breast to my brain and thence to evaporate in queer jagged lines and patches which i realized but could not actually see gay memories of my faroff childhood arose in me particularly those of a christmas party where i had met a little girl dressed like an elf a little girl with blue eyes whom i had loved dearly for quite a fortnight to be beaten down stamped out swallowed by that vision of the imminent shadow which awaits all mankind the black womb of a rebirth if rebirth there be  what could i do i thought of lighting a fire at any rate it would serve to scare the lions and other wild beasts which else might prey upon us before we were quite dead it would be dreadful to lie helpless but sentient and feel their rending fangs but i had no strength to collect the material to do so at best must have meant a long walk for even here it was not plentiful i had a few cartridges leftthree to be accuratein my repeating rifle the rest i had thrown away to be rid of their weight i determined to fire them since in my state i thought they could no longer serve either to win food or for the purposes of defence although as it happened in this i was wrong it was possible that even in that endless desert some one might hear the shots and if notwell goodnight  so i sat up and fired the first cartridge wondering in a childish fashion where the bullet would fall then i went to sleep for awhile the howling of a hyena woke me up and on glancing around i saw the beasts flaming eyes quite close to me i aimed and shot at it and heard a yell of pain that hyena i reflected would want no more food at present  the silence of the desert overwhelmed me it was so terrible that i almost wished the hyena back for company holding the rifle above my head i fired the third cartridge then i took the hand of higgs in my own for after all it was a linkthe last link with humanity and the worldand lay down in the company of death that seemed to fall upon me in black and smothering veils    i woke up and became aware that some one was pouring water down my throat heaven i thought to myself for at that time heaven and water were synonymous in my mind i drank a good deal of it not all i wanted by any means but as much as the pourer would allow then raised myself upon my hands and looked the starlight was extraordinarily clear in that pure desert atmosphere and by it i saw the face of sergeant quick bending over me also i saw orme sitting up staring about him stupidly while a great yellow dog with a head like a mastiff licked his hand i knew the dog at once it was that which orme had bought from some wandering natives and named pharaoh because he ruled over all other dogs moreover i knew the two camels that stood near by so i was still on earthunless indeed we had all moved on a step  how did you find us sergeant i asked feebly  didnt find you doctor answered quick dog pharaoh found you in a business like this a dog is more useful than man for he can smell what one cant see now if you feel better doctor please look at mr higgs for i fear hes gone  i looked and although i did not say so was of the same opinion his jaw had fallen and he lay limp and senseless his eyes i could not see because of the black spectacles  water i said and quick poured some into his mouth where it vanished  still he did not stir so i opened his garments and felt his heart at first i could detect nothing then there was the slightest possible flutter  theres hope i said in answer to the questioning looks you dont happen to have any brandy do you i added  never travelled without it yet doctor replied quick indignantly producing a metal flask  give him some i said and the sergeant obeyed with liberality and almost instantaneous effect for higgs sat up gasping and coughing  brandy filthy stuff teetotaller cursed trick never forgive you water water he spluttered in a thick low voice  we gave it to him and he drank copiously until we would let him have no more indeed then by degrees his senses came back to him he thrust up his black spectacles which he had worn all this while and stared at the sergeant with his sharp eyes  i understand he said so we are not dead after all which perhaps is a pity after getting through the beastly preliminaries what has happened  dont quite know answered orme ask quick  but the sergeant was already engaged in lighting a little fire and setting a campkettle to boil into which he poured a tin of beef extract that he had brought with other eatables from our stores on the chance that he might find us in fifteen minutes we were drinking soup for i forbade anything more solid as yet and oh what a blessed meal was that when it was finished quick fetched some blankets from the camels which he threw over us  lie down and sleep gentlemen he said pharaoh and i will watch  the last thing i remember was seeing the sergeant in his own fashion an extremely religious man and not ashamed of it kneeling upon the sand and apparently saying his prayers as he explained afterwards of course as a fatalist he knew well that whatever must happen would happen but still he considered it right and proper to return thanks to the power which had arranged that on this occasion the happenings should be good and not ill a sentiment with which every one of us agreed opposite to him with one of his faithful eyes fixed on orme sat pharaoh in grave contemplation doubtless being an eastern dog he understood the meaning of public prayer or perhaps he thought that he should receive some share of gratitude and thanks  when we awoke the sun was already high and to show us that we had dreamed no dream there was quick frying tinned bacon over the fire while pharaoh sat still and watched himor the bacon  look said orme to me pointing to the mountains they are still miles away it was madness to think that we could reach them  i nodded then turned to stare at higgs who was just waking up for indeed he was a sight to see his fiery red hair was full of sand his nether garments were gone apparently at some stage in our march he had dispensed with the remains of them because they chafed his sore limbs and his fair skin not excluding that of his face was a mass of blisters raised by the sun in fact he was so disfigured that his worst enemy would not have known him he yawned stretched himself always a good sign in man or beast and asked for a bath  i am afraid you will have to wash yourself in sand here sir like them filthy arabians said quick saluting no water to spare for baths in this dry country but ive got a tube of hazeline also a hairbrush and a lookingglass he added producing these articles  quite so sergeant said higgs as he took them its sacrilege to think of using water to wash i intend never to waste it in that way again then he looked at himself in the glass and let it fall upon the sand ejaculating oh good lord is that me  please be careful sir said the sergeant sternly you told me the other day that its unlucky to break a lookingglass also i have no other  take it away said the professor i dont want it any more and doctor come and oil my face theres a good fellow yes and the rest of me also if there is enough hazeline  so we treated each other with the ointment which at first made us smart fearfully and then very gingerly sat down to breakfast  now sergeant said orme as he finished his fifth pannikin of tea tell us your story  there isnt much of a story captain those zeu fellows came back without you and not knowing the lingo i could make nothing of their tale well i soon made shadrach and co understand that deathwind or no deathwindthats what they call itthey must come with me to look for you and at last we started although they said that i was mad as you were dead already indeed it wasnt until i asked that fellow shadrach if he wanted to be dead tooand the sergeant tapped his revolver grimlythat he would let any one go  as it proved he was right for we couldnt find you and after awhile the camels refused to face the storm any longer also one of the abati drivers was lost and hasnt been heard of since it was all the rest of us could do to get back to the oasis alive nor would shadrach go out again even after the storm had blown itself away it was no use arguing with the pig so as i did not want his blood upon my hands i took two camels and started with the dog pharaoh for company  now this was my thought although i could not explain it to the abati crowd that if you lived at all you would almost certainly head for the hills as i knew you had no compass and you would not be able to see anything else so i rode along the plain which stretches between the desert and the mountains keeping on the edge of the sandhills i rode all day but when night came i halted since i could see no more there i sat in that great place thinking and after an hour or two i observed pharaoh prick his ears and look toward the west so i also started toward the west and presently i thought that i saw one faint streak of light which seemed to go upward and therefore couldnt come from a falling star but might have come from a rifle fired toward the sky  i listened but no sound reached me only presently some seconds afterwards the dog again pricked his ears as though he heard something that settled me and i mounted and rode forward through the night toward the place where i thought i had seen the flash for two hours i rode firing my revolver from time to time then as no answer came gave it up as a bad job and stopped but pharaoh there wouldnt stop he began to whine and sniff and run forward and at last bolted into the darkness out of which presently i heard him barking some hundreds of yards away to call me i suppose so i followed and found you three gentlemen dead as i thought at first thats all the story captain  one with a good end anyway sergeant we owe our lives to you  beg your pardon captain answered quick modestly not to me at all but to providence first that arranged everything before we were born perhaps and next to pharaoh hes a wise dog pharaoh though fierce with some and you did a good deal when you bought him for a bottle of whisky and a sixpenny pocketknife    it was dawn on the following morning before we sighted the oasis whither we could travel but slowly since owing to the lack of camels two of us must walk of these two as may be guessed the sergeant was always one and his master the other for of all the men i ever knew i think that in such matters orme is the most unselfish nothing would induce him to mount one of the camels even for halfanhour so that when i walked the brute went riderless on the other hand once he was on notwithstanding the agonies he suffered from his soreness nothing would induce higgs to get off  here i am and here i stop he said several times in english french and sundry oriental languages ive tramped it enough to last me the rest of my life  both of us were dozing upon our saddles when suddenly i heard the sergeant calling to the camels to halt and asked what was the matter  looks like arabians doctor he said pointing to a cloud of dust advancing toward us  well if so i answered our best chance is to show no fear and go on i dont think they will harm us  so having made ready such weapons as we had we advanced orme and the sergeant walking between the two camels until presently we encountered the other caravan and to our astonishment saw none other than shadrach riding at the head of it mounted on my dromedary which his own mistress the lady of the abati had given to me we came face to face and halted staring at each other  by the beard of aaron is it you lords he asked we thought you were dead  by the hair of moses so i gather i answered angrily seeing that you are going off with all our belongings and i pointed to the baggage camels laden with goods  then followed explanations and voluble apologies which higgs for one accepted with a very bad grace indeed as he can talk arabic and its dialects perfectly he made use of that tongue to pour upon the heads of shadrach and his companions a stream of eastern invective that must have astonished them ably seconded as it was by sergeant quick in english  orme listened for some time then said  thatll do old fellow if you go on you will get up a row and sergeant be good enough to hold your tongue we have met them so there is no harm done now friend shadrach turn back with us to the oasis we are going to rest there for some days  shadrach looked sulky and said something about our turning and going on with them whereon i produced the ancient ring shebas ring which i had brought as a token from mur this i held before his eyes saying  disobey and there will be an account to settle when you come into the presence of her who sent you forth for even if we four should dieand i looked at him meaninglythink not that you will be able to hide this matter there are too many witnesses  then without more words he saluted the sacred ring and we all went back to zeu    chapter v  pharaoh makes trouble  another six weeks or so had gone by and at length the character of the country began to change at last we were passing out of the endless desert over which we had travelled for so many hundreds of miles at least a thousand according to our observations and reckonings which i checked by those that i had taken upon my eastward journey our march after the great adventure at the oasis was singularly devoid of startling events indeed it had been awful in its monotony and yet oddly enough not without a certain charmat any rate for higgs and orme to whom the experience was new  day by day to travel on across an endless sea of sand so remote so unvisited that for whole weeks no man not even a wandering bedouin of the desert crossed our path day by day to see the great red sun rise out of the eastern sands and its journey finished sink into the western sands night by night to watch the moon the same moon on which were fixed the million eyes of cities turning those sands to a silver sea or in that pure air to observe the constellations by which we steered our path making their majestic march through space and yet to know that this vast region now so utterly lonesome and desolate had once been familiar to the feet of longforgotten men who had trod the sands we walked and dug the wells at which we drank  armies had marched across these deserts also and perished there for once we came to a place where a recent fearful gale had almost denuded the underlying rock and there found the skeletons of thousands upon thousands of soldiers with those of their beasts of burden and among them heads of arrows swordblades fragments of armour and of painted wooden shields  here a whole host had died perhaps alexander sent it forth or perhaps some far earlier monarch whose name has ceased to echo on the earth at least they had died for there we saw the memorial of that buried enterprise there lay the kings the captains the soldiers and the concubines for i found the female bones heaped apart some with the long hair still upon the skulls showing where the poor affrighted women had hived together in the last catastrophe of slaughter or of famine thirst and driven sand oh if only those bones could speak what a tale was theirs to tell  there had been cities in this desert too where once were oases now overwhelmed except perhaps for a sandchoked spring twice we came upon the foundations of such places old walls of clay or stone stark skeletons of ancient homes that the shifting sands had disinterred which once had been the theatre of human hopes and fears where once men had been born loved and died where once maidens had been fair and good and evil wrestled and little children played some job may have dwelt here and written his immortal plaint or some king of sodom and suffered the uttermost calamity the world is very old all we westerns learned from the contemplation of these wrecks of men and of their works was just that the world is very old    one evening against the clear sky there appeared the dim outline of towering cliffs shaped like a horseshoe they were the mountains of mur many miles away but still the mountains of mur sighted at last next morning we began to descend through wooded land toward a wide river that is i believe a tributary of the nile though upon this point i have no certain information three days later we reached the banks of this river following some old road and faring sumptuously all the way since here there was much game and grass in plenty for the camels that after their long abstinence ate until we thought that they would burst evidently we had not arrived an hour too soon for now the mountains of mur were hid by clouds and we could see that it was raining upon the plains which lay between us and them the wet season was setting in and had we been a single week later it might have been impossible for us to cross the river which would then have been in flood as it was we passed it without difficulty by the ancient ford the water never rising above the knees of our camels  upon its further bank we took counsel for now we had entered the territory of the fung and were face to face with the real dangers of our journey fifty miles or so away rose the fortress of mur but as i explained to my companions the question was how to pass those fifty miles in safety shadrach was called to our conference and at my request set out the facts  yonder he said rose the impregnable mountain home of the abati but all the vast plain included in the loop of the river which he called ebur was the home of the savage fung race whose warriors could be counted by the ten thousand and whose principal city harmac was built opposite to the stone effigy of their idol that was also called harmac  harmacthat is harmachis god of dawn your fung had something to do with the old egyptians or both of them came from a common stock interrupted higgs triumphantly  i daresay old fellow answered orme i think you told us that before in london but we will go into the archæology afterwards if we survive to do so let shadrach get on with his tale  this city which had quite fifty thousand inhabitants continued shadrach commanded the mouth of the pass or cleft by which we must approach mur having probably been first built there for that very purpose  orme asked if there was no other way into the stronghold which he understood the embassy had left by being let down a precipice shadrach answered that this was true but that although the camels and their loads had been let down that precipitous place owing to the formation of its overhanging rocks it would be perfectly impossible to haul them up it with any tackle that the abati possessed  he asked again if there was not a way round if that circle of mountains had no back door shadrach replied that there was such a back door facing to the north some eight days journey away only at this season of the year it could not be reached since beyond the mountains of mur in that direction was a great lake out of which flowed the river ebur in two arms that enclosed the whole plain of fung by now this lake would be full swollen with rains that fell on the hills of northern africa and the space between it and the mur range nothing but an impassable swamp  being still unsatisfied orme inquired whether if we abandoned the camels we could not then climb the precipice down which the embassy had descended to this the answer which i corroborated was that if our approach were known and help given to us from above it might be possible provided that we threw away the loads  seeing what these loads are and the purpose for which we have brought them so far that is out of the question said orme therefore tell us at once shadrach how we are to win through the fung to mur  in one way only o son of orme should it be the will of god that we do so at all by keeping ourselves hidden during the daytime and marching at night according to their custom at this season tomorrow after sunset the fung hold their great spring feast in the city of harmac and at dawn go up to make sacrifice to their idol but after sunset they eat and drink and are merry and then it is their habit to withdraw their guards that they may take part in the festival for this reason i have timed our march that we should arrive on the night of this feast which i know by the age of the moon when in the darkness with gods help perchance we may slip past harmac and at the first light find ourselves in the mouth of the road that runs up to mur moreover i will give warning to my people the abati that we are coming so that they may be at hand to help us if there is need  how asked orme  by firing the reedsand he pointed to the dense masses of dead vegetation aboutas i arranged that i would do before we left mur many months ago the fung if they see it will think only that it is the work of some wandering fisherman  orme shrugged his shoulders saying  well friend shadrach you know the place and these people and i do not so we must do what you tell us but i say at once that if as i understand yonder fung will kill us if they can to me your plan seems very dangerous  it is dangerous he answered adding with a sneer but i thought that you men of england were not cowards  cowards you son of a dog broke in higgs in his high voice how dare you talk to us like that you see this man hereand he pointed to sergeant quick who tall and upright stood watching this scene grimly and understanding most of what passedwell he is the lowest among usa servant only here the sergeant saluted but i tell you that there is more courage in his little finger than in your whole body or in that of all the abati people so far as i can make out  here the sergeant saluted again murmuring beneath his breath i hope so sir being a christian i hope so but till it comes to the stickingpoint one can never be sure  you speak big words o higgs answered shadrach insolently for as i think i have said he hated the professor who smelt the rogue in him and scourged him continually with his sharp tongue but if the fung get hold of you then we shall learn the truth  shall i punch his head sir queried quick in a meditative voice  be quiet please interrupted orme we have troubles enough before us without making more it will be time to settle our quarrels when we have got through the fung  then he turned to shadrach and said  friend this is no time for angry words you are the guide of this party lead us as you will remembering only that if it comes to war i by the wish of my companions am captain also there is another thing which you should not forgetnamely that in the end you must make answer to your own ruler she who i understand from the doctor here is called walda nagasta the child of kings now no more words we march as you wish and where you wish on your head be it  the abati heard and bowed sullenly then with a look of hate at higgs he turned and went about his business  much better to have let me punch his head soliloquized quick it would have done him a world of good and perhaps saved many troubles for to tell the truth i dont trust that quarterbred hebrew  then he departed to see to the camels and the guns while the rest of us went to our tents to get such sleep as the mosquitoes would allow in my own case it was not much since the fear of evil to come weighed upon me although i knew the enormous difficulty of entering the mountain stronghold of mur by any other way such as that by which i had quitted it burdened as we were with our long train of camels laden with rifles ammunition and explosives i dreaded the results of an attempt to pass through the fung savages  moreover it occurred to me that shadrach had insisted upon this route from a kind of jealous obstinacy and to be in opposition to us englishmen whom he hated in his heart or perhaps for some dark and secret reason still the fact remained that we were in his power since owing to the circumstances in which i had entered and left the place it was impossible for me to act as guide to the party if i attempted to do so no doubt he and the abati with him would desert leaving the camels and their loads upon our hands why should they not seeing that they would be quite safe in concluding that we should never have an opportunity of laying our side of the case before their ruler  just as the sun was setting quick came to call me saying that the camels were being loaded up  i dont much like the look of things doctor he said as he helped me to pack my few belongings for the fact is i cant trust that shadrach man his pals call him cat a good name for him i think also he is showing his claws just now the truth being that he hates the lot of us and would like to get back into purr or mur or whatever the name of the place is having lost us on the road you should have seen the way he looked at the professor just now oh i wish the captain had let me punch his head im sure it would have cleared the air a lot  as it chanced shadrach was destined to get his head punched after all but by another hand it happened thus the reeds were fired as shadrach had declared it was necessary to do in order that the abati watchmen on the distant mountains might see and report the signal although in the light of subsequent events i am by no means certain that this warning was not meant for other eyes as well then as arranged we started out leaving them burning in a great sheet of flame behind us and all that night marched by the shine of the stars along some brokendown and undoubtedly ancient road  at the first sign of dawn we left this road and camped amid the overgrown ruins of a deserted town that had been built almost beneath the precipitous cliffs of mur fortunately without having met any one or being challenged i took the first watch while the others turned in to sleep after we had all breakfasted off cold meats for here we dared not light a fire as the sun grew high dispelling the mists i saw that we were entering upon a thicklypopulated country which was no stranger to civilization of a sort below us not more than fifteen or sixteen miles away and clearly visible through my fieldglasses lay the great town of harmac which during my previous visit to this land i had never seen as i passed it in the night  it was a city of the west central african type with open marketplaces and wide streets containing thousands of white flatroofed houses the most important of which were surrounded by gardens round it ran a high and thick wall built apparently of sunburnt brick and in front of the gateways of which i could see two stood square towers whence these might be protected all about this city the flat and fertile land was under cultivation for the season being that of early spring already the maize and other crops showed green upon the ground  beyond this belt of ploughlands with the aid of the fieldglasses i could make out great herds of grazing cattle and horses mixed with wild game a fact that assured me of the truth of what i had heard during my brief visit to mur that the fung had few or no firearms since otherwise the buck and quagga would have kept at a distance far off too and even on the horizon i saw what appeared to be other towns and villages evidently this was a very numerous people and one which could not justly be described as savage no wonder that the little abati tribe feared them so intensely notwithstanding the mighty precipices by which they were protected from their hate  about eleven oclock orme came on watch and i turned in having nothing to report soon i was fast asleep notwithstanding the anxieties that had i been less weary might well have kept me wakeful for these were many on the coming night we must slip through the fung and before midday on the morrow we should either have entered mur or failed to have entered mur which meantdeath or what was worse captivity among barbarians and subsequent execution preceded probably by torture of one sort or another  of course however we might come thither without accident travelling with good guides on a dark night for after all the place was big and the road lonely and little used so that unless we met a watch which we were told would not be there our little caravan had a good chance to pass unobserved shadrach seemed to think that we should do so but the worst of it was that like quick i did not trust shadrach even maqueda the lady of the abati she whom they called child of kings had her doubts about him or so it had seemed to me  at any rate she had told me before i left mur that she chose him for this mission because he was bold and cunning one of the very few of her people also who in his youth had crossed the desert and therefore knew the road yet physician she added meaningly watch him for is he not named cat yes watch him for did i not hold his wife and children hostages and were i not sure that he desires to win the great reward in land which i have promised to him i would not trust you to this mans keeping  well after many experiences in his company my opinion coincided with maquedas and so did that of quick no mean judge of men  look at him doctor he said when he came to tell me that i could turn in for whether it were his watch or not the sergeant never seemed to be off duty look at him and he pointed to shadrach who was seated under the shade of a tree talking earnestly in whispers with two of his subordinates with a very curious and unpleasing smile upon his face if god almighty ever made a scamp hes squatting yonder my belief is that he wanted to be rid of us all at zeu so that he might steal our goods and i hope he wont play the same trick again tonight even the dog cant abide him  before i could answer i had proof of this last statement for the great yellow hound pharaoh that had found us in the desert hearing our voices emerged from some corner where it was hidden and advanced toward us wagging its tail as it passed shadrach it stopped and growled the hair rising on its back whereon he hurled a stone at it and hit its leg next instant pharaoh a beast of enormous power was on the top of him and really i thought about to tear out his throat  well we got him off before any harm was done but shadrachs face lined with its livid scars was a thing to remember between rage and fear it looked like that of a devil  to return after this business i went to sleep wondering if it were my last rest upon the earth and whether having endured so much for his sake it would or would not be my fortune to see the face of my son again if indeed he still lived yonder not a score of miles awayor anywhere  toward evening i was awakened by a fearful hubbub in which i distinguished the shrill voice of higgs ejaculating language which i will not repeat the baying of pharaoh and the smothered groans and curses of an abati running from the little tent i saw a curious sight that of the professor with shadrachs head under his left arm in chancery as we used to call it at school while with his right he punched the said shadrachs nose and countenance generally with all his strength which i may add is considerable close by holding pharaoh by the collar which we had manufactured for him out of the skin of a camel that had died stood sergeant quick a look of grim amusement on his wooden face while around gesticulating after their eastern fashion and uttering guttural sounds of wrath were several of the abati drivers orme was absent being in fact asleep at the time  what are you doing higgs i shouted  cantyousee he spluttered accompanying each word with a blow on the unfortunate shadrachs prominent nose i am punching this fellows beastly head ah youd bite would you then take that and that andthat lord how hard his teeth are well i think he has had enough and suddenly he released the abati who a gory and most unpleasant spectacle fell to the ground and lay there panting his companions seeing their chiefs melancholy plight advanced upon the professor in a threatening fashion indeed one of them drew a knife  put up that thing sonny said the sergeant or by heaven ill loose the dog upon you got your revolver handy doctor  evidently if the man did not understand quicks words their purport was clear to him for he sheathed his knife and fell back with the others shadrach too rose from the ground and went with them at a distance of a few yards however he turned and glaring at higgs out of his swollen eyes said  be sure accursed gentile that i will remember and repay  at this moment too orme arrived upon the scene yawning  what the deuce is the matter he asked  id give five bob for a pint of iced stone ginger replied higgs inconsequently then he drank off a pannikin of warmish muddycoloured water which quick gave to him and handed it back saying  thanks sergeant thats better than nothing and cold drink is always dangerous if you are hot whats the matter oh not much shadrach tried to poison pharaoh thats all i was watching him out of the corner of my eye and saw him go to the strychnine tin roll a bit of meat in it which he had first wetted and throw it to the poor beast i got hold of it in time and chucked it over that wall where you will find it if you care to look i asked shadrach why he had done such a thing he answered to keep the dog quiet while we are passing through the fung adding that anyhow it was a savage beast and best out of the way as it had tried to bite him that morning then i lost my temper and went for the blackguard and although i gave up boxing twenty years ago very soon had the best of it for as you may have observed no oriental can fight with his fists thats all give me another cup of water sergeant  i hope it may be answered orme shrugging his shoulders to tell the truth old fellow it would have been wiser to defer blacking shadrachs eyes till we were safe in mur but its no use talking now and i daresay i should have done the same myself if i had seen him try to poison pharaoh and he patted the head of the great dog of which we were all exceedingly fond although in reality it only cared for orme merely tolerating the rest of us  doctor he added perhaps you would try to patch up our guides nose and soothe his feelings you know him better than we do give him a rifle no dont do that or he might shoot some one in the backby accident done on purpose promise him a rifle when we get into mur i know he wants one badly because i caught him trying to steal a carbine from the case promise him anything so long as you can square it up  so i went taking a bottle of arnica and some court plaster with me to find shadrach surrounded by sympathizers and weeping with rage over the insult which he said had been offered to his ancient and distinguished race in his own unworthy person i did my best for him physically and mentally pointing out as i dabbed the arnica on his sadly disfigured countenance that he had brought the trouble on himself seeing that he had really no business to poison pharaoh because he had tried to bite him he answered that his reason for wishing to kill the dog was quite different and repeated at great length what he had told the professornamely that it might betray us while we were passing through the fung also he went on so venomously about revenge that i thought it time to put a stop to the thing  see here shadrach i said unless you unsay those words and make peace at once you shall be bound and tried perhaps we shall have a better chance of passing safely through the fung if we leave you dead behind us than if you accompany us as a living enemy  on hearing this he changed his note altogether saying that he saw he had been wrong moreover so soon as his injuries were dressed he sought out higgs whose hand he kissed with many apologies vowing that he had forgotten everything and that his heart toward him was like that of a twin brother  very good friend answered higgs who never bore malice only dont try to poison pharaoh again and for my part ill promise not to remember this matter when we get to mur  quite a converted character aint he doctor sarcastically remarked quick who had been watching this edifying scene nasty eastern temper all gone no hebrew talk of eye for eye or tooth for tooth but kisses the fist that smote him in the best christian spirit all the same i wouldnt trust the swine further than i could kick him especially in the dark which he added meaningly is what it will be tonight  i made no answer to the sergeant for although i agreed with him there was nothing to be done and talking about a bad business would only make it worse  by now the afternoon drew towards nighta very stormy night to judge from the gathering clouds and rising wind we were to start a little after sundown that is within an hour and having made ready my own baggage and assisted higgs with his we went to look for orme and quick whom we found very busy in one of the rooms of an unroofed house to all appearance they were engaged quick in sorting pound tins of tobacco or bakingpowder and orme in testing an electric battery and carefully examining coils of insulated wire  whats your game asked the professor  better than yours old boy when satan taught your idle hands to punch shadrachs head but perhaps you had better put that pipe out these azoimide compounds are said to burn rather more safely than coal still one never knows the climate or the journey may have changed their constitution  higgs retreated hurriedly to a distance of fifty yards indeed whence he returned having knocked out his pipe and even left his matches on a stone  dont waste time in asking questions said orme as the professor approached with caution ill explain we are going on a queer journey tonightfour white men with about a dozen halfbred mongrel scamps of doubtful loyalty so you see quick and i thought it as well to have some of this stuff handy probably it will never be wanted and if wanted we shall have no time to use it still who knows there that will do ten canisters enough to blow up half the fung if they will kindly sit on them you take five quick a battery and three hundred yards of wire and ill take five a battery and three hundred yards of wire your detonators are all fixed arent they well so are mine and without more words he proceeded to stow away his share of the apparatus in the poacher pockets of his coat and elsewhere while quick did likewise with what remained then the case that they had opened was fastened up again and removed to be laden on a camel    chapter vi  how we escaped from harmac  as finally arranged this was the order of our march first went an abati guide who was said to be conversant with every inch of the way then came orme and sergeant quick conducting the camels that were loaded with the explosives i followed in order to keep an eye upon these precious beasts and those in charge of them next marched some more camels carrying our baggage provisions and sundries and finally in the rear were the professor and shadrach with two abati  shadrach i should explain had selected this situation for the reason as he said that if he went first after what had passed any mistake or untoward occurrence might be set down to his malice whereas if he were behind he could not be thus slandered on hearing this higgs who is a generous soul insisted upon showing his confidence in the virtue of shadrach by accompanying him as a rearguard so violently did he insist and so flattered did shadrach seem to be by this mark of faith that orme who i should say if i have not already done so was in sole command of the party now that hostilities were in the air consented to the plan if with evident reluctance  as i know his own view was that it would be best for us four englishmen to remain together although if we did so whatever position we chose it would be impossible for us in that darkness to keep touch with the line of camels and their loads which were almost as important to us as our lives at least having made up our minds to deliver them in mur we thought that they were important perhaps because it is the fashion of the anglosaxon race to put even a selfcreated idea of duty before personal safety or convenience  rightly or wrongly so things were settled for in such troublous conditions one can only do what seems best at the moment criticism subsequent to the event is always easy as many an unlucky commander has found out when the issue went awry but in emergency one must decide on something  the sun set the darkness fell and it began to rain and blow we started quite unobserved so far as we could tell and travelling downward from the overgrown ruined town gained the old road and in complete silence for the feet of camels make no noise passed along it toward the lights of harmac which now and again when the stormclouds lifted we saw glimmering in front of us and somewhat to our left  in all my long wanderings i cannot remember a more exciting or a more disagreeable journey the blackness relieved only from time to time by distant lightnings was that of the plagues of egypt the driving rain worked through the openings of our camelhair cloaks and the waterproofs we wore underneath them and wet us through the cold damp wind chilled us to the bone enervated as we were with the heat of the desert but these discomforts and they were serious enough we forgot in the tremendous issue of the enterprise should we win through to mur or as a crown to our many labours and sufferings should we perish presently on the road that was the question as i can assure the reader one that we found very urgent and interesting  three hours had gone by now we were opposite to the lights of harmac also to other lights that shone up a valley in the mountain to our right as yet everything was well for this we knew by the words whispered up and down the line  then of a sudden in front of us a light flashed although as yet it was a long way off next came another whispered message of halt so we halted and presently one of the front guides crept back informing us that a body of fung cavalry had appeared upon the road ahead we took counsel shadrach arrived from the rear and said that if we waited awhile they might go away as he thought that their presence must be accidental and connected with the great festival he implored us to be quite silent accordingly not knowing what to do we waited  now i think i have forgotten to say that the dog pharaoh to prevent accidents occupied a big basket this basket in which he often rode when tired being fixed upon one side of ormes camel here he lay peaceably enough until in an unlucky moment shadrach left me to go forward to talk to the captain whereon smelling his enemy pharaoh burst out into furious baying after that everything was confusion shadrach darted back toward the rear the light ahead began to move quickly advancing toward us the front camels left the road as i presume following their leader according to the custom of these beasts when marching in line  presently i know not how orme quick and myself found ourselves together in the darkness at the time we thought higgs was with us also but in this we were mistaken we heard shoutings and strange voices speaking a language that we could not understand by the sudden glare of a flash of lightning for the thunderstorm was now travelling over us we saw several things one of these was the professors ridingdromedary which could not be mistaken because of its pure white colour and queer method of holding its head to one side passing within ten yards between us and the road having a man upon its back who evidently was not the professor then it was that we discovered his absence and feared the worst  a fung has got his camel i said  no answered quick shadrach has got it i saw his ugly mug against the light  another vision was that of what appeared to be our baggage camels moving swiftly away from us but off the road which was occupied by a body of horsemen in white robes orme issued a brief order to the effect that we were to follow the camels with which the professor might be we started to obey but before we had covered twenty yards of the cornfield or whatever it was in which we were standing heard voices ahead that were not those of abati evidently the flash which showed the fung to us had done them a like service and they were now advancing to kill or capture us  there was only one thing to doturn and flyand this we did heading whither we knew not but managing to keep touch of each other  about a quarter of an hour later just as we were entering a grove of palms or other trees which hid everything in front of us the lightning blazed again though much more faintly for by this time the storm had passed over the mountains of mur leaving heavy rain behind it by the flash i who was riding last and as it chanced looking back over my shoulder saw that the fung horsemen were not fifty yards behind and hunting for us everywhere their line being extended over a long front i was however sure that they had not yet caught sight of us in the dense shadow of the trees  get on i said to the others they will be here presently and heard quick add  give your camel his head captain he can see in the dark and perhaps will take us back to the road  orme acted on this suggestion which as the blackness round us was pitchy seemed a good one at any rate it answered for off we went at a fair pace the three camels marching in line first over soft ground and afterwards on a road presently i thought that the rain had stopped since for a few seconds none fell on us but concluded from the echo of the camels feet and its recommencement that we had passed under some archway on we went and at length even through the gloom and rain i saw objects that looked like houses though if so there were no lights in them perhaps because the night drew toward morning a dreadful idea struck me we might be in harmac i passed it up for what it was worth  very likely whispered orme back perhaps these camels were bred here and are looking for their stables well there is only one thing to dogo on  so we went on for a long while only interfered with by the occasional attentions of some barking dog luckily of these pharaoh in his basket took no heed probably because it was his habit if another dog barked at him to pretend complete indifference until it came so near that he could spring and fight or kill it at length we appeared to pass under another archway after which a hundred and fifty yards or so further on the camels came to a sudden stop quick dismounted and presently i heard him say  doors can feel the brasswork on them tower above i think and wall on either side seem to be in a trap best stop here till light comes nothing else to be done  accordingly we stopped and having tied the camels to each other to prevent their straying took shelter from the rain under the tower or whatever it might be to pass away the time and keep life in us for we were almost frozen with the wet and cold we ate some tinned food and biscuits that we carried in our saddlebags and drank a dram of brandy from quicks flask this warmed us a little though i do not think that a bottleful would have raised our spirits higgs whom we all loved was gone dead probably by that time the abati had lost or deserted us and we three white men appeared to have wandered into a savage stronghold where as soon as we were seen we should be trapped like birds in a net and butchered at our captors will certainly the position was not cheerful  overwhelmed with physical and mental misery i began to doze orme grew silent and the sergeant having remarked that there was no need to bother since what must be must be consoled himself in a corner by humming over and over again the verse of the hymn which begins       there is a blessed home beyond this land of woe      where trials never come nor tears of sorrow flow  fortunately for us shortly before dawn the tears of sorrow as represented by the rain ceased to flow the sky cleared showing the stars suddenly the vault of heaven was suffused with a wonderful and pearly light although on the earth the mist remained so thick that we could see nothing then above this sea of mist rose the great ball of the sun but still we could see nothing that was more than a few yards away from us  there is a blessed home beyond this land of woe  droned quick beneath his breath for about the fiftieth time since apparently he knew no other hymn which he considered suitable to our circumstances then ejaculated suddenly  hullo heres a stair with your leave ill go up it captain and he did  a minute later we heard his voice calling us softly  come here gentlemen he said and see something worth looking at  so we scrambled up the steps and as i rather expected found ourselves upon the top of one of two towers set above an archway which towers were part of a great protective work outside the southern gates of a city that could be none other than harmac soaring above the mist rose the mighty cliffs of mur that almost exactly opposite to us were pierced by a deep valley  into this valley the sunlight poured revealing a wondrous and aweinspiring object of which the base was surrounded by billowy vapours a huge couchant animal fashioned of black stone with a head carved to the likeness of that of a lion and crowned with the uraeus the aspcrested symbol of majesty in old egypt how big the creature might be it was impossible to say at that distance for we were quite a mile away from it but it was evident that no other monolithic monument that we had ever seen or heard of could approach its colossal dimensions  compared to this tremendous effigy indeed the boasted sphinx of gizeh seemed but a toy it was no less than a small mountain of rock shaped by the genius and patient labour of some departed race of men to the form of a lionheaded monster its majesty and awfulness set thus above the rolling mists in the red light of the morning reflected on it from the towering precipices beyond were literally indescribable even in our miserable state they oppressed and overcame us so that for awhile we were silent then we spoke each after his own manner  the idol of the fung said i no wonder that savages should take it for a god  the greatest monolith in all the world muttered orme and higgs is dead oh if only he had lived to see it he would have gone happy i wish it had been i who was taken i wish it had been i and he wrung his hands for it is the nature of oliver orme always to think of others before himself  thats what we have come to blow up soliloquized quick well those azure stingingbees or whatever they call the stuff he meant azoimides are pretty active but it will take a lot of stirring if ever we get there seems a pity too for the old pussy is handsome in his way  come down said orme we must find out where we are perhaps we can escape in the mist  one moment i answered do you see that and i pointed to a needlelike rock that pierced the fog about a mile to the south of the idol valley and say two miles from where we were thats the white rock it isnt white really but the vultures roost on it and make it look so i have never seen it before for i passed it in the night but i know that it marks the beginning of the cleft which runs up to mur you remember shadrach told us so well if we can get to that white rock we have a chance of life  orme studied it hurriedly and repeated come down we may be seen up here  we descended and began our investigations in feverish haste this was the sum of them in the arch under the tower were set two great doors covered with plates of copper or bronze beaten into curious shapes to represent animals and men and apparently very ancient these huge doors had grilles in them through which their defenders could peep out or shoot arrows what seemed more important to us however was that they lacked locks being secured only by thick bronze bolts and bars such as we could undo  lets clear out before the mist lifts said orme with luck we may get to the pass  we assented and i ran to the camels that lay resting just outside the arch before i reached them however quick called me back  look through there doctor he said pointing to one of the peepholes  i did so and in the dense mist saw a body of horsemen advancing toward the door  they must have seen us on the top of the wall fools that we were to go there exclaimed orme  next instant he started back not a second too soon for through the hole where his face had been flashed a spear which struck the ground beyond the archway also we heard other spears rattle upon the bronze plates of the doors  no luck said orme thats all up they mean to break in now i think we had better play a bold game got your rifles sergeant and doctor yes then choose your loopholes aim and empty the magazines into them dont waste a shot for heavens sake dont waste a shot nowonetwothree fire  fire we did into the dense mass of men who had dismounted and were running up to the doors to burst them open at that distance we could scarcely miss and the magazines of the repeating rifles held five shots apiece as the smoke cleared away i counted quite halfadozen fung down while some others were staggering off wounded also several of the men and horses beyond were struck by the bullets which had passed through the bodies of the fallen  the effect of this murderous discharge was instantaneous and remarkable brave though the fung might be they were quite unaccustomed to magazine rifles living as they did perfectly isolated and surrounded by a great river even if they had heard of such things and occasionally seen an old gaspipe musket that reached them in the course of trade of modern guns and their terrible power they knew nothing small blame to them therefore if their courage evaporated in face of a form of sudden death which to them must have been almost magical at any rate they fled incontinently leaving their dead and wounded on the ground  now again we thought of flight which perhaps would have proved our wisest course but hesitated because we could not believe that the fung had left the road clear or done more than retreat a little to wait for us while we lost time thus the mist thinned a great deal so much indeed that we could see our exact position in front of us towards the city side lay a wide open space whereof the walls ended against those of harmac itself to which they formed a kind of vestibule or antechamber set there to protect this gateway of the town through which we had ridden in the darkness not knowing whither we went  those inner doors are open said orme nodding his head toward the great portals upon the farther side of the square lets go see if we can shut them otherwise we shant hold this place long  so we ran across to the further doors that were similar to those through which we had just fired only larger and as we met nobody to interfere with our efforts found that the united strength of the three of us was just only just sufficient to turn first one and then the other of them upon its hinges and work the various bolts and bars into their respective places two men could never have done the job but being three and fairly desperate we managed it then we retreated to our archway and as nothing happened took the opportunity to eat and drink a few mouthfuls quick remarking sagely that we might as well die upon full as upon empty stomachs  when we had crossed the square the fog was thinning rapidly but as the sun rose sucking the vapours from the rainsoaked earth it thickened again for awhile  sergeant said orme presently these black men are bound to attack us soon now is the time to lay a mine while they cant see what we are after  i was just thinking the same thing captain the sooner the better replied quick perhaps the doctor will keep a watch here over the camels and if he sees any one stick up his head above the wall he might bid him goodmorning we know he is a nice shot is the doctor and he tapped my rifle  i nodded and the two of them set out laden with wires and the packages that looked like tobacco tins heading for a stone erection in the centre of the square which resembled an altar but was i believe a rostrum whence the native auctioneers sold slaves and other merchandise what they did there exactly i am sure i do not know indeed i was too much occupied in keeping a watch upon the walls whereof i could clearly see the crest above the mist to pay much attention to their proceedings  presently my vigilance was rewarded for over the great gateway opposite at a distance of about a hundred and fifty paces from me appeared some kind of a chieftain clad in white robes and wearing a very fine turban or coloured headdress who paraded up and down waving a spear defiantly and uttering loud shouts  this man i covered very carefully lying down to do so as quick had said i am a good rifle shot having practised that art for many years still one may always miss which although i bore no personal grudge against the poor fellow in the fine headdress on this occasion i did not wish to do the sudden and mysterious death of that savage would i felt sure produce a great effect among his people  at length he stopped exactly over the door and began to execute a kind of wardance turning his head from time to time to yell out something to others on the farther side of the wall this was my opportunity i covered him with as much care as though i were shooting at a target with one bulls eye to win aiming a little low in case the rifle should throw high very gently i pressed the trigger the cartridge exploded the bullet went on its way and the man on the wall stopped dancing and shouting and stood quite still clearly he had heard the shot or felt the wind of the ball but was untouched  i worked the lever jerking out the empty case preparatory to firing again but on looking up saw that there was no need for the fung captain was spinning round on his heels like a top three or four times he whirled thus with incredible rapidity then suddenly threw his arms wide and dived headlong from the wall like a bather from a plank but backward and was soon no more only from the farther side of those gates arose a wail of wrath and consternation  after this no other fung appeared upon the wall so i turned my attention to the spyhole in the doors behind me and seeing some horsemen moving about at a distance of four or five hundred yards on a rocky ridge where the mist did not lie i opened fire on them and at the second shot was fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle one of those with him who must have been a brave fellow instantly jumped down threw him dead or living over the horse leaped up behind him and galloped away accompanied by the others pursued by some probably ineffective bullets that i sent after them  now the road to the pass of mur seemed to be clear and i regretted that orme and quick were not with me to attempt escape indeed i meditated fetching or calling them when suddenly i saw them returning burying a wire or wires in the sand as they came and at the same time heard a noise of thunderous blows of which i could not mistake the meaning evidently the fung were breaking down the farther bronze doors with some kind of batteringram i ran out to meet them and told my news  well done said orme in a quiet voice now sergeant just join up those wires to the battery and be careful to screw them in tight you have tested it havent you doctor be good enough to unbar the gates no you cant do that alone ill help you presently look to the camels and tighten the girths these fung will have the doors down in a minute and then there will be no time to lose  what are you going to do i asked as i obeyed  show them some fireworks i hope bring the camels into the archway so that they cant foul the wire with their feet sostand still you grumbling brutes now for these bolts heavens how stiff they are i wonder why the fung dont grease them one door will donever mind the other  labouring furiously we got it undone and ajar so far as we could see there was no one in sight beyond scared by our bullets or for other reasons of their own the guard there appeared to have moved away  shall we take the risk and ride for it i suggested  no answered orme if we do even supposing there are no fung waiting beyond the rise those inside the town will soon catch us on their swift horses we must scare them before we bolt and then those that are left of them may let us alone now listen to me when i give the word you two take the camels outside and make them kneel about fifty yards away not nearer for i dont know the effective range of these new explosives it may be greater than i think i shall wait until the fung are well over the mine and then fire it after which i hope to join you if i dont ride as hard as you can go to that white rock and if you reach mur give my compliments to the child of kings or whatever she is called and say that although i have been prevented from waiting upon her sergeant quick understands as much about picrates as i do also get shadrach tried and hanged if he is guilty of higgss death poor old higgs how he would have enjoyed this  beg your pardon captain said quick but ill stay with you the doctor can see to the baggage animals  will you be good enough to obey orders and fall to the rear when you are told sergeant now no words it is necessary for the purposes of this expedition that one of us two should try to keep a whole skin  then sir pleaded quick maynt i take charge of the battery  no he answered sternly ah the doors are down at last and he pointed to a horde of fung mounted and on foot who poured through the gateway where they had stood shouting after their fashion and went on now then pick out the captains and pepper away i want to keep them back a bit so that they come on in a crowd not scattered  we took up our repeating rifles and did as orme told us and so dense was the mass of humanity opposite that if we missed one man we hit another killing or wounding a number of them the result of the loss of several of their leaders to say nothing of meaner folk was just what orme had foreseen the fung soldiers instead of rushing on independently spread to right and left until the whole farther side of the square filled up with thousands of them a veritable sea of men at which we pelted bullets as boys hurl stones at a wave  at length the pressure of those behind thrust onward those in front and the whole fierce tumultuous mob began to flow forward across the square a multitude bent on the destruction of three white men armed with these new and terrible weapons it was a very strange and thrilling sight never have i seen its like  now said orme stop firing and do as i bid you kneel the camels fifty yards outside the wall not less and wait till you know the end if we shouldnt meet again well goodbye and good luck  so we went quick literally weeping with shame and rage  good lord he exclaimed good lord to think that after four campaigns samuel quick sergeant of engineers with five medals should live to be sent off with the baggage like a potbellied bandmaster leaving his captain to fight about three thousand niggers singlehanded doctor if he dont come out you do the best you can for yourself for im going back to stop with him thats all there thats fifty paces down you go you ugly beasts and he bumped his camel viciously on the head with the butt of his rifle  from where we had halted we could only see through the archway into the space beyond by now the square looked like a great sunday meeting in hyde park being filled up with men of whom the first rows were already past the altarlike rostrum in its centre  why dont he loose off them stingingbees muttered quick oh i see his little game look and he pointed to the figure of orme who had crept behind the unopened half of the door on our side of it and was looking intently round its edge holding the battery in his right hand he wants to let them get nearer so as to make a bigger bag he  i heard no more of quicks remarks for suddenly something like an earthquake took place and the whole sky seemed to turn to one great flame i saw a length of the wall of the square rush outward and upward i saw the shut half of the bronzeplated door skipping and hopping playfully toward us and in front of it the figure of a man then it began to rain all sorts of things  for instance stones none of which hit us luckily and other more unpleasant objects it is a strange experience to be knocked backward by a dead fist separated from its parent body yet on this occasion this actually happened to me and what is more the fist had a spear in it the camels tried to rise and bolt but they are phlegmatic brutes and as ours were tired as well we succeeded in quieting them  whilst we were thus occupied somewhat automatically for the shock had dazed us the figure that had been propelled before the dancing door arrived reeling in a drunken fashion and through the dust and falling débris we knew it for that of oliver orme his face was blackened his clothes were torn half off him and blood from a scalp wound ran down his brown hair but in his right hand he still held the little electric battery and i knew at once that he had no limbs broken  very successful mine he said thickly boer melinite shells arent in it with this new compound come on before the enemy recover from the shock and he flung himself upon his camel  in another minute we had started at a trot toward the white rock whilst from the city of harmac behind us rose a wail of fear and misery we gained the top of the rise on which i had shot the horseman and as i expected found that the fung had posted a strong guard in the dip beyond out of reach of our bullets in order to cut us off should we attempt to escape now terrified by what had happened to them a supernatural catastrophe they were escaping themselves for we perceived them galloping off to the left and right as fast as their horses would carry them  so for awhile we went on unmolested though not very quickly because of ormes condition when we had covered about half the distance between us and the white rock i looked round and became aware that we were being pursued by a body of cavalry about a hundred strong which i supposed had emerged from some other gate of the city  flog the animals i shouted to quick or they will catch us after all  he did so and we advanced at a shambling gallop the horsemen gaining on us every moment now i thought that all was over especially when of a sudden from behind the white rock emerged a second squad of horsemen  cut off i exclaimed  suppose so sir answered quick but these seem a different crowd  i scanned them and saw that he was right they were a very different crowd for in front of them floated the abati banner which i could not mistake having studied it when i was a guest of the tribe a curious triangular green flag covered with golden hebrew characters surrounding the figure of solomon seated on a throne moreover immediately behind the banner in the midst of a bodyguard rode a delicately shaped woman clothed in pure white it was the child of kings herself  two more minutes and we were among them i halted my camel and looked round to see that the fung cavalry were retreating after the events of that morning clearly they had no stomach left for a fight with a superior force  the lady in white rode up to us  greetings friend she exclaimed to me for she knew me again at once now who is captain among you  i pointed to the shattered orme who sat swaying on his camel with eyes half closed  noble sir she said addressing him if you can tell me what has happened i am maqueda of the abati she who is named child of kings look at the symbol on my brow and you will see that i speak truth and throwing back her veil she revealed the coronet of gold that showed her rank    chapter vii  barung  at the sound of this soft voice the extreme softness of maquedas voice was always one of her greatest charms orme opened his eyes and stared at her  very queer dream i heard him mutter must be something in the mohammedan business after all extremely beautiful woman and that gold thing looks well on her dark hair  what does the lord your companion say asked maqueda of me  having first explained that he was suffering from shock i translated word for word whereon maqueda blushed to her lovely violet eyes and let fall her veil in a great hurry in the confusion which ensued i heard quick saying to his master  no no sir this one aint no houri shes a flesh and blood queen and the pleasantest to look at i ever clapped eyes on though a benighted african jew wake up captain wake up you are out of that hellfire now its got the fung not you  the word fung seemed to rouse orme  yes he said i understand the vapour of the stuff poisoned me but it is passing now adams ask that lady how many men shes got with her what does she say about five hundred well then let her attack harmac at once the outer and inner gates are down the fung think they have raised the devil and will run she can inflict a defeat on them from which they will not recover for years only it must be done at once before they get their nerve again for after all they are more frightened than hurt  maqueda listened to this advice intently  it is to my liking it is very good she said in her quaint archaic arabic when i had finished translating but i must consult my council where is my uncle the prince joshua  here lady answered a voice from the press behind out of which presently emerged mounted on a white horse a stout man well advanced in middle age with a swarthy complexion and remarkably round prominent eyes he was clad in the usual eastern robes richly worked over which he wore a shirt of chainmail and on his head a helmet with mail flaps an attire that gave the general effect of an obese crusader of the early norman period without his cross  is that joshua said orme who was wandering a little again rummylooking cock isnt he sergeant tell joshua that the walls of jericho are down so therell be no need to blow his own trumpet im sure from the look of him that hes a perfect devil with a trumpet  what does your companion say asked maqueda again  i translated the middle part of ormes remarks but neither the commencement nor the end but even these amused her very much for she burst out laughing and said pointing to harmac over which still hung a cloud of dust  yes yes joshua my uncle the walls of jericho are down and the question is will you not take your opportunity so in an hour or two we shall be dead or if god goes with us perhaps free from the menace of the fung for years  the prince joshua stared at her with his great prominent eyes then answered in a thick gobbling voice  are you mad child of kings of us abati here there are but five hundred men and of the fung yonder tens of thousands if we attacked they would eat us up can five hundred men stand against tens of thousands  it seems that three stood against them this morning and worked some damage my uncle but it is true those three are of a different race from the abati she added with bitter sarcasm then she turned to those behind her and cried who of my captains and council will accompany me if i who am but a woman dare to advance on harmac  now here and there a voice cried i will or some gorgeously dressed person stepped forward in a hesitating way and that was all  you see men of the west said maqueda after a little pause addressing us three i thank you for the great deeds that you have done and for your counsel but i cannot take it because my people are notwarlike and she covered her face with her hands  now there arose a great tumult among her followers who all began to talk at once joshua in particular drew a large sword and waved it shouting out a recital of the desperate actions of his youth and the names of fung chieftains whom he alleged he had killed in single combat  told you that fat cur was a firstclass trumpeter said orme languidly while the sergeant ejaculated in tones of deep disgust  good lord what a set why doctor they aint fit to savage a referee in a london football ground pharaoh there in his basket where he was barking loudly would make the whole lot run and if he was outoh my now then you porpoisethis he addressed to joshua who was flourishing his sword unpleasantly nearput your pasteboard up wont you or ill knock your fat head off whereon the prince who if he did not understand quicks words at any rate caught their meaning wonderfully well did as he was told and fell back  just then indeed there was a general movement up the pass in the wide mouth of which all this scene took place for suddenly three fung chieftains appeared galloping toward us one of whom was veiled with a napkin in which were cut eyeholes so universal was this retreat in fact that we three on our camels and the child of kings on her beautiful mare found ourselves left alone  an embassy said maqueda scanning the advancing horsemen who carried with them a white flag tied to the blade of a spear physician will you and your friends come with me and speak to these messengers and without even waiting for an answer she rode forward fifty yards or so on to the plain and there reined up and halted till we could bring our camels round and join her as we did so the three fung splendidlooking blackfaced fellows arrived at a furious gallop their lances pointed at us  stand still friends said maqueda they mean no harm  as the words passed her lips the fung pulled the horses to their haunches arabfashion lifted spears and saluted then their leadernot the veiled man but anotherspoke in a dialect that i who had spent so many years among the savages of the desert understood well enough especially as the base of it was arabic  o walda nagasta daughter of solomon he said we are the tongues of our sultan barung son of barung for a hundred generations and we speak his words to the brave white men who are your guests thus says barung like the fat one whom i have already captured you white men are heroes three of you alone you held the gate against my army with the weapons of the white man you killed us from afar here one and there one then at last with a great magic of thunder and lightning and earthquake you sent us by scores into the bosom of our god and shook down our walls about our ears and out of that hell you escaped yourselves  now o white men this is the offer of barung to you leave the curs of the abati the baboons who gibber and deck themselves out the rockrabbits who seek safety in the cliffs and come to him he will give you not only life but all your hearts desirelands and wives and horses great shall you be in his councils and happy shall you live moreover for your sakes he will try to spare your brother the fat one whose eyes look out of black windows who blows fire from his mouth and reviles his enemies as never man did before yes although the priests have doomed him to sacrifice at the next feast of harmac he will try to spare him which perhaps he can do by making him like the singer of egypt also a priest of harmac and thus dedicate forever to the god with whom indeed he says he had been familiar for thousands of years this is our message o white men  now when i had translated the substance of this oration to orme and quick for as i saw by the quiver that passed through her at the fung insults upon her tribe maqueda understood it their tongues not differing greatly orme who for the time at any rate was almost himself again said  tell these fellows to say to their sultan that he is a good old boy and that we thank him very much also that we are sorry to have been obliged to kill so many of them in a way that he must have thought unsportsmanlike but we had to do it as we are sure he will understand in order to save our skins tell him also that speaking personally having sampled the abati yonder and on our journey i should like to accept his invitation but although as yet we have found no men among them only as he says baboons rockrabbits and boasters without a fight in them we haveand here he bowed his bleeding head to maquedafound a woman with a great heart of her salt we have eaten or are about to eat to serve her we have come from far upon her camels and unless she should be pleased to accompany us we cannot desert her  all of this i rendered faithfully while every one and especially maqueda listened with much attention when they had considered our words the spokesman of the messengers replied to the effect that the motives of our decision were of a nature that commanded their entire respect and sympathy especially as their people quite concurred in our estimate of the character of the abati ruler child of kings this being so they would amend their proposition knowing the mind of their sultan and having indeed plenipotentiary powers  lady of mur he went on addressing maqueda directly fair daughter of the great god harmac and a mortal queen what we have offered to the white lords your guests we offer to you also barung our sultan shall make you his head wife or if that does not please you you shall wed whom you willand perhaps by accident the envoys roving eyes rested for a moment upon oliver orme  leave then your rockrabbits who dare not quit their cliffs when but three messengers wait without with sticks and he glanced at the spear in his hand and come to dwell among men listen high lady we know your case you do your best in a hopeless task had it not been for you and your courage mur would have been ours three years ago and it was ours before your tribe wandered thither but while you can find but a hundred brave warriors to help you you think the place impregnable and you have perhaps that number though we know they are not here they guard the gates above yes with a few of your mountaineers whose hearts are as those of their forefathers were so far as you have defied all the power of the fung and when you saw that the end drew near using your womans wit you sent for the white men to come with their magic promising to pay them with the gold which you have in such plenty in the tombs of our old kings and in the rocks of the mountains  who told you that o tongue of barung asked maqueda in a low voice speaking for the first time the man of the west whom you took prisonerhe whom you call fat one  no no o walda nagasta the lord black windows has told us nothing as yet except sundry things about the history of our god with whom as we said he seems to be familiar and to whom therefore we vowed him at once but there are others who tell us things for in times of truce our peoples trade together a little and cowards are often spies for instance we knew that these white men were coming last night though it is true that we did not know of their fire magic for had we done so we should not have let the camels slip through since there may be more of it on them  for your comfort learn that there ismuch more i interrupted  ah replied the tongue shaking his head sadly and yet we suffered cat whom you call shadrach to make off with that of your fat brother yes and even gave it to him after his own beast had been lamed by accident well it is our bad luck and without doubt harmac is angry with us today but your answer o walda nagasta your answer o rose of mur  what can it be o voices of barung the sultan replied maqueda you know that by my blood and by my oath of office i am sworn to protect mur to the last  and so you shall pleaded the tongue for when we have cleaned it of baboons and rockrabbits which if you were among us we soon should do and thus fulfilled our oath to regain our ancient secret city of the rocks we will set you there once more as its lady under barung and give you a multitude of subjects of whom you may be proud  it may not be o tongue for they would be worshippers of harmac and between jehovah whom i serve and harmac there is war she answered with spirit  yes sweetsmelling bud of the rose there is war and let it be admitted that the first battle has gone against harmac thanks to the magic of the white men yet yonder he sits in his glory as the spirits his servants fashioned him in the beginning and he pointed with his spear toward the valley of the idol you know our prophecythat until harmac rises from his seat and flies away for where he goes the fung must followtill then i say we shall hold the plains and the city of his namethat is for ever  for ever is a long word o mouth of barung then she paused a little and added slowly did not certain of the gates of harmac fly far this morning now what if your god should follow his gates and those worshippers who went with them and be seen no more or what if the earth should open and swallow him so that he goes down to hell whither you cannot follow or what if the mountains should fall together and bury him from your sight eternally or what if the lightnings should leap out and shatter him to dust  at these ominous words the envoys shivered and it seemed to me that their faces for a moment turned grey  then o child of kings answered the spokesman solemnly the fung will acknowledge that your god is greater than our god and that our glory is departed  thus he spoke and was silent turning his eyes toward the third messenger he who wore a cloth or napkin upon his head that was pierced with eyeholes and hung down to the breast with a quick motion the man dragged off this veil and threw it to the ground revealing a very noble countenance not black like that of his followers but coppercoloured he was about fifty years of age with deepset flashing eyes hooked nose and a flowing grizzled beard the collar of gold about his neck showed that his rank was high but when we noticed a second ornament of gold also upon his brow we knew that it must be supreme for this ornament was nothing less than the symbol of royalty once worn by the ancient pharaohs of egypt the double snakes of the uraeus bending forward as though to strike which as we had seen rose also from the brow of the lionheaded sphinx of harmac  as he uncovered his two companions leapt to the ground and prostrated themselves before him crying barung barung while all three of us englishmen saluted involuntarily i think and even the child of kings bowed  the sultan acknowledged our greetings by raising his spear then he spoke in a grave measured voice  o walda nagasta and you white men sons of great fathers i have listened to the talk between you and my servants i confirm their words and i add to them i am sorry that my generals tried to kill you last night i was making prayer to my god or it should not have happened i have been well repaid for that deed since an army should not make war upon four men even though by their secret power four men can defeat an army i beseech you and you also rose of mur to accept my proffered friendship since otherwise ere long you will soon be dead and your wisdom will perish with you for i am weary of this little war against a handful whom we despise  o walda nagasta you have breathed threats against the majesty of harmac but he is too strong for you nor may the might that can turn a few bricks to dust and shatter the bones of men prevail against him who is shaped from the heart of a mountain and holds the spirit of eternity so at least i think but even if it is decreed otherwise what will that avail you if it should please the god to leave us because of your arts the fung will still remain to avenge him ere they follow then i swear to you by my majesty and by the bones of my ancestors who sit in the caves of mur that i will spare but one of the abati jews yourself o child of kings because of your great heart and the three white men your guests should they survive the battle because of their courage and their wisdom as for their brother black windows whom i have captured he must be sacrificed since i have sworn it unless you yield when i will plead for his life to the god with what result i cannot tell yield then and i will not even slay the abati they shall live on and serve the fung as slaves and minister to the glory of harmac  it may not be it may not be maqueda answered striking the pommel of her saddle with her small hand shall jehovah whom solomon my father worshipped jehovah of all the generations do homage to an idol shaped by the hands he made my people are worn out they have forgot their faith and gone astray as did israel in the desert i know it it may even happen that the time has come for them to perish who are no longer warriors as of old well if so let them die free and not as slaves at least i in whom their best blood runs do not seek your mercy o barung ill be no plaything in your house who at the worst can always die having done my duty to my god and those who bred me thus i answer you as the child of many kings yet as a woman she added in a gentler voice i thank you for your courtesy when i am slain barung if i am fated to be slain think kindly of me as one who did her best against mighty odds and her voice broke  that i shall always do he answered gravely is it ended  not quite she answered these western lords i give them to you i absolve them from their promise why should they perish in a lost cause if they take their wisdom to you to use against me you have vowed them their lives and perhaps that of their brother your captive there is a slave of yours alsoyou spoke of him or your servant didsinger of egypt is his name one of them knew him as a child perchance you will not refuse him to that man  she paused but barung made no answer  go my friends she went on turning toward us i thank you for your long journey on my behalf and the blow you have struck for me and in payment i will send you a gift of gold the sultan will see it safe into your hands i thank you i wish i could have known more of you but mayhap we shall meet again in war farewell  she ceased and i could see that she was watching us intently through her thin veil the sultan also watched us stroking his long beard a look of speculation in his eyes for evidently this play interested him and he wondered how it would end  this wont do said orme when he understood the thing higgs would never forgive us if we ate dirt just on the offchance of saving him from sacrifice hes too straightminded on big things but of course doctor he added jerkily you have interests of your own and must decide for yourself i think i can speak for the sergeant  i have decided i answered i hope that my son would never forgive me either but if it is otherwise why so it must be also barung has made no promises about him  tell him then said orme my head aches infernally and i want to go to bed above ground or under it  so i told him although to speak the truth i felt like a man with a knife in his heart for it was bitter to come so near to the desire of years to the love of life and then to lose all hope just because of duty to the head woman of a pack of effete curs to whom one had chanced to make a promise in order to gain this very end if we could have surrendered with honour at least i should have seen my son whom now i might never see again  one thing however i added on the spur of the momentnamely a request that the sultan would tell the professor every word that had passed in order that whatever happened to him he might know the exact situation  my harmac said barung when he had heard how disappointed should i have been with you if you had answered otherwise when a woman showed you the way i have heard of you english beforearabs and traders brought me tales of you for instance there was one who died defending a city against a worshipper of the prophet who called himself a prophet down yonder at khartoum on the nilea great death they told me a great death which your people avenged afterwards  well i did not quite believe the story and i wished to judge of it by you i have judged white lords i have judged and i am sure that your fat brother black windows will be proud of you even in the lions jaws fear not he shall hear every word the singer of egypt who it appears can talk his tongue shall tell the tale to him and make a song of it to be sung over your honourable graves and now farewell may it be my lot to cross swords with one of you before all is done that shall not be yet for you need rest especially yonder tall son of a god who is wounded and he pointed to orme child of kings with a heart of kings permit me to kiss your hand and to lead you back to your people that i would were more worthy of you ah yes i would that we were your people  maqueda stretched out her hand and taking it the sultan barely touched her fingers with his lips then still holding them he rode with her toward the pass  as we approached its mouth where the abati were crowded together watching our conference i heard them murmur the sultan the sultan himself and saw the prince joshua mutter some eager words to the officers about him  look out doctor said quick into my ear unless im mistook that porpoise is going to play some game  hardly were the words out of his mouth when uttering the most valiant shouts and with swords drawn joshua and a body of his companions galloped up and surrounded our little group  now yield barung bellowed joshua yield or die  the sultan stared at him in astonishment then answered  if i had any weapon he had thrown down his lance when he took maqueda by the hand certainly one of us should die o hog in mans clothes  then he turned to maqueda and added child of kings i knew these people of yours to be cowardly and treacherous but is it thus that you suffer them to deal with envoys under a flag of peace  not so not so she cried my uncle joshua you disgrace me you make our people a shame a hissing and a reproach stand back let the sultan of the fung go free  but they would not the prize was too great to be readily disgorged  we looked at each other not at all the game said orme if they collar him we shall be tarred with their extremely dirty brush shove your camel in front sergeant and if that beggar joshua tries any tricks put a bullet through him  quick did not need to be told twice banging his dromedarys ribs with the butt end of his rifle he drove it straight on to joshua shouting  out of the light porpoise with the result that the princes horse took fright and reared up so high that its rider slid off over its tail to find himself seated on the ground a sorry spectacle in his gorgeous robes and armour  taking advantage of the confusion which ensued we surrounded the sultan and escorted him out of the throng back to his two companions who seeing that there was something amiss were galloping toward us  i am your debtor said barung but o white men make me more so return i pray you to that hog in armour and say that barung sultan of the fung understands from his conduct that he desires to challenge him to single combat and that seeing he is fully armed the sultan although he wears no mail awaits him here and now  so i went at once with the message but joshua was far too clever to be drawn into any such dangerous adventure  nothing he said would have given him greater joy than to hack the head from the shoulders of this dog of a gentile sheik but unhappily owing to the conduct of one of us foreigners he had been thrown from his horse and hurt his back so that he could scarcely stand much less fight a duel  so i returned with my answer whereat barung smiled and said nothing only taking from his neck a gold chain which he wore he proffered it to quick who as he said had induced the prince joshua to show his horsemanship if not his courage then he bowed to us one by one and before the abati could make up their mind whether to follow him or not galloped off swiftly with his companions toward harmac  such was our introduction to barung sultan of the fung a barbarian with many good points among them courage generosity and appreciation of those qualities even in a foe characteristics that may have been intensified by the blood of his mother who i am told was an arab of high lineage captured by the fung in war and given as a wife to the father of barung    chapter viii  the shadow of fate  our ride from the plains up the pass that led to the high tableland of mur was long and in its way wonderful enough i doubt whether in the whole world there exists another home of men more marvellously defended by nature apparently the road by which we climbed was cut in the first instance not by human hands but by the action of primæval floods pouring perhaps from the huge lake which doubtless once covered the whole area within the circle of the mountains although today it is but a moderatesized sheet of water about twenty miles long by ten in breadth however this may be the old inhabitants had worked on it the marks of their tools may still be seen upon the rock  for the first mile or two the road is broad and the ascent so gentle that my horse was able to gallop up it on that dreadful night when after seeing my sons face accident or rather providence enabled me to escape the fung but from the spot where the lions pulled the poor beast down its character changes in places it is so narrow that travellers must advance in single file between walls of rock hundreds of feet high where the sky above looks like a blue ribbon and even at midday the path below is plunged in gloom at other spots the slope is so precipitous that beasts of burden can scarcely keep their foothold indeed we were soon obliged to transfer ourselves from the camels to horses accustomed to the rocks at others again it follows the brink of a yawning precipice an ugly place to ride or turn rectangular corners which halfadozen men could hold against an army and twice it passes through tunnels though whether these are natural i do not know  besides all these obstacles to an invader there were strong gates at intervals with towers near by where guards were stationed night and day and fosses or dry moats in front of them which could only be crossed by means of drawbridges so the reader will easily understand how it came about that whatever the cowardice of the abati though they strove for generations the fung had as yet never been able to recapture the ancient stronghold which or so it is said in the beginning these abati won from them by means of an oriental trick  here i should add that although there are two other roads to the plainsthat by which in order to outflank the fung the camels were let down when i started on my embassy to egypt and that to the north where the great swamps liethese are both of them equally if not more impassable at any rate to an enemy attacking from below  a strange cavalcade we must have seemed as we crawled up this terrific approach first went a body of the abati notables on horseback forming a long line of colour and glittering steel who chattered as they rode for they seemed to have no idea of discipline next came a company of horsemen armed with spears or rather two companies in the centre of which rode the child of kings some of her courtiers and chief officers and ourselves perhaps as quick suggested because infantry in the event of surprise would find it less easy to run away than those who were mounted upon horses last of all rode more cavalry the duty of whose rear files it was to turn from time to time and after inspection to shout out that we were not pursued  it cannot be said that we who occupied the centre of the advance were a cheerful band orme although so far he had borne up was evidently very ill from the shock of the explosion so much so that men had to be set on each side of him to see that he did not fall from the saddle also he was deeply depressed by the fact that honour had forced us to abandon higgs to what seemed a certain and probably a cruel death and if he felt thus what was my own case who left not only my friend but also my son in the hands of savage heathens  maquedas face was not visible because of the thin spangled veil that she wore but there was something about her attitude suggestive of shame and of despair the droop of the head and even her back showed this as i who rode a little behind and on side of her could see i think too that she was anxious about orme for she turned toward him several times as though studying his condition also i am sure that she was indignant with joshua and others of her officers for when they spoke to her she would not answer or take the slightest notice of them beyond straightening herself in the saddle as for the prince himself his temper seemed to be much ruffled although apparently he had overcome the hurt to his back which prevented him from accepting the sultans challenge for at a difficult spot in the road he dismounted and ran along actively enough at any rate when his subordinates addressed him he only answered them with muttered oaths and his attitude towards us englishmen especially quick was not amiable indeed if looks could have killed us i am sure that we should all have been dead before ever we reached the gate of mur  this socalled gate was the upper mouth of the pass whence first we saw lying beneath us the vast mountainringed plain beyond it was a beautiful sight in the sunshine almost at our feet halfhidden in palms and other trees lay the flatroofed town itself a place of considerable extent as every house of any consequence seemed to be set in a garden since here there was no need for cramping walls and defensive works beyond it to the northward farther than the eye could reach stretching down a gentle slope to the faroff shores of the great lake of glistening water were cultivated fields and amongst them villas and here and there hamlets  whatever might be the faults of the abati evidently they were skilled husbandsmen such as their reputed forefathers the old inhabitants of judæa must have been before them for of that strain presumably some trace was still present in their veins however far he may have drifted from such pursuits originally the jew was a tiller of the soil and here where many of his other characteristics had evaporated under pressure of circumstancesnotably the fierce courage that titus knewthis taste remained to him if only by tradition  indeed having no other outlet for their energies and none with whom to trade the interests of the abati were centred in the land for and by the land they lived and died and since the amount available was limited by the mountain wall he who had most land was great amongst them he who had little land was small he who had no land was practically a slave their law was in its essentials a law of the land their ambitions their crimes everything to do with them were concerned with the land upon the produce of which they existed and grew rich some of them by means of a system of barter they had no coinage their money being measures of corn or other produce horses camels acres of their equivalent of soil and so forth  and yet oddly enough their country is the richest in gold and other metals that i have ever heard of even in africaso rich that according to higgs the old egyptians drew bullion from it to the value of millions of pounds every year this indeed i can well believe for i have seen the ancient mines which were worked for the most part as open quarries still showing plenty of visible gold on the face of the slopes yet to these alleged jews this gold was of no account imagine it as quick said such a topsyturvy state of things was enough to make a mere christian feel cold down the back and go to bed thinking that the world must be coming to an end  to return the prince joshua who appeared to be generalissimo of the army in what was evidently a set phrase exhorted the guards at the last gates to be brave and if need were deal with the heathen as some one or other dealt with og king of bashan and other unlucky persons of a different faith in reply he received their earnest congratulations upon his escape from the frightful dangers of our journey  these formalities concluded casting off the iron discipline of war we descended a joyous mob or rather the abati did to partake of the delights of peace really conquerors returning from some desperate adventure could not have been more warmly greeted as we entered the suburbs of the town women some of them very handsome ran out and embraced their lords or lovers holding up babies for them to kiss and a little farther on children appeared throwing roses and pomegranate flowers before their triumphant feet and all this because these gallant men had ridden to the bottom of a pass and back again  heavens doctor exclaimed the sardonic quick after taking note of these demonstrations heavens what a hero i feel myself to be and to think that when i got back from the war with them boers after being left for dead on spion kop with a bullet through my lung and mentioned in a dispatchyes i sergeant quick mentioned in a dispatch by the biggest ass of a general as ever i clapped eyes on for a job that i wont detail no one in my native village ever took no note of me although i had written to the parish clerk who happens to be my brotherinlaw and told him the train i was coming by i tell you doctor no one so much as stood me a pint of beer let alone wine and he pointed to a lady who was proffering that beverage to some one whom she admired  and as for chucking their arms round my neck and kissing me and he indicated another episode all my old mother saidshe was alive thenwas that she hoped id done fooling about furrin parts as i called soldiering and come home to live respectable better late than never well doctor circumstances alter cases or blood and climate do which is the same thing and i didnt miss what i never expected why should i when others like the captain there who had done so much more fared worse but lord these abati are a sickening lot and i wish we were clear of them old barungs the boy for me  passing down the main street of this charming town of mur accompanied by these joyous demonstrators we came at last to its central square a large open space where in the moist and genial climate for the high surrounding mountains attracted plentiful showers of rain trees and flowers grew luxuriantly at the head of this square stood a long low building with whitewashed walls and gilded domes backed by the towering cliff but at a little distance from it and surrounded by double walls with a moat of water between them dug for purposes of defence  this was the palace which on my previous visit i had only entered once or twice when i was received by the child of kings in formal audience round the rest of this square each placed in its own garden were the houses of the great nobles and officials and at its western end among other public buildings a synagogue or temple which looked like a model of that built by solomon in jerusalem from the description of which it had indeed been copied though of course upon a small scale  at the gate of the palace we halted and joshua riding up asked maqueda sulkily whether he should conduct the gentiles for that was his polite description of us to the lodging for pilgrims in the western town  no my uncle answered maqueda these foreign lords will be housed in the guestwing of the palace  in the guestwing of the palace it is not usual gobbled joshua swelling himself out like a great turkey cock remember o niece that you are still unmarried i do not yet dwell in the palace to protect you  so i found out in the plain yonder she replied still i managed to protect myself now i pray you no words i think it necessary that these my guests should be where their goods already are in the safest place in mur you my uncle as you told us are badly hurt by which accident you were prevented from accepting the challenge of the sultan of the fung go then and rest i will send the court physician to you at once goodnight my uncle when you are recovered we will meet again for we have much that we must discuss nay nay you are most kind but i will not detain you another minute seek your bed my uncle and forget not to thank god for your escape from many perils  at this polite mockery joshua turned perfectly pale with rage like the turkey cock when his wattles fade from scarlet into white before he could make any answer however maqueda had vanished under the archway so his only resource was to curse us and especially quick who had caused him to fall from his horse unfortunately the sergeant understood quite enough arabic to be aware of the tenor of his remarks which he resented and returned  shut it porpoise he said and keep your eyes where nature put em or theyll fall out  what says the gentile spluttered joshua whereon orme waking up from one of his fits of lethargy replied in arabic  he says that he prays you o prince of princes to close your noble mouth and to keep your highbred eyes within their sockets lest you should lose them at which words those who were listening broke into a fit of laughter for one redeeming characteristic among the abati was that they had a sense of humour  after this i do not quite know what happened for orme showed signs of fainting and i had to attend to him when i looked round again the gates were shut and we were being conducted toward the guestwing of the palace by a number of gaily dressed attendants  they took us to our roomscool lofty chambers ornamented with glazed tiles of quaint colour and beautiful design and furnished somewhat scantily with articles made of richhued woods this guestwing of the palace where these rooms were situated formed we noted a separate house having its own gateway but so far as we could see no passage or other connection joining it to the main building in front of it was a small garden and at its back a courtyard with buildings in which we were informed our camels had been stabled at the time we noted no more for night was falling and even if it had not been we were too worn out to make researches  moreover orme was now desperately illso ill that he could scarcely walk leaning even on our shoulders still he would not be satisfied till he was sure that our stores were safe and before he could be persuaded to lie down insisted upon being supported to a vault with copperbound doors which the officers opened revealing the packages that had been taken from the camels  count them sergeant he said and quick obeyed by the light of a lamp that the officer held at the open door all correct sir he said so far as i can make out  very good sergeant lock the door and take the keys  again he obeyed and when the officer demurred to their surrender turned on him so fiercely that the man thought better of it and departed with a shrug of his shoulders as i supposed to make report to his superiors  then at length we got orme to bed and as he complained of intolerable pains in his head and would take nothing but some milk and water having first ascertained that he had no serious physical injuries that i could discover i administered to him a strong sleepingdraught from my little travelling medicine case to our great relief this took effect upon him in about twenty minutes causing him to sink into a stupor from which he did not awake for many hours  quick and i washed ourselves ate some food that was brought to us and then took turns to watch orme throughout the night when i was at my post about six oclock on the following morning he woke up and asked for drink which i gave to him after swallowing it he began to wander in his mind and on taking his temperature i found that he had over five degrees of fever the end of it was that he went off to sleep again only waking up from time to time and asking for more drink  twice during the night and early morning maqueda sent to inquire as to his condition and apparently not satisfied with the replies about ten in the forenoon arrived herself accompanied by two waitingladies and a longbearded old gentleman who i understood was the court physician  may i see him she asked anxiously  i answered yes if she and those with her were quite quiet then i led them into the darkened room where quick stood like a statue at the head of the bed only acknowledging her presence with a silent salute she gazed at olivers flushed face and the forehead blackened where the gases from the explosion had struck him and as she gazed i saw her beautiful violet eyes fill with tears then abruptly she turned and left the sickchamber outside its doors she waved back her attendants imperiously and asked me in a whisper  will he live  i do not know i answered for i thought it best that she should learn the truth if he is only suffering from shock fatigue and fever i think so but if the explosion or the blow on his head where it cut has fractured the skull then  save him she muttered i will give you all inay pardon me what need is there to tempt you his friend with reward only save him save him  i will do what i can lady but the issue is in other hands than mine i answered and just then her attendants came up and put an end to the conversation  to this day the memory of that old rabbi the court physician affects me like a nightmare for of all the medical fools that ever i met he was by far the most preeminent all about the place he followed me suggesting remedies that would have been absurd even in the middle ages the least harmful of them i remember was that poor ormes head should be plastered with a compound of butter and the bones of a stillborn child and that he should be given some filthy compound to drink which had been specially blessed by the priests others there were also that would certainly have killed him in halfanhour  well i got rid of him at last for the time and returned to my vigil it was melancholy work since no skill that i had could tell me whether my patient would live or die nowadays the young men might know or say that they did but it must be remembered that as a doctor i am entirely superannuated how could it be otherwise seeing that i have passed the best of my life in the desert without any opportunity of keeping up with the times  three days went by in this fashion and very anxious days they were for my part although i said nothing of it to any one i believed that there was some injury to the patients skull and that he would die or at best be paralyzed quick however had a different opinion he said that he had seen two men in this state before from the concussion caused by the bursting of large shells near to them and that they both recovered although one of them became an idiot  but it was maqueda who first gave me any definite hope on the third evening she came and sat by orme for awhile her attendants standing at a little distance when she left him there was a new look upon her facea very joyful lookwhich caused me to ask her what had happened  oh he will live she answered  i inquired what made her think so  this she replied blushing suddenly he looked up and in my own tongue asked me of what colour were my eyes i answered that it depended upon the light in which they might be seen  not at all he said they are always violet whether the curtain is drawn or no now physician adams tell me what is this colour violet  that of a little wild flower which grows in the west in the spring o maquedaa very beautiful and sweetscented flower which is dark blue like your eyes  indeed physician she said well i do not know this flower but what of that your friend will live and be sane a dying man does not trouble about the colour of a ladys eyes and one who is mad does not give that colour right  are you glad o child of kings i asked  of course she answered seeing that i am told that this captain alone can handle the firestuffs which you have brought with you and therefore that it is necessary to me that he should not die  i understand i replied let us pray that we may keep him alive but there are many kinds of firestuffs o maqueda and of one of them which chances to give out violet flames i am not sure that my friend is master yet in this country it may be the most dangerous of all  now when she heard these words the child of kings looked me up and down angrily then suddenly she laughed a little in a kind of silent way that is peculiar to her and without saying anything beckoned to her ladies and left the place  very variegated thing woman sir remarked quick who was watching i think he meant to say variable this one for instance comes up that passage like a tired horseshuffle shuffle shufflefor i could hear the heels of her slippers on the floor but now she goes out like a buck seeking its matehead in air and hoof lifted how do you explain it doctor  you had better ask the lady herself quick did the captain take that soup she brought him  every drop sir and tried to kiss her hand afterward being still dazed poor man poor man i saw him do it knowing no better hell be sorry enough when he comes to himself  no doubt sergeant but meanwhile let us be glad that both their spirits seem to have improved and if she brings any more soup when i am not there i should let him have it it is always well to humour invalids and women  yes doctor but he added with a sudden fall of face invalids recover sometimes and then how about the women  sufficient to the day is the evil thereof i answered you had better go out for exercise it is my watch but to myself i thought that fate was already throwing its ominous shadow before and that it lay deep in maquedas violet eyes  well to cut a long story short this was the turningpoint of ormes illness and from that day he recovered rapidly for as it proved there was no secret injury to the skull and he was suffering from nothing except shock and fever during his convalescence the child of kings came to see him several times or to be accurate if my memory serves me right every afternoon of course her visits were those of ceremonythat is to say she was always accompanied by several of her ladies that thorn in my flesh the old doctor and one or two secretaries and officersinwaiting  but as oliver was now moved by day into a huge reception room and these people of the court were expected to stop at one end of it while she conversed with him at the other to all intents and purposes save for the presence of myself and quick her calls were of a private nature nor were we always present since now that my patient was out of danger the sergeant and i went out riding a good dealinvestigating mur and its surroundings  it may be asked what they talked about on these occasions i can only answer that so far as i heard the general subject was the politics of mur and its perpetual war with the fung still there must have been other topics which i did not hear since incidently i discovered that orme was acquainted with many of maquedas private affairs whereof he could only have learned from her lips  thus when i ventured to remark that perhaps it was not altogether wise for a young man in his position to become so intimate with the hereditary ruler of an exclusive tribe like the abati he replied cheerfully that this did not in the least matter as of course according to their ancient laws she could only marry with one of her own family a fact which made all complications impossible i inquired which of her cousins of whom i knew she had several was the happy man he replied  none of them as a matter of fact i believe that she is officially affianced to that fat uncle of hers the fellow who blows his own trumpet so much but i neednt add that this is only a form to which she submits in order to keep the others off  ah i said i wonder if prince joshua thinks it only a form  dont know what he thinks and dont care he replied yawning i only know that things stand as i say and that the porpoiseman has as much chance of becoming the husband of maqueda as you have of marrying the empress of china and now to drop this matrimonial conversation and come to something more important have you heard anything about higgs and your son  you are more in the way of learning state secrets than i am orme i answered sarcastically being rather irritated at the course of events and his foolishness what have you heard  this old fellow i cant say how she knows it but maqueda says that they are both in good health and well treated only our friend barung sticks to his word and proposes to sacrifice poor old higgs on this day fortnight now of course that must be prevented somehow and prevented it shall be if it costs me my life dont you suppose that i have been thinking about myself all the time for it isnt so only the trouble is that i cant find any plan of rescue which will hold water  then whats to be done orme i havent spoken much of the matter before for fear of upsetting you when you were still weak but now that you are all right again we must come to some decision  i know i know he answered earnestly and i tell you this that rather than let higgs die alone there i will give myself up to barung and if i cant save him suffer with him or for him if i can listen there is to be a great council held by the child of kings on the day after tomorrow which we must attend for it has only been postponed until i was well enough at this council that rogue shadrach is to be put upon his trial and will i believe be condemned to death also we are formally to return shebas ring which maqueda lent to you to be used in proof of her story well we may learn something then or at any rate must make up our minds to definite action and now i am to have my first ride am i not come on pharaoh he added to the dog which had stuck at his bedside all through his illness so closely that it was difficult to entice him away even to eat we are going for a ride pharaoh do you hear that you faithful beast    chapter ix  the swearing of the oath  two or three days after this conversation i forget exactly which it was maqueda held her council in the great hall of the palace when we entered the place in charge of a guard as though we were prisoners we found some hundreds of abati gathered there who were seated in orderly rows upon benches at the farther end in an apseshaped space sat the child of kings herself on a gilded or perhaps a golden chair of which the arms terminated in lions heads she was dressed in a robe of glittering silver and wore a ceremonial veil embroidered with stars also of silver and above it set upon her dark hair a little circlet of gold in which shone a single gem that looked like a ruby thus attired although her stature is small her appearance was very dignified and beautiful especially as the gossamer veil added mystery to her face  behind the throne stood soldiers armed with spears and swords and at its sides and in front of it were gathered her court to the number of a hundred or more including her waitingladies who in two companies were arranged to the right and left each member of this court was gorgeously dressed according to his profession  there were the generals and captains with prince joshua at the head of them in their normanlike chain armour there were judges in black robes and priests in gorgeous garments there were territorial lords of whose attire i remember only that they wore high boots and men who were called marketmasters whose business it was to regulate the rate of exchange of products and with them the representatives of other trades  in short here was collected all the aristocracy of the little population of the town and territory of mur every one of whom as we found afterwards possessed some highsounding title answering to those of our dukes and lords and right honourables and knights to say nothing of the princes of the blood of whom joshua was the first  really although it looked so fine and gay the spectacle was in a sense piteous being evidently but a poor mockery and survival of the pageantry of a people that had once been great the vast hall in which they were assembled showed this since although the occasion was one that excited public interest it was after all but a quarter filled by those who had a right to be present  with much dignity and to the sound of music we were marched up the broad nave if i may describe it thus for the building with its apse and supporting cedar columns bore some resemblance to a cathedral till we reached the open space in front of the throne where our guards prostrated themselves in their eastern fashion and we saluted its occupant in our own then chairs having been given to us after a pause a trumpet blew and from a side chamber was produced our late guide shadrach heavily manacled and looking extremely frightened  the trial that followed i need not describe at length it took a long while and the three of us were called upon to give evidence as to the quarrel between our companion the professor and the prisoner about the dog pharaoh and other matters the testimony however that proclaimed the guilt of shadrach was that of his companion guides who it appeared had been threatened with floggings unless they told the truth  these men swore one after the other that the abandonment of higgs had been a preconceived plan several of them added that shadrach was in traitorous communication with the fung whom he had warned of our advent by firing the reeds and had even contrived to arrange that we were to be taken while he and the other abati with the camels laden with our rifles and goods which they hoped to steal passed through in safety  in defence shadrach boldly denied the whole story and especially that he had pushed the gentile higgs off his dromedary as was alleged and mounted it himself because his own beast had broken down or been injured  however his lies availed him little since after consultation with the child of kings presently one of the blackrobed judges condemned him to suffer death in a very cruel fashion which was reserved for traitors further his possessions were to be forfeited to the state and his wife and children and household to become public slaves which meant that the males would be condemned to serve as soldiers and the females allotted to certain officials in the order of their rank  several of those who had conspired with him to betray us to the fung were also deprived of their possessions and condemned to the army which was their form of penal servitude  thus amidst a mighty wailing of those concerned and of their friends and relatives ended this remarkable trial of which i give some account because it throws light upon the social conditions of abati what hope is there for a people when its criminals are sent not to jail but to serve as soldiers and their womenfolk however innocent are doomed to become the slaves of the judges or whoever these may appoint be it added however that in this instance shadrach and his friends deserved all they got since even allowing for a certain amount of false evidence undoubtedly for the purposes of robbery and private hate they did betray those whom their ruler had sent them to guide and protect  when this trial was finished and shadrach had been removed howling for mercy and attempting to kiss our feet like the cur he was the audience who had collected to hear it and to see us the gentile strangers dispersed and the members of the privy council if i may call it so were summoned by name to attend to their duties when all had gathered we three were requested to advance and take seats which had been placed for us among the councillors  then came a pause and as i had been instructed that i should do i advanced and laid shebas ring upon a cushion held by one of the court officers who carried it to maqueda  child of kings i said take back this ancient token which you lent to me to be a proof of your good faith and mine know that by means of it i persuaded our brother who is captive a man learned in all that has to do with the past to undertake this mission and through him the captain orme who stands before you and his servant the soldier  she took it and after examination showed it to several of the priests by whom it was identified  though i parted from it with fear and doubt the holy ring has served its purpose well she said and i thank you physician for returning it to my people and to me in safety  then she replaced it on the finger from which it had been withdrawn when she gave it to me many months before  there then that matter ended  now an officer cried  walda nagasta speaks whereon every one repeated walda nagasta speaks and was silent  then maqueda began to address us in her soft and pleasant voice  strangers from the western country called england she said be pleased to hear me you know our case with the fungthat they surround us and would destroy us you know that in our extremity i took advantage of the wandering hither of one of you a year ago to beg him to go to his own land and there obtain firestuffs and those who understand them with which to destroy the great and ancient idol of the fung for that people declare that if this idol is destroyed they will leave the land they dwell in for another such being their ancient prophecy  pardon o child of kings interrupted orme but you will remember that only the other day barung sultan of the fung said that in this event his nation would still live on to avenge their god harmac also he said that of all the abati he would leave you alive alone  now at these illomened words a shiver and a murmur went through the council but maqueda only shrugged her shoulders causing the silver trimmings on her dress to tinkle  i have told you the ancient prophecy she answered and for the rest words are not deeds if the foul fiend harmac goes i think that the fung will follow him otherwise why do they make sacrifice to earthquake as the evil god they have to fear and when some five centuries ago such an earthquake shook down part of the secret city in the bowels of the mountains that i will show to you afterwards why did they fly from mur and take up their abode in the plain as they said to protect the god  i do not know answered oliver if our brother were here he whom the fung have captured he might know being learned in the ways of idolworshipping savage peoples  alas o son of orme she said thanks to that traitor whom but now we have condemned he is not here and perhaps could tell us nothing if he were at least the saying runs as i have spoken it and for many generations because of it we abati have desired to destroy the idol of the fung to which so many of us have been offered in sacrifice through the jaws of their sacred lions now i ask and she leaned forward looking at oliver will you do this for me  speak of the reward my niece broke in joshua in his thick voice when he saw that we hesitated what to answer i have heard that these western gentiles are a very greedy people who live and die for the gold which we despise  ask him captain exclaimed quick if they despise land also since yesterday afternoon i saw one of them try to cut the throat of another over a piece not bigger than a large dogkennel  yes i added for i confess that joshuas remarks nettled me and ask him whether the jews did not despoil the egyptians of their ornaments of gold in the old days and whether solomon whom he claims as a forefather did not trade in gold to ophir and lastly whether he knows that most of his kindred in other lands make a very god of gold  so orme as our spokesman put these questions with great gusto to joshua whom he disliked intensely whereat some of the council those who were not of the party of the prince smiled or even laughed and the silvery ornaments upon maquedas dress began to shake again as though she also were laughing behind her veil still she did not seem to think it wise to allow joshua to answerif he couldbut did so herself saying  the truth is o my friends that here we set small store by gold because being shut in and unable to trade it is of no use to us save as an ornament were it otherwise doubtless we should value it as much as the rest of the world jew or gentile and shall do so when we are freed from our foes who hem us in therefore my uncle is wrong to claim as a virtue that which is only a necessity especially when as your servant says and she pointed to the sergeant our people make land their gold and will spend their lives in gaining more of it even when they have enough  then do the gentiles seek no reward for their services sneered joshua  by no means prince answered oliver we are soldiers of fortune since otherwise why should we have come here to fight your quarrel laying an unpleasant emphasis on the your against a chief who if half savage to us seems to have some merits those of honour and courage for instance if we risk our lives and do our work we are not too proud to take whatever we can earn why should we be seeing that some of us need wealth and that our brother who is as good as dead yonder owing to the treachery of those who were sent to guard him has relatives in england who are poor and should be compensated for his loss  why indeed ejaculated maqueda listen now my friends in my own name and in that of the abati people i promised to you as many camelloads of this gold as you can carry away from mur and before the day is done i will show it to you if you dare follow me to where it lies hid  first the work then the pay said oliver now tell us child of kings what is that work  this o son of orme you must swearif this is not against your consciences as christiansthat for the space of one year from today you will serve me and fight for me and be subject to my laws striving all the while to destroy the idol harmac by your western skill and weapons after which you shall be free to go whither you will with your reward  and if we swear lady asked oliver after reflection tell us what rank shall we hold in your service  you shall be my chief captain for this enterprise o son of orme and those with you shall serve under you in such positions as you may please  at these words a murmur of dissatisfaction arose from the mailclad generals in the council  are we then to obey this stranger o child of kings queried joshua as their spokesman  aye my uncle so far as this great enterprise is concerned as i have said can you handle the firestuffs of which they alone have the secret could any three of you have held the gate of harmac against the armies of the fung and sent it flying skyward  she paused and waited in the midst of a sullen silence  you do not answer because you cannot continued maqueda then for this purpose be content to serve awhile under the command of those who have the skill and power which you lack  still there was no answer  lady said orme in this ominous quiet you are so good as to make me a general among your soldiers but will they obey me and who are your soldiers does every man of the abati bear arms  alas no she replied fixing upon this latter question perhaps because she could not answer the first alas no in the old days it was otherwise when my great ancestresses ruled and then we did not fear the fung but now the people will not serve as soldiers they say it takes them from their trades and the games they love they say they cannot give the time in youth they say that it degrades a man to obey the orders of those set over him they say that war is barbarous and should be abolished and all the while the brave fung wait without to massacre our men and make our women slaves only the very poor and the desperate and those who have offended against the laws will serve in my army except it be as officers oh and therefore are the abati doomed and throwing back her veil suddenly she burst into tears before us all  i do not know that i ever remember seeing a sight more pathetic in its way than that of this beautiful and highspirited young woman weeping in the presence of her council over the utter degeneracy of the race she was called upon to rule being old and accustomed to these eastern expressions of emotion i remained silent however but oliver was so deeply affected that i feared lest he should do something foolish he went red he went white and was rising from his seat to go to her had i not caught him by the arm and pulled him back as for quick he turned his eyes to the ceiling as though engaged in prayer and i heard him muttering  the lord help the poor thing the lord help her the one pearl in the snout of all these gilded swine well i understand i am a bit of a general now and if i dont make em sit up for her sake my name aint samuel quick  meanwhile there was much consternation and indignant murmuring amongst the court which felt that reflections had been thrown upon it collectively and individually at such a crisis as usual prince joshua took the lead rising from his seat he knelt not without difficulty before the throne and said  o child of kings why do you distress us with such words have you not the god of solomon to protect you  god protects those who protect themselves sobbed maqueda  and have you not many brave officers  what are officers without an army  and have you not me your uncle your affianced your lover and he laid his hand where he conceived his heart to be and stared up at her with his rolling fishlike eyes had it not been for the interference of these gentiles in whom you seem to put such trust he went on should i not have taken barung captive the other day and left the fung without a head  and the abati without such shreds of honour as still belong to them my uncle  let us be wed o bud of the rose o flower of mur and soon i will free you from the fung we are helpless because we are separate but together we shall triumph say o maqueda when shall we be wed  when the idol harmac is utterly destroyed and the fung have departed for ever my uncle she answered impatiently but is this a time to talk of marriage i declare the council closed let the priests bring the rolls that these strangers from the west may take the oath and then pardon me if i leave you  now from behind the throne there appeared a gorgeous gentleman arrayed in a headdress that reminded me faintly of a bishops mitre and wearing over his robes a breastplate of precious stones roughly polished which was half hidden by a very long white beard  this person who it seemed was the high priest carried in his hand a double roll of parchment written over with characters which we afterwards discovered were bastard hebrew very ancient and only decipherable by three or four of the abati if indeed any of them could really read it at least it was said to be the roll of the law brought by their forefathers centuries ago from abyssinia together with shebas ring and a few other relics among them the cradle a palpable forgery in which the child of solomon and maqueda or belchis the first known queen of sheba was traditionally reported to have been rocked this roll of the law which for generations had been used at all important ceremonies among the abati such as the swearingin of their queens and chief officers was now tendered to us to hold and kiss while we took the oath of obedience and allegiance in the names of jehovah and of solomon a strange mixture it struck us solemnly vowing to perform those things which i have already set out  this seems a pretty wide promise said oliver after it had been read to us and translated by me to quick do you think that we ought to take it on  i answered yes that was from my point of view since otherwise i saw no chance of achieving the object that had caused me to enter upon this adventure then being especially requested to do so the sergeant after reflecting awhile gave his considered opinion  sir he said to orme we are three white men here consorting with a mob of quarterbred african jews and one real lady it seems to me that we had best swear anything they want us to trusting to the lady to see us through the mess since otherwise we shall be mere filibusters in the country without official rank and liable therefore to be shot on sight by the enemy or any mutineers who get the upper hand here also we have the professor and the doctors son to think of therefore i say swear to anything in reason reserving allegiance to the crown of great britain and trust to luck you see captain we are in their power anyway and this oath may help but cant hurt us while to refuse it must give offence to all these skunks and perhaps to the lady also which is of more consequence  i think you are probably right sergeant said orme anyway in for a penny in for a pound  then he turned to maqueda who had been watching this conference in an unknown tongue with some anxiety or so it seemed to me and added in arabic o child of kings we will take your oath although it is wide trusting to your honour to protect us from any pitfalls which it may cover for we would ask you to remember that we are strangers in your land who do not understand its laws and customs only we stipulate that we retain our allegiance to our own ruler far away remaining the subjects of that monarch with all rights thereto appertaining also we stipulate that before we enter on our duties or at any rate during those duties we shall be at full liberty to attempt the rescue of our friend and companion now a prisoner in the hands of the fung and of the son of one of us who is believed to be a slave to them and that we shall have all the assistance which you can give us in this matter moreover we demand that if we should be tried for any offence under this oath you to whom we swear allegiance shall be our judge alone none others intermeddling in the trial if you accept these terms we will swear the oath otherwise we swear nothing but will act as occasion may arise  now we were requested to stand back while the child of kings consulted with her advisers which she did for a considerable time since evidently the questions raised involved differences of opinion in the end however she and those who supported her seemed to overrule the objectors and we were called up and told that our terms had been accepted and engrossed upon the form of the oath and that everything there included would be faithfully observed by the ruler and council of the abati  so we signed and swore kissing the book or rather the roll in the civilized fashion afterwards very tired for all this business had been anxious we were conducted back to our own quarters to lunch or rather to dine for the abati ate their heaviest meal at midday taking a siesta after it according to the common eastern custom  about four oclock of that afternoon i was awakened from my nap by the growls of pharaoh and looked up to see a man crouching against the door evidently in fear of the dogs fangs he proved to be a messenger from maqueda sent to ask us if we cared to accompany her to a place that we had never seen of course we answered yes and were at once led by the messenger to a disused and dusty hall at the back of the palace where presently maqueda and three of her ladies joined us and with them a number of men who carried lighted lamps gourds of oil and bundles of torches  doubtless friends said maqueda who was unveiled and appeared to have quite recovered from our outburst of the morning you have seen many wonderful places in this africa and other lands but now i am about to show you one that i think is stranger than them all  following her we came to a door at the end of the hall which the men unbolted and shut again behind us and thence passed into a long passage cut in the rock that sloped continuously downwards and at length led through another doorway to the vastest cave that we had ever heard of or seen so vast was it indeed that the feeble light of our lamps did not suffice to reach the roof and only dimly showed to right and left the outlines of what appeared to be shattered buildings of rock  behold the cave city of mur said maqueda waving the lamp she held here it was that the ancients whom we believe to have been the forefathers of the fung had their secret stronghold these walls were those of their granaries temples and places of ceremonial but as i have told you centuries ago an earthquake shattered them leaving them as they are now also it broke down much of the cave itself causing the roof to fall so that there are many parts where it is not safe to enter come now and see what is left  we followed her into the depth of the wonderful place our lanterns and torches making little stars of light in that great blackness we saw the ruins of granaries still filled with the dust of what i suppose had once been corn and came at length to a huge roofless building of which the area was strewn with shattered columns and among them overgrown statues covered so thick by dust that we could only discover that most of them seemed to be shaped like sphinxes  if only higgs were here said oliver with a sigh and passed on to maqueda who was calling him to look at something else  leaving the temple in which it was unsafe to walk she led us to where a strong spring the water supply of the place bubbled up into a rock basin and overflowing thence through prepared openings ran away we knew not whither  look this fountain is very ancient said maqueda pointing to the lip of the basin that was worn away to the depth of several inches where those who drew water had for many generations rested their hands upon the hard rock  how did they light so vast a cavern asked oliver  we do not know she answered since lamps would scarcely have served them it is a secret of the past which none of the abati have cared to recover and another is how the air is always kept fresh so deep in the bowels of the mountain we cannot even say whether this place is natural as i think or hollowed out by men  both i expect i answered but tell me lady do the abati make any use of this great cave  some corn is still stored here in pits in case of siege she replied adding sadly but it is not enough to be of real service since almost all of it comes from the estates of the child of kings in vain have i prayed the people to contribute if only a hundredth part of their harvest but they will not each says that he would give if his neighbour gave and so none give and yet a day may come when a store of corn alone would stand between them and death by hungerif the fung held the valley for instance and she turned impatiently and walked forward to show us the stables where the ancients kept their horses and the marks of their chariot wheels in the stone floor  nice people the abati sir said quick to me if it werent for the women and children and above all for this little lady whom i am beginning to worship like my master as in duty bound id like to see them do a bit of hungering  there is one more place to show you said maqueda when we had inspected the stables and argued as to what possible causes could have induced the ancients to keep horses underground which perhaps you will think worth a visit since it holds the treasures that are or shall be yours come  we started forward again along various passages the last of which suddenly widened into a broad and steep incline of rock which we followed for quite fifty paces till it ended in what seemed to be a blank wall here maqueda bade her ladies and attendants halt which indeed they seemed very anxious to do though at the moment we did not know why then she went to one end of the wall where it joined that of the passage and showing us some loose stones asked me to pull them out which i did not without difficulty when an aperture had been made large enough for a man to creep through she turned to her people and said  you i know believe this place to be haunted nor would the bravest of you enter it save by express command but i and these strangers have no such fears therefore give us a gourd of oil and some torches and bide where you are till we return setting a lamp in the hole in the wall to guide us in case our own should become extinguished no do not reason but obey there is no danger for though hot the air within is pure as i know who have breathed it more than once  then she gave her hand to oliver and with his assistance crept through the hole we followed to find ourselves in another cavern where as she had said the temperature was much hotter than that without  what is this place asked orme in a low voice for its aspect seemed to awe him  the tomb of the old kings of mur she replied presently you shall see and once more she took his hand for the slope was sharp and slippery  on we went always descending for perhaps four hundred yards our footfalls echoing loudly in the intense silence and our lamps round which the bats circled in hundreds making four stars of light in the utter blackness till at length the passage widened out into what appeared to be a vast circular arena with a lofty domelike roof of rock maqueda turned to the right and halting before some objects that glimmered whitely held up her light saying look  this was what we saw a great stone chair and piled upon its seat and upon its base human bones amongst these was a skull and on it grotesquely tilted a crown of gold while other ornamentssceptres rings necklaces weapons and armourwere mingled with the bones nor was this all for in a wide circle round the chair were other skeletons fifty or more of them and amongst them the ornaments that their owners had worn  also in front of each stood a tray of some metal which we afterwards discovered to be silver or copper and heaped upon it every kind of valuable such as golden cups and vases toilet utensils necklaces pectorals bracelets leglets earrings and beads that seemed to be cut from precious stones piles of ring money and a hundred other things such as have been prized by mankind since the beginning of civilization  you understand said maqueda as we stared openmouthed at this awful and marvellous sight he in the chair was the king those about him were his officers guards and women when he was buried they brought his household here bearing his wealth sat them down about him and killed them blow away the dust and you will see that the rock beneath is still stained with their blood also there are the swordmarks on their skulls and neckbones  quick who was of an inquiring mind stepped forward and verified these statements  golly he said throwing down the skull of a man over whom the tired executioners had evidently bungled badly im glad i didnt serve the old kings of mur but the same game goes on in a small way today in africa for when i was campaigning on the west coast i came across it not a fortnight old only there they had buried the poor beggars living  perhaps said maqueda when the sergeants remarks had been translated to her yet i do not think the custom is one that my people would love and she laughed a little then added forward friends there are many more of these kings and oil does not burn for ever  so we moved on and at a distance of some twenty paces found another chair with scattered bones on and about the seat lying where each had fallen as the dead man decayed round it were the skeletons of the unfortunates who had been doomed to accompany him upon his last journey every one of them behind his tray of golden objects or of simple treasure in front of this kings chair also were the bones of a dog with a jewelled collar  again we proceeded to a third mortuary if it may so be called and here maqueda pointed out the skeleton of a man in front of which stood a tray piled up with what evidently had been the medicine bottles of the period and among them a number of rude surgical instruments  say o physician adams she remarked with a smile would you have wished to be court doctor to the kings of mur if indeed that was then their citys name  no lady i answered but i do wish to examine his instruments if i have your leave and while she hurried forward i stooped down and filled my pockets here i may remark that upon subsequent inspection i found among these instruments manufactured i know not what number of thousands of years agofor on that point controversy rages among the learnedmany that with modifications are still in use today  of that strange and dreadful sepulchre there is little more to tell from monarch to monarch we marched on till at length we grew weary of staring at bones and gold even quick grew weary who had passed his early youth in assisting his father the parish sexton and therefore like myself regarded these relics with professional interest though of a different degree at any rate he remarked that this family vault was uncommonly hot and perhaps if it pleased her majesty as he called maqueda we might take the rest of the deceased gentlemen as read like a recruits attestation questions  but just then we came to no 25 according to my counting and were obliged to stop to wonder for clearly this king had been the greatest of them all since round him lay about two or three times the average number of dead and an enormous quantity of wealth some of it in the form of little statues of men and women or perhaps of gods yet oddly enough he was hunchback with a huge skull almost a monstrosity indeed perhaps his mind partook of the abnormal qualities of his body since no less than eleven little children had been sacrificed at his obsequies two of whom judging from their crooked bones must have been his own  one wonders what chanced in mur and the surrounding territories which then acknowledged its sway when king hunchback ruled alas history writes no record    chapter x  quick lights a match  here we begin to turn for this cave is a great circle said maqueda over her shoulder  but oliver whom she addressed had left her side and was engaged in taking observations behind the hunchbacks funeral chair with an instrument which he had produced from his pocket  she followed him and asked curiously what this thing might be and why he made use of it here  we call it a compass he answered and it tells me that beyond us lies the east where the sun rises also it shows at what height we stand above the sea that great water which you have never seen o child of kings say now if we could walk through this rock what should we find out yonder  the lionheaded idol of the fung i have been told she answered that which you saw before you blew up the gate of the city harmac but how far off it may be i do not know for i cannot see through stone friend adams help me to refill the lamps for they burn low and all these dead would be ill company in the dark so at least my people think since there is not one of them that dares to enter this place when first we found it only a few years ago and saw the company it held they fled and left me to search it alone look yonder are my footsteps in the dust  so i refilled the shallow handlamps and while i did so orme took some hasty observations of which he jotted down the results in his pocketbook  what have you learned she asked when at last he rejoined us somewhat unwillingly for she had been calling to him to come  not so much as i should have done if you could have given me more time he replied adding in explanation lady i was brought up as an engineer that is one who executes works and to do so takes measurements and makes calculations for instance those dead men who hollowed or dressed these caves must have been engineers and no mean ones  we have such among us now she said they raise dams and make drains and houses though not so good as those which were built of old but again i askwhat have you learned o wise engineer  only that here we stand not so very far above the city harmac of which i chanced to take the level and that behind yonder chair there was i think once a passage which has been built up but be pleased to say nothing of the matter lady and to ask me no more questions at present as i cannot answer them with certainty  i see that you are discreet as well as wise she replied with some sarcasm well since i may not be trusted with your counsel keep it to yourself  oliver bowed and obeyed this curt instruction  then we began our return journey passing many more groups of skeletons which now we scarcely troubled to look at perhaps because the heavy air filled with dust that once had been the flesh of men was telling on our energies only i noticed or rather the observant quick called my attention to the fact that as we went the kings in their chairs were surrounded by fewer and fewer attendants and women and that the offerings placed at their feet were of an everlessening value indeed after we had passed another five or six of them their murdered retinues dwindled to a few female skeletons doubtless those of favourite wives who had been singled out for this particular honour  at length there were none at all the poor monarchs who now were crowded close together being left to explore the shades alone adorned merely with their own jewellery and regalia ultimately even these were replaced by funeral goldfoil ornaments and the trays of treasure by earthenware jars which appeared to have contained nothing but food and wine and added to these a few spears and other weapons the last of the occupied chairs for there were empty ones beyond contained bones which from their slenderness and the small size of the bracelets among them i saw at once had belonged to a woman who had been sent to the grave without companions or any offerings at all  doubtless said maqueda when i pointed this out to her at that time the ancients had grown weak and poor since after so many kings they permitted a woman to rule over them and had no wealth to waste upon her burial that may have been after the earthquake when only a few people were left in mur before the abati took possession of it  where then are those of your own house buried asked oliver staring at the empty chairs  oh not in this place she answered i have told you it was discovered but a few years ago we rest in tombs outside and for my part i will sleep in the simple earth so that i may live on in grass and flowers if in no other way but enough of death and doom soon who can tell how soon we shall be as these are and she shuddered meanwhile we breathe so let us make the best of breath you have seen your fee say does it content you  what fee he asked death the reward of life how can i tell until i have passed its gate  here this philosophical discussion was interrupted by the sudden decease of quicks lamp  thought there was something wrong with the blooming thing said the sergeant but couldnt turn it up as it hasnt got a screw without which these oldfashioned colza oils never were no good hullo doctor there goes yours and as he spoke go it did  the wicks exclaimed maqueda we forgot to bring new wicks and without them of what use is oil come be swift we are still far from the mouth of this cave where none except the high priests will dare to seek us and taking oliver by the hand she began to run leaving us two to follow as best we could  steady doctor said quick steady in the presence of disaster comrades should always stick together as it says in the redbook presented by the crown to warrant officers but paid for out of their deferred allowance take my arm doctor ah i thought so the more haste the less speed look there and he pointed to the flying shapes ahead now a long way off and with only one lamp between them  next instant maqueda turned round holding up this remaining lamp and called to us i saw the faint light gleam upon her beautiful face and glitter down the silver ornaments of her dress very wild and strange she looked in that huge vault seen thus for a single moment then seen no more for presently where the flame had been was but a red spark and then nothing at all  stop still till we come back to you cried oliver and shout at intervals  yes sir said quick and instantly let off a fearful yell which echoed backward and forward across the vault till i was quite bewildered  all right coming answered oliver and his voice sounded so far to the left that quick thought it wise to yell again  to cut a long story short we next heard him on our right and then behind us  cant trust sounds here sir echoes are too uncertain said the sergeant but come on i think ive placed them now and calling to them not to move we headed in what we were sure was the right direction  the end of that adventure was that presently i tripped up over a skeleton and found myself lying half stunned amidst trays of treasure affectionately clasping a skull under the impression that it was quicks boot  he hauled me up again somehow and as we did not know what to do we sat down amidst the dead and listened by now the others were apparently so far off that the sound of olivers calling only reached us in faint mysterious notes that came from we knew not whence  as like idiots we started in such a hurry that we forgot to bring any matches with us there is nothing to be done except wait i said no doubt in due course those abati will get over their fear of ghosts and come to look for us  wish i could do the same sir i didnt mind those deaders in the light but the darks a different matter cant you hear them rattling their shanks and talking all round us  certainly i do hear something i answered but i think it must be the echo of our own voices  well let us hold our jaw sir and perhaps they will hold theirs for this kind of conversation aint nice  so we were silent but the strange murmuring still went on coming apparently from the wall of the cave behind us and it occurred to me that i had once heard something like it before though at the time i could not think where afterwards i remembered that it was when as a boy i had been taken to see the whispering gallery in st pauls cathedral in london  halfanhour or so went by in this fashion and still there were no signs of the abati or of our missing pair quick began to fumble among his clothes i asked him what he was doing  cant help thinking ive got a wax match somewhere doctor i remember feeling it in one of the pockets of this coat on the day before we left london and thinking afterwards it wasnt safe to have had it packed in a box marked hold now if only i could find that match we have got plenty of torches for ive stuck to my bundle all through although i never thought of them when the lamps were going out  having small belief in the sergeants match i made no answer and the search went on till presently i heard him ejaculate  by jingo here it is in the lining yes and the head feels all right now doctor hold two of the torches toward me make ready present fire and he struck the match and applied it to the heads of the resinous torches  instantly these blazed up giving an intense light in that awful darkness by this light for one moment only we saw a strange and not unattractive spectacle i think i forgot to say that in the centre of this vault stood a kind of altar which until that moment indeed i had not seen this altar which doubtless had been used for ceremonial purposes at the funerals of the ancient kings consisted of a plain block of basalt stone whereon was cut the symbol of a human eye the stone being approached by steps and supported upon carved and crouching sphinxes  on the lowest of these steps near enough to enable us to see them quite clearly were seated oliver orme and maqueda child of kings they were seated very close together indeed if i must tell the truth olivers arm was about maquedas waist her head rested upon his shoulder and apparently he was engaged in kissing her upon the lips  right about face hissed the sergeant in a tone of command and mark time  so we rightabouted for a decent period then coughing loudlybecause of the irritant smoke of the torchesadvanced to cross the cavern and by accident stumbled upon our lost companions i confess that i had nothing to say but quick rose to the occasion nobly  glad to see you captain he said to oliver was getting very anxious about you sir until by good luck i found a match in the lining of my coat if the professor had been here hed have had plenty which is an argument in favour of continuous smoking even when ladies are present ah no wonder her majesty is faint in this hot place poor young thing its lucky you didnt leave hold of her sir do you think you could manage to support her sir as we ought to be moving cant offer to do so myself as i have lamed my foot with the tooth of a dead king also my arms are full of torches but if you prefer the doctorwhat do you say sir that you can manage there is such an echo in this vault that it is difficult to hearvery well let us go on for these torches wont last for ever and you wouldnt like us to have to spend a whole night here with the lady in such a delicate condition would you especially as those nastytempered abati might say that you had done it on purpose take her majestys arm doctor and let us trek ill go ahead with the torches  to all this artless harangue oliver answered not a single word but glared at us suspiciously over the shape of maqueda who apparently had fainted only when i ventured to offer her some professional assistance she recovered and said that she could get on quite well alone which meant upon ormes arm  well the end of it was that she got on and so did we for the torches lasted until we reached the narrow sloping passage and rounding the corner saw the lantern burning in the hole in the wall after which of course things were easy    doctor said oliver to me in a voice of studied nonchalance that night as we were preparing to turn in did you notice anything in the vault of kings this afternoon  oh yes i answered lots of course myself i am not given to archæology like poor higgs but the sight struck me as absolutely unique if i were inclined to moralize for instance what a contrast between those dead rulers and their young and beautiful successor full of life and lovehere he looked at me sharplylove of her people such as i have no doubt in their day  oh shut it adams i dont want a philosophical lecture with historical comparisons did you notice anything except bones and gold when that unutterable ass quick suddenly turned on the lightsi mean struck the match which unfortunately he had with him  now i gave it up and faced the situation  well if you want the truth i said not very much myself for my sight isnt as good as it used to be but the sergeant who has extraordinarily sharp eyes thought that he saw you kissing maqueda a supposition that your relative attitudes seemed to confirm which explains moreover some of the curious sounds we heard before he lit the torches thats why he asked me to turn my back but of course we may have been mistaken do i understand you to say that the sergeant was mistaken  oliver consigned the sergeants eyes to an ultimate fate worse than that which befell those of peeping tom then in a burst of candour for subterfuge never was his forte owned up  you made no mistake he said we love each other and it came out suddenly in the dark i suppose that the unusual surroundings acted on our nerves  from a moral point of view i am glad that you love each other i remarked since embraces that are merely nervous cannot be commended but from every other in our circumstances the resulting situation strikes me as a little short of awful although quick a most observant man warned me to expect it from the first  curse quick said oliver again with the utmost energy ill give him a months notice this very night  dont i said for then youll oblige him to take service with barung where he would be most dangerous look here orme to drop chaff this is a pretty mess  why whats wrong about it doctor he asked indignantly of course shes a jew of some diluted sort or other and im a christian but those things adapt themselves of course too shes my superior but after all hers is a strictly local rank and in europe we should be on much the same footing as for her being an eastern what does that matter surely it is not an objection which should have weight with you and for the rest did you ever see her equal  never never never i answered with enthusiasm the young lady to whom any gentleman has just engaged himself is always absolutely unequalled and let me admit at once that this is perhaps the most original and charming that i have ever met in all central africa only whatever may be the case with you i dont know whether this fact will console me and quick when our throats are being cut look here orme i added didnt i tell you long ago that the one thing you must not do was to make love to the child of kings  did you really i forget you told me such a lot of things doctor he answered coolly enough only unfortunately the colour that rose in his cheeks betrayed his lips  at this moment quick who had entered the room unobserved gave a dry cough and remarked  dont blame the captain doctor because he dont remember theres nothing like shock from an explosion for upsetting the memory ive seen that often in the boer war when after a big shell had gone off somewhere near them the very bravest soldiers would clean forget that it was their duty to stand still and not run like rabbits indeed it happened to me myself  i laughed and oliver said something which i could not hear but quick went on imperturbably  still truth is truth and if the captain has forgotten the more reason that we should remind him that evening at the professors house in london you did warn him sir and he answered that you neednt bother your head about the fascinations of a nigger woman  nigger woman broke out oliver i never used such words i never even thought them and you are an impertinent fellow to put them into my mouth nigger woman good heavens its desecration  very sorry captain now i come to think of it i believe you said black woman speaking in your haste yes and i begged you not to brag seeing that if you did we might live to see you crawling after her with myself samuel quick bringing up the rear well there it is we are and the worst of it is that i cant blame you being as anticipated in the prophecyfor thats what it was though i didnt know it myself at the timeexactly in the same state myself though of course at a distance bringing up the rear respectfully as said  you dont mean that you are in love with the child of kings said oliver staring at the sergeants grim and battered figure  begging your pardon captain that is exactly what i do mean if a cat may look at a queen why maynt a man love her howsoever my kind of love aint likely to interfere with yours my kind means sentrygo and perhaps a knife in my gizzard yourswell we saw what yours means this afternoon though what it will all lead to we didnt see still captain speaking as one who hasnt been keen on the sex heretofore i saysail in since its worth it even if youve got to sink afterwards for this lady although she is half a jew and i never could abide jews is the sweetest and the loveliest and the best and the bravest little woman that ever walked gods earth  at this point oliver seized his hand and shook it warmly and i may mention that i think some report of quicks summary of her character must have reached maquedas ears at any rate thenceforward until the end she always treated the old fellow with what the french call the most distinguished consideration  but as i was not in love no one shook my hand so leaving the other two to discuss the virtues and graces of the child of kings i went off to bed filled with the gloomiest forbodings what a fool i had been not to insist that whatever expert accompanied higgs should be a married man and yet now when i came to think of it that might not have bettered matters and perhaps would only have added to the transaction a degree of moral turpitude which at present was lacking since even married men are sometimes weak  the truth was that maquedas attractions were extraordinarily great to her remarkable beauty she added a wonderful charm of manner and force of mind also her situation must touch the heart and pity of any man so helpless was she in the midst of all her hollow grandeur so lonely amongst a nation of curs whom she strove in vain to save and should she escape destruction with them doomed to so sad and repulsive a fate namely to become the wife of a fat poltroon who was her own uncle well we know to what emotion pity is akin and the catastrophe had occurred a little sooner than i had expected that was all  doubtless to her in comparison with the men to whom she was accustomed and allowed by etiquette to take as her associates this brave and handsome young englishman who had come into her care sick and shattered after the doing of a great deed must have seemed a veritable fairy prince and she had helped to nurse him and he had shown himself grateful for her kindness and condescension andthe rest followed as surely as the day follows the night  but how would it end sooner or later the secret must come out for already the abati nobles if i may call them so for want of a better name and especially joshua were bitterly jealous of the favour their lady showed to the foreigner and watched them both then whatwhat would happen under the abati law it was death for any one outside of the permitted degree of relationship to tamper with the affections of the child of kings nor was this wonderful since that person held her seat in virtue of her supposed direct descent from solomon and the first maqueda queen of sheba and therefore the introduction of any alien blood could not be tolerated  moreover orme having sworn an oath of allegiance had become subject to those laws lastly i could not in the least hope from the character of the pair concerned that this was but a passing flirtation  oh without a doubt these two had signed their own deathwarrant yonder in the cave of death and incidentally ours also this must be the end of our adventure and my long search for the son whom i had lost    chapter xi  the rescue fails  our breakfast on the following morning was a somewhat gloomy meal by common consent no allusion was made to the events of the previous day or to our conversation at bedtime  indeed there was no talk at all to speak of since not knowing what else to do i thought i could best show my attitude of mind by preserving a severe silence while quick seemed to be absorbed in philosophical reflections and orme looked rather excited and dishevelled as though he had been writing poetry as i daresay was the case in the midst of this dreary meal a messenger arrived who announced that the walda nagasta would be pleased to see us all within halfanhour  fearing lest orme should say something foolish i answered briefly that we would wait upon her and the man went leaving us wondering what had happened to cause her to desire our presence  at the appointed time we were shown into the small audience room and as we passed its door i ventured to whisper to oliver  for your own sake and hers as well as that of the rest of us i implore you to be careful your face is watched as well as your words  all right old fellow he answered colouring a little you may trust me  i wish i could i muttered  then we were shown in ceremoniously and made our bows to maqueda who was seated surrounded by some of the judges and officers among them prince joshua and talking to two roughlooking men clad in ordinary brown robes she greeted us and after the exchange of the usual compliments said  friends i have summoned you for this reason this morning when the traitor shadrach was being led out to execution at the hands of these men the officers of the law he begged for a delay when asked why as his petition for reprieve had been refused he said that if his life was spared he could show how your companion he whom they call black windows may be rescued from the fung  how asked orme and i in one breath  i do not know she answered but wisely they spared the man let him be brought in  a door opened and shadrach entered his hands bound behind his back and shackles on his feet he was a very fearful and much chastened shadrach for his eyes rolled and his teeth chattered with terror as having prostrated himself to the walda nagasta he wriggled round and tried to kiss ormes boot the guards pulled him to his feet again and maqueda said  what have you to tell us traitor before you die  the thing is secret o bud of the rose must i speak before so many  nay she answered and ordered most of those present to leave the room including the executioners and soldiers  the man is desperate and there will be none left to guard him said joshua nervously  ill do that your highness answered quick in his bad arabic and stepping up behind shadrach he added in english now then pussy you behave or it will be the worse for you  when all had gone again shadrach was commanded to speak and say how he could save the englishman whom he had betrayed into the hands of the fung  thus child of kings he answered black windows as we know is imprisoned in the body of the great idol  how do you know it man  o lady i do know it and also the sultan said so did he not well i can show a secret road to that idol whence he may be reached and rescued in my boyhood i who am called cat because i can climb so well found that road and when the fung took me afterward and threw me to the lions where i got these scars upon my face by it i escaped spare me and i will show it to you  it is not enough to show the road said maqueda dog you must save the foreign lord whom you betrayed if you do not save him you die do you understand  that is a hard saying lady answered the man am i god that i should promise to save this stranger who perchance is already dead yet i will do my best knowing that if i fail you will kill me and that if i succeed i shall be spared at any rate i will show you the road to where he is or was imprisoned although i warn you that it is a rough one  where you can travel we can follow said maqueda tell us now what we must do  so he told her and when he had done the prince joshua intervened saying that it was not fitting that the child of kings in her own sacred person should undertake such a dangerous journey she listened to his remonstrances and thanked him for his care of her  still i am going she said not for the sake of the stranger who is called black windows but because if there is a secret way out of mur i think it well that i should know that way yet i agree with you my uncle that on such a journey i ought not to be unprotected and therefore i pray that you will be ready to start with us at noon since i am sure that then we shall all be safe  now joshua began to make excuses but she would not listen to them  no no she said you are too honest the honour of the abati is involved in this manner since alas it was an abati that betrayed black windows and an abatinamely yourselfmust save him you have often told me my uncle how clever you are at climbing rocks and now you shall make proof of your skill and courage before these foreigners it is a command speak no more and she rose to show that the audience was finished    that same afternoon shadrach by mountain paths that were known to him led a little company of people to the crest of the western precipice of mur fifteen hundred feet or more beneath us lay the great plains upon which some miles away could be seen the city of harmac but the idol in the valley we could not see because here the precipice bent over and hid it from our sight  what now fellow said maqueda who was clad in the rough sheepskin of a peasant woman which somehow looked charming upon her here is the cliff there lies the plain i see no road between the two and my wise uncle the prince tells me that he never heard of one  lady answered the man now i take command and you must follow me but first let us see that nobody and nothing are lacking  then he went round the company and numbered them in all we were sixteen maqueda and joshua we three englishmen armed with repeating rifles and revolvers our guide shadrach and some picked mountaineers chosen for their skill and courage for even in mur there were brave men left especially among the shepherds and huntsmen whose homes were on the cliffs these sturdy guides were laden with ropes lamps and long slender ladders that could be strapped together  when everything had been checked and all the ladders and straps tested shadrach went to a clump of bushes which grew feebly on the windswept crest of the precipice in the midst of these he found and removed a large flat stone revealing what evidently had been the head of a stair although now its steps were much worn and crumbled by the water that in the wet season followed this natural drain to the depths below  this is that road the ancients made for purposes of their own explained shadrach which as i have said i chanced to discover when i was a boy but let none follow it who are afraid for it is steep and rough  now joshua who was already weary with his long ride and walk up to the crest of the precipice implored maqueda almost passionately to abandon the idea of entering this horrid hole while oliver backed up his entreaties with few words but many appealing glances for on this point though for different reasons the prince and he were at one  but she would not listen  my uncle she said with you the experienced mountaineer why should i be afraid if the doctor here who is old enough to be the father of either of us so far as joshua was concerned this remark lacked truth is willing to go surely i can go also moreover if i remained behind you would wish to stay to guard me and never should i forgive myself if i deprived you of such a great adventure also like you i love climbing come let us waste no more time  so we were roped up first went shadrach with quick next to him a position which the sergeant insisted upon occupying as his custodian and several of the mountaineers carrying ladders lamps oil food and other things then in a second gang came two more of these men oliver maqueda myself and next to me joshua the remaining mountaineers brought up the rear carrying spare stores ladders and so forth when all was ready the lamps were lit and we started upon a very strange journey  for the first two hundred feet or so the stairs though worn and almost perpendicular for the place was like the shaft of a mine were not difficult to descend to any of us except joshua whom i heard puffing and groaning behind me then came a gallery running eastward at a steep slope for perhaps fifty paces and at the end of it a second shaft of about the same depth as the first but with the stairs much more worn apparently by the washing of water of which a good deal trickled out of the sides of the shaft another difficulty was that the air rushing up from below made it hard to keep the lamps alight  toward the bottom of this section there was scarcely any stair left and the climbing became very dangerous here indeed joshua slipped and with a wail of terror slid down the shaft and landed with his legs across my back in such a fashion that had i not happened to have good hand and foot hold at the time he would have propelled me on to maqueda and we must have all rolled down headlong probably to our deaths  as it was this fat and terrified fellow cast his arms about my neck to which he clung nearly choking me until just when i was about to faint beneath his weight and pressure the mountaineers in the third party arrived and dragged him off when they had got him in charge for i refused to move another step while he was immediately behind me we descended by a ladder which the first party had set up to the second level where began another long eastward sloping passage that ended at the mouth of a third pit  here arose the great question as to what was to be done with the prince joshua who vowed that he could go no farther and demanded loudly to be taken back to the top of the cliff although shadrach assured him that thenceforward the road was much easier at length we were obliged to refer the matter to maqueda who settled it in very few words  my uncle she said you tell us that you cannot come on and it is certain that we cannot spare the time and men to send you back therefore it seems that you must stop where you are until we return and if we should not return make the best of your own way up the shaft farewell my uncle this place is safe and comfortable and if you are wise you will rest awhile  heartless woman gobbled joshua who was shaking like a jelly with fear and rage would you leave your affianced lord and lover alone in this haunted hole while you scramble down rocks like a wild cat with strangers if i must stay do you stay with me  certainly not replied maqueda with decision shall it be said that the child of kings is afraid to go where her guests can travel  well the end of it was that joshua came on in the centre of the third body of mountaineers who were practically obliged to carry him  shadrach was right since for some reason or other the stairs thenceforward remained more perfect only they seemed almost endless and before we reached our goal i calculated that we must have descended quite twelve hundred feet into the bowels of the rock at length when i was almost tired out and maqueda was so breathless that she was obliged to lean on oliver dragging me behind her like a dog on a string of a sudden we saw a glimmer of daylight that crept into the tunnel through a small hole by the mouth of yet another pit or shaft we found shadrach and the others waiting for us saluting he said that we must unrope leave our lamps behind and follow him oliver asked him whither this last shaft led  to a still lower level lord he answered but one which you will scarcely care to explore since it ends in the great pit where the fung keep their sacred lions  indeed said oliver much interested for reasons of his own and he glanced at quick who nodded his head and whistled  then we all followed shadrach to find ourselves presently upon a plateau about the size of a racquet court which either by nature or by the hand of man had been recessed into the face of that gigantic cliff going to the edge of this plateau whereon grew many treeferns and some thick green bushes that would have made us invisible from below even had there been any one to see us we saw that the sheer precipice ran down beneath for several hundred feet of these yawning depths however we did not at the moment make out much partly because they were plunged in shadow and partly for another reason  rising out of the gulf below was what we took at first to be a rounded hill of black rock oblong in shape from which projected a gigantic shaft of stone ending in a kind of fretted bush that alone was of the size of a cottage the point of this bushlike rock was exactly opposite the little plateau on to which we had emerged and distant from it not more than thirty or at most forty feet  what is that asked maqueda of shadrach pointing in front of her as she handed back to one of the mountaineers a cup from which she had been drinking water  that o walda nagasta he answered is nothing else than the back of the mighty idol of the fung which is shaped like a lion the great shaft of rock with the bush at the end of it is the tail of the lion doubtless this platform on which we stand is a place whence the old priests when they owned mur as well as the land of the fung used to hide themselves to watch whatever it was they wanted to see look and he pointed to certain grooves in the face of the rock i think that here there was once a bridge which could be let down at will on to the tail of the liongod though long ago it has rotted away yet ere now i have travelled this road without it  we stared at him astonished and in the silence that followed i heard maqueda whisper to oliver  perhaps that is how he whom we call cat escaped from the fung or perhaps that is how he communicates with them as a spy  or perhaps he is a liar my lady interrupted quick who had also overheard their talk a solution which i confess commended itself to me  why have you brought us here asked maqueda presently  did i not tell you in mur ladyto rescue black windows listen now it is the custom of the fung to allow those who are imprisoned within the idol to walk unguarded upon its back at dawn and sunset at least this is their custom with black windowsask me not how i know it this is truth i swear it on my life which is at stake now this is my plan we have with us a ladder which will reach from where we stand to the tail of the idol should the foreign lord appear upon the back of the god which if he still lives as i believe he does he is almost sure to do at sundown as a man who dwells in the dark all day will love the light and air when he can get them then some of us must cross and bring him back with us perhaps it had best be you my lord orme since if i went alone or even with these men after what is past black windows might not altogether trust me  fool broke in maqueda how can a man do such a thing  o lady it is not so difficult as it looks a few steps across the gulf and then a hundred feet or so along the tail of the lion which is flat on the top and so broad that one may run down it if careful to follow the curves that is on a still daynothing more but of course if the lord orme is afraid which i did not think who have heard so much of his courage and the rogue shrugged his shoulders and paused  afraid fellow said oliver well i am not ashamed to be afraid of such a journey yet if there is need i will make it though not before i see my brother alone yonder on the rock since all this may be but a trick of yours to deliver me to the fung among whom i know that you have friends  it is madness you shall not go said maqueda you will fall and be dashed to pieces i say that you shall not go  why should he not go my niece interrupted joshua shadrach is right we have heard much of the courage of this gentile now let us see him do something  she turned on the prince like a tiger  very good my uncle then you shall go with him surely one of the ancient blood of the abati will not shirk from what a gentile dares  on hearing this joshua relapsed into silence and i have no clear memory of what he did or said in connection with the rest of that thrilling scene  now followed a pause in the midst of which oliver sat down and began to take off his boots  why do you undress yourself friend asked maqueda nervously  because lady he answered if i have to walk yonder road it is safer to do so in my stockings have no fear he added gently from boyhood i have been accustomed to such feats and when i served in my countrys army it was my pleasure to give instruction in them although it is true that this one surpasses all that ever i attempted  still i do fear she said  meanwhile quick had sat down and begun to take off his boots  what are you doing sergeant i asked  getting ready to accompany the captain upon forlorn hope doctor  nonsense i said you are too old for the game sergeant if any one goes i should seeing that i believe my son is over there but i cant try it as i know my head would give out and i should fall in a second which would only upset everybody  of course broke in oliver who had overheard us im in command here and my orders are that neither of you shall come remember sergeant that if anything happens to me it is your business to take over the stores and use them if necessary which you alone can do now go and see to the preparations and find out the plan of campaign for i want to rest and keep quiet i daresay the whole thing is humbug and we shall see nothing of the professor still one may as well be prepared  so quick and i went to superintend the lashing of two of the light ladders together and the securing of some planks which we had brought with us upon the top of the rungs so as to make these ladders easy to walk on i asked who would be of the party besides shadrach and orme and was told no one as all were afraid ultimately however a man named japhet one of the mountaineers volunteered upon being promised a grant of land from the child of kings herself which grant she proclaimed before them all was to be given to his relatives in the event of his death  at length everything was ready and there came another spell of silence for the nerves of all of us were so strained that we did not seem able to talk it was broken by a sound of sudden and terrible roaring that arose from the gulf beneath  it is the hour of the feeding of the sacred lions which the fung keep in the pit about the base of the idol explained shadrach then he added unless he should be rescued i believe that black windows will be given to the lions tonight which is that of full moon and a festival of harmac though maybe he will be kept till the next full moon when all the fung come up to worship  this information did not tend to raise anyones spirits although quick who always tried to be cheerful remarked that it was probably false  the shadows began to gather in the valley of harmac whereby we knew that the sun was setting behind the mountains indeed had it not been for a clear and curious glow reflected from the eastern sky the gulf would have plunged us in gloom presently far away upon a rise of rock which we knew must be the sphinx head of the huge idol a little figure appeared outlined against the sky and there began to sing the moment that i heard the distant voice i went near to fainting and indeed should have fallen had not quick caught me  what is it adams asked oliver looking up from where he and maqueda sat whispering to each other while the fat joshua glowered at them in the background has higgs appeared  no i answered but thank god my son still lives that is his voice oh if you can save him too  now there was much suppressed excitement and some one thrust a pair of fieldglasses into my hand but either they were wrongly set or the state of my nerves would not allow me to see through them so quick took them and reported  tall slim figure wearing a white robe but at the distance in this light cant make out the face one might hail him perhaps only it would give us away ah the hymn is done and hes gone seemed to jump into a hole in the rock which shows that hes all right anyway or he couldnt jump so cheer up doctor for you have much to be thankful for  yes i repeated after him much to be thankful for but still i would that i had more after all these years to search to think that i should be so close to him and he know nothing of it  after the ceasing of the song and the departure of my son there appeared upon the back of the idol three fung warriors fine fellows clad in long robes and armed with spears and behind them a trumpeter who carried a horn or hollowed elephants tusk these men marched up and down the length of the platform from the rise of the neck to the root of the tail apparently to make an inspection having found nothing for of course they could not see us hidden behind the bushes on our little plateau of which no doubt they did not even know the existence and much less that it was connected with the mountain plain of mur the trumpeter blew a shrill blast upon his horn and before the echoes of it had died away vanished with his companions  sunset tour of inspection seen the same kind of thing as at gib said the sergeant oh by jingo pussy isnt lying after allthere he is and he pointed to a figure that rose suddenly out of the black stone of the idols back just as the guards had done  it was higgs higgs without a doubt higgs wearing his battered sunhelmet and his dark spectacles higgs smoking his big meerschaum pipe and engaged in making notes in a pocketbook as calmly as though he sat before a new object in the british museum  i gasped with astonishment for somehow i had never expected that we should really see him but orme rising very quietly from his seat beside maqueda only said  yes thats the old fellow right enough well now for it you shadrach run out your ladder and cross first that i may be sure you play no trick  nay broke in maqueda this dog shall not go for never would he return from his friends the fung man she said addressing japhet the mountaineer to whom she had promised land go you over first and hold the end of the ladder while this lord crosses if he returns safe your reward is doubled  japhet saluted the ladder was run out and its end set upon the roughnesses in the rock that represented the hair of the sphinxs tail the mountaineer paused a moment with hands and face uplifted evidently he was praying then bidding his companions hold the hither end of the ladder and having first tested it with his foot and found that it hung firm calmly he walked across being a brave fellow and presently was seen seated on the opposing mass of rock  now came olivers turn he nodded to maqueda who went white as a sheet muttering some words to her that did not reach me then he turned and shook my hand  if you can save my son also i whispered  ill do my best if i can get hold of him he answered sergeant if anything happens to me you know your duty  ill try and follow your example captain under all circumstances though that will be hard replied quick in a rather shaky voice  oliver stepped out on the ladder i reckoned that twelve or fourteen short paces would take him across and the first half of these he accomplished with quiet certainty when he was in the exact middle of the passage however the end of one of the uprights of the ladder at the farther side slipped a little notwithstanding the efforts of japhet to keep it straight with the result that the plank bound on the rungs lost its level sinking an inch or so to the right and nearly causing oliver to fall from it into the gulf he wavered like a windshaken reed attempted to step forward hesitated stopped and slowly sank on to his hands and knees  ah panted maqueda  the gentile has lost his head began joshua in a voice full of the triumph that he could not hide hewill  joshua got no further for quick turning threatened him savagely with his fist saying in english  stow your jaw if you dont want to follow him you swine whereon joshua who understood the gesture if not the words relapsed into silence  now the mountaineer on the farther side spoke saying  have no fear the ladder is safe  for a moment oliver remained in his crouching posture on the board which was all that separated him from an awful death in the gulf beneath next while we watched agonized he rose to his feet again and with perfect calmness walked across to its other end  well done our side said quick addressing joshua why dont your royal highness cheer no you leave that knife alone or presently therell be a hog the less in this world and stooping down he relieved the prince of the weapon which he was fingering with his round eyes fixed upon the sergeant  maqueda who had noted all now interfered  my uncle she said brave men are risking their lives yonder while we sit in safety be silent and cease from quarrelling i pray you  next moment we had forgotten all about joshua being utterly absorbed in watching the drama in progress upon the farther side of the gulf after a slight pause to recover his nerve or breath orme rose and preceded by japhet climbed up the bushlike rock till he reached the shaft of the sphinxs tail here he turned and waved his hand to us then following the mountaineer walked apparently with the utmost confidence along the curves of the tail to where it sprang from the body of the idol at this spot there was a little difficulty in climbing over the smooth slope of rock on to the broad terracelike back soon however they surmounted it and vanishing for a few seconds into the hollow of the loins which of course was a good many feet deep reappeared moving toward the shoulders between these we could see higgs standing with his back toward us utterly unconscious of all that was passing behind him  passing japhet oliver walked up to the professor and touched him on the arm higgs turned stared at the pair for a moment and then in his astonishment or so we guessed sat down plump upon the rock they pulled him to his feet orme pointing to the cliff behind and evidently explaining the situation and what must be done then followed a short and animated talk through the glasses we could even see higgs shaking his head he told them something they came to a determination for now he turned stepped forward a pace or two and vanished as i learnt afterwards to fetch my son without whom he would not try to escape  a while went by it seemed an age but really was under a minute we heard the sound of shouts higgss white helmet reappeared and then his body with two fung guards clinging on to him he yelled out in english and the words reached us faintly  save yourself ill hold these devils run you infernal fool run  oliver hesitated although the mountaineer was pulling at him till the heads of more fung appeared then with a gesture of despair he turned and fled first ran oliver then japhet whom he had outpaced and after them came a number of priests or guards waving knives while in the background higgs rolled on the rock with his captors  the rest was very short orme slid down the rump of the idol on to the tail followed by the mountaineer and after them in single file came three fung who apparently thought no more of the perilous nature of their foothold than do the sheiks of the egyptian pyramids when they swarm about those monuments like lizards nor for the matter of that did oliver or japhet who doubled down the tail as though it were a race track oliver swung himself on to the ladder and in a second was half across it we holding its other end when suddenly he heard his companion cry out a fung had got hold of japhet by the leg and he lay face downward on the board  oliver halted and slowly turned round drawing his revolver as he did so then he aimed and fired and the fung leaving go of japhets leg threw up his arms and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath the next thing i remember is that they were both among us and somebody shouted pull in the ladder  no said quick wait a bit  vaguely i wondered why till i perceived that three of those courageous fung were following across it resting their hands upon each others shoulders while their companions cheered them  now pull brothers pull shouted the sergeant and pull we did poor fung they deserved a better fate  always inflict loss upon the enemy when you get a chance remarked the sergeant as he opened fire with his repeating rifle upon other fung who by now were clustering upon the back of the idol this position however they soon abandoned as untenable except one or two of them who remained there dead or wounded  a silence followed in the midst of which i heard quick saying to joshua in his very worst arabic  now does your royal highness think that we gentiles are cowards although it is true those fung are as good men as we any day  joshua declined argument and i turned to watch oliver who had covered his face with his hands and seemed to be weeping  what is it o friend what is it i heard maqueda say in her gentle voicea voice full of tears tears of gratitude i think you have done a great deed you have returned safe all is well  nay he answered forgetting her titles in his distress all is ill i have failed and tonight they throw my brother to the lions he told me so  maqueda finding no answer stretched out her hand to the mountaineer his companion in adventure who kissed it  japhet she said i am proud of you your reward is fourfold and henceforth you are a captain of my mountaineers  tell us what happened i said to oliver  this he answered i remembered about your son and so did higgs in fact he spoke of him firstthey seem to have become friends he said he would not escape without him and could fetch him in a moment as he was only just below well he went to do so and must have found the guard instead who i suppose had heard us talking you know as much about the rest as i do tonight when the full moon is two hours high there is to be a ceremony of sacrifice and poor higgs will be let down into the den of lions he was writing his will in a notebook when we saw him as barung had promised to send it to us  doctor said the sergeant in a confidential voice when he had digested this information would you translate for me a bit as i want to have a talk with cat there and my arabic dont run to it  i nodded and we went to that corner of the plateau where shadrach stood apart watching and listening  now cat said the sergeant i give his remarks in his own language leaving out my rendering just listen to me and understand that if you tell lies or play games either you or i dont reach the top of this cliff again alive do you catch on  shadrach replied that he caught on  very well youve told us that once you were a prisoner among the fung and thrown to these holy lions but got out now just explain what happened  this o quick after ceremonies that do not matter i was let down in the foodbasket into the feedingden and thrown out of the basket like any other meat then the gates were lifted up by the chains and the lions came in to devour me according to their custom  and what happened next shadrach  what happened why of course i hid myself in the shadow as much as possible right against the walls of the precipice until a satan of a shelion snuffled me out and gave a stroke at me look here are the marks of her claws and he pointed to the scars upon his face those claws stung like scorpions they made me mad the terror which i had lost when i saw their yellow eyes came back to me i rushed at the precipice as a cat that is hunted by a dog rushes at a wall i clung to its smooth side with my nails with my toes with my teeth a lion leaped up and tore the flesh of my leg here here and he showed the marks which we could scarcely see in that dim light he ran back for another spring above me i saw a tiny ledge big enough for a hawk to sit onno more i jumped i caught it drawing up my legs so that the lion missed me i made the effort a man makes once in his life somehow i dragged myself to that ledge i rested one thigh upon it and pressed against the rock to steady myself then the rock gave and i tumbled backward into the bottom of a tunnel afterwards i escaped to the top of the cliff in the dark o god of israel in the dark smelling my way climbing like a baboon risking death a thousand times it took me two whole days and nights and the last of those nights i knew not what i did yet i found my way and that is why my people name me cat  i understand said quick in a new and more respectful voice and however big a rascal you may be youve got pluck now say remembering what i told you and he tapped the handle of his revolver is that feedingden where it used to be  i believe so o quick why should it be changed the victims are let down from the belly of the god just there between his thighs where are doors the feedingplace lies in a hollow of the cliff this platform on which we stand is over it none saw my escape therefore none searched for the means of it since they thought that the lions had devoured me as they have devoured thousands no one enters there only when the beasts have fed full they draw back to their sleepingdens and those who watch above let down the bars listen and as he spoke we heard a crash and a rattle far below they fall now the lions having eaten when black windows and perhaps others are thrown to them by and by they will be drawn up again  is that hole in the rock still there shadrach  without doubt though i have not been down to look  then my boy you are going now remarked quick grimly    chapter xii  the den of lions  we returned to the others and told them everything that we had learned from shadrach  whats your plan sergeant asked oliver when he had heard tell me for i have none my head is muddled  this captain for what it is worth that i should go down through the hole that cat here speaks of and get into the den then when they let down the professor if they do and pull up the gates that i should keep back the lions with my rifle while he bolts to the ladder which is ready for him and i follow if i can  capital said orme but you cant go alone ill come too  and i also i said  what schemes do you make asked maqueda eagerly for of course she could not understand our talk  we explained  what my friend she said to oliver reproachfully would you risk your life again tonight surely it is tempting the goodness of god  it would be tempting the goodness of god much more if i left my friend to be eaten by lions lady he answered  then followed much discussions in the end it was agreed that we should descend to the level of the den if this were possible that oliver and quick should go down into the den with japhet who instantly volunteered to accompany them and that i with some of the mountaineers should stop in the mouth of the hole as a reserve to cover their retreat from the lions i pleaded to be allowed to take a more active part but of this they would not hear saying with some truth that i was by far the best shot of the three and could do much more to help them from above if as was hoped the moon should shine brightly  but i knew they really meant that i was too old to be of service in such an adventure as this also they desired to keep me out of risk  then came the question as to who should descend the last tunnel to the place of operations oliver wished maqueda to return to the top of the cliff and wait there but she said at once that she could not think of attempting the ascent without our aid also that she was determined to see the end of the matter even joshua would not go i think that being an unpopular character among them he distrusted the mountaineers whose duty it would have been to escort him  it was suggested that he should remain where he was until we returned if we did return but this idea commended itself to him still less than the other indeed he pointed out with much truth what we had overlooked namely that now the fung knew of the passage and were quite capable of playing our own game that is of throwing a bridge across from the sphinxs tail and attempting the storm of mur  and then what should i do if they found me here alone he added pathetically  maqueda answered that she was sure she did not know but that meanwhile it might be wise to block the mouth of the tunnel by which we had reached the plateau in such a fashion that it could not easily be forced  yes answered oliver and if we ever get out of this to blow the shaft in and make sure that it cannot be used  that shaft might be useful captain said quick doubtfully  there is a better way sergeant if we want to mine under the sphinx i mean through the tomb of kings i took the levels roughly and the end of it cant be far off anyhow this shaft is of no more use to us now that the fung have found it out  then we set to work to fill in the mouth of the passage with such loose stones as we could find it was a difficult business but in the end the mountaineers made a very fair job of it under our direction piling the rocks in such a fashion that they could scarcely be cleared away in any short time without the aid of explosives  while this work was going on japhet shadrach and the sergeant in charge of him undertook to explore the last shaft which led down to the level of the den to our relief just as we had finished building up the hole they returned with the news that now after they had removed a fallen stone or two it was quite practicable with the aid of ropes and ladders  so in the same order as before we commenced its passage and in about halfanhour for it was under three hundred feet in depth arrived safely at the foot here we found a bathaunted place like a room that evidently had been hollowed out by man as shadrach had said at its eastern extremity was a large oblong boulder so balanced that if even one person pushed on either of its ends it swung around leaving on each side a passage large enough to allow a man to walk through in a crouching attitude  very silently we propped open this primæval door and looked out now the full moon was up and her brilliant light had begun to flood the gulf by it we saw a dense shadow that reached from the ground to three hundred feet or so above us this we knew to be that thrown by the flanks of the gigantic sphinx which projected beyond the mountain of stone whereon it rested those flanks whence according to shadrach higgs would be lowered in a foodbasket in this shadow and on either side of it covering a space of quite a hundred yards square lay the feedingden whence arose a sickly and horrible odour such as is common to any place frequented by cats mingled with the more pungent smell of decaying flesh  this darksome den was surrounded on three sides by precipices and on the fourth that toward the east enclosed by a wall or barrier of rock pierced with several gates made of bars of metal or so we judged by the light that flowed through them  from beyond this eastern wall came dreadful sounds of roars snarls and whimperings evidently there the sacred lions had their home  only one more thing need be mentioned on the rock floor almost immediately beneath us lay remains which from their torn clothes and hair we knew must be human as somebody explained i think it was shadrach they were those of the man whom orme had shot upon the tail of the sphinx and of his companions who had been tilted off the ladder  for awhile we gazed at this horrible hole in silence then oliver took out his watch which was a repeater and struck it  higgs told me he said that he was to be thrown to the lions two hours after moonrise which is within fifteen minutes or so sergeant i think we had better be getting ready  yes captain answered quick but everything is quite ready including those brutes to judge by the noise they make excepting perhaps samuel quick who never felt less ready for anything in his life now then pussy run out that ladder heres your rifle captain and six reload clips of cartridges five hollownosed bullets in each youll never want more than that and its no use carrying extra weight in your righthand pocket captain dont forget ive the same in mine doctor heres a pile for you laid upon that stone if you lie there youll have a good light and rest for your elbow and at this range ought to make very pretty shooting even in the moonlight best keep your pistol on the safe captain at least im doing so as we might get a fall and these newfangled weapons are very hairtriggered heres japhet ready too so give us your marching orders sir and we will go to business the doctor will translate to japhet  we descend the ladder said orme and advance about fifty paces into the shadow where we can see without being seen where also according to shadrach the foodbasket is let down there we shall stand and await the arrival of this basket if it contains the professor he whom the fung and the abati know as black windows japhet you are to seize him and lead or if necessary carry him to the ladder up which some of the mountaineers must be ready to help him your duty sergeant and mine also that of the doctor firing from above will be to keep off the lions as best we can should any lions appear retreating as we fire if the brutes get one of us he must be left since it is foolish that both lives should be sacrificed needlessly for the rest you sergeant and you japhet must be guided by circumstances and act upon your own discretion do not wait for special orders from me which i may not be able to give now come on if we do not return adams you will see the child of kings safely up the shafts and conduct her to mur goodbye lady  goodbye answered maqueda in a brave voice i could not see her face in the darkness presently i am sure you will return with your brother  just then joshua broke in  i will not be outdone in courage by these gentiles he said lacking their terrible weapons i cannot advance into the den but i will descend and guard the foot of the ladder  very well sir answered orme in an astonished voice glad to have your company i am sure only remember that you must be quick in going up it again since hungry lions are active and let all take notice that we are not responsible for anything that may happen to you  surely you had better stop where you are my uncle remarked maqueda  to be mocked by you for ever after my niece no i go to face the lions and very slowly he crept through the hole and began to descend the ladder indeed when quick followed after an interval he found him only halfway down and had to hurry his movements by accidentally treading on his fingers  a minute or two later peeping over the edge i saw that they were all in the den that is except joshua who had reascended the ladder to the height of about six feet and stood on it face outward holding to the rock on either side with his hands as though he had been crucified fearing lest he should be seen there even in the shadow i suggested to maqueda that she should order him either to go down or to return which she did vigorously but without effect so in the end we left him alone  meanwhile the three had vanished into the shadow of the sphinx and we could see nothing of them the great round moon rose higher and higher flooding the rest of the charnelhouse with light and save for an occasional roar or whimper from the lions beyond the wall the silence was intense now i could make out the metal gates in this wall and even dark and stealthy forms which passed and repassed beyond their bars then i made out something else also the figures of men gathering on the top of the wall though whence they came i knew not by degrees their number increased till there were hundreds of them for the wall was broad as a roadway  evidently these were spectators come to witness the ceremony of sacrifice  prince i whispered to joshua you must get down off the ladder or you will betray us all nay it is too late to come up here again for already the moonlight strikes just above your head go down or we will cast the ladder loose and let you fall  so he went down and hid himself among some ferns and bushes where we saw no more of him for a while and to tell the truth forgot his existence  far far above us from the back of the idol i suppose came a faint sound of solemn chanting it sank and we heard shouts then suddenly it swelled again now maqueda who knelt near me touched my arm and pointed to the shadow which gradually was becoming infiltrated with the moonlight flowing into it from either side i looked and high in the air perhaps two hundred feet from the ground saw something dark descending slowly doubtless it was the basket containing higgs and whether by coincidence or no at this moment the lions on the farther side of the wall burst into peal upon peal of terrific roaring perhaps their sentries watching at the gate saw or smelt the familiar basket and communicated the intelligence to their fellows  slowly slowly it descended till it was within a few feet of the ground when it began to sway backward and forward like a pendulum at each swing covering a wider arc presently when it hung over the edge of the shadow that was nearest to us it was let down with a run and overset and out of it looking very small in those vast surroundings and that mysterious light rolled the figure of a man although at that distance we could see little of him accident assured us of his identity for as he rolled the hat he wore fell from him and i knew it at once for higgss sunhelmet he rose from the ground limped very slowly and painfully after the helmet picked it up and proceeded to use it to dust his knees at this moment there was a clanking sound  oh they lift the gates murmured maqueda  then followed more sounds this time of wild beasts raging for their prey and of other human beasts shrieking with excitement on the wall above the professor turned and saw for a moment he seemed about to run then changed his mind clapped the helmet on his head folded his arms and stood still reminding me in some curious way perhaps because of the shortness of his thick figure of a picture i had seen of the great napoleon contemplating a disaster  to describe what followed is extremely difficult for we watched not one but several simultaneous scenes for instance there were the lions which did not behave as might have been expected i thought that they would rush through the doors and bound upon the victim but whether it was because they had already been fed that afternoon or because they thought that a single human being was not worth the trouble they acted differently  through the open gates they came in two indolent yellow lines male lions female lions halfgrown lions cub lions that cuffed each other in play in all perhaps fifty or sixty of them of these only two or three looked towards the professor for none of them ran or galloped while the rest spread over the den some of them vanishing into the shadow at the edge of the surrounding cliff where the moonlight could not reach  here one of them at any rate must have travelled fast enough for it seemed only a few seconds later that we heard a terrific yell beneath us and craning over the rock i saw the prince joshua running up the ladder more swiftly than ever did any london lamplighter when i was a boy  but quickly as he came the long thin sinuous thing beneath came quicker it reared itself on its hind legs it stretched up a great pawi can see the gleaming claws in it nowand struck or hooked at poor joshua the paw caught him in the small of the back and seemed to pin him against the ladder then it was drawn slowly downward and heaven how joshua howled up came the other paw to repeat the operation when stretching myself outward and downward with an abati holding me by the ankles i managed to shoot the beast through the head so that it fell all of a heap taking with it a large portion of joshuas nether garments  a few seconds later he was among us and tumbled groaning into a corner where he lay in charge of some of the mountaineers for i had no time to attend to him just then  when the smoke cleared at length i saw that japhet had reached higgs and was gesticulating to him to run while two lions a male and a female stood at a little distance regarding the pair in an interested fashion higgs after some brief words of explanation pointed to his knee evidently he was lamed and could not run japhet rising to the occasion pointed to his back and bent down higgs flung himself upon it and was hitched up like a sack of flour the pair began to advance toward the ladder japhet carrying higgs as one schoolboy carries another  the lion sat down like a great dog watching this strange proceeding with mild interest but the lioness filled with feminine curiosity followed sniffing at higgs who looked over his shoulder taking off his battered helmet he threw it at the beast hitting her on the head she growled then seized the helmet playing with it for a moment as a kitten does with a ball of wool and next instant finding it unsatisfying uttered a short and savage roar ran forward and crouched to spring lashing her tail i could not fire because a bullet that would hit her must first pass through japhet and higgs  but just when i thought that the end had come a rifle went off in the shadow and she rolled over kicking and biting the rock thereon the indolent male lion seemed to awake and sprang not at the men but at the wounded lioness and a hellish fight ensued of which the details and end were lost in a mist of dust and flying hair  the crowd upon the wall becoming alive to the real situation began to scream in indignant excitement which quickly communicated itself to the less savage beasts these set up a terrible roaring and ran about keeping for the most part to the shadows while japhet and his burden made slow but steady progress toward the ladder  then from the gloom beneath the hindquarters of the sphinx rose a sound of rapid firing and presently orme and quick emerged into the moonlight followed by a number of angry lions that advanced in short rushes evidently the pair had kept their heads and were acting on a plan  one of them emptied his rifle at the pursuing beasts while the other ran back a few paces thrusting in a fresh clip of cartridges as he went then he began to fire and his companion in turn retreated behind him in this way they knocked over a number of lions for the range was too short for them to miss often and the expanding bullets did their work very well paralyzing even when they did not kill i also opened fire over their heads and although in that uncertain light the majority of my shots did no damage the others disposed of several animals which i saw were becoming dangerous  so things went on until all four that is japhet with higgs upon his back and orme and quick were within twenty paces of the ladder although separated from each other by perhaps half the length of a cricket pitch we thought that they were safe and shouted in our joy while the hundreds of spectators on the wall who fortunately dared not descend into the den because of the lions which are undiscriminating beasts yelled with rage at the imminent rescue of the sacrifice  then of a sudden the position changed from every quarter fresh lions seemed to arrive ringing the men round and clearly bent on slaughter although the shouting and the sound of firearms which they had never heard before frightened them and made them cautious  a halfgrown cub rushed in and knocked over japhet and higgs i fired and hit it in the flank it bit savagely at its wound then sprang on to the prostrate pair and stood over them growling but in such pain that it forgot to kill them the ring of beasts closed inwe could see their yellow eyes glowing in the gloom orme and quick might have got through by the help of their rifles but they could not leave the others the dreadful climax seemed at hand  follow me said maqueda who all this while had watched panting at my side and rose to run to the ladder i thrust her back  nay i shouted follow me abati shall a woman lead you  of how i descended that ladder i have no recollection nor do i in the least know how the mountaineers came after me but i think that the most of them rolled and scrambled down the thirty feet of rock at least to their honour be it said they did come yelling like demons and waving long knives in their hands  the effect of our sudden arrival from above was extraordinary scared by the rush and the noise the lions gave way then bolted in every direction the wounded cub which could not or would not move being stabbed to death where it stood over higgs and japhet  five minutes more and all of us were safe in the mouth of the tunnel    that was how we rescued higgs from the den of the sacred lions which guarded the idol of the fung    chapter xiii  the adventures of higgs  a more weary and dishevelled set of people than that which about the hour of dawn finally emerged from the mouth of the ancient shaft on to the cliffs of mur it has seldom been my lot to behold yet with a single exception the party was a happy one for we had come triumphant through great dangers and actually effected our objectthe rescue of higgs which under the circumstances most people would have thought impossible yes there he was in the flesh before us having injured his knee and lost his hat but otherwise quite sound save for a few trifling scratches inflicted by the cub and still wearing what the natives called his black windows  even the prince joshua was happy though wrapped in a piece of coarse sacking because the lion had taken most of his posterior clothing and terribly sore from the deep cuts left by the claws  had he not dared the dangers of the den and thus proved himself a hero whose fame would last for generations had i not assured him that his honourable wounds though painful as a matter of fact after they had set they kept him stiff as a mummy for some days so that unless he stood upon his feet he had to be carried or lie rigid on his face would probably not prove fatal and had he not actually survived to reach the upper air again which was more than he ever expected to do no wonder that he was happy  i alone could not share in the general joy since although my friend was restored to me my son still remained a prisoner among the fung yet even in this matter things might have been worse since i learned that he was well treated and in no danger but of that i will write presently  never shall i forget the scene after the arrival of higgs in our hole when the swinging boulder had been closed and made secure and the lamps lighted there he sat on the floor his red hair glowing like a torch his clothes torn and bloody his beard ragged and stretching in a newgate frill to his ears indeed his whole appearance accentuated by the blue spectacles with wire gauze sidepieces was more disreputable than words can tell moreover he smelt horribly of lion he put his hand into his pocket and produced his big pipe which had remained unbroken in its case  some tobacco please he said those were his first words to us i have finished mine saved up the last to smoke just before they put me into that stinking basket  i gave him some and as he lit his pipe the light of the match fell upon the face of maqueda who was staring at him with amused astonishment  what an uncommonly pretty woman he said whats she doing down here and who is she  i told him whereon he rose or rather tried to felt for his hat which of course had gone with the idea of taking it off and instantly addressed her in his beautiful and fluent arabic saying how glad he was to have this unexpected honour and so forth  she congratulated him on his escape whereon his face grew serious  yes a nasty business he said as yet i can hardly remember whether my name is daniel or ptolemy higgs then he turned to us and added look here you fellows if i dont thank you it isnt because i am not grateful but because i cant the truth is im a bit dazed your son is all right adams hes a good fellow and we grew great friends safe oh yes hes safe as a church old barung hes the sultan and another good fellow although he did throw me to the lionsbecause the priests made himis very fond of him and is going to marry him to his daughter  at this moment the men announced that everything was ready for our ascent and when i had attended to joshua with a heart made thankful by higgss news we began that toilsome business and as i have already said at length accomplished it safely but even then our labours were not ended since it was necessary to fill up the mouth of the shaft so as to make it impossible that it should be used by the fung who now knew of its existence  nor was this a business that could be delayed for as we passed the plateau whence oliver and japhet had crossed to the sphinx we heard the voices of men on the farther side of the rough wall that we had built there evidently the priests or idol guards infuriated by the rescue of their victim had already managed to bridge the gulf and were contemplating assault a knowledge which caused us to hurry our movements considerably if they had got through before we passed them our fate would have been terrible since at the best we must have slowly starved in the pit below  indeed as soon as we reached the top and had blocked it temporarily quick weary as he was was sent off on horseback accompanied by maqueda shadrach now under the terms of his contract once more a free man and two mountaineers to gallop to the palace of mur and fetch a supply of explosives the rest of us for higgs declined to leave and we had no means of carrying joshua remained watching the place or rather the abati watched while we slept with our rifles in our hands before noon quick returned accompanied by many men with litters and all things needful  then we pulled out the stones and oliver japhet and some others descended to the first level and arranged blasting charges awhile after he reappeared with his companions looking somewhat pale and anxious and shouted to us to get back following our retreat to a certain distance unwinding a wire as he came presently he stopped and pressed the button of a battery which he held in his hand there was a muffled explosion and a tremor of the soil like to that of an earthquake while from the mouth of the shaft stones leapt into the air  it was over and all that could be noted was a sinkage in the ground where the ancient pit had been  i am sorry for them said oliver presently but it had to be done  sorry for whom i asked  for those fung priests or soldiers the levels below are full of them dead or alive they were pouring up at our heels well no one will travel that road again    later in the guest house at mur higgs told us his story after his betrayal by shadrach which it appeared was meant to include us all for the professor overheard the hurried talk between him and a fung captain he was seized and imprisoned in the body of the great sphinx where many chambers and dungeons had been hollowed out by the primæval race that fashioned it here barung the sultan visited him and informed him of his meeting with the rest of us to whom apparently he had taken a great liking and also that we had refused to purchase a chance of his release at the price of being false to our trust  you know said higgs that when first i heard this i was very angry with you and thought you a set of beasts but on considering things i saw the other side of it and that you were right although i never could come to fancy the idea of being sacrificed to a sphinx by being chucked like a piece of horseflesh to a lot of holy lions however barung an excellent fellow in his way assured me that there was no road out of the matter without giving grave offence to the priests who are very powerful among the fung and bringing a fearful curse on the nation  meanwhile he made me as comfortable as he could for instance i was allowed to walk upon the back of the idol to associate with the priests a suspicious and most exclusive set and to study their entire religious system from which i have no doubt that of egypt was derived indeed i have made a great discovery which if ever we get out of this will carry my name down to all generations the forefathers of these fung were undoubtedly also the forefathers of the predynastic egyptians as is shown by the similarity of their customs and spiritual theories further intercourse was kept up between the fung who then had their headquarters here in mur and the egyptians in the time of the ancient empire till the twentieth dynasty indeed if not later my friends in the dungeons in which i was confined there is an inscription or rather a graffite made by a prisoner extradited to mur by rameses ii after twenty years residence in egypt which was written by him on the night before he was thrown to the sacred lions that even in those days were an established institution and i have got a copy of that inscription in my pocketbook i tell you he added in a scream of triumph ive got a certified copy of that inscription thanks to shadrach on whose dirty head be blessings  i congratulated him heartily upon this triumph and before he proceeded to give us further archæological details asked him for some information about my boy  oh said higgs he is a very nice young man and extremely good looking indeed i am quite proud to have such a godson he was much interested to hear that you were hunting for him after so many years quite touched indeed he still talks english though with a fung accent and of course would like to escape meanwhile he is having a very good time being chief singer to the god for his voice is really beautiful an office which carries with it all sorts of privileges i told you didnt i that he is to be married to barungs only legitimate daughter on the night of the next full moon but one the ceremony is to take place in harmac city and will be the greatest of its sort for generations a feast of the entire people in short i should very much like to be present at it but being an intelligent young man he has promised to keep notes of everything which i hope may become available in due course  and is he attached to this savage lady i asked dismayed  attached oh dear no i think he said he had never seen her and only knew that she was rather plain and reported to possess a haughty temper he is a philosophical young man however as might be expected from one who has undergone so many vicissitudes and therefore takes things as they come thanking heaven that they are no worse you see as the husband of the sultans daughter unless the pair quarrel very violently he will be safe from the lions and he could never quite say as much before but we didnt go into these domestic matters very deeply as there were so many more important things to interest us both he wanted to know all about you and our plans and naturally i wanted to know all about the fung and the ritual and traditions connected with the worship of harmac so that we were never dull for a single moment in fact i wish that we could have had longer together for we became excellent friends but whatever happens i think that i have collected the cream of his information and he tapped a fat notebook in his hands adding  what an awful thing it would have been if a lion had eaten this for myself it did not matter there may be many better egyptologists but i doubt if any one of them will again have such opportunities of original research however i took every possible precaution to save my notes by leaving a copy of the most important of them written with native ink upon sheepskin in charge of your son indeed i meant to leave the originals also but fortunately forgot in the excitement of my very hurried departure  i agreed with him that his chances had been unique and that he was a most lucky archæologist and presently he went on puffing at his pipe  of course when oliver turned up in that unexpected fashion on the back of the idol remembering your wishes and natural desire to recover your son i did my best to rescue him also but he wasnt in the room beneath where i thought i should find him the priests were there instead and they had heard us talking above and you know the rest well as it happens it didnt matter though that descent into the den of lionsthere were two or three hundred feet of it and the rope seemed worn uncommonly thin with usewas a trying business to the nerves  what did you think about all the time asked oliver curiously  think about i didnt think much was in too great a fright i just wondered whether st paul had the same sensations when he was let down in a basket wondered what the early christian martyrs felt like in the arena wondered whether barung with whom my parting was quite affectionate would come in the morning and look for me as darius did for daniel and how much he would find if he did hoped that my specs would give one of those brutes appendicitis and so forth my word it was sickening especially that kind of schooltreat swing and bump at the end i never could bear swinging still it was all for the best as i shouldnt have gone a yard along that sphinxs tail without tumbling off tightrope walking not being in my line and ill tell you what you are just the best three fellows in the whole world dont you think i forget that because i havent said much and now lets have your yarn for i want to hear how things stand which i never expected to do this side of judgmentday  so we told him all while he listened openmouthed when we came to the description of the tomb of the kings his excitement could scarcely be restrained  you havent touched them he almost screamed dont say you have been vandals enough to touch them for every article must be catalogued in situ and drawings must be made if possible specimen groups with their surrounding offerings should be moved so that they can be set up again in museums why theres six months work before me at least and to think that if it hadnt been for you by now i should be in process of digestion by a lion a stinking mangy sacred lion  next morning i was awakened by higgs limping into my room in some weird sleepingsuit that he had contrived with the help of quick  i say old fellow he said tell me some more about that girl walda nagasta what a sweet face shes got and what pluck of course such things aint in my line never looked at a woman these twenty years past hard enough to remember her next morning but by jingo the eyes of that one made me feel quite queer here and he hit the sleepingsuit somewhere in the middle though perhaps it was only because she was such a contrast to the lions  ptolemy i answered in a solemn voice let me tell you that she is more dangerous to meddle with than any lion and whats more if you dont want to further complicate matters with a flaming row you had better keep to your old habits and leave her eyes alone i mean that oliver is in love with her  of course he is i never expected anything else but whats that got to do with it why shouldnt i be in love with her too though i admit he added sadly contemplating his rotund form the chances are in his favour especially as hes got the start  they are ptolemy for shes in love with him and i told him what we had seen in the tomb of kings  first he roared with laughter then on second thoughts grew exceedingly indignant  i call it scandalous of oliver compromising us all in this waythe lucky dog these selfish amorous adventures will let us in for no end of trouble it is even probably adams that you and i may come to a miserable end solely because of this young mans erotic tendencies just fancy neglecting business in order to run after a pretty roundfaced jewess that is if she is a jewess which i doubt as the blood must have got considerably mixed by now and the first queen of sheba if she ever existed was an ethiopian as a friend almost old enough to be his father i shall speak to him very seriously  all right i called after him as he hobbled off to take his bath only if you are wise you wont speak to maqueda for she might misinterpret your motives if you go on staring at her as you did yesterday    that morning i was summoned to see the prince joshua and dress his wounds which although not of a serious nature were very painful the moment that i entered the mans presence i noticed a change in his face like the rest of us i had always set this fellow down as a mere poltroon and windbag a blower of his own trumpet as oliver had called him now i got an insight into his real nature which showed me that although he might be these things and worse he was also a very determined and dangerous person animated by ambitions which he meant to satisfy at all hazards  when i had done what i could for him and told him that in my opinion he had no ill results to fear from his hurts since the thick clothes he was wearing at the time had probably cleaned the lions paws of any poison that might have been on them he said  physician i desire private words with you  i bowed and he went on  the child of kings hereditary ruler of this land somewhat against the advice of her council has thought fit to employ you and your gentile companions in order that by your skill and certain arts of which you are masters you may damage its ancient enemies the fung and in reward has promised to pay you well should you succeed in your endeavours now i wish you to understand that though you think yourselves great men and may for aught i know be great in your own country here you are but servants like any other mercenaries whom it may please us to hire  his tone was so offensive that though it might have been wiser to keep silent i could not help interrupting him  you use hard words prince i said let me then explain what is the real pay for which we work and undergo some risks mine is the hope of recovering a son who is the slave of your enemies that of the captain orme is the quest of adventure and war since being a rich man in his own country he needs no further wealth that of him whom you call black windows but whose name is higgs is the pure love of learning in england and throughout the west he is noted for his knowledge of dead peoples their languages and customs and it is to study these that he has undertaken so terrible a journey as for quick he is ormes man who has known him from childhood an old soldier who has served with him in war and comes hither to be with the master whom he loves  ah said joshua a servant a person of no degree who yet dares to threaten me the premier prince of the abati to my face  in the presence of death all men are equal prince you acted in a fashion that might have brought his lord who was daring a desperate deed to a hideous doom  and what do i care about his lords desperate deeds physician i see that you set store by such things and think those who accomplish them great and wonderful well we do not there is no savage among the barbarous fung would not do all that your orme does and more just because he is a savage we who are civilized we who are cultivated we who are wise know better our lives were given us to enjoy not to throw away or to lose at the swords point and therefore no doubt you would call us cowards  yet prince those who bear that title of coward which you hold one of honour are apt to perish at the swords point the fung wait without your gates o prince  and therefore o gentile we hire you to fight the fung still i bear no grudge against your servant quick who is himself but a whiteskinned fung for he acted according to his nature and i forgive him only in the future let him beware and nowfor a greater matter the child of kings is beautiful she is young and high spirited a new face from another land may perchance touch her fancy but he added meaningly let the owner of that face remember who she is and what he is let him remember that for any outside the circle of the ancient blood to lift his eyes to the daughter of solomon is to earn death death slow and cruel for himself and all who aid and abet him let him remember lastly that this highborn lady to whom he an unknown and vagrant gentile dares to talk as equal to equal has from childhood been my affianced who will shortly be my wife although it may please her to seem to flout me after the fashion of maidens and that we abati are jealous of the honour of our women do you understand  yes prince i answered for by now my temper was roused but i would have you understand something alsothat we are men of a high race whose arm stretches over half the world and that we differ from the little tribe of the abati whose fame is not known to us in thisthat we are jealous of our own honour and do not need to hire strangers to fight the foes we fear to face next time i come to attend to your wounds o prince i trust that they will be in front and not behind one word more if you will be advised by me you will not threaten that captain whom you call a gentile and a mercenary lest you should learn that it is not always well to be a coward of blood however ancient  then in a towering rage i left him feeling that i had made a thorough fool of myself but the truth was that i could not sit still and hear men such as my companions to say nothing of myself spoken of thus by a bloated cur who called himself a prince and boasted of his own poltroonery he glowered at me as i went and the men of his party who hung about the end of the great room and in his courts glowered at me also clearly he was a very dangerous cur and i almost wished that instead of threatening to slap his face down in the tunnel quick had broken his neck and made an end of him  so did the others when i told them the story although i think it opened their eyes and especially those of oliver to the grave and growing dangers of the situation afterward he informed me that he had spoken of the matter with maqueda and that she was much frightened for our sakes and somewhat for her own joshua she said was a man capable of any crime who had at his back the great majority of the abati a jealous mean and intolerant race who made up in cunning for what they lacked in courage  yet as i saw well the peril of their situation did nothing to separate this pair or to lessen their love indeed rather did it seem to bind them closer together and to make them more completely one in short the tragedy took its appointed course whilst we stood by and watched it helplessly  on the afternoon of my angry interview with joshua we were summoned to a meeting of the council whither we went not without some trepidation expecting trouble trouble there was but of a different sort to that which we feared scarcely had we entered the great room where the child of kings was seated in her chair of state surrounded by all the pomp and ceremony of her mimic court when the big doors at the end of it were opened and through them marched three graybearded men in white robes whom we saw at once were heralds or ambassadors from the fung these men bowed to the veiled maqueda and turning toward where we stood in a little group apart bowed to us also  but of joshua who was there supported by two servants for he could not yet stand alone and the other notables and priests of the abati they took not the slightest heed  speak said maqueda  lady answered the spokesman of the embassy we are sent by our sultan barung son of barung ruler of the fung nation these are the words of barung o walda nagasta by the hands and the wit of the white lords whom you have called to your aid you have of late done much evil to the god harmac and to me his servant you have destroyed one of the gates of my city and with it many of my people you have rescued a prisoner out of my hands robbing harmac of his sacrifice and thereby bringing his wrath upon us you have slain sundry of the sacred beasts that are the mouth of sacrifice you have killed certain of the priests and guards of harmac in a hole of the rocks moreover my spies tell me that you plan further ills against the god and against me now i send to tell you that for these and other offences i will make an end of the people of the abati whom hitherto i have spared in a little while i marry my daughter to the white man that priest of harmac who is called singer of egypt and who is said to be the son of the physician in your service but after i have celebrated this feast and my people have finished the hoeing of their crops i take up the sword in earnest nor will i lay it down again until the abati are no more  learn that last night after the holy beasts had been slain and the sacrifice snatched away the god harmac spoke to his priests in prophecy and this was his prophecy that before the gathering in of the harvest his head should sleep above the plain of mur we know not the interpretation of the saying but this i know that before the gathering of the harvest i or those who rule after me will lie down to sleep within my city of mur  now choosesurrender forthwith and save for the dog joshua who the other day tried to entrap me against the custom of peoples and ten others whom i shall name i will spare the lives of all of you though joshua and these ten i will hang since they are not worthy to die by the sword or resist and by harmac himself i swear that every man among the abati shall die save the white lords whom i honour because they are brave and that servant of yours who stood with them last night in the den of lions and that every woman shall be made a slave save you o walda nagasta because of your great heart your answer o lady of the abati  now maqueda looked around the faces of her council and saw fear written upon them all indeed as we noted many of them shook in their terror  my answer will be short ambassadors of barung she replied still i am but one woman and it is fitting that those who represent the people should speak for the people my uncle joshua you are the first of my council what have you to say are you willing to give up your life with ten others whose names i do not know that there may be peace between us and the fung  what answered joshua with a splutter of rage do i live to hear a walda nagasta suggest that the first prince of the land her uncle and affianced husband should be surrendered to our hereditary foes to be hanged like a wornout hound and do you o unknown ten who doubtless stand in this chamber live to hear it also  my uncle you do not i asked if such was your wish that is all  then i answer that it is not my wish nor the wish of the ten nor the wish of the abati nay we will fight the fung and destroy them and of their beastheaded idol harmac we will make blocks to build our synagogues and stones to pave our roads do you hear savages of fung and assisted by his two servants he hobbled towards them grinning in their faces  the envoys looked him up and down with their quiet eyes we hear and we are very glad to hear their spokesman answered since we fung love to settle our quarrels with the sword and not by treaty but to you joshua we say make haste to die before we enter mur since the rope is not the only means of death whereof we know  very solemnly the three ambassadors saluted first the child of kings and next ourselves then turned to go  kill them shouted joshua they have threatened and insulted me the prince  but no one lifted a hand against the men who passed safely out of the palace to the square where an escort waited with their horses    chapter xiv  how pharaoh met shadrach  when the ambassadors had gone at first there was silence a very heavy silence since even the frivolous abati felt that the hour was big with fate of a sudden however the members of the council began to chatter like so many monkeys each talking without listening to what his neighbour said till at length a gorgeously dressed person i understood that he was a priest stepped forward and shouted down the others  then he spoke in an excited and venomous fashion he pointed out that we gentiles had brought all this trouble upon mur since before we came the abati although threatened had lived in peace and gloryhe actually used the word gloryfor generations but now we had stung the fung as a hornet stings a bull and made them mad so that they wished to toss the abati he proposed therefore that we should at once be ejected from mur  at this point i saw joshua whisper into the ear of a man who called out  no no for then they would go to their friend barung a savage like themselves and having learned our secrets would doubtless use them against us i say that they must be killed instantly and he drew a sword and waved it  quick walked up to the fellow and clapped a pistol to his head  drop that sword he said or youll never hear the end of the story and he obeyed whereupon quick came back  now maqueda began to speak quietly enough although i could see that she was quaking with passion  these men are our guests she said come hither to serve us do you desire to murder our guests moreover of what use would that be one thing alone can save us the destruction of the god of the fung since according to the ancient saying of that people when the idol is destroyed the fung will leave their city of harmac moreover as to this new prophecy of the priests of the idol that before the gathering in of the harvest his head shall sleep above the plain of mur how can that happen if it is destroyed unless indeed it means that harmac shall sleep in the heavens therefore what have you to fear from threats built upon that which cannot happen  but can you destroy this false god harmac or dare you fight the fung you know that it is not so for had it been so what need was there for me to send for these westerns and if you murder them will barung thereby be appeased nay i tell you that being a brave and honourable man although our enemy he will become ten times more wroth with you than he was before and exact a vengeance even more terrible i tell you also that then you must find another walda nagasta to rule over you since i maqueda will do so no more  that is impossible said some one you are the last woman of the true blood  then you can choose one of blood that is not true or elect a king as the jews elected saul for if my guests are butchered i shall die of very shame  these words of hers seemed to cow the council one of whom asked what would she have them do  do she replied throwing back her veil why be men raise an army of every male who can carry a sword help the foreigners and they will lead you to victory people of the abati would you be slaughtered would you see your women slaves and your ancient name blotted out from the list of peoples  now some of them cried no  then save yourselves you are still many the strangers here have skill in war they can lead if you will follow be brave a while and i swear to you that by harvest the abati shall sit in the city of harmac and not the fung in mur i have spoken now do what you will and rising from her chair of state maqueda left the chamber motioning to us to do likewise    the end of all this business was that a peace was made between us and the council of the abati after their pompous pedantic fashion they swore solemnly on the roll of the law that they would aid us in every way to overcome the fung and even obey such military orders as we might give them subject to the confirmation of these orders by a small council of their generals in short being very frightened for a time they forgot their hatred of us foreigners  so a scheme of operations was agreed upon and some law passed by the council the only governing body among the abati for they possessed no representative institutions under which law a kind of conscription was established for a while let me say at once that it met with the most intense opposition the abati were agriculturalists who loathed military service from their childhood they had heard of the imminence of invasion but no actual invasion had ever yet taken place the fung were always without and they were always within an inland isle the wall of rock that they thought impassable being their sea which protected them from danger  they had no experience of slaughter and rapine their imaginations were not sufficiently strong to enable them to understand what these things meant they were lost in the pettiness of daily life and its pressing local interests their homes in flames they themselves massacred their women and children dragged off to be the slaves of the victors a poor remnant left to die of starvation among the wasted fields or to become wild men of the rocks all these things they looked upon as a mere tale a romance such as their local poets repeated in the evenings of a wet season dim and faroff events which might have happened to the canaanites and jebusites and amalekites in the ancient days whereof the book of their law told them but which could never happen to them the comfortable abati in that book the israelites always conquered in the end although the philistines alias fung sat at their gates for it will be remembered that it includes no account of the final fall of jerusalem and awful destruction of its citizens of which they had little if any knowledge  so it came about that our recruiting parties perhaps press gangs would be a better term were not well received i know it for this branch of the business was handed over to me of course as adviser to the abati captains and on several occasions when riding round the villages on the shores of their beautiful lake we were met by showers of stones and were even the object of active attacks which had to be put down with bloodshed still an army of five or six thousand men was got together somehow and formed into camps whence desertions were incessant once or twice accompanied by the murder of officers  its opeless downright opeless doctor said quick to me dropping his hs as he sometimes did in the excitement of the moment what can one do with a crowd of pigs everyone of them bent on bolting to his own sty or anywhere except toward the enemy the sooner the fung get them the better for all concerned say i and if it wasnt for our lady yonder quick always called maqueda after our lady after it had been impressed upon him that her majesty was an incorrect title my advice to the captain and you gentlemen would be get out of this infernal hole as quick as your legs can carry you and lets do a bit of hunting on the way home leaving the abati to settle their own affairs  you forget sergeant that i have a reason for staying in this part of the world and so perhaps have the others for instance the professor is very fond of those old skeletons down in the cave and i paused  yes doctor and the captain is very fond of something much better than a skeleton and so are we all well weve got to see it through but somehow i dont think that every one of us will have that luck though its true that when a man has lived fairly straight according to his lights a few years more or less dont matter much one way or the other after all except you gentlemen who is there that will miss samuel quick  then without waiting for an answer drawing himself up straight as a ramrod he marched off to assist some popinjays of abati officers whom he hated and who hated him to instil the elements of drill into a newly raised company leaving me to wonder what fears or premonitions filled his honest soul  but this was not quicks principal work since for at least six hours of every day he was engaged in helping oliver in our great enterprise of driving a tunnel from the end of the tomb of kings deep into the solid rock that formed the base of the mighty idol of the fung the task was stupendous and would indeed have been impossible had not ormes conjecture that some passage had once run from the extremity of the cave toward the idol proved to be perfectly accurate such a passage indeed was found walled up at the back of the chair containing the bones of the hunchbacked king it descended very sharply for a distance of several hundred yards after which for another hundred yards or more its walls and roof were so riven and shaky that for fear of accidents we found it necessary to timber them as we went  at last we came to a place where they had fallen in altogether shaken down i presume by the great earthquake which had destroyed so much of the ancient cavecity at this spot if olivers instruments and calculations could be trusted we were within about two hundred feet of the floor of the den of lions to which it seemed probable that the passage once led and of course the question arose as to what should be done  a council was held to discuss this problem at which maqueda and a few of the abati notables were present to these oliver explained that even if that were possible it would be useless to clear out the old passage and at the end find ourselves once more in the den of lions  what then is your plan asked maqueda  lady he answered i your servant am instructed to attempt to destroy the idol harmac by means of the explosives which we have brought with us from england first i would ask you if you still cling to that design  why should it be abandoned inquired maqueda what have you against it  two things lady as an act of war the deed seems useless since supposing that the sphinx is shattered and a certain number of priests and guards are destroyed how will that advance your cause secondly such destruction will be very difficult if it can be done at all the stuff we have with us it is true is of fearful strength yet who can be sure that there is enough of it to move this mountain of hard rock of which i cannot calculate the weight not having the measurements or any knowledge of the size of the cavities within its bulk lastly if the attempt is to be made a tunnel must be hollowed of not less than three hundred feet in length first downward and then upward into the very base of the idol and if this is to be done within six weeks that is by the night of the marriage of the daughter of barung the work will be very hard if indeed it can be completed at all although hundreds of men labour day and night  now maqueda thought a while then looked up and said  friend you are brave and skilful tell us all your mind if you sat in my place what would you do  lady i would lead out every ablebodied man and attack the city of the fung say on the night of the great festival when they are off their guard i would blow in the gates of the city of harmac and storm it and drive away the fung and afterwards take possession of the idol and if it is thought necessary destroy it piecemeal from within  now maqueda consulted with her councillors who appeared to be much disturbed at this suggestion and finally called us back and gave us her decision  these lords of the council she said speaking with a ring of contempt in her voice declare that your plan is mad and that they will never sanction it because the abati could not be persuaded to undertake so dangerous an enterprise as an attack upon the city of harmac which would end they think in all of them being killed they point out o orme that the prophecy is that the fung will leave the plain of harmac when their god is destroyed and not before and that therefore it must be destroyed they say further o orme that for a year you and your companions are the sworn servants of the abati and that it is your business to receive orders not to give them also that the condition upon which you earn your pay is that you destroy the idol of the fung this is the decision of the council spoken by the mouth of the prince joshua who command further that you shall at once set about the business to execute which you and your companions are present here in mur  is that your command also o child of kings answered oliver colouring  since i also think that the abati can never be forced to attack the city of the fung it is o orme though the words in which it is couched are not my words  very well o child of kings i will do my best only blame us not if the end of this matter is other than these advisers of yours expect prophecies are twoedged swords to play with and i do not believe that a race of fighting men like the fung will fly and leave you triumphant just because a stone image is shattered if that can be done in the time and with the means which we possess meanwhile i ask that you should give me two hundred and fifty picked men of the mountaineers not of the townspeople under the captaincy of japhet who must choose them to assist us in our work  it shall be done she answered and we made our bows and went as we passed through the council we heard joshua say in a loud voice meant for us to hear  thanks be to god these hired gentiles have been taught their place at last  oliver turned on him so fiercely that he recoiled thinking that he was about to strike him  be careful prince joshua he said that before this business is finished you are not taught yours which i think may be lowly and he looked meaningly at the ground  so the labour began and it was heavy indeed as well as dangerous fortunately in addition to the picrate compounds that quick called azure stinging bees we had brought with us a few cases of dynamite of which we now made use for blasting purposes a hole was drilled in the face of the tunnel and the charge inserted then all retreated back into the tomb of kings till the cartridge had exploded and the smoke cleared off which took a long while when our people advanced with iron bars and baskets and cleared away the débris after which the process must be repeated  oh the heat of that narrow hole deep in the bowels of the rock and the reek of the stagnant air which sometimes was so bad that the lights would scarcely burn indeed after a hundred feet had been completed we thought that it would be impossible to proceed since two men died of asphyxiation and the others although they were good fellows enough refused to return into the tunnel at length however orme and japhet persuaded some of the best of them to do so and shortly after this the atmosphere improved very much i suppose because we cut some cranny or shaft which communicated with the open air  there were other dangers also notably of the collapse of the whole roof where the rock was rotten as we found it to be in places then it proved very hard to deal with the water for once or twice we struck small springs impregnated with copper or some other mineral that blistered the feet and skin since every drop of this acid water had to be carried out in wooden pails that difficulty we overcame at last by sinking a narrow well down to the level of the ancient tunnel of which i have spoken as having been shaken in by the earthquake  thus we or rather oliver and quick with the mountaineers toiled on higgs did his best but after a while proved quite unable to bear the heat which became too much for so stout a man the end of it was that he devoted himself to the superintendence of the removal of the rubbish into the tomb of kings the care of the stores and so forth at least that was supposed to be his business but really he employed most of his time in drawing and cataloguing the objects of antiquity and the groups of bones that were buried there and in exploring the remains of the underground city in truth this task of destruction was most repellent to the poor professor  to think he said to us to think that i who all my life have preached the iniquity of not conserving every relic of the past should now be employed in attempting to obliterate the most wonderful object ever fashioned by the ancients it is enough to make a vandal weep and i pray heaven that you may not succeed in your infamous design what does it matter if the abati are wiped out as lots of better people have been before them what does it matter if we accompany them to oblivion so long as that noble sphinx is preserved to be the wonder of future generations well thank goodness at any rate i have seen it which is more probably than any of you will ever do there another brute is dumping his rubbish over the skull of no 14  thus we laboured continually each at his different task for the work in the mine never stopped oliver being in charge during the day and quick at night for a whole week since on each sunday they changed with their gangs quick taking the day shift and oliver the night or vice versa sometimes maqueda came down the cave to inspect progress always i noticed at those hours when oliver happened to be off duty then on this pretext or on that they would wander away together to visit i know not what in the recesses of the underground city or elsewhere in vain did i warn them that their every step was dogged and that their every word and action were noted by spies who crept after them continually since twice i caught one of these gentry in the act they were infatuated and would not listen  at this time oliver only left the underground city twice or thrice a week to breathe the fresh air for an hour or two in truth he had no leisure for this same reason he fitted himself up a bed in what had been a priests chamber or a sanctuary in the old temple and slept there generally with no other guard but the great dog pharaoh his constant companion even in the recesses of the mine  it was curious to see how this faithful beast accustomed itself to the darkness and made its other senses especially that of smell serve the purpose of eyes as do the blind by degrees too it learned all the details of the operations thus when the cartridge was in place for firing it would rise and begin to walk out of the tunnel even before the men in charge  one night the tragedy that i feared very nearly happened and indeed must have happened had it not been for this same hound pharaoh about six oclock in the evening oliver came off duty after an eighthour shift in the tunnel leaving higgs in command for a little while until it was time for quick to take charge i had been at work outside all day in connection with the new conscript army a regiment of which was in revolt because the men most of whom were what we should call smallholders declared that they wanted to go home to weed their crops indeed it had proved necessary for the child of kings herself to be summoned to plead with them and condemn some of the ringleaders to punishment  when at length this business was over we left together and the poor lady exasperated almost to madness sharply refusing the escort of any of her people requested me to accompany her to the mine  at the mouth of the tunnel she met oliver as probably she had arranged to do and after he had reported progress to her wandered away with him as usual each of them carrying a lamp into some recess of the buried city i followed them at a distance not from curiosity or because i wished to see more of the wonders of that city whereof i was heartily sick but because i suspected that they were being spied upon  the pair vanished round a corner that i knew ended in a culdesac so extinguishing my lamp i sat down on a fallen column and waited till i should see their light reappear when i proposed to effect my retreat whilst i sat thus thinking on many things and to tell the truth very depressed in mind i heard a sound as of some one moving and instantly struck a match the light of it fell full upon the face of a man whom i recognized at once as a bodyservant of the prince joshua though whether he was passing me toward the pair or returning from their direction i could not be sure  what are you doing here i asked  what is that to you physician he answered  then the match burnt out and before i could light another he had vanished like a snake into a stone wall  my first impulse was to warn maqueda and oliver that they were being watched but reflecting that the business was awkward and that the spy would doubtless have given over his task for this day i left it alone and went down to the tomb of the kings to help higgs just afterwards quick came on duty long before his time the fact being that he had no confidence in the professor as a director of mining operations when he appeared higgs and i retreated from that close and filthy tunnel and by way of recreation put in an hour or so at the cataloguing and archæological research in which his soul delighted  if only we could get all this lot out of mur he said with a sweep of his hand we should be the most famous men in europe for at least three days and rich into the bargain  ptolemy i answered we shall be fortunate if we get ourselves alive out of mur let alone these bones and ancient treasures and i told him what i had seen that evening  his fat and kindly face grew anxious  ah he said well i dont blame him should probably do the same myself if i got the chance and so would youif you were twenty years younger no i dont blame him or her either for the fact is that although their race education and circumstances are so different they are one of natures pairs and while they are alive nothing will keep them apart you might as well expect a magnet and a bit of iron to remain separate on a sheet of notepaper moreover they give themselves away as people in that state always do the pursuit of archæology has its dangers but it is a jolly sight safer than that of woman though it did land me in a den of lions whats going to happen old fellow  cant say but i think it very probable that oliver will be murdered and that we shall follow the same road or if we are lucky be only bundled out of mur well its time for dinner if i get a chance i will give them a hint  so we made our way to the old temple in the great cave where we kept our stores and oliver had his headquarters here we found him waiting for us and our meal ready for food was always brought to us by the palace servants when we had eaten and these men had cleared away we lit our pipes and fed the dog pharaoh upon the scraps that had been reserved for him then i told oliver about the spy whom i had caught tracking him and maqueda  well what of it he said colouring in his telltale fashion she only took me to see what she believed to be an ancient inscription on a column in that northern aisle  then shed have done better to take me my boy said higgs what was the character like  dont know he answered guiltily she could not find it again  an awkward silence followed which i broke  oliver i said i dont think you ought to go on sleeping here alone you have too many enemies in this place  rubbish he answered though its true pharaoh seemed uneasy last night and that once i woke up and thought i heard footsteps in the court outside i set them down to ghosts in which i have almost come to believe in this haunted place and went to sleep again  ghosts be blowed said higgs vulgarly if there were such things i have slept with too many mummies not to see them that confounded joshua is the wizard who raises your ghosts look here old boy he added let me camp with you tonight since quick must be in the tunnel and adams has to sleep outside in case he is wanted on the army business  not a bit of it he answered you know you are too asthmatical to get a wink in this atmosphere i wont hear of such a thing  then come and sleep with us in the guesthouse  cant be done the sergeant has got a very nasty job down there about one oclock and i promised to be handy in case he calls me up and he pointed to the portable field telephone that fortunately we had brought with us from england which was fixed closed by adding if only that silly thing had another few hundred yards of wire id come but you see it hasnt and i must be in touch with the work  at this moment the bell tinkled and orme made a jump for the receiver through which for the next five minutes he was engaged in giving rapid and to us quite unintelligible directions  there you are he said when he had replaced the mouthpiece on its hook if i hadnt been here they would probably have had the roof of the tunnel down and killed some people no no i cant leave that receiver unless i go back to the mine which i am too tired to do however dont you fret with a pistol a telephone and pharaoh im safe enough and now good night you fellows had better be getting home as i must be up early tomorrow and want to sleep while i can    on the following morning about five oclock higgs and i were awakened by some one knocking at our door i rose and opened it whereon in walked quick a grim and grimy figure for as his soaked clothes and soiled face told us he had but just left his work in the mine  captain wants to see you as soon as possible gentlemen he said  whats the matter sergeant asked higgs as we got into our garments  youll see for yourself presently professor was the laconic reply nor could we get anything more out of him  five minutes later we were advancing at a run through the dense darkness of the underground city each of us carrying a lamp i reached the ruins of the old temple first for quick seemed very tired and lagged behind and in that atmosphere higgs was scant of breath and could not travel fast at the doorway of the place where he slept stood the tall form of oliver holding a lamp aloft evidently he was waiting for us by his side sat the big yellow dog pharaoh that when he smelt us gambolled forward wagging his tail in greeting  come here said orme in a low and solemn voice i have something to show you and he led the way into the priests chamber or sanctuary whatever it may have been where he slept upon a rough nativemade bedstead at the doorway he halted lowered the lamp he held and pointed to something dark on the floor to the right of his bedstead saying look  there lay a dead man and by his side a great knife that evidently had fallen from his hand at the first glance we recognised the face which by the way was singularly peaceful as though it were that of one plunged in deep sleep this seemed odd since the throat below was literally torn out  shadrach we said with one voice  shadrach it was shadrach our former guide who had betrayed us shadrach who to save his own life had shown us how to rescue higgs and for that service been pardoned as i think i mentioned shadrach and no other  pussy seems to have been on the prowl and to have met a dog remarked quick  do you understand what has happened asked oliver in a dry hard voice perhaps i had better explain before anything is moved shadrach must have crept in here last nighti dont know at what time for i slept through it allfor purposes of his own but he forgot his old enemy pharaoh and pharaoh killed him see his throat when pharaoh bites he doesnt growl and of course shadrach could say nothing or as he had dropped his knife for the matter of that do anything either when i was woke up about an hour ago by the telephone bell the dog was fast asleep for he is accustomed to that bell with his head resting upon the body of shadrach now why did shadrach come into my room at night with a drawn knife in his hand  doesnt seem a difficult question to answer replied higgs in the high voice which was common to him when excited he came here to murder you and pharaoh was too quick for him thats all that dog was the cheapest purchase you ever made friend oliver  yes answered orme he came here to murder meyou were right about the risk after allbut what i wonder is who sent him  and so you may go on wondering for the rest of your life captain exclaimed quick still i think we might guess if we tried  then news of what had happened was sent to the palace and within little over an hour maqueda arrived accompanied by joshua and several other members of her council when she saw and understood everything she was horrified and sternly asked joshua what he knew of this business of course he proved to be completely innocent and had not the slightest idea of who had set the murderer on to work this deed of darkness nor had anybody else the general suggestion being that shadrach had attempted it out of revenge and met with the due reward of his crime  only that day poor pharaoh was poisoned well he had done his work and his memory is blessed    chapter xv  sergeant quick has a presentiment  from this time forward all of us and especially oliver were guarded night and day by picked men who it was believed could not be corrupted as a consequence the tsar of russia scarcely leads a life more irksome than ours became at mur of privacy there was none left to us since sentries and detectives lurked at every corner while tasters were obliged to eat of each dish and drink from each cup before it touched our lips lest our fate should be that of pharaoh whose loss we mourned as much as though the poor dog had been some beloved human being  most of all was it irksome i think to oliver and maqueda whose opportunities of meeting were much curtailed by the exigencies of this rigid espionage who can murmur sweet nothings to his adored when two soldiers armed to the teeth have been instructed never to let him out of their sight particularly is this so if the adored happens to be the ruler of those soldiers to whom the person guarded has no right to be making himself agreeable for when off duty even the most faithful guardians are apt to talk of course the result was that the pair took risks which did not escape observation indeed their intimate relations became a matter of gossip throughout the land  still annoying as they might be these precautions succeeded for none of us were poisoned or got our throats cut although we were constantly the victims of mysterious accidents thus a heavy rock rolled down upon us when we sat together one evening upon the hillside and a flight of arrows passed between us while we were riding along the edge of a thicket by one of which higgss horse was killed only when the mountain and the thicket were searched no one could be found moreover a great plot against us was discovered in which some of the lords and priests were implicated but such was the state of feeling in the country that beyond warning them privately that their machinations were known maqueda did not dare to take proceedings against these men  a little later on things mended so far as we were concerned for the following reason one day two shepherds arrived at the palace with some of their companions saying that they had news to communicate on being questioned these peasants averred that while they were herding their goats upon the western cliffs many miles away suddenly on the top of the hills appeared a body of fifteen fung who bound and blindfolded them telling them in mocking language to take a message to the council and to the white men  this was the message that they had better make haste to destroy the god harmac since otherwise his head would move to mur according to the prophecy and that when it did so the fung would follow as they knew how to do then they set the two men on a rock where they could be seen and on the following morning were in fact found by some of their fellows those who accompanied them to the court and corroborated this story  of course the matter was duly investigated but as i know for i went with the search party when we got to the place no trace of the fung could be found except one of their spears of which the handle had been driven into the earth and the blade pointed toward mur evidently in threat or defiance no other token of them remained for as it happened a heavy rain had fallen and obliterated their footprints which in any case must have been faint on this rocky ground  notwithstanding the most diligent search by skilled men their mode of approach and retreat remained a mystery as indeed it does to this day the only places where it was supposed to be possible to scale the precipice of mur were watched continually so that they could have climbed up by none of these the inference was therefore that the fung had discovered some unknown path and if fifteen men could climb that path why not fifteen thousand  only where was this path in vain were great rewards in land and honours offered to him who should discover it for although such discoveries were continually reported on investigation these were found to be inventions or mares nests nothing but a bird could have travelled by such roads  then at last we saw the abati thoroughly frightened for with additions the story soon passed from mouth to mouth till the whole people talked of nothing else it was as though we english learned that a huge foreign army had suddenly landed on our shores and having cut the wires and seized the railways was marching upon london the effect of such tidings upon a nation that always believed invasion to be impossible may easily be imagined only i hope that we should take them better than did the abati  their swagger their selfconfidence their talk about the rocky walls of mur evaporated in an hour now it was only of the disciplined and terrible regiments of the fung among whom every man was trained to war and of what would happen to them the civilized and domesticated abati a peaceloving people who rightly enough as they declared had refused all martial burdens should these regiments suddenly appear in their midst they cried out that they were betrayedthey clamoured for the blood of certain of the councillors that carpet knight joshua lost popularity for a while while maqueda who was known always to have been in favour of conscription and perfect readiness to repel attack gained what he had lost  leaving their farms they crowded together into the towns and villages where they made what in south africa are called laagers religion which practically had been dead among them for they retained but few traces of the jewish faith if indeed they had ever really practised it became the craze of the hour priests were at a premium sheep and cattle were sacrificed it was even said that after the fashion of their foes the fung some human beings shared the same fate at any rate the almighty was importuned hourly to destroy the hated fung and to protect his peoplethe abatifrom the results of their own base selfishness and cowardly neglect  well the world has seen such exhibitions before today and will doubtless see more of them in the instance of greater peoples who allow luxury and pleasureseeking to sap their strength and manhood  the upshot of it all was that the abati became obsessed with the saying of the fung scouts to the shepherds which after all was but a repetition of that of their envoys delivered to the council a little while before that they should hasten to destroy the idol harmac lest he should move himself to mur how an idol of such proportions or even its head could move at all they did not stop to inquire it was obvious to them however that if he was destroyed there would be nothing to move and further that we gentiles were the only persons who could possibly effect such destruction so we also became popular for a little while everybody was pleasant and flattered useverybody even joshua bowed when we approached and took a most lively interest in the progress of our work which many deputations and prominent individuals urged us to expedite  better still the untoward accidents such as those i have mentioned ceased our dogs for we had obtained some others were no longer poisoned rocks that appeared fixed did not fall no arrows whistled among us when we went out riding we even found it safe occasionally to dispense with our guards since it was every ones interest to keep us alivefor the present still i for one was not deceived for a single moment and in season and out of season warned the others that the wind would soon blow again from a less favourable quarter  we worked we worked we worked heaven alone knows how we did work think of the task which after all was only one of several a tunnel must be bored for i forget how far through virgin rock with the help of inadequate tools and unskilled labour and this tunnel must be finished by a certain date a hundred unexpected difficulties arose and one by one were conquered great dangers must be run and were avoided while the responsibility of this tremendous engineering feat lay upon the shoulders of a single individual oliver orme who although he had been educated as an engineer had no great practical experience of such enterprises  truly the occasion makes the man for orme rose to it in a way that i can only call heroic when he was not actually in the tunnel he was labouring at his calculations of which many must be made or taking levels with such instruments as he had for if there proved to be the slightest error all this toil would be in vain and result only in the blowing of a useless hole through a mass of rock then there was a great question as to the effect which would be produced by the amount of explosive at his disposal since terrible as might be the force of the stuff unless it were scientifically placed and distributed it would assuredly fail to accomplish the desired end  at last after superhuman efforts the mine was finished our stock of concentrated explosive about four full camel loads of it was set in as many separate chambers each of them just large enough to receive the charge hollowed in the primæval rock from which the idol had been hewn  these chambers were about twenty feet from each other although if there had been time to prolong the tunnel the distance should have been at least forty in order to give the stuff a wider range of action according to olivers mathematical reckoning they were cut in the exact centre of the base of the idol and about thirty feet below the actual body of the crouching sphinx as a matter of fact this reckoning was wrong in several particulars the charges having been set farther toward the east or head of the sphinx and higher up in the base than he supposed when it is remembered that he had found no opportunity of measuring the monument which practically we had only seen once from behind under conditions not favourable to accuracy in such respects or of knowing its actual length and depth these trifling errors were not remarkable  what was remarkable is that his general plan of operations founded upon a mere hypothetical estimate should have proved as accurate as it did  at length all was prepared and the deadly castiron flasks had been packed in sand together with dynamite cartridges the necessary detonators electric wires and so forth an anxious and indeed awful task executed entirely in that stifling atmosphere by the hands of orme and quick then began another labour that of the filling in of the tunnels this it seems was necessary or so i understood lest the expanding gases following the line of least resistance should blow back as it were through the venthole what made that task the more difficult was the need of cutting a little channel in the rock to contain the wires and thereby lessen the risk of the fracture of these wires in the course of the buildingup process of course if by any accident this should happen the circuit would be severed and no explosion would follow when the electric battery was set to work  the arrangement was that the mine should be fired on the night of that full moon on which we had been told and spies confirmed the information the feast of the marriage of barungs daughter to my son would be celebrated in the city of harmac this date was fixed because the sultan had announced that so soon as that festivity which coincided with the conclusion of the harvest was ended he meant to deliver his attack on mur  also we were anxious that it should be adhered to for another reason since we knew that on this day but a small number of priests and guards would be left in charge of the idol and my son could not be among them now whatever may have been the views of the abati we as christians who bore them no malice did not at all desire to destroy an enormous number of innocent fung as might have happened if we had fired our mine when the people were gathered to sacrifice to their god   the fatal day arrived at last all was completed save for the blocking of the passage which still went on or rather was being reinforced by the piling up of loose rocks against its mouth at which a hundred or so men laboured incessantly the firing wires had been led into that little chamber in the old temple where the dog pharaoh tore out the throat of shadrach and no inch of them was left unguarded for fear of accident or treachery  the electric batteriestwo of them in case one should failhad been tested but not connected with the wires there they stood upon the floor looking innocent enough and we four sat round them like wizards round their magic pot who await the working of some spell we were not cheerful who could be under so intense a strain orme indeed who had grown pale and thin with continuous labour of mind and body seemed quite worn out he could not eat nor smoke and with difficulty i persuaded him to drink some of the native wine he would not even go to look at the completion of the work or to test the wires  you can see to it he said i have done all i can now things must take their chance  after our midday meal he lay down and slept quite soundly for several hours about four oclock those who were labouring at the piling up of débris over the mouth of the tunnel completed their task and in charge of quick were marched out of the underground city  then higgs and i took lamps and went along the length of the wires which lay in a little trench covered over with dust removing the dust and inspecting them at intervals discovering nothing amiss we returned to the old temple and at its doorway met the mountaineer japhet who throughout all these proceedings had been our prop and stay indeed without his help and that of his authority over the abati the mine could never have been completed at any rate within the time  the light of the lamp showed that his face was very anxious  what is the matter i asked  o physician he answered i have words for the ear of the captain orme be pleased to lead me to him  we explained that he slept and could not be disturbed but japhet only answered as before adding  come you with me my words are for your ears as well as his  so we went into the little room and awoke oliver who sprang up in a great fright thinking that something untoward had happened at the mine  whats wrong he asked of japhet have the fung cut the wires  nay o orme a worse thing i have discovered that the prince joshua has laid a plot to steal away herwhosenameishigh  what do you mean set out all the story japhet said oliver  it is short lord i have some friends one of whomhe is of my own blood but ask me not his nameis in the service of the prince we drank a cup of wine together which i needed and i suppose it loosed his tongue at any rate he told me and i believed him this is the story for his own sake and that of the people the prince desires that you should destroy the idol of fung and therefore he has kept his hands off you of late yet should you succeed he does not know what may happen he fears lest the abati in their gratitude should set you up as great men  then he is an ass interrupted quick for the abati have no gratitude  he fears went on japhet other things also for instance that the child of kings may express that gratitude by a mark of her signal favour toward one of you and he stared at orme who turned his head aside now the prince is affianced to this great lady whom he desires to wed for two reasons first because this marriage will make him the chief man amongst the abati and secondly because of late he has come to think that he loves her whom he is afraid that he may lose so he has set a snare  what snare asked one of us for japhet paused  i dont know answered japhet and i do not think that my friend knew either or if he did he would not tell me but i understand the plot is that the child of kings is to be carried off to the prince joshuas castle at the other end of the lake six hours ride away and there be forced to marry him at once  indeed said orme and when is all this to happen  i dont know lord i know nothing except what my friend told me which i thought it right to communicate to you instantly i asked him the time however and he said that he believed the date was fixed for one night after next sabbath  next sabbath is five days hence so that this matter does not seem to be very pressing remarked oliver with a sigh of relief are you sure that you can trust your friend japhet  no lord i am not sure especially as i have always known him to be a liar still i thought that i ought to tell you  very kind of you japhet but i wish that you had let me have my sleep out first now go down the line and see that all is right then return and report  japhet saluted in his native fashion and went  what do you think of this story asked oliver as soon as he was out of hearing  all bosh answered higgs the place is full of talk and rumours and this is one of them  he paused and looked at me  oh i said i agree with higgs if japhets friend had really anything to tell he would have told it in more detail i daresay there are a good many things joshua would like to do but i expect he will stop there at any rate for the present if you take my advice you will say nothing of the matter especially to maqueda  then we are all agreed but what are you thinking of sergeant asked oliver addressing quick who stood in a corner of the room lost apparently in contemplation of the floor  i captain he replied coming to attention well begging their pardon i was thinking that i dont hold with these gentlemen except in so far that i should say nothing of this job to our lady who has plenty to bother her just now and wont need to be frightened as well still there may be something in it for though that japhet is stupid hes honest and honest men sometimes get hold of the right end of the stick at least he believes there is something and thats what weighs with me  well if thats your opinion whats best to be done sergeant i agree that the child of kings should not be told and i shant leave this place till after ten oclock tonight at the earliest if we stick to our plans as we had better do for all that stuff in the tunnel wants a little time to settle and for other reasons what are you drawing there and he pointed to the floor in the dust of which quick was tracing something with his finger  a plan of our ladys private rooms captain she told you she was going to rest at sundown didnt she or earlier for she was up most of last night and wanted to get a few hours sleep beforesomething happens well her bedchamber is there isnt it and another before it in which her maids sleep and nothing behind except a high wall and a ditch which cannot be climbed  thats quite true interrupted higgs i got leave to make a plan of the palace only there is a passage six feet wide and twenty long leading from the guard chamber to the ladies anteroom  just so professor and that passage has a turn in it if i remember right so that two wellarmed men could hold it against quite a lot supposing now that you and i professor should go and take a nap in that guardroom which will be empty for the watch is set at the palace gate we shant be wanted here since if the captain cant touch off that mine no one can with the doctor to help him just in case anything goes wrong and japhet guarding the line i daresay theres nothing in this yarn but who knows there might be and then we should blame ourselves what do you say professor  i oh ill do anything you wish though i should rather have liked to climb the cliff and watch what happens  youd see nothing higgs interrupted oliver except perhaps the reflection of a flash in the sky so if you dont mind i wish you would go with the sergeant somehow although i am quite certain that we ought not to alarm maqueda i am not easy about her and if you two fellows were there i should know she was all right and it would be a weight off my mind  that settles it said higgs well be off presently look here give us that portable telephone which is of no use anywhere else now the wire will reach to the palace and if the machine works all right we can talk to you and tell each other how things are going on  ten minutes later they had made their preparations quick stepped up to oliver and stood at attention saying  ready to march any more orders captain  i think not sergeant he answered lifting his eyes from the little batteries that he was watching as though they were live things you know the arrangements at ten oclockthat is about two hours hencei touch this switch whatever happens it must not be done before for fear lest the doctors son should not have left the idol to say nothing of all the other poor beggars the spies say that the marriage feast will not be celebrated until at least three hours after moonrise  and thats what i heard when i was a prisoner interrupted higgs  i daresay answered orme but it is always well to allow a margin in case the procession should be delayed or something so until ten oclock ive got to stop where i am and you may be sure doctor that under no circumstances shall i fire the mine before that hour as indeed you will be here to see after that i cant say what will happen but if we dont appear you two had better come to look for usin case of accidents you know do your best at your end according to circumstances the doctor and i will do our best at ours i think that is all sergeant report yourselves by the telephone if the wire is long enough and it will work which i daresay it wont and anyway look out for us about halfpast ten goodbye  goodbye captain answered quick then stretched out his hand shook that of orme and without another word took his lamp and left the chamber  an impulse prompted me to follow him leaving orme and higgs discussing something before they parted when he had walked about fifty yards in the awful silence of that vast underground town of which the ruined tenements yawned on either side of us the sergeant stopped and said suddenly  you dont believe in presentiments do you doctor  not a bit i answered  glad of it doctor still i have got a bad one now and it is that i shant see the captain or you any more  then thats a poor lookout for us quick  no doctor for me i think you are both all right and the professor too its my name they are calling up aloft or so it seems to me well i dont care much for though no saint i have tried to do my duty and if it is done its done if its written its got to come to pass hasnt it for everything is written down for us long before we begin or so ive always thought still ill grieve to part from the captain seeing that i nursed him as a child and id have liked to know him well out of this hole and safely married to that sweet lady first though i dont doubt that it will be so  nonsense sergeant i said sharply you are not yourself all this work and anxiety has got on your nerves  as it well might doctor not but i daresay thats true anyhow if the other is the true thing and you should all see old england again with some of the stuff in that deadhouse ive got three nieces living down at home whom you might remember dont say nothing of what i told you to the captain till this nights game is played seeing that it might upset him and hell need to keep cool up to ten oclock and afterwards too perhaps only if we shouldnt meet again say that samuel quick sent him his duty and gods blessing and the same on yourself doctor and your son too and now here comes the professor so goodbye    a minute later they had left me and i stood watching them until the two stars of light from their lanterns vanished into the blackness    chapter xvi  harmac comes to mur  slowly and in very bad spirits i retraced my steps to the old temple following the line of the telephone wire which higgs and quick had unreeled as they went in the sergeants prognostications of evil i had no particular belief as they seemed to me to be born of the circumstances which surrounded us and in different ways affected all our minds even that of the buoyant higgs  to take my own case for instance here i was about to assist in an act which for aught i knew might involve the destruction of my only son it was true we believed that this was the night of his marriage at the town of harmac some miles away and that the tale of our spies supported this information but how could we be sure that the date or the place of the ceremony had not been changed at the last moment supposing for instance that it was held not in the town as arranged but in the courts of the idol and that the fearful activities of the fiery agent which we were about to wake to life should sweep the celebrants into nothingness  the thought made me turn cold and yet the deed must be done roderick must take his chance and if all were well and he escaped that danger were there not worse behind think of him a christian man the husband of a savage woman who worshipped a stone image with a lions head bound to her and her tribe a state prisoner trebly guarded whom so far as i could see there would be no hope of rescuing it was awful then there were other complications if the plan succeeded and the idol was destroyed my own belief was that the fung must thereby be exasperated evidently they knew some road into this stronghold it would be used they would pour their thousands up it a general massacre would follow of which justly we should be the first victims  i reached the chamber where oliver sat brooding alone for japhet was patrolling the line  i am not happy about maqueda doctor he said to me i am afraid there is something in that story she wanted to be with us indeed she begged to be allowed to come almost with tears but i wouldnt have it since accidents may always happen the vibration might shake in the roof or something in fact i dont think you should be here why dont you go away and leave me  i answered that nothing would induce me to do so for such a job should not be left to one man  no youre right he said i might faint or lose my head or anything i wish now that we had arranged to send the spark from the palace which perhaps we might have done by joining the telephone wire on to the others but to tell you the truth im afraid of the batteries the cells are new but very weak for time and the climate have affected them and i thought it possible the extra difference might make the difference and that they would fail to work thats why i fixed this as the firing point hullo theres the bell what have they got to say  i snatched the receiver and presently heard the cheerful voice of higgs announcing that they had arrived safely in the little anteroom to maquedas private apartments  the palace seems very empty he added we only met one sentry for i think that everybody else except maqueda and a few of her ladies have cleared out being afraid lest rocks should fall on them when the explosion occurs  did the man say so i asked of higgs  yes something of that sort also he wanted to forbid us to come here saying that it was against the prince joshuas orders that we gentiles should approach the private apartments of the child of kings well we soon settled that and he bolted where to oh i dont know to report he said  hows quick i asked  much the same as usual in fact he is saying his prayers in the corner looking like a melancholy brigand with rifles revolvers and knives stuck all over him i wish he wouldnt say his prayers added higgs and his voice reached me in an indignant squeak it makes me feel uncomfortable as though i ought to join him but not having been brought up a dissenter or a moslem i cant pray in public as he does hullo wait a minute will you  then followed a longish pause and after it higgss voice again  its all right it said only one of maquedas ladies who had heard us and come to see who we were when she learns i expect she will join us here as the girl says shes nervous and cant sleep  higgs proved right in his anticipations for in about ten minutes we were rung up again this time by maqueda herself whereon i handed the receiver to oliver and retired to the other end of the room  nor to tell the truth was i sorry for the interruption since it cheered up oliver and helped to pass the time  the next thing worth telling that happened was that an hour or more later japhet arrived looking very frightened we asked him our usual question if anything was wrong with the wires with a groan he answered no the wires seemed all right but he had met a ghost  what ghost you donkey i said  the ghost of one of the dead kings o physician yonder in the burial cave it was he with the bent bones who sits in the farthest chair only he had put some flesh on his bones and i tell you he looked fearful a very fierce man or rather ghost  indeed and did he say anything to you japhet  oh yes plenty o physician only i could not understand it all because his language was somewhat different to mine and he spat out his words as a green log spits out sparks i think that he asked me however how my miserable people dared to destroy his god harmac i answered that i was only a servant and did not know adding that he should put his questions to you  and what did he say to that japhet  i think he said that harmac would come to mur and settle his account with the abati and that the foreign men would be wise to fly fast and far thats all i understood ask me no more who would not return into that cave to be made a prince  hes got hold of what barungs envoys told us said oliver indifferently and no wonder this place is enough to make anybody see ghosts ill repeat it to maqueda it will amuse her  i wouldnt if i were you i answered for it isnt exactly a cheerful yarn and perhaps shes afraid of ghosts too also and i pointed to the watch that lay on the table beside the batteries it is five minutes to ten  oh that last five minutes it seemed as many centuries like stone statues we sat each of us lost in his own thoughts though for my part the power of clear thinking appeared to have left me visions of a sort flowed over my mind without sinking into it as water flows over marble all i could do was fix my eyes on the face of that watch of which in the flickering lamplight the secondhand seemed to my excited fancy to grow enormous and jump from one side of the room to the other  orme began to count aloud one two three four fivenow and almost simultaneously he touched the knob first of one battery and next of the other before his finger pressed the lefthand knob i felt the solid rock beneath us surgeno other word conveys its movement then the great stone crosspiece weighing several tons that was set as a transom above the tall door of our room dislodged itself and fell quite gently into the doorway which it completely blocked  other rocks fell also at a distance making a great noise and somehow i found myself on the ground my stool had slid away from me next followed a muffled awful roar and with it came a blast of wind blowing where wind never blew before since the beginning of the world that with a terrible wailing howled itself to silence in the thousand recesses of the cave city as it passed our lamps went out lastly quite a minute later i should think there was a thud as though something of enormous weight had fallen on the surface of the earth far above us  then all was as it had been all was darkness and utter quietude  well thats over said oliver in a strained voice which sounded very small and far away through that thick darkness all over for good or ill i neednt have been anxious the first battery was strong enough for i felt the mine spring as i touched the second i wonder he went on as though speaking to himself what amount of damage nearly a ton and a half of that awful azoimide compound has done to the old sphinx according to my calculations it ought to have been enough to break the thing up if we could have spread the charge more but as it is i am by no means certain it may only have driven a hole in its bulk especially if there were hollows through which the gases could run well with luck we may know more about it later strike a match adams and light those lamps why whats that listen  as he spoke from somewhere came a series of tiny noises that though they were so faint and small suggested rifles fired at a great distance crack crack crack went the infinitesimal noises  i groped about and finding the receiver of the field telephone set it to my ear in an instant all grew plain to me guns were being fired near the other end of the wire and the transmitter was sending us the sound of them very faintly but with distinctness i could hear higgss high voice saying look out sergeant theres another rush coming and quick answering shoot low professor for the lords sake shoot low you are empty sir load up load up heres a clip of cartridges dont fire too fast ah that devil got me but ive got him hell never throw another spear  they are being attacked i exclaimed quick is wounded now maqueda is talking to you she says oliver come joshuas men assail me oliver come  then followed a great sound of shouting answered by more shots and just as orme snatched the receiver from my hand the wire went dead in vain he called down it in an agonized voice as well might he have addressed the planet saturn  the wires cut he exclaimed dashing down the receiver and seizing the lantern which japhet had just succeeded in relighting come on theres murder being done and he sprang to the doorway only to stagger back again from the great stone with which it was blocked  good god he screamed were shut in how can we get out how can we get out and he began to run round and round the room and even to spring at the walls like a frightened cat thrice he sprang striving to climb to the coping for the place had no roof each time falling back since it was too high for him to grasp i caught him round the middle and held him by main force although he struck at me  be quiet i said do you want to kill yourself you will be no good dead or maimed let me think  meanwhile japhet was acting on his own account for he too had heard the tiny ominous sounds given out by the telephone and guessed their purport first he ran to the massive transom that blocked the doorway and pushed it was useless not even an elephant could have stirred it then he stepped back examining it carefully  i think it can be climbed physician he said help me now and he motioned to me to take one end of the heavy table on which the batteries stood we dragged it to the doorway and seeing his purpose oliver jumped on to it with him then at japhets direction while i supported the table to prevent its oversetting orme rested his forehead against the stone making what schoolboys call a back up which the mountaineer climbed actively until he stood upon his shoulders and by stretching himself was able to grasp the end of the fallen transom next while i held up the lamp to give him light he gripped the roughnesses of the hewn stone with his toes and in a few moments was upon the coping of the wall twenty feet or more above the floor line  the rest was comparatively easy for taking off his linen robe japhet knotted it once or twice and let it down to us by the help of this improvised rope with orme supporting me beneath i too was dragged up to the coping of the wall then both of us pulled up oliver who without a word swung himself over the wall hanging to japhets arms and loosing his hold dropped to the ground on the farther side next came my turn it was a long fall and had not oliver caught me i think that i should have hurt myself as it was the breath was shaken out of me lastly japhet swung himself down landing lightly as a cat the lamps he had already dropped to us and in another minute they were all lighted and we were speeding down the great cavern  be careful i cried there may be fallen rocks about  as it happened i was right for at that moment oliver struck his legs against one of them and fell cutting himself a good deal in a moment he was up again but after this our progress grew slow for hundreds of tons of stone had been shaken from the roof and blocked the path also whole buildings of the ancient and underground city had been thrown down although these were mostly blown inward by the rush of air at length we came to the end of the cave and halted dismayed for here where the blast of the explosion had been brought to a full stop the place seemed to be crowded with rocks which it had rolled before it  my god i believe we are shut in exclaimed oliver in despair  but japhet lantern in hand was already leaping from block to block and presently from the top of the débris called to us to come to him  i think there is a road left though a bad one lords he said and pointed to a jagged welllike hole blown out as i believe by the recoil of the blast with difficulty and danger for many of the piled up stones were loose we climbed down this place and at its bottom squeezed ourselves through a narrow aperture on to the floor of the cave praying that the huge door which led to the passage beyond might not be jammed since if it were as we knew well our small strength would not avail to move it happily this fear at least proved groundless since it opened outward and the force of the compressed air had torn it from its massive stone hinges and thrown it shattered to the ground  we scrambled over it and advanced down the passage our revolvers in our hands we reached the audience hall which was empty and in darkness we turned to the left crossing various chambers and in the last of them through which one of the gates of the palace could be approached met with the first signs of the tragedy for there were bloodstains on the floor  orme pointed to them as he hurried on and suddenly a man leapt out of the darkness as a buck leaps from a bush and ran past us holding his hands to his side where evidently he had some grievous hurt now we entered the corridor leading to the private apartments of the child of kings and found ourselves walking on the bodies of dead and dying men one of the former i observed as one does notice little things at such a moment held in his hand the broken wire of the field telephone i presume that he had snatched and severed it in his death pang at the moment when communication ceased between us and the palace  we rushed into the little antechamber in which lights were burning and there saw a sight that i for one never shall forget  in the foreground lay more dead men all of them wearing the livery of prince joshua beyond was sergeant quick seated on a chair he seemed to be literally hacked to pieces an arrow that no one had attempted to remove was fast in his shoulder his head which maqueda was sponging with wet clothswell i will not describe his wounds  leaning against the wall near by stood higgs also bleeding and apparently quite exhausted behind besides maqueda herself were two or three of her ladies wringing their hands and weeping in face of this terrible spectacle we came to a sudden halt no word was spoken of by any one for the power of speech had left us  the dying quick opened his eyes lifted his hand upon which there was a ghastly swordcut to his forehead as though to shade them from the lightah how well i recall that pathetic motionand from beneath this screen stared at us a while then he rose from the chair touched his throat to show that he could not speak as i suppose saluted orme turned and pointed to maqueda and with a triumphant smile sank down anddied  such was the noble end of sergeant quick  to describe what followed is not easy for the scene was confused also shock and sorrow have blurred its recollection in my mind i remember maqueda and orme falling into each others arms before everybody i remember her drawing herself up in that imperial way of hers and saying as she pointed to the body of quick  there lies one who has shown us how to die this countryman of yours was a hero o oliver and you should hold his memory in honour since he saved me from worse than death  whats the story asked orme of higgs  a simple one enough he answered we got here all right as we told you over the wire then maqueda talked to you for a long while until you rang off saying you wanted to speak to japhet after that at ten oclock precisely we heard the thud of the explosion next as we were preparing to go out to see what had happened joshua arrived alone announced that the idol harmac had been destroyed and demanded that the child of kings for state reasons should accompany him to his own castle she declined and as he insisted i took it upon myself to kick him out of the place he retired and we saw no more of him but a few minutes later there came a shower of arrows down the passage and after them a rush of men who called death to the gentiles rescue the rose  so we began to shoot and knocked over a lot of them but quick got that arrow through his shoulder three times they came on like that and three times we drove them back at last our cartridges ran low and we only had our revolvers left which we emptied into them they hung a moment but moved forward again and all seemed up  then quick went mad he snatched the sword of a dead abati and ran at them roaring like a bull they hacked and cut at him but the end of it was that he drove them right out of the passage while i followed firing past him  well those who were left of the blackguards bolted and when they had gone the sergeant tumbled down the women and i carried him back here but he never said another word and at last you turned up now hes gone god rest him for if ever there was a hero in this world he was christened samuel quick and turning aside the professor pushed up the blue spectacles he always wore on to his forehead and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand  with grief more bitter than i can describe we lifted up the body of the gallant quick and bearing it into maquedas private apartment placed it on her own bed for she insisted that the man who had died to protect her should be laid nowhere else it was strange to see the grim old soldier whose face now that i had washed his wounds looked calm and even beautiful laid out to sleep his last sleep upon the couch of the child of kings that bed i remember was a rich and splendid thing made of some black wood inlaid with scrolls of gold and having hung about it curtains of white net embroidered with golden stars such as maqueda wore upon her official veil  there upon the scented pillows and silken coverlet we set our burden down the workworn hands clasped upon the breast in an attitude of prayer and one by one bid our farewell to this faithful and upright man whose face as it chanced we were never to see again except in the glass of memory well he had died as he had lived and would have wished to diedoing his duty and in war and so we left him peace be to his honoured spirit  in the bloodstained anteroom while i dressed and stitched up the professors wounds a swordcut on the head an arrowgraze along the face and a spearprick in the thigh none of them happily at all deep or dangerous we held a brief council  friends said maqueda who was leaning on her lovers arm it is not safe that we should stop here my uncles plot has failed for the moment but it was only a small and secret thing i think that soon he will return again with a thousand at his back and then  what is in your mind asked oliver to fly from mur  how can we fly she answered when the pass is guarded by joshuas men and the fung wait for us without the abati hate you my friends and now that you have done your work i think that they will kill you if they can whom they bore with only till it was done alas alas that i should have brought you to this false and ungrateful country and she began to weep while we stared at each other helpless  then japhet who all this while had been crouched on the floor rocking himself too and fro and mourning in his eastern fashion for quick whom he had loved rose and coming to the child of kings prostrated himself before her  o walda nagasta he said hear the words of your servant only three miles away near to the mouth of the pass are encamped five hundred men of my own people the mountaineers who hate prince joshua and his following fly to them o walda nagasta for they will cleave to you and listen to me whom you have made a chief among them afterwards you can act as may seem wisest  maqueda looked at oliver questioningly  i think that is good advice he said at any rate we cant be worse off among the mountaineers than we are in this undefended place tell your women to bring cloaks that we can throw over our heads and let us go  five minutes later a forlorn group filled with fears we had stolen over the dead and dying in the passage and made our way to the side gate of the palace that we found open and over the bridge that spanned the moat beyond which was down doubtless joshuas ruffians had used it in their approach and retreat disguised in the long cloaks with monklike hoods that the abati wore at night or when the weather was cold and wet we hurried across the great square here since we could not escape them we mingled with the crowd that was gathered at its farther end all of themmen women and childrenchattering like monkeys in the treetops and pointing to the cliff at the back of the palace beneath which it will be remembered lay the underground city  a band of soldiers rode by thrusting their way through the people and in order to avoid them we thought it wise to take refuge in the shadow of a walk of greenleaved trees which grew close at hand for we feared lest they might recognize oliver by his height here we turned and looked up at the cliff to discover what it was at which every one was staring at that moment the full moon which had been obscured by a cloud broke out and we saw a spectacle that under the circumstances was nothing less than terrifying  the cliff behind the palace rose to a height of about a hundred and fifty feet and as it chanced just there a portion of it jutted out in an oblong shape which the abati called the lion rock although personally heretofore i had never been able to see in it any great resemblance to a lion now however it was different for on the very extremity of this rock staring down at mur sat the head and neck of the huge lionfaced idol of the fung indeed in that light with the promontory stretching away behind it it looked as though it were the idol itself moved from the valley upon the farther side of the precipice to the top of the cliff above  oh oh oh groaned japhet the prophecy is fulfilledthe head of harmac has come to sleep at mur  you mean that we have sent him there whispered higgs dont be frightened man cant you understand that the power of our medicine has blown the head off the sphinx high into the air and landed it where it sits now  yes i put in and what we felt in the cave was the shock of its fall  i dont care what brought him replied japhet who seemed quite unstrung by all that he had gone through all i know is that the prophecy is fulfilled and harmac has come to mur and where harmac goes the fung follow  so much the better said the irreverent higgs i may be able to sketch and measure him now  but i saw that maqueda was trembling for she too thought this occurrence a very bad omen and even oliver remained silent perhaps because he feared its effect upon the abati  nor was this wonderful since from the talk around us clearly that effect was great evidently the people were terrified like japhet we could hear them foreboding ill and cursing us gentiles as wizards who had not destroyed the idol of the fung as we promised but had only caused him to fly to mur  here i may mention that as a matter of fact they were right as we discovered afterwards the whole force of the explosion instead of shattering the vast bulk of the stone image had rushed up through the hollow chambers in its interior until it struck against the solid head lifting this as though it were a toy the expanding gas had hurled that mighty mass an unknown distance into the air to light upon the crest of the cliffs of mur where probably it will remain forever  well i said when we had stared a little while at this extraordinary phenomenon thank god it did not travel farther and fall upon the palace  oh had it done so whispered maqueda in a tearful voice i think you might have thanked god indeed for then at least i should be free from all my troubles come friends let us be going before we are discovered    chapter xvii  i find my son  our road toward the pass ran through the camping ground of the newly created abati army and what we saw on our journey thither told us more vividly than any words or reports could do how utter was the demoralization of that people where should have been sentries were no sentries where should have been soldiers were groups of officers talking with women where should have been officers were camp followers drinking  through this confusion and excitement we made our way unobserved or at any rate unquestioned till at length we came to the regiment of the mountaineers who for the most part were goatherds poor people who lived upon the slopes of the precipices that enclosed the land of mur these folk having little to do with their more prosperous brethren of the plain were hardy and primitive of nature and therefore retained some of the primeval virtues of mankind such as courage and loyalty  it was for the first of these reasons and indeed for the second also that they had been posted by joshua at the mouth of the pass which he knew well they alone could be trusted to defend in the event of serious attack moreover it was desirable from his point of view to keep them out of the way while he developed his plans against the person of the child of kings for whom these simpleminded men had a hereditary and almost a superstitious reverence  as soon as we were within the lines of these mountaineers we found the difference between them and the rest of the abati the other regiments we had passed unchallenged but here we were instantly stopped by a picket japhet whispered something into the ear of its officer that caused him to stare hard at us then this officer saluted the veiled figure of the child of kings and led us to where the commander of the band and his subordinates were seated near a fire sitting together at some sign or word that did not reach us the commander an old fellow with a long grey beard rose and said  your pardon but be pleased to show your faces  maqueda threw back her hood and turned so that the light of the moon fell full upon her whereon the old man dropped to his knee saying  your commands o walda nagasta  summon your regiment and i will give them she answered and seated herself on a bench by the fire we three and japhet standing behind her  the commander issued orders to his captains and presently the mountaineers formed up on three sides of a square above us to the number of a little over five hundred men when all were gathered maqueda mounted the bench upon which she had been sitting threw back her hood so that every one could see her face in the light of the fire and addressed them  men of the mountainside this night just after the idol of the fung had been destroyed the prince joshua my uncle came to me demanding my surrender to him whether to kill me or to imprison me in his castle beyond the end of the lake for reasons of state as he said or for other vile purposes i do not know  at these words a murmur rose from the audience  wait said maqueda holding up her hand there is worse to come i told my uncle prince joshua that he was a traitor and had best be gone he went threatening me and when i do not know withdrew the guards that should be stationed at my palace gates now some rumour of my danger had reached the foreigners in my service and two of them he who is called black windows whom we rescued from the fung and the soldier named quick came to watch over me while the lord orme and the doctor adams stayed in the cave to send out that spark of fire which should destroy the idol nor did they come back without need for presently arrived a band of prince joshuas men to take me  then black windows and the soldier his companion fought a good fight they two holding the narrow passage against many and slaying a number of them with their terrible weapons the end of it was men of the mountains that the warrior quick charging down the passage drove away those servants of joshua who remained alive but in so doing he was wounded to the death yes that brave man lies dead having given his life to save the child of kings from the hands of her own people black windows also was woundedsee the bandages about his head then came the lord orme and the doctor adams and with them your brother japhet who had barely escaped with their lives from the cave city and knowing that i was no longer safe in the palace where even my sleepingroom has been drenched with blood with them i have fled to you for succour will you not protect me o men of the mountainside  yes yes they answered with a great shout command we obey what shall we do o child of kings  now maqueda called the officers of the regiment apart and consulted with them asking their opinions one by one some of them were in favour of finding out where joshua might be and attacking him at once crush the snakes head and its tail will soon cease wriggling these said and i confess this was a view that in many ways commended itself to us  but maqueda would have none of it  what she exclaimed shall i begin a civil war among my people when for aught i know the enemy is at our gates adding aside to us also how can these few hundred men brave though they be hope to stand against the thousands under the command of joshua  what then would you do asked orme  return to the palace with these mountaineers o oliver and by help of that garrison hold it against all enemies  very well he replied to those who are quite lost one road is as good as another they must trust to the stars to guide them  quite so echoed higgs and the sooner we go the better for my leg hurts and i want a sleep  so maqueda gave her commands to the officers by whom they were conveyed to the regiment which received them with a shout and instantly began to strike its camp  then it was coming hotfoot after so much sorrow loss and doubt that there followed the happiest event of all my life utterly tired out and very despondent i was seated on an arrowchest awaiting the order to march idly watching oliver and maqueda talking with great earnestness at a little distance and in the intervals trying to prevent poor higgs at my side from falling asleep while i was thus engaged suddenly i heard a disturbance and by the bright moonlight caught sight of a man being led into the camp in charge of a guard of abati soldiers whom from their dress i knew to belong to a company that just then was employed in watching the lower gates of the pass  i took no particular heed of the incident thinking only that they might have captured some spy till a murmur of astonishment and the general stir warned me that something unusual had occurred so i rose from my box and strolled towards the man who now was hidden from me by a group of mountaineers as i advanced this group opened the men who composed it bowing to me with a kind of wondering respect that impressed me i did not know why  then for the first time i saw the prisoner he was a tall athletic young man dressed in festal robes with a heavy gold chain about his neck and i wondered vaguely what such a person should be doing here in this time of national commotion he turned his head so that the moonlight showed his dark eyes his somewhat ovalshaped face ending in a peaked black beard and his finely cut features in an instant i knew him  it was my son roderick  next moment for the first time for very many years he was in my arms  the first thing that i remember saying to him was a typically anglosaxon remark for however much we live in the east or elsewhere we never really shake off our native conventions and habits of speech it was how are you my boy and how on earth did you come here to which he answered slowly it is true and speaking with a foreign accent  all right thank you father i ran upon my legs  by this time higgs hobbled up and was greeting my son warmly for of course they were old friends  thought you were to be married tonight roderick he said  yes yes he answered i am half married according to fung custom which counts not to my soul look this is the dress of marriage and he pointed to his fine embroidered robe and rich ornaments  then wheres your wife asked higgs  i do not know and i do not care he answered for i did not like that wife also it is all nothing as i am not quite married to her fung marriage between big people takes two days to finish and if not finished does not matter so she marry some one else if she like and i too  what happened then i asked  oh this father when we had eaten the marriage feast but before we past before priest suddenly we hear a thunder and see a pillar of fire shoot up into sky and sitting on top of it head of harmac which vanish into heaven and stop there then everybody jump up and say  magic of white man magic of white man white man kill the god who sit there from beginning of world now day of fung finished according to prophecy run away people of fung run away  barung the sultan tear his clothes too and sayrun away fung and my halfwife she tear her clothes and say nothing but run like antelope so they all run toward east where great river is and leave me alone then i get up and run tootoward west for i know from black windows and he pointed to higgs when we shut up together in belly of god before he let down to lions what all this game mean and therefore not frightened well i run meeting no one in night till i come to pass run up it and find guards to whom i tell story so they not kill me but let me through and at last i come here quite safe without fung wife thank god and that end of tale  i am afraid you are wrong there my boy i said out of the fryingpan into the fire thats all  out of fryingpan into fire he repeated not understand father must remember i only little fellow when khalifas people take me and since then speak no english till i meet black windows only he give me biblebook that he have in pocket when he go down to be eat by lions here higgs blushed for no one ever suspected him a severe critic of all religions of carrying a bible in his pocket and muttered something about ancient customs of the hebrews  well went on roderick read that book ever since and as you see all my english come back  the question is said higgs evidently in haste to talk of something else will the fung come back  oh black windows dont know cant say think not their prophecy was that harmac move to mur but when they see his head jump into sky and stop there they run every man toward the sunrise and i think go on running  but harmac has come to mur roderick i said at least his head has fallen on to the cliff that overlooks the city  oh my father he answered then that make great difference when fung find out that head of harmac has come here no doubt they come after him for head his most holy bit especially as they want hang all the abati whom they not like  well lets hope that they dont find out anything about it i replied to change the subject then taking roderick by the hand i led him to where maqueda stood a yard or two apart listening to our talk but of course understanding very little of it and introduced him to her explaining in a few words the wonderful thing that had happened she welcomed him very kindly and congratulated me upon my sons escape meanwhile roderick had been staring at her with evident admiration now he turned to us and said in his quaint broken english  walda nagasta most lovely woman no wonder king solomon love her mother if barungs daughter my wife had been like her think i run through great river into rising sun with fung  oliver instantly translated this remark which made us all laugh including maqueda herself and very grateful we were to find the opportunity for a little innocent merriment upon that tragic night  by this time the regiment was ready to start and had formed up into companies before the march actually began however the officer of the abati patrol in whose charge roderick had been brought to us demanded his surrender that he might deliver his prisoner to the commanderinchief prince joshua of course this was refused whereon the man asked roughly  by whose order  as it happened maqueda of whose presence he was not aware heard him and acting on some impulse came forward and unveiled  by mine she said know that the child of kings rules the abati not the prince joshua and that prisoners taken by her soldiers are hers not his be gone back to your post  the captain stared saluted and went with his companions not to the pass indeed as he had been ordered but to joshua to him he reported the arrival of the gentiles son and the news he brought that the nation of the fung dismayed by the destruction of their god were in full flight from the plains of harmac purposing to cross the great river and to return no more  this glad tidings spread like wildfire so fast indeed that almost before we had begun our march we heard the shouts of exultation with which it was received by the terrified mob gathered in the great square the cloud of terror was suddenly lifted from them they went mad in their delight they lit bonfires they drank they feasted they embraced each other and boasted of their bravery that had caused the mighty nation of the fung to flee away for ever  meanwhile our advance had begun nor in the midst of the general jubilation was any particular notice taken of us till we were in the middle of the square of mur and within half a mile of the palace when we saw by the moonlight that a large body of troops two or three thousand of them were drawn up in front of us apparently to bar our way still we went on till a number of officers rode up and addressing the commander of the regiment of mountaineers demanded to know why he had left his post and whither he went  i go whither i am ordered he answered for there is one here greater than i  if you mean the gentile orme and his fellows the command of the prince joshua is that you hand them over to us that they may make report to him of their doings this night  and the command of the child of kings is replied the captain of the mountaineers that i take them with her back to the palace  it has no weight said the spokesman insolently not being endorsed by the council surrender the gentiles hand over to us the person of the child of kings of whom you have taken possession and return to your post till the pleasure of the prince joshua be known  then the wrath of maqueda blazed up  seize those men she said and it was done instantly now cut the head from him who dared to demand the surrender of my person and of my officers and give it to his companions to take back to the prince joshua as my answer to his message  the man heard and being a coward like all the abati flung himself upon his face before maqueda trying to kiss her robe and pleading for mercy  dog she answered you were one of those who this very night dared to attack my chamber oh lie not i knew your voice and heard your fellowtraitors call you by your name away with him  we tried to interfere but she would not listen even to orme  would you plead for your brothers murderer she asked alluding to quick i have spoken  so they dragged him off behind us and presently we saw a melancholy procession returning whence they came carrying something on a shield it reached the opposing ranks whence there arose a murmur of wrath and fear  march on said maqueda and gain the palace  so the regiment formed into a square and setting maqueda and ourselves in the centre of it advanced again  then the fight began great numbers of the abati surrounded us and as they did not dare to make a direct attack commenced shooting arrows which killed and wounded a number of men but the highlanders also were archers and carried stronger bows the square was halted the first ranks kneeling and the second standing behind them then at a given word the stiff bows which these hardy people used against the lion and the buffalo upon their hills were drawn to the ear and loosed again and again with terrible effect  on that open place it was almost impossible to miss the mobs of the abati who having no experience of war were fighting without order nor could the light mail they wore withstand the rush of the heavy barbed arrows which pierced them through and through in two minutes they began to give in three they were flying back to their main body those who were left of them a huddled rout of men and horses so the french must have fled before the terrible longbows of the english at crécy and poitiers for in fact we were taking part in just such a mediæval battle  oliver who was watching intently went to japhet and whispered something in his ear he nodded and ran to seek the commander of the regiment presently the result of that whisper became apparent for the sides of the hollow square wheeled outward and the rear moved up to strengthen the centre  now the mountaineers were ranged in a double or triple line behind which were only about a dozen soldiers who marched round maqueda holding their shields aloft in order to protect her from stray arrows with these too came our four selves a number of campfollowers and others carrying on their shields those of the regiment who were too badly wounded to walk  leaving the dead where they lay we began to advance pouring in volleys of arrows as we went twice the abati tried to charge us and twice those dreadful arrows drove them back then at the word of command the highlanders slung their bows upon their backs drew their short swords and in their turn charged  five minutes afterwards everything was over joshuas soldiers threw down their arms and ran or galloped to right and left save a number of them who fled through the gates of the palace which they had opened and across the drawbridge into the courtyards within after them or rather mixed up with them followed the mountaineers killing all whom they could find for they were out of hand and would not listen to the commands of maqueda and their officers that they should show mercy  so just as the dawn broke this strange moonlit battle ended a small affair it is true for there were only five hundred men engaged upon our side and three or four thousand on the other yet one that cost a great number of lives and was the beginning of all the ruin that followed  well we were safe for a while since it was certain after the lesson which he had just learned that joshua would not attempt to storm the double walls and fosse of the palace without long preparation yet even now a new trouble awaited us for by some means we never discovered how that wing of the palace in which maquedas private rooms were situated suddenly burst into flames  personally i believe that the fire arose through the fact that a lamp had been left burning near the bed of the child of kings upon which was laid the body of sergeant quick perhaps a wounded man hidden there overturned the lamp perhaps the draught blowing through the open doors brought the goldspangled curtains into contact with the wick  at any rate the woodpanelled chambers took fire and had it not happened that the set of the wind was favourable the whole palace might have been consumed as it was we succeeded in confining the conflagration to this particular part of it which within two hours had burnt out leaving nothing standing but the stark stone walls  such was the funeral pyre of sergeant quick a noble one i thought to myself as i watched it burn  when the fire was so well under control for we had pulled down the connecting passage where higgs and quick fought their great fight that there was no longer any danger of its spreading and the watches had been set at length we got some rest  maqueda and two or three of her ladies one of them i remember her old nurse who had brought her up for her mother died at her birth took possession of some empty rooms of which there were many in the palace while we lay or rather fell down in the guestchambers where we had always slept and never opened our eyes again until the evening  i remember that i woke thinking that i was the victim of some wonderful dream of mingled joy and tragedy oliver and higgs were sleeping like logs but my son roderick still dressed in his bridal robes had risen and sat by my bed staring at me a puzzled look upon his handsome face  so you are here i said taking his hand i thought i dreamed  no father he answered in his odd english no dream all true this is a strange world father look at me for how many yearstwelvefourteen slave of savage peoples for whom i sing priest of fung idol always near death but never die then sultan barung take fancy to me say i come of white blood and must be his daughters husband then your brother higgs made prisoner with me and tell me that you hunt me all these years then higgs thrown to lions and you save him then yesterday i married to sultans daughter whom i never see before but twice at fast of idol then harmacs head fly off to heaven and all fung people run away and i run too and find you then battle and many killed and arrow scratch my neck but not hurt me and he pointed to a graze just over his jugular vein and now we together oh father very strange world i think there god somewhere who look after us  i think so too my boy i answered and i hope that he will continue to do so for i tell you we are in a worse place than ever you were among the fung  oh dont mind that father he answered gaily for roderick is a cheerful soul as fung say there no house without door although plenty people made blind and cant see it but we not blind or we dead long ago find door by and by but here come man to talk to you  the man proved to be japhet who had been sent by the child of kings to summon us as she had news to tell so i woke the others and after i had dressed the professors flesh wounds which were stiff and sore we joined her where she sat in the gateway tower of the inner wall she greeted us rather sadly asked oliver how he had slept and higgs if his cuts hurt him then she turned to my son and congratulated him upon his wonderful escape and upon having found a father if he had lost a wife  truly she added you are a fortunate man to be so well loved o son of adams to how many sons are given fathers who for fourteen long years abandoning all else would search for them in peril of their lives enduring slavery and blows and starvation and the deserts heat and cold for the sake of a longlost face such faithfulness is that of my forefather david for his brother jonathan and such love it is that passes the love of women see that you pay it back to him and to his memory until the last hour of your life child of adams  i will indeed i will o walda nagasta answered roderick and throwing his arms about my neck he embraced me before them all it is not too much to say that this kiss of filial devotion more than repaid me for all i had undergone for his beloved sake for now i knew that i had not toiled and suffered for one of no worth as is so often the lot of true hearts in this bitter world  just then some of maquedas ladies brought food and at her bidding we breakfasted  be sparing she said with a melancholy little laugh for i know not how long our store will last listen i have received a last offer from my uncle joshua an arrow brought itnot a man i think that no man would come lest his fate should be that of the traitor of yesterday and she produced a slip of parchment that had been tied to the shaft of an arrow and unfolding it read as follows  o walda nagasta deliver up to death the gentiles who have bewitched you and led you to shed the blood of so many of your people and with them the officers of the mountaineers and the rest shall be spared you also i will forgive and make my wife resist and all who cling to you shall be put to the sword and to yourself i promise nothing  written by order of the council  joshua prince of the abati   what answer shall i send she asked looking at us curiously  upon my word replied orme shrugging his shoulders if it were not for those faithful officers i am not sure but that you would be wise to accept the terms we are cooped up here but a few surrounded by thousands who if they dare not assault still can starve us out as this place is not victualled for a siege  you forget one of those terms o oliver she said slowly pointing with her finger to the passage in the letter which stated that joshua would make her his wife now do you still counsel surrender  how can i he answered flushing and was silent  well it does not matter what you counsel she went on with a smile seeing that i have already sent my answer also by arrow see here is a copy of it and she read  to my rebellious people of the abati  surrender to me joshua my uncle and the members of the council who have lifted sword against me to be dealt with according to the ancient law and the rest of you shall go unharmed refuse and i swear to you that before the night of the new moon has passed there shall be such woe in mur as fell upon the city of david when the barbarian standards were set upon her walls such is the counsel that has come to me the child of solomon in the watches of the night and i tell you that it is true do what you will people of the abati or what you must since your fate and ours are written but be sure that in me and the western lords lies your only hope  walda nagasta   what do you mean o maqueda i asked about the counsel that came to you in the watches of the night  what i say o adams she answered calmly after we parted at dawn i slept heavily and in my sleep a dark and royal woman stood before me whom i knew to be my great ancestress the beloved of solomon she looked on me sadly yet as i thought with love then she drew back as it were a curtain of thick cloud that hid the future and revealed to me the young moon riding the sky and beneath it mur a blackened ruin her streets filled with dead yes and she showed to me other things though i may not tell them which also shall come to pass then held her hands over me as if in blessing and was gone  old hebrew prophet business very interesting i heard higgs mutter below his breath while in my own heart i set the dream down to excitement and want of food in fact only two of us were impressed my son very much and oliver a little perhaps because everything maqueda said was gospel to him  doubtless all will come to pass as you say walda nagasta said roderick with conviction the day of the abati is finished  why do you say that son i asked  because father among the fung people from a child i have two offices that of singer to the god and that of reader of dreams oh do not laugh i can tell you many that have come true as i read them thus the dream of barung which i read to mean that the head of harmac would come to mur and see there it sit and turning he pointed through the doorway of the tower to the grim lionhead of the idol crouched upon the top of the precipice watching mur as a beast of prey watches the victim upon which it is about to spring i know when dreams true and when dreams false it my gift like my voice i know that this dream true that all and as he ceased speaking i saw his eyes catch maquedas and a very curious glance pass between them  as for orme he only said  you easterns are strange people and if you believe a thing maqueda there may be something in it but you understand that this message of yours means war to the last a very unequal war and he looked at the hordes of the abati gathering on the great square  yes she answered quietly i understand but however sore our straits and however strange may seem the things that happen have no fear of the end of that war o my friends    chapter xviii  the burning of the palace  orme was right maquedas defiance did mean war an unequal war this was our position we were shut up in a long range of buildings of which one end had been burned that on account of their moat and double wall if defended with any vigour could only be stormed by an enemy of great courage and determination prepared to face a heavy sacrifice of life this was a circumstance in our favour since the abati were not courageous and very much disliked the idea of being killed or even injured  but here our advantage ended deducting those whom we had lost on the previous night the garrison only amounted to something over four hundred men of whom about fifty were wounded some of them dangerously moreover ammunition was short for they had shot away most of their arrows in the battle of the square and we had no means of obtaining more but worst of all the palace was not provisioned for a siege and the mountaineers had with them only three days rations of sundried beef or goats flesh and a hard kind of biscuit made of indian corn mixed with barley meal thus as we saw from the beginning unless we could manage to secure more food our case must soon grow hopeless  there remained yet another danger although the palace itself was stonebuilt its gilded domes and ornamental turrets were of timber and therefore liable to be fired as indeed had already happened the roof also was of ancient cedar beams thinly covered with concrete while the interior containing an enormous quantity of panels or rather boarding cut from some resinous wood  the abati on the other hand were amply supplied with every kind of store and weapon and could bring a great force to blockade us though that force was composed of a timid and undisciplined rabble  well we made the best preparations that we could although of these i did not see much since all that day my time was occupied in attending to the wounded with the help of my son and a few rough orderlies whose experience in doctoring had for the most part been confined to cattle a pitiful business it proved without the aid of anæsthetics or a proper supply of bandages and other appliances although my medicine chest had been furnished upon a liberal scale it proved totally inadequate to the casualties of battle still i did my best and saved some lives though many cases developed gangrene and slipped through my fingers  meanwhile higgs who worked nobly notwithstanding his flesh wounds which pained him considerably and orme were also doing their best with the assistance of japhet and the other officers of the highland regiment the palace was thoroughly examined and all weak places in its defences were made good the available force was divided into watches and stationed to the best advantage a number of men were set to work to manufacture arrow shafts from cedar beams of which there were plenty in the wooden stables and outhouses that lay at the back of the main building and to point and wing the same from a supply of iron barbs and feathers which fortunately was discovered in one of the guardhouses a few horses that remained in a shed were killed and salted down for food and so forth  also every possible preparation was made to repel attempts to storm paving stones being piled up to throw upon the heads of assailants and fires lighted on the walls to heat pitch and oil and water for the same purpose  but to our disappointment no direct assault was delivered such desperate methods not commending themselves to the abati their plan of attack was to take cover wherever they could especially among the trees of the garden beyond the gates and thence shoot arrows at any one who appeared upon the walls or even fire them in volleys at the clouds as the normans did at hastings so that they might fall upon the heads of persons in the courtyards although these cautious tactics cost us several men they had the advantage of furnishing us with a supply of ammunition which we sorely needed all the spent arrows were carefully collected and made use of against the enemy at whom we shot whenever opportunity offered we did them but little damage however since they were extremely careful not to expose themselves  in this fashion three dreary days went past unrelieved by any incident except a feint for it was scarcely more which the abati made upon the second night apparently with the object of forcing the great gates under cover of a rainstorm the advance was discovered at once and repelled by two or three volleys of arrows and some rifle shots of these rifles indeed whereof we possessed about a score the abati were terribly afraid picking out some of the most intelligent soldiers we taught them how to handle our spare guns and though of course their shooting was extremely erratic the result of it backed up by our own more accurate marksmanship was to force the enemy to take cover indeed after one or two experiences of the effect of bullets not a man would show himself in the open within five hundred yards until night had fallen  on the third afternoon we held a council to determine what must be done since for the last twentyfour hours it had been obvious that things could not continue as they were to begin with we had only sufficient food left to keep our force from starvation for two more days also the spirits of our soldiers brave men enough when actual fighting was concerned were beginning to flag in this atmosphere of inaction gathered into groups they talked of their wives and children and of what would happen to them at the hands of joshua also of their cattle and crops saying that doubtless these were being ravaged and their houses burned in vain did maqueda promise them fivefold their loss when the war was ended for evidently in their hearts they thought it could only end one way moreover as they pointed out she could not give them back their children if these were killed  at this melancholy council every possible plan was discussed to find that these resolved themselves into two alternativesto surrender or to take the bull by the horns sally out of the palace at night and attack joshua on the face of it this latter scheme had the appearance of suicide but in fact it was not so desperate as it seemed the abati being such cowards it was quite probable that they would run in their thousands before the onset of a few hundred determined men and that if once victory declared itself for the child of kings the bulk of her subjects would return to their allegiance so we settled on it in preference to surrender which we knew meant death to ourselves and for maqueda a choice between that last grim solution of her troubles and a forced marriage  but there were others to be convinced namely the mountaineers japhet who had been present at the council was sent to summon all of them except those actually on guard and when they were assembled in the large inner court maqueda went out and addressed them  i do not remember the exact words of her speech and i made no note of them but it was extremely beautiful and touching she pointed out her plight and that we could halt no longer between two opinions who must either fight or yield for herself she said she did not care since although she was young and their ruler she set no store upon her life and would give it up gladly rather than be driven into a marriage which she considered shameful and forced to pass beneath the yoke of traitors  but for us foreigners she did care we had come to her country at her invitation we had served her nobly one of us had given his life to protect her person and now in violation of her safeguard and that of the council we were threatened with a dreadful death were they her subjects so lacking in honour and hospitality that they would suffer such a thing with no blow struck to save us  now the majority of them shouted no but some were silent and one old captain advanced saluted and spoke  child of kings he said let us search out the truth of this matter is it not because of your love of the foreign soldier orme that all this trouble has arisen is not that love unlawful according to our law and are you not solemnly affianced to the prince joshua  maqueda considered awhile before she replied and said slowly  friend my heart is my own therefore upon this point answer your question for yourself as regards my uncle joshua if there existed any abiding contract between us it was broken when a few nights ago he sent his servants armed to attack and drag me off i know not whither would you have me marry a traitor and a coward i have spoken  no again shouted the majority of the soldiers  then in the silence that followed the old captain replied with a canniness that was almost scotch  on the point raised by you o child of kings i give no opinion since you being but a woman if a highborn one would not listen to me if i did but will doubtless follow that heart of yours of which you speak to whatever end is appointed settle the matter with your betrothed joshua as you will but we also have a matter to settle with joshua who is a toad with a long tongue that if he seems slow yet never misses his fly we took up your cause and have killed a great number of his people as he has killed some of ours this he will not forget therefore it seems to me that it will be wise that we should make what we can of the nest that we have built since it is better to die in battle than on the gallows for this reason then since we can stay here no longer for my part i am willing to go out and fight for you this night although joshuas people being so many and ours so few i shall think myself fortunate if i live to see another sun  this hard and reasoned speech seemed to appeal to the dissentients with the result that they withdrew their opposition and it was agreed that we should attempt to break our way through the besieging army about one hour before the dawn when they would be heavily asleep and most liable to panic  yet as it chanced that sortie was destined never to take place which perhaps was fortunate for us since i am convinced that it would have ended in failure it is true that we might have forced our way through joshuas army but afterwards those of us who remained alive would have been surrounded starved out and when our strength and ammunition were exhausted taken prisoners or cut down  however that may be events shaped a different course for us perhaps because the abati got wind of our intention and had no stomach for a pitched battle with desperate men as it happened this night from sunset on to moonrise was one of a darkness so remarkable that it was impossible to see anything even a foot away also a wind blowing from the east made sounds very inaudible only a few of our men were on guard since it was necessary that they should be rested till it was time for them to prepare for their great effort also we had little fear of any direct attack  about eight oclock however my son roderick one of the watch stationed in the gateway towers who was gifted with very quick ears reported that he thought he heard people moving on the farther side of the massive wooden doors beyond the moat accordingly some of us went to listen but could distinguish nothing and concluded therefore that he was mistaken so we retired to our posts and waited patiently for the moon to rise but as it chanced no moon rose or rather we could not see her because the sky was completely covered by thick banks of thunderclouds presaging the breakup of a period of great heat these as the wind had now died down remained quite stationary upon the face of the sky blotting out all light  perhaps another hour had passed when chancing to look behind me i saw what i thought was a meteor falling from the crest of the cliff against which the palace was built that cliff whither the head of the idol harmac had been carried by the force of the explosion  look at that shooting star i said to oliver who was at my side  it is not a shooting star it is fire he replied in a startled voice and as he spoke other streaks of light scores of them began to rain down from the brow of the cliff and land upon the wooden buildings to the rear of the palace that were dry as tinder with the drought and what was worse upon the gilded timber domes of the roof  dont you understand the game he went on they have tied firebrands to arrows and spears to burn us out sound the alarm sound the alarm  it was done and presently the great range of buildings began to hum like a hive of bees the soldiers still half asleep rushed hither and thither shouting the officers also developing the characteristic excitement of the abati race in this hour of panic yelled and screamed at them beating them with their fists and swords till some kind of control was established  then attempts were made to extinguish the flames which by this time had got hold in halfadozen places from the beginning the effort was absolutely hopeless it is true that there was plenty of water in the moat which was fed by a perennial stream that flowed down the face of the precipice behind but pumping engines of any sort were quite unknown to the abati who if a building took fire just let it burn contenting themselves with safeguarding those in its neighbourhood moreover even in the palace such articles as pails jugs or other vessels were comparatively few and far between  those that we could find however were filled with water and passed by lines of men to the places in most dangerthat is practically everywherewhile other men tried to cut off the advance of the flames by pulling down portions of the building  but as fast as one fire was extinguished others broke out for the rain of burning darts and of lighted pots or lamps filled with oil descended continuously from the cliff above a strange and terrible sight it was to see them flashing down through the darkness like the fiery darts that shall destroy the wicked in the day of armageddon  still we toiled on despairingly on the roof we four white men and some soldiers under the command of japhet were pouring water on to several of the gilded domes which now were well alight close by wrapped in a dark cloak and attended by some of her ladies stood maqueda she was quite calm although sundry burning arrows and spears falling with great force from the cliff above struck the flat roofs close to where she stood  her ladies however were not calm they wept and wrung their hands while one of them went into violent hysterics in her very natural terror maqueda turned and bade them descend to the courtyard of the gateway where she said she would join them presently they rushed off rejoicing to escape the sight of those burning arrows one of which had just pierced a man and set his clothes and hair on fire causing him to leap from the roof in his madness  at olivers request i ran to the child of kings to lead her to some safer place if it could be found but she would not stir  let me be o adams she said if i am to die i will die here but i do not think that is fated and with her foot she kicked aside a burning spear that had struck the cement roof and rebounding fallen quite close to her if my people will not fight she went on with bitter sarcasm at least they understand the other arts of war for this trick of theirs is clever they are cruel also listen to them mocking us in the square they ask whether we will roast alive or come out and have our throats cut oh she went on clenching her hands oh that i should have been born the head of such an accursed race let sheol take them all for in the day of their tribulation no finger will i lift to save them  she was silent for a moment and down below near the gateway i heard some brute screaming pretty pigeons pretty pigeons are your feathers singeing come then into our pie pretty pigeons pretty pigeons followed by shouts of ribald laughter  but it chanced it was this hound himself who went into the pie presently when the flames were brighter i saw him in the midst of a crowd of his admirers singing his foul song another verse of it about maqueda which i will not repeat and by good fortune managed to put a bullet through his head it was not a bad shot considering the light and circumstances and the only one i fired that night i trust also that it will be the last i shall ever fire at any human being  just as i was about to leave maqueda and return with her message to orme to the effect that she would not move the final catastrophe occurred amongst the stables was a large shed filled with dry fodder for the palace horses and camels suddenly this burst into a mass of flame that spread in all directions then came the last hideous panic from every part of the palace the mountaineers men and officers together rushed down to the gateway in a minute with the single exception of japhet we four and maqueda were left alone upon the roof where we stood overwhelmed not knowing what to do we heard the drawbridge fall we heard the great doors burst upon beneath the pressure of a mob of men we heard a coarse voicei thought it was that of joshuayell  kill whom you will my children but death to him who harms the child of kings she is my spoil  then followed terrible sights and sounds the cunning abati had stretched ropes outside the doors it was the noise they made at this work which had reached rodericks ears earlier during the darkness the terrified soldiers flying from the fire stumbled and fell over these ropes nor could they rise again because of those who pressed behind what happened to them all i am sure i do not know but doubtless many were crushed to death and many more killed by joshuas men i trust however that some of them escaped since compared to the rest of the abati they were as lions are to cats although like all their race they lacked the stamina to fight an uphill game  it was at the commencement of this terrific scene that i shot the foulmouthed singer  you shouldnt have done that old fellow screamed higgs in his high voice striving to make himself heard above the tumult as it will show those swine where we are  i dont think they will look for us here anyway i answered  then we watched awhile in silence  come said orme at length taking maqueda by the hand  where are you going o oliver she asked hanging back sooner will i burn than yield to joshua  i am going to the cave city he answered we have nowhere else to go and little time to lose four men with rifles can hold that place against a thousand come  i obey she answered bowing her head  we went down the stairway that led from the roof on which the inhabitants of the palace were accustomed to spend much of their day and even to sleep in hot weather as is common in the east another minute and we should have been too late the fire from one of the domes had spread to the upper story and was already appearing in little tongues of flame mingled with jets of black smoke through cracks in the crumbling partition wall  as a matter of fact this wall fell in just as my son roderick the last of us was passing down the stairs with the curiosity of youth he had lingered for a few moments to watch the sad scene below a delay which nearly cost him his life  on the ground floor we found ourselves out of immediate danger since the fire was attacking this part of the palace from above and burning downward we had even time to go to our respective sleepingplaces and collect such of our possessions and valuables as we were able to carry fortunately among other things these included all our notebooks which today are of priceless value laden with these articles we met again in the audience hall which although it was very hot seemed as it had always been a huge empty place whereof the roof painted with stars was supported upon thick cedar columns each of them hewn from a single tree  passing down that splendid apartment which an hour later had ceased to exist lamps in hand for these we had found time to fetch and light we reached the mouth of the passage that led to the underground city without meeting a single human being  had the abati been a different race they could perfectly well have dashed in and made us prisoners for the drawbridge was still intact but their cowardice was our salvation for they feared lest they should be trapped by the fire so i think at least but justice compels me to add that on the spur of the moment they may have found it impossible to clear the gateways of the mass of fallen or dead soldiers over which it would have been difficult to climb  such at any rate was the explanation that we heard afterwards  we reached the mouth of the vast cave in perfect safety and clambered through the little orifice which was left between the rocks rolled thither by the force of the explosion or shaken down from the roof this hole for it was nothing more we proceeded to stop with a few stones in such a fashion that it could not be forced without much toil and considerable noise only leaving one little tortuous channel through which if necessary a man could creep  the labour of rockcarrying in which even maqueda shared occupied our minds for awhile and induced a kind of fictitious cheerfulness but when it was done and the chilly silence of that enormous cave so striking in comparison with the roar of the flames and the hideous human tumult which we had left without fell upon us like sudden cold and blinding night upon a wanderer in windy sunlit mountains all our excitement perished in a flash we understood our terrible position we who had but escaped from the red fire to perish slowly in the black darkness  still we strove to keep our spirits as best we could leaving higgs to watch the blocked passage a somewhat superfluous task since the fire without was our best watchman the rest of us threaded our way up the cave following the telephone wire which poor quick had laid on the night of the blowingup of the god harmac till we came to what had been our headquarters during the digging of the mine into the room which was olivers whence we had escaped with so much difficulty after that event we could not enter because of the transom that blocked the doorway still there were plenty of others at hand in the old temple although they were foul with the refuse of the bats that wheeled about us in thousands for these creatures evidently had some unknown access to the open air one of these rooms had served as our storechamber and after a few rough preparations we assigned it to maqueda  friends she said as she surveyed its darksome entrance it looks like the door of a tomb well in the tomb there is rest and rest i must have leave me to sleep who were it not for you o oliver would pray that i might never wake again  man she added passionately before us all for now in face of the last peril every false shame and wish to conceal the truth had left her man why were you born to bring woe upon my head and joy to my heart well well the joy outweighs the woe and even if the angel who led you hither is named azrael still i shall bless him who has revealed to me my soul yet for you i weep and if only your life could be spared to fulfil itself in happiness in the land that bore you oh for you i would gladly die  now oliver who seemed deeply moved stepped to her and began to whisper into her ear evidently making some proposal of which i think i can guess the nature she listened to him smiling sadly and made a motion with her hand as though to thrust him away  not so she said it is nobly offered but did i accept through whatever universes i may wander those who came after me would know me by my trail of blood the blood of him who loved me perhaps too by that crime i should be separated from you for ever moreover i tell you that though all seems black as this thick darkness i believe that things will yet end well for you and mein this world or another  then she was gone leaving orme staring after her like a man in a trance  i daresay they will remarked higgs sotto voce to me and thats firstrate so far as they are concerned but what i should jolly well like to know is how they are going to end for us who havent got a charming lady to see us across the styx  you neednt puzzle your brain over that i answered gloomily for i think there will soon be a few more skeletons in this beastly cave thats all dont you see that those abati will believe we are burned in the palace    chapter xix  starvation  i was right the abati did think that we had been burned it never occurred to them that we might have escaped to the underground city so at least i judged from the fact that they made no attempt to seek us there until they learned the truth in the fashion that i am about to describe if anything this safety from our enemies added to the trials of those hideous days and nights had there been assaults to repel and the excitement of striving against overwhelming odds at any rate we should have found occupation for our minds and remaining energies  but there were none by turns we listened at the mouth of the passage for the echo of footsteps that never came nothing came to break a silence so intense that at last our ears craving for sound magnified the soft flitter of the bats into a noise as of eagles wings till at last we spoke in whispers because the full voice of man seemed to affront the solemn quietude seemed intolerable to our nerves  yet for the first day or two we found occupation of a sort of course our first need was to secure a supply of food of which we had only a little originally laid up for our use in the chambers of the old temple tinned meats that we had brought from london and so forth now nearly all consumed we remembered that maqueda had told us of corn from her estates which was stored annually in pits to provide against the possibility of a siege of mur and asked her where it was  she led us to a place where round stone covers with rings attached to them were let into the floor of the cave not unlike those which stop the coalshoots in a town pavement only larger with great difficulty we prised one of these up to me it did not seem to have been moved since the ancient kings ruled in mur and after leaving it open for a long while for the air within to purify lowered roderick by a rope we had to report its contents next moment we heard him saying want to come up please this place is not pleasant  we pulled him out and asked what he had found  nothing good to eat he answered only plenty of dead bones and one rat that ran up my leg  we tried the next two pits with the same resultthey were full of human bones then we crossexamined maqueda who after reflection informed us that she now remembered that about five generations before a great plague had fallen on mur which reduced its population by onehalf she had heard also that those stricken with the plague were driven into the underground city in order that they might not infect the others and supposed that the bones we saw were their remains this information caused us to close up those pits again in a great hurry though really it did not matter whether we caught the plague or no  still as she was sure that corn was buried somewhere we went to another group of pits in a distant chamber and opened the first one this time our search was rewarded to the extent that we found at the bottom of it some mouldering dust that years ago had been grain the other pits two of which had been sealed up within three years as the date upon the wax showed were quite empty  then maqueda understood what had happened  surely the abati are a people of rogues she said see now the officers appointed to store away my corn which i gave them have stolen it oh may they live to lack bread even more bitterly than we do today  we went back to our sleepingplace in silence well might we be silent for of food we had only enough left for a single scanty meal water there was in plenty but no food when we had recovered a little from our horrible disappointment we consulted together  if we could get through the mine tunnel said oliver we might escape into the den of lions which were probably all destroyed by the explosion and so out into the open country  the fung would take us there suggested higgs  no no broke in roderick fung all gone or if they do anything better than this black hole yes even my wife  let us look i said and we started  when we reached the passage that led from the city to the tomb of kings it was to find that the wall at the end of it had been blown bodily back into the parent cave leaving an opening through which we could walk side by side of course the contents of the tomb itself were scattered in all directions lay bones objects of gold and other metals or overturned thrones the roof and walls alone remained as they had been  what vandalism exclaimed higgs indignant even in his misery why wouldnt you let me move the things when i wanted to orme  because they would have thought that we were stealing them old fellow also those mountaineers were superstitious and i did not want them to desert but what does it matter anyway if you had they would have been burned in the palace  by this time we had reached that end of the vast tomb where the hunchbacked king used to sit and saw at once that our quest was vain the tunnel which we had dug beyond was utterly choked with masses of fallen rock that we could never hope to move even with the aid of explosives of which we had none left  so we returned our last hope gone  also another trouble stared us in the face our supply of the crude mineral oil which the abati used for lighting purposes was beginning to run low measurement of what remained of the store laid up for our use while the mine was being made revealed the fact that there was only enough left to supply four lamps for about three days and nights one for maqueda one for ourselves one for the watchman near the tunnel mouth and one for general purposes  this generalpurpose lamp as a matter of fact was mostly made use of by higgs truly he furnished a striking instance of the ruling passion strong in death all through those days of starvation and utter misery until he grew too weak and the oil gave out he trudged backward and forward between the old temple and the tomb of kings carrying a large basket on his arm going out with this basket empty he would bring it back filled with gold cups and other precious objects that he had collected from among the bones and scattered rubbish in the tomb these objects he laboriously catalogued in his pocketbook at night and afterwards packed away in empty cases that had contained our supplies of explosive and other goods carefully nailing them down when filled  what on earth are you doing that for higgs i asked petulantly as he finished off another case i think it was his twentieth  i dont know doctor he answered in a thin voice for like the rest of us he was growing feeble on a waterdiet i suppose it amuses me to think how jolly it would be to open all these boxes in my rooms in london after a firstrate dinner of fried sole and steak cut thick and he smacked his poor hungry lips yes yes he went on to take them out one by one and show them to  and  and he mentioned by name officials of sundry great museums with whom he was at war and see them tear their hair with rage and jealousy while they wondered in their hearts if they could not manage to seize the lot for the crown as treasuretrove or do me out of them somehow and he laughed a little in his old pleasant fashion  of course i never shall he added sadly but perhaps one day some other fellow will find them here and get them to europe and if he is a decent chap publish my notes and descriptions of which i have put a duplicate in each box and so make my name immortal well im off again there are four more cases to fill before the oil gives out and i must get that great gold head into one of them though it is an awful job to carry it far at a time doctor what disease is it that makes your legs suddenly give way beneath you so that you find yourself sitting in a heap on the floor without knowing how you came there you dont know well no more do i but ive got it bad i tell you im downright sore behind from continual and unexpected contact with the rock  poor old higgs i did not like to tell him that his disease was starvation  well he went on with his fetching and carrying and cataloguing and packing i remember that the last load he brought in was the golden head he had spoken of the wonderful likeness of some prehistoric king which has since excited so much interest throughout the world the thing being too heavy for him to carry in his weakened state for it is much over lifesize he was obliged to roll it before him which accounts for the present somewhat damaged condition of the nose and semiegyptian diadem  never shall i forget the sight of the professor as he appeared out of the darkness shuffling along upon his knees where his garments were worn into holes and by the feeble light of the lamp that he moved from time to time painfully pushing the great yellow object forward only a foot or two at each push  here it is at last he gasped triumphantly whilst we watched him with indifferent eyes japhet help me to wrap it up in the mat and lift it into the box no no you donkeyface upwardso never mind the corners ill fill them with ringmoney and other trifles and out of his wide pockets he emptied a golden shower amongst which he sifted handfuls of dust from the floor and anything else he could find to serve as packing finally covering all with a goatshair blanket which he took from his bed  then very slowly he found the lid of the box and nailed it down resting between every few strokes of the hammer whilst we watched him in our intent but idle fashion wondering at the strange form of his madness  at length the last nail was driven and seated on the box he put his hand into an inner pocket to find his notebook then incontinently fainted i struggled to my feet and sprinkled water over his face till he revived and rolled on to the floor where presently he sank into sleep or torpor as he did so the first lamp gave out  light it japhet said maqueda it is dark in this place  o child of kings answered the man i would obey if i could but there is no more oil  halfanhour later the second lamp went out by the light that remained we made such arrangements as we could knowing that soon darkness would be on us they were few and simple the fetching of a jar or two of water the placing of arms and ammunition to our hands and the spreading out of some blankets on which to lie down side by side upon what i for one believed would be our bed of death  while we were thus engaged japhet crawled into our circle from the outer gloom suddenly i saw his haggard face appear looking like that of a spirit rising from the grave  my lamp is burned out he moaned it began to fail whilst i was on watch at the tunnel mouth and before i was halfway here it died altogether had it not been for the wire of the thingthatspeaks which guided me i could never have reached you i should have been lost in the darkness of the city and perished alone among the ghosts  well you are here now said oliver have you anything to report  nothing lord or at least very little i moved some of the small rocks that we piled up and crept down the hole till i came to a place where the blessed light of day fell upon me only one little ray of it but still the light of day i think that something has fallen upon the tunnel and broken it perhaps one of the outer walls of the palace at least i looked through a crack and saw everywhere ruinsruins that still smoke from among them i heard the voices of men shouting to each other  one of them called to his companion that it was strange if the gentiles and the child of kings had perished in the fire that they had not found their bones which would be known by the guns they carried his friend answered that it was strange indeed but being magicians perhaps they had hidden away somewhere for his part he hoped so as then sooner or later they would be found and put to death slowly as they deserved who had led astray the child of kings and brought so many of the heavendescended abati to their death then fearing lest they should find and kill me for they drew near as i could tell by their voices i crept back again and that is all my story  we said nothing there seemed to be nothing to say but sat in our sad circle and watched the dying lamp when it began to flicker leaping up and down like a thing alive a sudden panic seized poor japhet  o walda nagasta he cried throwing himself at her feet you have called me a brave man but i am only brave where the sun and the stars shine here in the dark amongst so many angry spirits and with hunger gnawing at my bowels i am a great coward joshua himself is not such a coward as i let us go out into the light while there is yet time let us give ourselves up to the prince perhaps he will be merciful and spare our lives or at least he will spare yours and if we die it will be with the sun shining on us  but maqueda only shook her head whereon he turned to orme and went on  lord would you have the blood of the child of kings upon your hands is it thus that you repay her for her love lead her forth no harm will come to her who otherwise must perish here in misery  you hear what the man says maqueda said orme heavily there is some truth in it it really does not matter to us whether we die in the power of the abati or here of starvation in fact i think that we should prefer the former end and doubtless no hand will be laid on you will you go  nay she answered passionately a hand would be laid on me the hand of joshua and rather than that he should touch me i will die a hundred deaths let fate take its course for as i have told you i believe that then it will open to us some gate we cannot see and if i believe in vain why there is another gate which we can pass together o oliver and beyond that gate lies peace bid the man be silent or drive him away let him trouble me no more    the lamp flame sank low it flickered once twice thrice each time showing the pale drawn faces of us six seated about it like wizards making an incantation like corpses in a tomb  then it went out  how long were we in that place after this at least three whole days and nights i believe if not more but of course we soon lost all count of time at first we suffered agonies from famine which we strove in vain to assuage with great draughts of water no doubt these kept us alive but even higgs who it may be remembered was a teetotaller afterwards confessed to me that he has loathed the sight and taste of water ever since indeed he now drinks beer and wine like other people it was torture we could have eaten anything in fact the professor did manage to catch and eat a bat that got entangled in his red hair he offered me a bite of it i remember and was most grateful when i declined  the worst of it was also that we had a little food a few hard ships biscuits which we had saved up for a purpose namely to feed maqueda this was how we managed it at certain intervals i would announce that it was time to eat and hand maqueda her biscuit then we would all pretend to eat also saying how much we felt refreshed by the food and how we longed for more smacking our lips and biting on a piece of wood so that she could not help hearing us  this piteous farce went on for fortyeight hours or more until at last the wretched japhet who was quite demoralized and in no mood for acting betrayed us exactly how i cannot remember after this maqueda would touch nothing more which did not greatly matter as there was only one biscuit left i offered it to her whereon she thanked me and all of us for our courtesy toward a woman took the biscuit and gave it to japhet who ate it like a wolf  it was some time after this incident that we discovered japhet to be missing at least we could no longer touch him nor did he answer when we called therefore we concluded that he had crept away to die and i am sorry to say thought little more about it for after all what he suffered or had suffered we suffered also  i recall that before we were overtaken by the last sleep a strange fit came upon us our pangs passed away much as the pain does when mortification follows a wound and with them that horrible craving for nutriment we grew cheerful and talked a great deal thus roderick gave me the entire history of the fung people and of his life among them and other savage tribes further he explained every secret detail of their idol worship to higgs who was enormously interested and tried to make some notes by the aid of our few remaining matches when even that subject was exhausted he sang to us in his beautiful voiceenglish hymns and arab songs oliver and maqueda also chatted together quite gaily for i heard them laughing and gathered that he was engaged in trying to teach her english  the last thing that i recollect is the scene as it was revealed by the momentary light of one of the last matches maqueda sat by oliver his arm was about her waist her head rested upon his shoulder her long hair flowed loose her large and tender eyes stared from her white wan face up toward his face which was almost that of a mummy  then on the other side stood my son supporting himself against the wall of the room and beyond him higgs a shadow of his former self feebly waving a pencil in the air and trying apparently to write a note upon his panama straw hat which he held in his left hand as i suppose imagining it to be his pocketbook the incongruity of that sunhat in a place where no sun had ever come made me laugh and as the match went out i regretted that i had forgotten to look at his face to ascertain whether he was still wearing his smoked spectacles  what is the use of a straw hat and smoked spectacles in kingdomcome i kept repeating to myself while roderick whose arm i knew was about me seemed to answer  the fung wizards say that the sphinx harmac once wore a hat but my father i do not know if he had spectacles  then a sensation as of being whirled round and round in some vast machine down the sloping sides of which i sank at last into a vortex of utter blackness whereof i knew the name was death  dimly very dimly i became aware that i was being carried i heard voices in my ears but what they said i could not understand then a feeling of light struck upon my eyeballs which gave me great pain agony ran all through me as it does through the limbs of one who is being brought back from death by drowning after this something warm was poured down my throat and i went to sleep  when i awoke again it was to find myself in a large room that i did not know i was lying on a bed and by the light of sunrise which streamed through the windowplaces i saw the three others my son roderick orme and higgs lying on the other beds but they were still asleep  abati servants entered the room bringing food a kind of rough soup with pieces of meat in it of which they gave me a portion in a wooden bowl that i devoured greedily also they shook my companions until they awoke and almost automatically ate up the contents of similar bowls after which they went to sleep again as i did thanking heaven that we were all still alive  every few hours i had a vision of these men entering with the bowls of soup or porridge until at last life and reason came back to me in earnest and i saw higgs sitting up on the bed opposite and staring at me  i say old fellow he said are we alive or is this hades  cant be hades i answered because there are abati here  quite right he replied if the abati go anywhere its to hell where they havent whitewashed walls and fourpost beds oliver wake up we are out of that cave anyway  orme raised himself on his hand and stared at us  wheres maqueda he asked a question to which of course we could give no answer till presently roderick woke also and said  i remember something they carried us all out of the cave japhet was with them they took the child of kings one way and us another that is all i know  shortly afterwards the abati servants arrived bearing food more solid than the soup and with them came one of their doctors not that old idiot of a court physician who examined us and announced that we should all recover a fact which we knew already we asked many questions of him and the servants but could get no answer for evidently they were sworn to silence however we persuaded them to bring us water to wash in it came and with it a polished piece of metal such as the abati use for a lookingglass in which we saw our faces the terrible wasted faces of those who have gone within a hairs breadth of death by starvation in the dark  yet although our gaolers would say nothing something in their aspect told us that we were in sore peril of our lives they looked at us hungrily as a terrier looks at rats in a wire cage of which the door will presently be opened moreover roderick who as i think i have said has very quick ears overheard one of the attendants whisper to another  when does our service on these hounds of gentiles come to an end to which his fellow answered the council has not yet decided but i think tomorrow or the next day if they are strong enough it will be a great show  also that evening about sunset we heard a mob shouting outside the barrack in which we were imprisoned for that was its real use give us the gentiles give us the gentiles we are tired of waiting until at length some soldiers drove them away  well we talked the thing over only to conclude that there was nothing to be done we had no friend in the place except maqueda and she it appeared was a prisoner like ourselves and therefore could not communicate with us nor could we see the slightest possibility of escape  out of the fryingpan into the fire remarked higgs gloomily i wish now that they had let us die in the cave it would have been better than being baited to death by a mob of abati  yes answered oliver with a sigh for he was thinking of maqueda but thats why they saved us the vindictive beasts to kill us for what they are pleased to call high treason  high treason exclaimed higgs i hope to goodness their punishment for the offence is not that of mediæval england hanging is bad enoughbut the rest  i dont think the abati study european history i broke in but it is no use disguising from you that they have methods of their own look here friends i added i have kept something about me in case the worst should come to the worst and i produced a little bottle containing a particularly swift and deadly poison done up into tabloids and gave one to each of them my advice is i added that if you see we are going to be exposed to torture or to any dreadful form of death you should take one of these as i mean to do and cheat the abati of their vengeance  that is all very fine said the professor as he pocketed his tabloid but i never could swallow a pill without water at the best of times and i dont believe those beasts will give one any well i suppose i must suck it thats all oh if only the luck would turn if only the luck would turn  three more days went by without any sign of higgss aspiration being fulfilled on the contrary except in one respect the luck remained steadily against us the exception was that we got plenty to eat and consequently regained our normal state of health and strength more rapidly than might have been expected with us it was literally a case of let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  only somehow i dont think that any of us really believed that we should die though whether this was because we had all except poor quick survived so much or from a sneaking faith in maquedas optimistic dreams i cannot say at any rate we ate our food with appetite took exercise in an inner yard of the prison and strove to grow as strong as we could feeling that soon we might need all our powers oliver was the most miserable among us not for his own sake but because poor fellow he was haunted with fears as to maqueda and her fate although of these he said little or nothing to us on the other hand my son roderick was by far the most cheerful he had lived for so many years upon the brink of death that this familiar gulf seemed to have no terrors for him  all come right somehow my father he said airily who can know what happen perhaps child of king drag us out of mudhole for after all she was very strong cow or what you call it heifer and i think toss joshua if he drive her into corner or perhaps other thing occur  what other thing roderick i asked  oh dont know cant say but i think fung thing believe we not done with fung yet believe they not run far believe they take thought for morrow and come back again only he added sadly hope my wife not come back for that old girl too full of lofty temper for me still cheer up not dead yet by long days march and meanwhile food good and this very jolly rest after beastly underground city now i tell professor some more stories about fung religion den of lions and so forth  on the morning after this conversation a crisis came just as we had finished breakfast the doors of our chamber were thrown open and in marched a number of soldiers wearing joshuas badge they were headed by an officer of his household who commanded us to rise and follow him  where to asked orme  to take your trial before the child of kings and her council gentile upon the charge of having murdered certain of her subjects answered the officer sternly  thats all right said higgs with a sigh of relief if maqueda is chairman of the bench we are pretty certain of an acquittal for ormes sake if not for our own  dont you be too sure of that i whispered into his ear the circumstances are peculiar and women have been known to change their minds  adams he replied glaring at me through his smoked spectacles if you talk like that we shall quarrel maqueda change her mind indeed why it is an insult to suggest such a thing and if you take my advice you wont let oliver hear you dont you remember man that shes in love with him  oh yes i answered but i remember also that prince joshua is in love with her and that she is his prisoner    chapter xx  the trial and after  they set us in a line four raggedlooking fellows all of us with beards of various degrees of growth that is all the other three for mine had been an established fact for years and everything having been taken away from us we possessed neither razor nor scissors  in the courtyard of our barrack we were met by a company of soldiers who encircled us about with a triple line of men as we thought to prevent any attempt of escape so soon as we passed the gates i found however that this was done for a different reason namely to protect us from the fury of the populace all the way from the barrack to the courthouse whither we were being taken now that the palace was burned the people were gathered in hundreds literally howling for our blood it was a strange and in a way a dreadful sight to see even the brightly dressed women and children shaking their fists and spitting at us with faces distorted by hate  why they love you so little father when you do so much for them asked roderick shrugging his shoulders and dodging a stone that nearly hit him on the head  for two reasons i answered because their lady loves one of us too much and because through us many of their people have lost their lives also they hate strangers and are by nature cruel like most cowards and now that they have no more fear of the fung they think it will be safe to kill us  ah said roderick yet harmac has come to mur and he pointed to the great head of the idol seated on the cliff and i think where harmac goes fung follow and if so they make them pay plenty for my life for i great man among fung fung myself husband of sultans daughter these fools like children because they see no fung think there are no fung well in one year or perhaps one month they learn  i daresay my boy i answered but i am afraid that wont help us  by now we were approaching the courthouse where the abati priests and learned men tried civil and some criminal cases through a mob of nobles and soldiers who mocked us as we went we were hustled into the large hall of judgment that was already full to overflowing  up the centre of it we marched to a clear space reserved for the parties to a cause or prisoners and their advocates beyond which against the wall were seats for the judges these were five members of the council one of whom was joshua while in the centre as president of the court and wearing her veil and beautiful robes of ceremony sat maqueda herself  thank god shes safe muttered oliver with a gasp of relief  yes answered higgs but whats she doing there she ought to be in the dock too not on the bench  we reached the open space and were thrust by soldiers armed with swords to where we must stand and although each of us bowed to her i observed that maqueda took not the slightest notice of our salutations she only turned her head and said something to joshua on her right which caused him to laugh  then with startling suddenness the case began a kind of public prosecutor stood forward and droned out the charge against us it was that we who were in the employ of the abati had traitorously taken advantage of our position as mercenary captains to stir up a civil war in which many people had lost their lives and some been actually murdered by ourselves and our companion who was dead moreover that we had caused their palace to be burned and greatest crime of all had seized the sacred person of the walda nagasta rose of mur and dragged her away into the recesses of the underground city whence she was only rescued by the chance of an accomplice of ours one japhet betraying our hidingplace  this was the charge which it will be noted contained no allusion whatever to the love entanglement between maqueda and oliver when it was finished the prosecutor asked us what we pleaded whereon oliver answered as our spokesman that it was true there had been fighting and men killed also that we had been driven into the cave but as to all the rest the child of kings knew the truth and must speak for us as she wished  now the audience began to shout they plead guilty give them to death and so forth while the judges rising from their seats gathered round maqueda and consulted her  by heaven i believe she is going to give us away exclaimed higgs whereon oliver turned on him fiercely and bade him hold his tongue adding  if you were anywhere else you should answer for that slander  at length the consultation was finished the judges resumed their seats and maqueda held up her hand thereon an intense silence fell upon the place then she began to speak in a cold constrained voice  gentiles she said addressing us you have pleaded guilty to the stirring up of civil war in mur and to the slaying of numbers of its people facts of which there is no need for evidence since many widows and fatherless children can testify to them today moreover you did as alleged by my officer commit the crime of bearing off my person into the cave and keeping me there by force to be a hostage for your safety  we heard and gasped higgs ejaculating good gracious what a lie but none of the rest of us said anything  for these offences went on maqueda you are all of you justly worthy of a cruel death then she paused and added yet as i have the power to do i remit the sentence i decree that this day you and all the goods that remain to you which have been found in the cave city and elsewhere together with camels for yourselves and your baggage shall be driven from mur and that if any one of you returns hither he shall without further trial be handed over to the executioners this i do because at the beginning of your service a certain bargain was made with you and although you have sinned so deeply i will not suffer that the glorious honour of the abati people shall be tarnished even by the breath of suspicion get you gone wanderers and let us see your faces no more for ever  now the mob gathered in the hall shouted in exultation though i heard some crying out no kill them kill them  when the tumult had died down maqueda spoke again saying  o noble and generous abati you approve of this deed of mercy you who would not be held merciless in far lands o abati where although you may not have heard of them there are i believe other peoples who think themselves as great as you you would not have it whispered i say that we who are the best of the world we the children of solomon have dealt harshly even with stray dogs that have wandered to our gates moreover we called these dogs to hunt a certain beast for us the lionheaded beast called fung and to be just to them they hunted well therefore spare them the noose though they may have deserved it and let them run hence with their bone say you the bone which they think that they have earned what does a bone more or less matter to the rich abati if only their holy ground is not defiled with the blood of gentile dogs  nothing at all nothing at all they shouted tie it to their tails and let them go  it shall be done o my people and now that we have finished with these dogs i have another word to say to you you may have thought or heard that i was too fond of them and especially of one of them and she glanced toward oliver well there are certain dogs who will not work unless you pat them on the head therefore i patted this one on the head since after all he is a clever dog who knows things that we do not know for instance how to destroy the idol of the fung o great abati can any of you really have believed that i of the ancient race of solomon and sheba i the child of kings purposed to give my noble hand to a vagrant gentile come hither for hire can you really have believed that i the solemnly betrothed to yonder prince of princes joshua my uncle would for a moment even in my heart have preferred to him such a man as that and once again she looked at oliver who made a wild motion as though he were about to speak but before he could so much as open his lips maqueda went on  well if you believed not guessing all the while i was working for the safety of my people soon shall you be undeceived since tomorrow night i invite you to the great ceremony of my nuptials when according to the ancient custom i break the glass with him whom on the following night i take to be my husband and rising she bowed thrice to the audience then stretched out her hand to joshua  he too rose puffing himself out like a great turkeycock and taking her hand kissed it gobbling some words which we did not catch  wild cheering followed and in the momentary silence which followed oliver spoke  lady he said in a cold and bitter voice we gentiles have heard your words we thank you for your kind acknowledgment of our services namely the destruction of the idol of the fung at the cost of some risk and labour to ourselves we thank you also for your generosity in allowing us as the reward of that service to depart from mur with insult and hard words and such goods as remain to us instead of consigning us to death by torture as you and your council have the power to do it is indeed a proof of your generosity and of that of the abati people which we shall always remember and repeat in our own land should we live to reach it also we trust that it will come to the ears of the savage fung so that at length they may understand that true nobility and greatness lie not in brutal deeds of arms but in the hearts of men but now walda nagasta i have a last request to make of you namely that i may see your face once more to be sure that it is you who have spoken to us and not another beneath your veil and that if this be so i may carry away with me a faithful picture of one so true to her country and noble to her guests as you have shown yourself this day  she listened then very slowly lifted her veil revealing such a countenance as i had never seen before it was maqueda without a doubt but maqueda changed her face was pale which was only to be expected after all she had gone through her eyes glowed in it like coals her lips were set but it was her expression at once defiant and agonized which impressed me so much that i never shall forget it i confess i could not read it in the least but it left upon my mind the belief that she was a false woman and yet ashamed of her own falsity there was the greatest triumph of her art that in those terrible circumstances she should still have succeeded in conveying to me and to the hundreds of others who watched this conviction of her own turpitude  for a moment her eyes met those of orme but although he searched them with pleading and despair in his glance i could trace in hers no relenting sign but only challenge not unmixed with mockery then with a short hard laugh she let fall her veil again and turned to talk with joshua oliver stood silent a little while long enough for higgs to whisper to me  i say isnt this downright awful id rather be back in the den of lions than live to see it  as he spoke i saw oliver put his hand to where his revolver usually hung but of course it had been taken from him next he began to search in his pocket and finding that tabloid of poison which i had given him lifted it toward his mouth but just as it touched his lips my son who was next to him saw also with a quick motion he struck it from his fingers and ground it to powder on the floor beneath his heel  oliver raised his arm as though to hit him then without a sound fell senseless evidently maqueda noted all this also for i saw a kind of quiver go through her and her hands gripped the arms of her chair till the knuckles showed white beneath the skin but she only said  this gentile has fainted because he is disappointed with his reward take him hence and let his companion the doctor adams attend to him when he is recovered conduct them all from mur as i have decreed see that they go unharmed taking with them plenty of food lest it be said that we only spared their lives here in order that they might starve without our gates  then waving her hand to show that the matter was done with she rose and followed by the judges and officers left the court by some door behind them  while she spoke a strong body of guards had surrounded us some of whom came forward and lifted the senseless oliver on to a stretcher they carried him down the court the rest of us following  look jeered the abati as he passed look at the gentile pig who thought to wear the bud of the rose upon his bosom he has got the thorn now not the rose is the swine dead think you  thus they mocked him and us  we reached our prison in safety and there i set to work to revive oliver a task in which i succeeded at length when he had come to himself again he drank a cup of water and said quite quietly  you fellows have seen all so there is no need for talk and explanations one thing i beg of you if you are any friends of mine and it is that you will not reproach or even speak of maqueda to me doubtless she had reasons for what she did moreover her bringing up has not been the same as ours and her code is different do not let us judge her i have been a great fool that is all and now i am paying for my folly or rather i have paid come let us have some dinner for we dont know when we shall get another meal  we listened to this speech in silence only i saw roderick turn aside to hide a smile and wondered why he smiled  scarcely had we finished eating or pretending to eat when an officer entered the room and informed us roughly that it was time for us to be going as he did so some attendants who had followed him threw us bundles of clothes and with them four very beautiful camelhair cloaks to protect us from the cold with some of these garments we replaced our rags for they were little more tying them and the rest of the outfit up into bundles  then clothed as abati of the upper class we were taken to the gates of the barrack where we found a long train of riding camels waiting for us the moment that i saw these beasts i knew that they were the best in the whole land and of very great value indeed that to which oliver was conducted was maquedas own favourite dromedary which upon state occasions she sometimes rode instead of a horse he recognized it at once poor fellow and coloured to the eyes at this unexpected mark of kindness the only one she had vouchsafed to him  come gentiles said the officer and take count of your goods that you may not say that we have stolen anything from you here are your firearms and all the ammunition that is left these will be given to you at the foot of the pass but not before lest you should do more murder on the road on those camels are fastened the boxes in which you brought up the magic fire we found them in your quarters in the cave city ready packed but what they contain we neither know nor care full or empty take them they are yours those and he pointed to two other beasts are laden with your pay which the child of kings sends to you requesting that you will not count it till you reach egypt or your own land since she wishes no quarrelling with you as to the amount the rest carry food for you to eat also there are two spare beasts now mount and begone  so we climbed into the embroidered saddles of the kneeling dromedaries and a few minutes later were riding through mur toward the pass accompanied by our guard and hooting mobs that once or twice became threatening but were driven off by the soldiers  i say doctor said higgs to me excitedly do you know that we have got all the best of the treasure of the tomb of kings in those fiveandtwenty crates i have thought since that i was crazy when i packed them picking out the most valuable and rare articles with such care and filling in the cracks with ring money and small curiosities but now i see it was the inspiration of genius my subliminal self knew what was going to happen and was on the job thats all oh if only we can get it safe away i shall not have played daniel and been nearly starved to death for nothing why id go through it all again for that golden head alone shove on shove on before they change their minds it seems too good to be true  just then a rotten egg thrown by some sweet abati youth landed full on the bridge of his nose and dispersing itself into his mouth and over his smoked spectacles cut short the professors eloquence or rather changed its tenor so absurd was the sight that in spite of myself i burst out laughing and with that laugh felt my heart grow lighter as though our clouds of trouble were lifting at length  at the mouth of the pass we found joshua himself waiting for us clad in all his finery and chain armour and looking more like a porpoise on horseback than he had ever done  farewell gentiles he said bowing to us in mockery we wish you a quick journey to sheol or wherever such swine as you may go listen you orme i have a message for you from the walda nagasta it is that she is sorry she could not ask you to stop for her nuptial feast which she would have done had she not been sure that if you stayed the people would have cut your throat and she did not wish the holy soil of mur to be defiled with your dogs blood also she bids me say that she hopes that your stay here will have taught you a lesson and that in future you will not believe that every woman who makes use of you for her own ends is therefore a victim of your charms tomorrow night and the night after i pray you think of our happiness and drink a cup of wine to the walda nagasta and her husband come will you not wish me joy o gentile  orme turned white as a sheet and gazed at him steadily then a strange look came into his grey eyes almost a look of inspiration  prince joshua he said in a very quiet voice who knows what may happen before the sun rises thrice on mur all things that begin well do not end well as i have learned and as you also may live to learn at least soon or late your day of reckoning must come and you too may be betrayed as i have been rather should you ask me to forgive your soul the insults that in your hour of triumph you have not been ashamed to heap upon one who is powerless to avenge them and he urged his camel past him  as we followed i saw joshuas face turn as pale as olivers had done and his great round eyes protrude themselves like those of a fish  what does he mean said the prince to his companions pray god he is not a prophet of evil even now i have a mindno let him go to break my marriage vow might bring bad luck upon me let him go and he glared after oliver with fear and hatred written on his coarse features  that was the last we ever saw of joshua uncle of maqueda and first prince among the abati    down the pass we went and through the various gates of the fortifications which were thrown open as we came and closed behind us we did not linger on that journey why should we when our guards were anxious to be rid of us and we of them indeed so soon as the last gate was behind us either from fear of the fung or because they were in a hurry to return to share in the festivities of the approaching marriage suddenly the abati wheeled round bade us farewell with a parting curse and left us to our own devices  so having roped the camels into a long line we went on alone truly thankful to be rid of them and praying every one of us that never in this world or the next might we see the face or hear the voice of another abati  we emerged on to the plain at the spot where months before we had held our conference with barung sultan of the fung and where poor quick had forced his camel on to joshuas horse and dismounted that hero here we paused awhile to arrange our little caravan and arm ourselves with the rifles revolvers and cartridges which until now we had not been allowed to touch  there were but four of us to manage the long train of camels so we were obliged to separate higgs and i went ahead since i was best acquainted with the desert and the road oliver took the central station and roderick brought up the rear because he was very keen of sight and hearing and from his long familiarity with them knew how to drive camels that showed signs of obstinacy or a wish to turn  on our right lay the great city of harmac we noted that it seemed to be quite deserted there rebuilt now frowned the gateway through which we had escaped from the fung after we had blown so many of them to pieces but beneath it none passed in or out the town was empty and although they were dead ripe the rich crops had not yet been reaped apparently the fung people had now left the land  now we were opposite to the valley of harmac and saw that the huge sphinx still sat there as it had done for unknown thousands of years only its head was gone for that had moved to mur and in its neck and shoulders appeared great clefts caused by the terrific force of the explosion moreover no sound came from the enclosures where the sacred lions used to be doubtless every one of them was dead  dont you think suggested higgs whose archæological zeal was rekindling fast that we might spare halfanhour to go up the valley and have a look at harmac from the outside of course both roderick and i are thoroughly acquainted with his inside and the den of lions and so forth but i would give a great deal just to study the rest of him and take a few measurements you know one must camp somewhere and if we cant find the camera at dawn one might make a sketch  are you mad i asked by way of answer and higgs collapsed but to this hour he has never forgiven me  we looked our last upon harmac the god whose glory we had destroyed and went on swiftly till darkness overtook us almost opposite to that ruined village where shadrach had tried to poison the hound pharaoh which afterwards tore out his throat here we unloaded the camels no light task and camped for near this spot there was water and a patch of maize on which the beasts could feed  before the light quite faded roderick rode forward for a little way to reconnoitre and presently returned announcing shortly that he had seen no one so we ate of the food with which the abati had provided us not without fear lest it should be poisoned and then held a council of war  the question was whether we should take the old road toward egypt or now that the swamps were dry strike up northward by the other route of which shadrach had told us according to the map this should be shorter and higgs advocated it strongly as i discovered afterwards because he thought there might be more archæological remains in that direction  i on the other hand was in favour of following the road we knew which although long and very wearisome was comparatively safe as in that vast desert there were few people to attack us while oliver our captain listened to all we had to say and reserved his opinion  presently however the question was settled for us by roderick who remarked that if we travelled to the north we should probably fall in with the fung i asked what he meant and he replied that when he made his reconnaissance an hour or so before although it was true that he had seen no one not a thousand yards from where we sat he had come across the track of a great army this army from various indications he felt sure was that of barung which had passed there within twelve hours  perhaps my wife with them so i no want to go that way father he added with sincere simplicity  where could they be travelling i asked  dont know he answered but think they go round to attack mur from other side or perhaps to find new land to north  we will stick to the old road said oliver briefly like roderick i have had enough of all the inhabitants of this country now let us rest awhile we need it  about two oclock we were up again and before it was dawn on the following morning we had loaded our camels and were on the road by the first faint light we saw that what roderick had told us was true we were crossing the track of an army of many thousand men who had passed there recently with laden camels and horses moreover those men were fung for we picked up some articles that could have belonged to no other people such as a headdress that had been lost or thrown away and an arrow that had fallen from a quiver  however we saw nothing of them and travelling fast to our great relief by midday reached the river ebur which we crossed without difficulty for it was now low that night we camped in the forestlands beyond having all the afternoon marched up the rising ground at the foot of which ran the river  toward dawn higgs whose turn it was to watch the camels came and woke me  sorry to disturb you old fellow he said but there is a most curious sky effect behind us which i thought you might like to see  i rose and looked in the clear starlight night i could just discern the mighty outline of the mountains of mur above them the firmament was suffused with a strange red glow i formed my own conclusion at once but only said  let us go to tell orme and led the way to where he had lain down under a tree  he was not sleeping indeed i do not think he had closed his eyes all night the night of maquedas marriage on the contrary he was standing on a little knoll staring at the distant mountains and the glow above them  mur is on fire he said solemnly oh my god mur is on fire and turning he walked away  just then roderick joined us  fung got into mur he said and now cut throat of all abati we well out of that but pig joshua have very warm wedding feast because barung hate joshua who try to catch him not fairly which he never forget often talk of it  poor maqueda i said to higgs what will happen to her  i dont know he answered but although once like everybody else i adored that girl really as a matter of justice she deserves all she gets the falsehearted little wretch still it is true he added relenting she gave us very good camels to say nothing of their loads  but i only repeated poor maqueda    that day we made but a short journey since we wished to rest ourselves and fill the camels before plunging into the wilderness and feeling sure that we should not be pursued had no cause to hurry at night we camped in a little hollow by a stream that ran at the foot of a rise as dawn broke we were awakened by the voice of roderick who was on watch calling to us in tones of alarm to get up as we were followed we sprang to our feet seizing our rifles  where are they i asked  there there he said pointing toward the rise behind us  we ran round some intervening bushes and looked to see upon its crest a solitary figure seated on a very tired horse for it panted and its head drooped this figure which was entirely hidden in a long cloak with a hood appeared to be watching our camp just as a spy might do higgs lifted his rifle and fired at it but oliver who was standing by him knocked the barrel up so that the bullet went high saying  dont be a fool if it is only one man theres no need to shoot him and if there are more you will bring them on to us  then the figure urged the weary horse and advanced slowly and i noticed that it was very small a boy i thought to myself who is bringing some message  the rider reached us and slipping from the horse stood still  who are you asked oliver scanning the cloaked form  one who brings a token to you lord was the answer spoken in a low and muffled voice here it is and a hand a very delicate hand was stretched out holding between the fingers a ring  i knew it at once it was shebas ring which maqueda had lent to me in proof of her good faith when i journeyed for help to england this ring it will be remembered we returned to her with much ceremony at our first public audience oliver grew pale at the sight of it  how did you come by this he asked hoarsely is she who alone may wear it dead  yes yes answered the voice a feigned voice as i thought the child of kings whom you knew is dead and having no more need for this ancient symbol of her power she bequeathed it to you whom she remembered kindly at the last  oliver covered his face with his hands and turned away  but went on the speaker slowly the woman maqueda whom once it is said you loved  he dropped his hands and stared  the woman maqueda whom once it is said youlovedstill lives  then the hood slipped back and in the glow of the rising sun we saw the face beneath  it was that of maqueda herself  a silence followed that in its way was almost awful  my lord oliver asked maqueda presently do you accept my offering of queen shebas ring    note by maqueda  once called walda nagasta and takla warda that is child of kings and bud of the rose once also by birth ruler of the abati people the sons of solomon and sheba  i maqueda write this by the command of oliver my lord who desires that i should set out certain things in my own words  truly all men are fools and the greatest of them is oliver my lord though perhaps he is almost equalled by the learned man whom the abati called black windows and by the doctor son of adam only he who is named roderick child of adam is somewhat less blind because having been brought up among the fung and other people of the desert he has gathered a little wisdom this i know because he has told me that he alone saw through my plan to save all their lives but said nothing of it because he desired to escape from mur where certain death waited on him and his companions perhaps however he lies to please me  now for the truth of the matter which not being skilled in writing i will tell briefly  i was carried out of the cave city with my lord and the others starving starving too weak to kill myself which otherwise i would have done rather than fall into the hands of my accursed uncle joshua yet i was stronger than the rest because as i have learned they tricked me about those biscuits pretending to eat when they were not eating for which never will i forgive them it was japhet a gallant man on one side but a coward on the other like the rest of the abati who betrayed us driven thereto by emptiness within which after all is an ill enemy to fight he went out and told joshua where we lay hid and then of course they came  well they took away my lord and the others and me too they bore to another place and fed me till my strength returned and oh how good was that honey which first i ate for i could touch nothing else when i was strong again came prince joshua to me and said now i have you in my net now you are mine  then i answered joshua fool your net is of air i will fly through it  how he asked by death i answered of which a hundred means lie to my hand you have robbed me of one but what does that matter when so many remain i will go where you and your love cannot pursue me  very well child of kings he said but how about that tall gentile who has caught your eyes and his companions they too have recovered and they shall die every one of them after a certain fashion which i maqueda will not set down since there are some things that ought not to be written if you die they die as i told you they die as a wolf dies that is caught by the shepherds they die as a baboon dies that is caught by the husbandman  now i looked this way and that and found that there was no escape so i made a bargain  joshua i said let these men go and i swear upon the name of our mother she of sheba that i will marry you keep them and kill them and you will have none of me  well in the end because he desired me and the power that went with me he consented  then i played my part my lord and his companions were brought before me and in presence of all the people i mocked them i spat in their faces and oh fools fools fools they believed me i lifted my veil and showed them my eyes and they believed also what they seemed to see in my eyes forgetting that i am a woman who can play a part at need yes they forgot that there were others to deceive as well all the abati people who if they thought i tricked them would have torn the foreigners limb from limb that was my bitterest morsel that i should have succeeded in making even my own lord believe that of all the wicked women that ever trod this world i was the most vile yet i did so and he cannot deny it for often we have talked of this thing till he will hear of it no more  well they went with all that i could give them though i knew well that my lord cared nothing for what i could give nor the doctor child of adam either who cared only for his son that god had restored to him only black windows cared not because he loves wealth but because he worships all that is old and ugly for of such things he fashions up his god  they went for their going was reported to me and i i entered into hell because i knew that my lord thought me false and that he would never learn the truth namely that what i did i did to save his life until at length he came to his own country if ever he came there and opened the chests of treasure if ever he opened them which perhaps he would not care to do and all that while he would believe me the wife of joshua andoh i cannot write of it and i i should be dead i i could not tell him the truth until he joined me in that land of death if there men and women can talk together any more  for this and no other was the road that i had planned to walk when he and his companions had gone so far that they could not be followed then i would tell joshua and the abati all the truth in such language as should never be forgotten for generations and kill myself before their eyes so that joshua might lack a wife and the abati a child of kings  i sat through the feast of preparation and smiled and smiled it passed and the next day passed and came the night of the feast of marriage the glass was broken the ceremony was fulfilled joshua rose up to pledge me before all the priests lords and headmen he devoured me with his hateful eyes me who was already his but i i handled the knife in my robe wishing such was the rage in my heart that i could kill him also  then god spoke and the dream that i had dreamed came true far away there rose a single cry and after it other cries and the sounds of shouting and of marching feet far away tongues of fire leapt into the air and each man asked his neighbour what is this then from all the thousands of the feasting people rose one giant scream and that scream said fung fung the fung are on us fly fly fly  come shouted joshua seizing me by the arm but i drew my dagger on him and he let go then he fled with the other lords and i remained in my high seat beneath the golden canopy alone  the people fled past me without fighting they fled into the cave city they fled to the rocks they hid themselves among the precipices and after them came the fung slaying and burning till all mur went up in flames and i i sat and watched waiting till it was time for me to die also  at last i know not how long afterwards appeared before me barung a red sword in his hand which he lifted to me in salute  greeting child of kings he said you see harmac is come to sleep at mur  yes i answered harmac is come to sleep at mur and many of those who dwelt there sleep with him what of it say barung will you kill me or shall i kill myself  neither child of kings he answered in his high fashion did i not make you a promise yonder in the pass of mur when i spoke with you and the western men and does a fung sultan break his word i have taken back the city that was ours as i swore to do and purified it with fire and he pointed to the raging flames now i will rebuild it and you shall rule under me  not so i answered but in place of that promise i ask of you three things  name them said barung  they are these first that you give me a good horse and five days food and let me go where i will secondly that if he still lives you advance one japhet a certain mountaineer who befriended me and brought others to do likewise to a place of honour under you thirdly that you spare the rest of the abati people  you shall go whither you desire and i think i know where you will go answered barung certain spies of mine last night saw four white men riding on fine camels towards egypt and reported it to me as i led my army to the secret pass that harmac showed me which you abati could never find but i said let them go it is right that brave men who have been the mock of the abati should be allowed their freedom yes i said this although one of them was my daughters husband or near to it but she will have no more of him who fled to his father rather than with her so it was best that he should go also since if i brought him back it must be to his death  yes i answered boldly i go after the western men i who have done with these abati i wish to see new lands  and find an old love who thinks ill of you just now he said stroking his beard well no wonder for here has been a marriage feast say what were you about to do o child of kings take the fat joshua to your breast  nay barung i was about to take this husband to my breast and i showed him the knife that was hidden in my marriage robe  no he said smiling i think the knife was for joshua first still you are a brave woman who could save the life of him you love at the cost of your own yet bethink you child of kings for many a generation your mothers have been queens and under me you may still remain a queen how will one whose blood has ruled so long endure to serve a western man in a strange land  that is what i go to find out barung and if i cannot endure then i shall come back again though not to rule the abati of whom i wash my hands for ever yet barung my heart tells me i shall endure  the child of kings has spoken he said bowing to me my best horse awaits her and five of my bravest guards shall ride with her to keep her safe till she sights the camp of the western men i say happy is he of them who was born to wear the sweetscented bud of the rose upon his bosom for the rest the man japhet is in my hands he yielded himself to me who would not fight for his own people because of what they had done to his friends the white men lastly already i have given orders that the slaying should cease since i need the abati to be my slaves they who are cowards but cunning in many arts only one more man shall die he added sternly and that is joshua who would have taken me by a trick in the mouth of the pass so plead not for him for by the head of harmac it is in vain  now hearing this i did not plead fearing lest i should anger barung and but waste my breath    at daybreak i started on the horse having with me the five fung captains as we crossed the marketplace i met those that remained alive of the abati being driven in hordes like beasts to hear their doom among them was prince joshua my uncle whom a man led by a rope about his neck while another man thrust him forward from behind since joshua knew that he went to his death and the road was one which he did not wish to travel he saw me and cast himself down upon the ground crying to me to save him i told him that i could not though it is the truth i swear it before god that notwithstanding all the evil he had worked toward me toward oliver my lord and his companions bringing to his end that gallant man who died to protect me i would still have saved him if i could but i could not for although i tried once more barung would not listen so i answered  plead o joshua with him who has the power in mur today for i have none you have fashioned your own fate and must travel the road you chose  what road do you ride mounted on a horse of the plains maqueda oh what need is there for me to ask you go to see that accursed gentile whom i would i had killed by inches as i would that i could kill you  then calling me by evil names joshua sprang at me as though to strike me down but he who held the rope about his neck jerked him backward so that he fell and i saw his face no more  but oh it was sad that journey across the great square for the captive abati by hundredsmen women and children togetherwith tears and lamentations cried to me to preserve them from death or slavery at the hands of the fung but i answered  your sins against me and the brave foreign men who fought so well for you i forgive but search your hearts o abati and say if you can forgive yourselves if you had listened to me and to those whom i called in to help us you might have beaten back the fung and remained free for ever but you were cowards you would not learn to bear arms like men you would not even watch your mountain walls and soon or late the people who refuse to be ready to fight must fall and become the servants of those who are ready  and now my oliver i have no more
