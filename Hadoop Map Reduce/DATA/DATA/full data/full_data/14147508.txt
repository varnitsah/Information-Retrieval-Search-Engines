14147508	poems 1817  by  john keats        what more felicity can fall to creature than to enjoy delight with liberty  fate of the butterflyspenser     dedication  to leigh hunt esq  glory and loveliness have passed away   for if we wander out in early morn   no wreathed incense do we see upborne into the east to meet the smiling day no crowd of nymphs soft voicd and young and gay   in woven baskets bringing ears of corn   roses and pinks and violets to adorn the shrine of flora in her early may but there are left delights as high as these   and i shall ever bless my destiny that in a time when under pleasant trees   pan is no longer sought i feel a free a leafy luxury seeing i could please   with these poor offerings a man like thee    the short pieces in the middle of the book as well as some of the sonnets were written at an earlier period than the rest of the poems     poems    places of nestling green for poets made                                  story of rimini    i stood tiptoe upon a little hill the air was cooling and so very still that the sweet buds which with a modest pride pull droopingly in slanting curve aside their scantly leaved and finely tapering stems had not yet lost those starry diadems caught from the early sobbing of the morn the clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn and fresh from the clear brook sweetly they slept on the blue fields of heaven and then there crept a little noiseless noise among the leaves born of the very sigh that silence heaves for not the faintest motion could be seen of all the shades that slanted oer the green there was wide wandring for the greediest eye to peer about upon variety far round the horizons crystal air to skim and trace the dwindled edgings of its brim to picture out the quaint and curious bending of a fresh woodland alley never ending or by the bowery clefts and leafy shelves guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves i gazed awhile and felt as light and free as though the fanning wings of mercury had played upon my heels i was lighthearted and many pleasures to my vision started so i straightway began to pluck a posey of luxuries bright milky soft and rosy  a bush of may flowers with the bees about them ah sure no tasteful nook would be without them and let a lush laburnum oversweep them and let long grass grow round the roots to keep them moist cool and green and shade the violets that they may bind the moss in leafy nets  a filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined and clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind upon their summer thrones there too should be the frequent chequer of a youngling tree that with a score of light green brethen shoots from the quaint mossiness of aged roots round which is heard a springhead of clear waters babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters the spreading blue bells it may haply mourn that such fair clusters should be rudely torn from their fresh beds and scattered thoughtlessly by infant hands left on the path to die  open afresh your round of starry folds ye ardent marigolds dry up the moisture from your golden lids for great apollo bids that in these days your praises should be sung on many harps which he has lately strung and when again your dewiness he kisses tell him i have you in my world of blisses so haply when i rove in some far vale his mighty voice may come upon the gale  here are sweet peas on tiptoe for a flight with wings of gentle flush oer delicate white and taper fulgent catching at all things to bind them all about with tiny rings  linger awhile upon some bending planks that lean against a streamlets rushy banks and watch intently natures gentle doings they will be found softer than ringdoves cooings how silent comes the water round that bend not the minutest whisper does it send to the oerhanging sallows blades of grass slowly across the chequerd shadows pass why you might read two sonnets ere they reach to where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach a natural sermon oer their pebbly beds where swarms of minnows show their little heads staying their wavy bodies gainst the streams to taste the luxury of sunny beams temperd with coolness how they ever wrestle with their own sweet delight and ever nestle their silver bellies on the pebbly sand if you but scantily hold out the hand that very instant not one will remain but turn your eye and they are there again the ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses and cool themselves among the emrald tresses the while they cool themselves they freshness give and moisture that the bowery green may live so keeping up an interchange of favours like good men in the truth of their behaviours sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop from low hung branches little space they stop but sip and twitter and their feathers sleek then off at once as in a wanton freak or perhaps to show their black and golden wings pausing upon their yellow flutterings were i in such a place i sure should pray that nought less sweet might call my thoughts away than the soft rustle of a maidens gown fanning away the dandelions down than the light music of her nimble toes patting against the sorrel as she goes how she would start and blush thus to be caught playing in all her innocence of thought o let me lead her gently oer the brook watch her halfsmiling lips and downward look o let me for one moment touch her wrist let me one moment to her breathing list and as she leaves me may she often turn her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne what next a tuft of evening primroses oer which the mind may hover till it dozes oer which it well might take a pleasant sleep but that tis ever startled by the leap of buds into ripe flowers or by the flitting of diverse moths that aye their rest are quitting or by the moon lifting her silver rim above a cloud and with a gradual swim coming into the blue with all her light o maker of sweet poets dear delight of this fair world and all its gentle livers spangler of clouds halo of crystal rivers mingler with leaves and dew and tumbling streams closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams lover of loneliness and wandering of upcast eye and tender pondering thee must i praise above all other glories that smile us on to tell delightful stories for what has made the sage or poet write but the fair paradise of natures light in the calm grandeur of a sober line we see the waving of the mountain pine and when a tale is beautifully staid we feel the safety of a hawthorn glade when it is moving on luxurious wings the soul is lost in pleasant smotherings fair dewy roses brush against our faces and flowering laurels spring from diamond vases oer head we see the jasmine and sweet briar and bloomy grapes laughing from green attire while at our feet the voice of crystal bubbles charms us at once away from all our troubles so that we feel uplifted from the world walking upon the white clouds wreathd and curld so felt he who first told how psyche went on the smooth wind to realms of wonderment what psyche felt and love when their full lips first touchd what amorous and fondling nips they gave each others cheeks with all their sighs and how they kist each others tremulous eyes the silver lampthe ravishmentthe wonder the darknesslonelinessthe fearful thunder their woes gone by and both to heaven upflown to bow for gratitude before joves throne so did he feel who pulld the boughs aside that we might look into a forest wide to catch a glimpse of fawns and dryades coming with softest rustle through the trees and garlands woven of flowers wild and sweet upheld on ivory wrists or sporting feet telling us how fair trembling syrinx fled arcadian pan with such a fearful dread poor nymphpoor panhow he did weep to find nought but a lovely sighing of the wind along the reedy stream a half heard strain full of sweet desolationbalmy pain  what first inspired a bard of old to sing narcissus pining oer the untainted spring in some delicious ramble he had found a little space with boughs all woven round and in the midst of all a clearer pool than eer reflected in its pleasant cool the blue sky here and there serenely peeping through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping and on the bank a lonely flower he spied a meek and forlorn flower with naught of pride drooping its beauty oer the watery clearness to woo its own sad image into nearness deaf to light zephyrus it would not move but still would seem to droop to pine to love so while the poet stood in this sweet spot some fainter gleamings oer his fancy shot nor was it long ere he had told the tale of young narcissus and sad echos bale  where had he been from whose warm head outflew that sweetest of all songs that ever new that aye refreshing pure deliciousness coming ever to bless the wanderer by moonlight to him bringing shapes from the invisible world unearthly singing from out the middle air from flowery nests and from the pillowy silkiness that rests full in the speculation of the stars ah surely he had burst our mortal bars into some wondrous region he had gone to search for thee divine endymion  he was a poet sure a lover too who stood on latmus top what time there blew soft breezes from the myrtle vale below and brought in faintness solemn sweet and slow a hymn from dians temple while upswelling the incense went to her own starry dwelling but though her face was clear as infants eyes though she stood smiling oer the sacrifice the poet wept at her so piteous fate wept that such beauty should be desolate so in fine wrath some golden sounds he won and gave meek cynthia her endymion  queen of the wide air thou most lovely queen of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen as thou exceedest all things in thy shine so every tale does this sweet tale of thine o for three words of honey that i might tell but one wonder of thy bridal night  where distant ships do seem to show their keels phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels and turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize the evening weather was so bright and clear that men of health were of unusual cheer stepping like homer at the trumpets call or young apollo on the pedestal and lovely women were as fair and warm as venus looking sideways in alarm the breezes were ethereal and pure and crept through half closed lattices to cure the languid sick it coold their feverd sleep and soothed them into slumbers full and deep soon they awoke clear eyed nor burnt with thirsting nor with hot fingers nor with temples bursting and springing up they met the wondring sight of their dear friends nigh foolish with delight who feel their arms and breasts and kiss and stare and on their placid foreheads part the hair young men and maidens at each other gazd with hands held back and motionless amazd to see the brightness in each others eyes and so they stood filld with a sweet surprise until their tongues were loosd in poesy therefore no lover did of anguish die but the soft numbers in that moment spoken made silken ties that never may be broken cynthia i cannot tell the greater blisses that followd thine and thy dear shepherds kisses was there a poet bornbut now no more my wandring spirit must no further soar     specimen of an induction to a poem   lo i must tell a tale of chivalry for large white plumes are dancing in mine eye not like the formal crest of latter days but bending in a thousand graceful ways so graceful that it seems no mortal hand or een the touch of archimagos wand could charm them into such an attitude we must think rather that in playful mood some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight to show this wonder of its gentle might lo i must tell a tale of chivalry for while i muse the lance points slantingly athwart the morning air some lady sweet who cannot feel for cold her tender feet from the worn top of some old battlement hails it with tears her stout defender sent and from her own pure self no joy dissembling wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling sometimes when the good knight his rest would take it is reflected clearly in a lake with the young ashen boughs gainst which it rests and th half seen mossiness of linnets nests ah shall i ever tell its cruelty when the fire flashes from a warriors eye and his tremendous hand is grasping it and his dark brow for very wrath is knit or when his spirit with more calm intent leaps to the honors of a tournament and makes the gazers round about the ring stare at the grandeur of the balancing no no this is far offthen how shall i revive the dying tones of minstrelsy which linger yet about lone gothic arches in dark green ivy and among wild larches how sing the splendour of the revelries when buts of wine are drunk off to the lees and that bright lance against the fretted wall beneath the shade of stately banneral is slung with shining cuirass sword and shield where ye may see a spur in bloody field lightfooted damsels move with gentle paces round the wide hall and show their happy faces or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens yet must i tell a tale of chivalry or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight rein in the swelling of his ample might  spenser thy brows are arched open kind and come like a clear sunrise to my mind and always does my heart with pleasure dance when i think on thy noble countenance where never yet was ought more earthly seen than the pure freshness of thy laurels green therefore great bard i not so fearfully call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh my daring steps or if thy tender care thus startled unaware be jealous that the foot of other wight should madly follow that bright path of light tracd by thy lovd libertas he will speak and tell thee that my prayer is very meek that i will follow with due reverence and start with awe at mine own strange pretence him thou wilt hear so i will rest in hope to see wide plains fair trees and lawny slope the morn the eve the light the shade the flowers clear streams smooth lakes and overlooking towers     calidore  a fragment   young calidore is paddling oer the lake his healthful spirit eager and awake to feel the beauty of a silent eve which seemd full loath this happy world to leave the light dwelt oer the scene so lingeringly he bares his forehead to the cool blue sky and smiles at the far clearness all around until his heart is well nigh over wound and turns for calmness to the pleasant green of easy slopes and shadowy trees that lean so elegantly oer the waters brim and show their blossoms trim scarce can his clear and nimble eyesight follow the freaks and dartings of the blackwingd swallow delighting much to see it half at rest dip so refreshingly its wings and breast gainst the smooth surface and to mark anon the widening circles into nothing gone  and now the sharp keel of his little boat comes up with ripple and with easy float and glides into a bed of water lillies broad leavd are they and their white canopies are upward turnd to catch the heavens dew near to a little islands point they grew whence calidore might have the goodliest view of this sweet spot of earth the bowery shore went off in gentle windings to the hoar and light blue mountains but no breathing man with a warm heart and eye prepared to scan natures clear beauty could pass lightly by objects that lookd out so invitingly on either side these gentle calidore greeted as he had known them long before  the sidelong view of swelling leafiness which the glad setting sun in gold doth dress whence ever and anon the jay outsprings and scales upon the beauty of its wings  the lonely turret shatterd and outworn stands venerably proud too proud to mourn its long lost grandeur fir trees grow around aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground  the little chapel with the cross above upholding wreaths of ivy the white dove that on the windows spreads his feathers light and seems from purple clouds to wing its flight  green tufted islands casting their soft shades across the lake sequesterd leafy glades that through the dimness of their twilight show large dock leaves spiral foxgloves or the glow of the wild cats eyes or the silvery stems of delicate birch trees or long grass which hems a little brook the youth had long been viewing these pleasant things and heaven was bedewing the mountain flowers when his glad senses caught a trumpets silver voice ah it was fraught with many joys for him the warders ken had found white coursers prancing in the glen friends very dear to him he soon will see so pushes off his boat most eagerly and soon upon the lake he skims along deaf to the nightingales first undersong nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly his spirit flies before him so completely  and now he turns a jutting point of land whence may be seen the castle gloomy and grand nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches before the point of his light shallop reaches those marble steps that through the water dip now over them he goes with hasty trip and scarcely stays to ope the folding doors anon he leaps along the oaken floors of halls and corridors  delicious sounds those little brighteyed things that float about the air on azure wings had been less heartfelt by him than the clang of clattering hoofs into the court he sprang just as two noble steeds and palfreys twain were slanting out their necks with loosened rein while from beneath the threatning portcullis they brought their happy burthens what a kiss what gentle squeeze he gave each ladys hand how tremblingly their delicate ancles spannd into how sweet a trance his soul was gone while whisperings of affection made him delay to let their tender feet come to the earth with an incline so sweet from their low palfreys oer his neck they bent and whether there were tears of languishment or that the evening dew had pearld their tresses he feels a moisture on his cheek and blesses with lips that tremble and with glistening eye all the soft luxury that nestled in his arms a dimpled hand fair as some wonder out of fairy land hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers of whitest cassia fresh from summer showers and this he fondled with his happy cheek as if for joy he would no further seek when the kind voice of good sir clerimond came to his ear like something from beyond his present being so he gently drew his warm arms thrilling now with pulses new from their sweet thrall and forward gently bending thankd heaven that his joy was never ending while gainst his forehead he devoutly pressd a hand heaven made to succour the distressd a hand that from the worlds bleak promontory had lifted calidore for deeds of glory  amid the pages and the torches glare there stood a knight patting the flowing hair of his proud horses mane he was withal a man of elegance and stature tall so that the waving of his plumes would be high as the berries of a wild ash tree or as the winged cap of mercury his armour was so dexterously wrought in shape that sure no living man had thought it hard and heavy steel but that indeed it was some glorious form some splendid weed in which a spirit new come from the skies might live and show itself to human eyes tis the farfamd the brave sir gondibert said the good man to calidore alert while the young warrior with a step of grace came upa courtly smile upon his face and mailed hand held out ready to greet the largeeyed wonder and ambitious heat of the aspiring boy who as he led those smiling ladies often turned his head to admire the visor arched so gracefully over a knightly brow while they went by the lamps that from the highroofd hall were pendent and gave the steel a shining quite transcendent  soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated the sweetlippd ladies have already greeted all the green leaves that round the window clamber to show their purple stars and bells of amber sir gondibert has doffd his shining steel gladdening in the free and airy feel of a light mantle and while clerimond is looking round about him with a fond and placid eye young calidore is burning to hear of knightly deeds and gallant spurning of all unworthiness and how the strong of arm kept off dismay and terror and alarm from lovely woman while brimful of this he gave each damsels hand so warm a kiss and had such manly ardour in his eye that each at other lookd half staringly and then their features started into smiles sweet as blue heavens oer enchanted isles  softly the breezes from the forest came softly they blew aside the tapers flame clear was the song from philomels far bower grateful the incense from the limetree flower mysterious wild the far heard trumpets tone lovely the moon in ether all alone sweet too the converse of these happy mortals as that of busy spirits when the portals are closing in the west or that soft humming we hear around when hesperus is coming sweet be their sleep              to some ladies   what though while the wonders of nature exploring   i cannot your light mazy footsteps attend nor listen to accents that almost adoring   bless cynthias face the enthusiasts friend  yet over the steep whence the mountain stream rushes   with you kindest friends in idea i rove mark the clear tumbling crystal its passionate gushes   its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews  why linger you so the wild labyrinth strolling   why breathless unable your bliss to declare ah you list to the nightingales tender condoling   responsive to sylphs in the moon beamy air  tis morn and the flowers with dew are yet drooping   i see you are treading the verge of the sea and now ah i see ityou just now are stooping   to pick up the keepsake intended for me  if a cherub on pinions of silver descending   had brought me a gem from the fretwork of heaven and smiles with his starcheering voice sweetly blending   the blessings of tighe had melodiously given  it had not created a warmer emotion   than the present fair nymphs i was blest with from you than the shell from the bright golden sands of the ocean   which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw  for indeed tis a sweet and peculiar pleasure   and blissful is he who such happiness finds to possess but a span of the hour of leisure   in elegant pure and aerial minds     on receiving a curious shell and a copy of verses from the same ladies   hast thou from the caves of golconda a gem   pure as the icedrop that froze on the mountain bright as the hummingbirds green diadem   when it flutters in sunbeams that shine through a fountain  hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine   that goblet right heavy and massy and gold and splendidly markd with the story divine   of armida the fair and rinaldo the bold  hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing   hast thou a sword that thine enemys smart is hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing   and wearst thou the shield of the famd britomartis  what is it that hangs from thy shoulder so brave   embroidered with many a spring peering flower is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave   and hastest thou now to that fair ladys bower  ah courteous sir knight with large joy thou art crownd   full many the glories that brighten thy youth i will tell thee my blisses which richly abound   in magical powers to bless and to sooth  on this scroll thou seest written in characters fair   a sunbeamy tale of a wreath and a chain and warrior it nurtures the property rare   of charming my mind from the trammels of pain  this canopy mark tis the work of a fay   beneath its rich shade did king oberon languish when lovely titania was far far away   and cruelly left him to sorrow and anguish  there oft would he bring from his soft sighing lute   wild strains to which spellbound the nightingales listened the wondering spirits of heaven were mute   and tears mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened  in this little dome all those melodies strange   soft plaintive and melting for ever will sigh nor eer will the notes from their tenderness change   nor eer will the music of oberon die  so when i am in a voluptuous vein   i pillow my head on the sweets of the rose and list to the tale of the wreath and the chain   till its echoes depart then i sink to repose  adieu valiant eric with joy thou art crownd   full many the glories that brighten thy youth i too have my blisses which richly abound   in magical powers to bless and to sooth     to       hadst thou livd in days of old o what wonders had been told of thy lively countenance and thy humid eyes that dance in the  midst of their own brightness in the very fane of lightness over which thine eyebrows leaning picture out each lovely meaning in a dainty bend they lie like two streaks across the sky or the feathers from a crow fallen on a bed of snow of thy dark hair that extends into many graceful bends as the leaves of hellebore turn to whence they sprung before and behind each ample curl peeps the richness of a pearl downward too flows many a tress with a glossy waviness full and round like globes that rise from the censer to the skies through sunny air add too the sweetness of thy honied voice the neatness of thine ankle lightly turnd with those beauties scarce discrnd kept with such sweet privacy that they seldom meet the eye of the little loves that fly round about with eager pry saving when with freshening lave thou dippst them in the taintless wave like twin water lillies born in the coolness of the morn o if thou hadst breathed then now the muses had been ten couldst thou wish for lineage higher than twin sister of thalia at least for ever evermore will i call the graces four  hadst thou livd when chivalry lifted up her lance on high tell me what thou wouldst have been ah i see the silver sheen of thy broidered floating vest covring half thine ivory breast which o heavens i should see but that cruel destiny has placed a golden cuirass there keeping secret what is fair like sunbeams in a cloudlet nested thy locks in knightly casque are rested oer which bend four milky plumes like the gentle lillys blooms springing from a costly vase see with what a stately pace comes thine alabaster steed servant of heroic deed oer his loins his trappings glow like the northern lights on snow mount his back thy sword unsheath sign of the enchanters death bane of every wicked spell silencer of dragons yell alas thou this wilt never do thou art an enchantress too and wilt surely never spill blood of those whose eyes can kill     to hope   when by my solitary hearth i sit   and hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom when no fair dreams before my minds eye flit   and the bare heath of life presents no bloom     sweet hope ethereal balm upon me shed     and wave thy silver pinions oer my head  wheneer i wander at the fall of night   where woven boughs shut out the moons bright ray should sad despondency my musings fright   and frown to drive fair cheerfulness away     peep with the moonbeams through the leafy roof     and keep that fiend despondence far aloof  should disappointment parent of despair   strive for her son to seize my careless heart when like a cloud he sits upon the air   preparing on his spellbound prey to dart     chace him away sweet hope with visage bright     and fright him as the morning frightens night  wheneer the fate of those i hold most dear   tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow o brighteyed hope my morbid fancy cheer   let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow     thy heavenborn radiance around me shed     and wave thy silver pinions oer my head  should eer unhappy love my bosom pain   from cruel parents or relentless fair o let me think it is not quite in vain   to sigh out sonnets to the midnight air     sweet hope ethereal balm upon me shed     and wave thy silver pinions oer my head  in the long vista of the years to roll   let me not see our countrys honour fade o let me see our land retain her soul   her pride her freedom and not freedoms shade     from thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed     beneath thy pinions canopy my head  let me not see the patriots high bequest   great liberty how great in plain attire with the base purple of a court oppressd   bowing her head and ready to expire     but let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings     that fill the skies with silver glitterings  and as in sparkling majesty a star   gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud brightening the half veild face of heaven afar   so when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud     sweet hope celestial influence round me shed     waving thy silver pinions oer my head  february 1815     imitation of spenser     now morning from her orient chamber came   and her first footsteps touchd a verdant hill   crowning its lawny crest with amber flame   silvring the untainted gushes of its rill   which pure from mossy beds did down distill   and after parting beds of simple flowers   by many streams a little lake did fill   which round its marge reflected woven bowers and in its middle space a sky that never lowers    there the kingfisher saw his plumage bright   vieing with fish of brilliant dye below   whose silken fins and golden scales light   cast upward through the waves a ruby glow   there saw the swan his neck of arched snow   and oard himself along with majesty   sparkled his jetty eyes his feet did show   beneath the waves like africs ebony and on his back a fay reclined voluptuously    ah could i tell the wonders of an isle   that in that fairest lake had placed been   i could een dido of her grief beguile   or rob from aged lear his bitter teen   for sure so fair a place was never seen   of all that ever charmd romantic eye   it seemd an emerald in the silver sheen   of the bright waters or as when on high through clouds of fleecy white laughs the coerulean sky    and all around it dippd luxuriously   slopings of verdure through the glossy tide   which as it were in gentle amity   rippled delighted up the flowery side   as if to glean the ruddy tears it tried   which fell profusely

neck and creamy breast   are things on which the dazzled senses rest till the fond fixed eyes forget they stare from such fine pictures heavens i cannot dare   to turn my admiration though unpossessd   they be of what is worthythough not drest in lovely modesty and virtues rare yet these i leave as thoughtless as a lark   these lures i straight forgeteen ere i dine or thrice my palate moisten but

sun his farewell beam has darted but tis impossible far different cares beckon me sternly from soft lydian airs and hold my faculties so long in thrall that i am oft in doubt whether at all i shall again see phoebus in the morning or flushd aurora in the roseate dawning or a white naiad in a rippling stream or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam or again witness what with thee ive seen the dew by fairy feet swept from the green after a night of some quaint jubilee which every elf and fay had come to see when bright processions took their airy march beneath the curved moons triumphal arch  but might i now each passing moment give to the coy muse with me she would not live in this dark city nor would condescend mid contradictions her delights to lend should eer the fineeyed maid to me be kind ah surely it must be wheneer i find some flowery spot sequesterd wild romantic that often must have seen a poet frantic where oaks that erst the druid knew are growing and flowers the glory of one day are blowing where the darkleavd laburnums drooping clusters reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres and intertwined the cassias arms unite with its own drooping buds but very white where on one side are covert branches hung mong which the nightingales have always sung in leafy quiet where to pry aloof atween the pillars of the sylvan roof would be to find where violet beds were

wonders of the mazy range oer pebbly crystal and oer golden sands kissing thy daily food from naiads pearly hands  november 1815     to my brother george  full many a dreary hour have i past my brain

lightning plays or on the wavy grass outstretchd supinely pry mong the stars to strive to think divinely that i should never hear apollos song though feathery clouds were floating all along the purple west and two bright streaks between the golden lyre itself were dimly seen that the still murmur of the honey bee would never teach a rural song to me that the bright glance from beautys eyelids slanting would never make a lay of mine enchanting or warm my breast with ardour to unfold some tale of love and arms in time of old  but there are times when those that love the bay fly from all sorrowing far far away a sudden glow comes on them nought they see in water earth or air but poesy it has been said dear george and true i hold it for knightly spenser to libertas told it that when a poet is in such a trance in air he sees white coursers paw and prance bestridden of gay knights in gay apparel who at each other tilt in playful quarrel and what we ignorantly sheetlightning call is the swift opening of their wide portal when the bright warder blows his trumpet clear whose tones reach nought on earth but poets ear when these enchanted portals open wide and through the light the horsemen swiftly glide the poets eye can reach those golden halls and view the glory of their festivals their ladies fair that in the distance seem fit for the silvring of a seraphs dream their rich brimmd goblets that incessant run like the bright spots that move about the sun and when upheld the wine from each bright jar pours with the lustre of a falling star yet further off are dimly seen their bowers of which no mortal eye can reach the flowers and tis right just for well apollo knows twould make the poet quarrel with the rose all thats reveald from that far seat of blisses is the clear fountains interchanging kisses as gracefully descending light and thin like silver streaks across a dolphins fin when he upswimmeth from the coral caves and sports with half his tail above the waves  these wonders strange be sees and many more whose head is pregnant with poetic lore should he upon an evening ramble fare with forehead to the soothing breezes bare would he naught see but the dark silent blue with all its diamonds trembling through and through or the coy moon when in the waviness of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress and staidly paces higher up and higher like a sweet nun in holyday attire ah yes much more would start into his sight the revelries and mysteries of night and should i ever see them i will tell you such tales as needs must with amazement spell you  these are the living pleasures of the bard but richer far posteritys award what does he murmur with his latest breath while his proud eye looks through the film of death what though i leave this dull and earthly mould yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold with after timesthe patriot shall feel my stern alarum and unsheath his steel or in the senate thunder out my numbers to startle princes from their easy slumbers the sage will mingle with each moral theme my happy thoughts sententious he will teem with lofty periods when my verses fire him and then ill stoop from heaven to inspire him lays have i left of such a dear delight that maids will sing them on their bridal night gay villagers upon a morn of may when they have tired their gentle limbs with play and formd a snowy circle on the grass and placd in midst of all that lovely lass who chosen is their queenwith her fine head crowned with flowers purple white and red for there the lily and the muskrose sighing are emblems true of hapless lovers dying between her breasts that never yet felt trouble a bunch of violets full blown and double serenely sleepshe from a casket takes a little bookand then a joy awakes about each youthful heartwith stifled cries and rubbing of white hands and sparkling eyes for shes to read a tale of hopes and fears one that i fosterd in my youthful years the pearls that on each glistning circlet sleep gush ever and anon with silent creep lured by the innocent dimples to sweet rest shall the dear babe upon its mothers breast be lulld with songs of mine fair world adieu thy dales and hills are fading from my view swiftly i mount upon wide spreading pinions far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions full joy i feel while thus i cleave the air that my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair and warm thy sons ah my dear friend and brother could i at once my mad ambition smother for tasting joys like these sure i should be happier and dearer to society at times tis true ive felt relief from pain when some bright thought has darted through my brain through all that day ive felt a greater pleasure than if id brought to light a hidden treasure as to my sonnets though none else should heed them i feel delighted still that you should read them of late too i have had much calm enjoyment stretchd on the grass at my best lovd employment of scribbling lines for you these things i thought while in my face the freshest breeze i caught een now im pillowd on a bed of flowers that crowns a lofty clift which proudly towers above the oceanwaves the stalks and blades chequer my tablet with their quivering shades on one side is a field of drooping oats through which the poppies show their scarlet coats so pert and useless that they bring to mind the scarlet coats that pester humankind and on the other side outspread is seen oceans blue mantle streakd with purple and green now tis i see a canvassd ship and now mark the bright silver curling round her prow i see the lark downdropping to his nest and the broad winged seagull never at rest for when no more he spreads his feathers free his breast is dancing on the restless sea now i direct my eyes into the west which at this moment is in sunbeams drest why westward turn twas but to say adieu twas but to kiss my hand dear george to you  august 1816     to charles cowden clarke   oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning and with proud breast his own white shadow crowning he slants his neck beneath the waters bright so silently it seems a beam of light come from the galaxy anon he sports with outspread wings the naiad zephyr courts or ruffles all the surface of the lake in striving from its crystal face to take some diamond water drops and them to treasure in milky nest and sip them off at leisure but not a moment can he there insure them nor to such downy rest can he allure them for down they rush as though they would be free and drop like hours into eternity just like that bird am i in loss of time wheneer i venture on the stream of rhyme with shatterd boat oar snapt and canvass rent i slowly sail scarce knowing my intent still scooping up the water with my fingers in which a trembling diamond never lingers  by this friend charles you may full plainly see why i have never pennd a line to thee because my thoughts were never free and clear and little fit to please a classic ear because my wine was of too poor a savour for one whose palate gladdens in the flavour of sparkling heliconsmall good it were to take him to a desert rude and bare who had on baiaes shore reclind at ease while tassos page was floating in a breeze that gave soft music from armidas bowers mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers small good to one who had by mullas stream fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream who had beheld belphoebe in a brook and lovely una in a leafy nook and archimago leaning oer his book who had of all thats sweet tasted and seen from silvry ripple up to beautys queen from the sequesterd haunts of gay titania to the blue dwelling of divine urania one who of late had taen sweet forest walks with him who elegantly chats and talks the wrongd libert aswho has told you stories of laurel chaplets and apollos glories of troops chivalrous prancing through a city and tearful ladies made for love and pity with many else which i have never known thus have i thought and days on days have flown slowly or rapidlyunwilling still for you to try my dull unlearned quill nor should i now but that ive known you long that you first taught me all the sweets of song the grand the sweet the terse the free the fine what swelld with pathos and what right divine spenserian vowels that elope with ease and float along like birds oer summer seas miltonian storms and more miltonian tenderness michael in arms and more meek eves fair slenderness who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly up to its climax and then dying proudly who found for me the grandeur of the ode growing like atlas stronger from its load who let me taste that more than cordial dram the sharp the rapierpointed epigram shewd me that epic was of all the king round vast and spanning all like saturns ring you too upheld the veil from clios beauty and pointed out the patriots stern duty the might of alfred and the shaft of tell the hand of brutus that so grandly fell upon a tyrants head ah had i never seen or known your kindness what might i have been what my enjoyments in my youthful years bereft of all that now my life endears and can i eer these benefits forget and can i eer repay the friendly debt no doubly noyet should these rhymings please i shall roll on the grass with twofold ease for i have long time been my fancy feeding with hopes that you would one day think the reading of my rough verses not an hour misspent should it eer be so what a rich content some weeks have passd since last i saw the spires in lucent thames reflectedwarm desires to see the sun oer peep the eastern dimness and morning shadows streaking into slimness across the lawny fields and pebbly water to mark the time as they grow broad and shorter to feel the air that plays about the hills and sips its freshness from the little rills to see high golden corn wave in the light when cynthia smiles upon a summers night and peers among the cloudlets jet and white as though she were reclining in a bed of bean blossoms in heaven freshly shed no sooner had i steppd into these pleasures than i began to think of rhymes and measures the air that floated by me seemd to say write thou wilt never have a better day and so i did when many lines id written though with their grace i was not oversmitten yet as my hand was warm i thought id better trust to my feelings and write you a letter such an attempt required an inspiration of a peculiar sorta consummation which had i felt these scribblings might have been verses from which the soul would never wean but many days have past since last my heart was warmd luxuriously by divine mozart by arne delighted or by handel maddend or by the song of erin piercd and saddend what time you were before the music sitting and the rich notes to each sensation fitting since i have walkd with you through shady lanes that freshly terminate in open plains and reveld in a chat that ceased not when at nightfall among your books we got no nor when supper came nor after that nor when reluctantly i took my hat no nor till cordially you shook my hand midway between our homesyour accents bland still sounded in my ears when i no more could hear your footsteps touch the gravly floor sometimes i lost them and then found again you changd the footpath for the grassy plain in those still moments i have wishd you joys that well you know to honourlifes very toys with him said i will take a pleasant charm it cannot be that ought will work him harm these thoughts now come oer me with all their might again i shake your handfriend charles good night  september 1816      sonnets     i to my brother george   many the wonders i this day have seen   the sun when first he kist away the tears   that filld the eyes of mornthe laureld peers who from the feathery gold of evening lean the ocean with its vastness its blue green   its ships its rocks its caves its hopes its fears   its voice mysterious which whoso hears must think on what will be and what has been een now dear george while this for you i write   cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping so scantly that it seems her bridal night   and she her halfdiscoverd revels keeping but what without the social thought of thee would be the wonders of the sky and sea     ii to         had i a mans fair form then might my sighs   be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell   thine ear and find thy gentle heart so well would passion arm me for the enterprize but ah i am no knight whose foeman dies   no cuirass glistens on my bosoms swell   i am no happy shepherd of the dell whose lips have trembled with a maidens eyes yet must i dote upon theecall thee sweet   sweeter by far than hyblas honied roses     when steepd in dew rich to intoxication ah i will taste that dew for me tis meet   and when the moon her pallid face discloses     ill gather some by spells and incantation     iii written on the day that mr leigh hunt left prison   what though for showing truth to flatterd state   kind hunt was shut in prison yet has he   in his immortal spirit been as free as the skysearching lark and as elate minion of grandeur think you he did wait   think you he nought but prison walls did see   till so unwilling thou unturndst the key ah no far happier nobler was his fate in spensers halls he strayed and bowers fair   culling enchanted flowers and he flew with daring milton through the fields of air   to regions of his own his genius true took happy flights who shall his fame impair   when thou art dead and all thy wretched crew     iv   how many bards gild the lapses of time   a few of them have ever been the food   of my delighted fancyi could brood over their beauties earthly or sublime and often when i sit me down to rhyme   these will in throngs before my mind intrude   but no confusion no disturbance rude do they occasion tis a pleasing chime so the unnumberd sounds that evening store   the songs of birdsthe whispring of the leaves the voice of watersthe great bell that heaves   with solemn soundand thousand others more that distance of recognizance bereaves   make pleasing music and not wild uproar     v to a friend who sent me some roses   as late i rambled in the happy fields   what time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew   from his lush clover covertwhen anew adventurous knights take up their dinted shields i saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields   a freshblown muskrose twas the first that threw   its sweets upon the summer graceful it grew as is the wand that queen titania wields and as i feasted on its fragrancy   i thought the gardenrose it far excelld but when o wells thy roses came to me   my sense with their deliciousness was spelld soft voices had they that with tender plea   whisperd of peace and truth and friendliness unquelld     vi to g a w   nymph of the downward smile and sidelong glance   in what diviner moments of the day   art thou most lovely when gone far astray into the labyrinths of sweet utterance or when serenely wandring in a trance   of sober thought or when starting away   with careless robe to meet the morning ray thou sparst the flowers in thy mazy dance haply tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly   and so remain because thou listenest but thou to please wert nurtured so completely   that i can never tell what mood is best i shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly   trips it before apollo than the rest     vii   o solitude if i must with thee dwell   let it not be among the jumbled heap   of murky buildings climb with me the steep natures observatorywhence the dell its flowery slopes its rivers crystal swell   may seem a span let me thy vigils keep   mongst boughs pavilliond where the deers swift leap startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell but though ill gladly trace these scenes with thee   yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind whose words are images of thoughts refind   is my souls pleasure and it sure must be almost the highest bliss of humankind   when to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee     viii to my brothers   small busy flames play through the fresh laid coals   and their faint cracklings oer our silence creep   like whispers of the household gods that keep a gentle empire oer fraternal souls and while for rhymes i search around the poles   your eyes are fixd as in poetic sleep   upon the lore so voluble and deep that aye at fall of night our care condoles this is your birthday tom and i rejoice   that thus it passes smoothly quietly many such eves of gently whispring noise   may we together pass and calmly try what are this worlds true joysere the great voice   from its fair face shall bid our spirits fly  november 18 1816     ix   keen fitful gusts are whispring here and there   among the bushes half leafless and dry   the stars look very cold about the sky and i have many miles on foot to fare yet feel i little of the cool bleak air   or of the dead leaves rustling drearily   or of those silver lamps that burn on high or of the distance from homes pleasant lair for i am brimfull of the friendliness   that in a little cottage i have found of fairhaird miltons eloquent distress   and all his love for gentle lycid drownd of lovely laura in her light green dress   and faithful petrarch gloriously crownd     x   to one who has been long in city pent   tis very sweet to look into the fair   and open face of heavento breathe a prayer full in the smile of the blue firmament who is more happy when with hearts content   fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair   of wavy grass and reads a debonair and gentle tale of love and languishment returning home at evening with an ear   catching the notes of philomelan eye watching the sailing cloudlets bright career   he mourns that day so soon has glided by een like the passage of an angels tear   that falls through the clear ether silently     xi on first looking into chapmans homer   much have i traveled in the realms of gold   and many goodly states and kingdoms seen   round many western islands have i been which bards in fealty to apollo hold oft of one wide expanse had i been told   that deepbrowd homer ruled as his demesne   yet did i never breathe its pure serene till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold then felt i like some watcher of the skies   when a new planet swims into his ken or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes   he stard at the pacificand all his men lookd at each other with a wild surmise   silent upon a peak in darien     xii on leaving some friends at an early hour   give me a golden pen and let me lean   on heapd up flowers in regions clear and far   bring me a tablet whiter than a star or hand of hymning angel when tis seen the silver strings of heavenly harp atween   and let there glide by many a pearly car   pink robes and wavy hair and diamond jar and half discovered wings and glances keen the while let music wander round my ears   and as it reaches each delicious ending     let me write down a line of glorious tone and full of many wonders of the spheres   for what a height my spirit is contending     tis not content so soon to be alone     xiii addressed to haydon   highmindedness a jealousy for good   a lovingkindness for the great mans fame   dwells here and there with people of no name in noisome alley and in pathless wood and where we think the truth least understood   oft may be found a singleness of aim   that ought to frighten into hooded shame a money mongring pitiable brood how glorious this affection for the cause   of stedfast genius toiling gallantly what when a stout unbending champion awes   envy and malice to their native sty unnumberd souls breathe out a still applause   proud to behold him in his countrys eye     xiv addressed to the same   great spirits now on earth are sojourning   he of the cloud the cataract the lake   who on helvellyns summit wide awake catches his freshness from archangels wing he of the rose the violet the spring   the social smile the chain for freedoms sake   and lowhose stedfastness would never take a meaner sound than raphaels whispering and other spirits there are standing apart   upon the forehead of the age to come these these will give the world another heart   and other pulses hear ye not the hum of mighty workings   listen awhile ye nations and be dumb     xv on the grasshopper and cricket   the poetry of earth is never dead   when all the birds are faint with the hot sun   and hide in cooling trees a voice will run from hedge to hedge about the newmown mead that is the grasshoppershe takes the lead   in summer luxuryhe has never done   with his delights for when tired out with fun he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed the poetry of earth is ceasing never   on a lone winter evening when the frost     has wrought a silence from the stove there shrills the crickets song in warmth increasing ever   and seems to one in drowsiness half lost     the grasshoppers among some grassy hills  december 30 1816     xvi to kosciusko   good kosciusko thy great name alone   is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling   it comes upon us like the glorious pealing of the wide spheresan everlasting tone and now it tells me that in worlds unknown   the names of heroes burst from clouds concealing   and changed to harmonies for ever stealing through cloudless blue and round each silver throne it tells me too that on a happy day   when some good spirit walks upon the earth   thy name with alfreds and the great of yore gently commingling gives tremendous birth to a loud hymn that sounds far far away   to where the great god lives for evermore     xvii   happy is england i could be content   to see no other verdure than its own   to feel no other breezes than are blown through its tall woods with high romances blent yet do i sometimes feel a languishment   for skies italian and an inward groan   to sit upon an alp as on a throne and half forget what world or worldling meant happy is england sweet her artless daughters   enough their simple loveliness for me     enough their whitest arms in silence clinging   yet do i often warmly burn to see     beauties of deeper glance and hear their singing and float with them about the summer waters     sleep and poetry   as i lay in my bed slepe full unmete was unto me but why that i ne might rest i ne wist for there nas erthly wight as i suppose had more of hertis ese than i for i nad sicknesse nor disese  chaucer   what is more gentle than a wind in summer what is more soothing than the pretty hummer that stays one moment in an open flower and buzzes cheerily from bower to bower what is more tranquil than a muskrose blowing in a green island far from all mens knowing more healthful than the leafiness of dales more secret than a nest of nightingales more serene than cordelias countenance more full of visions than a high romance what but thee sleep soft closer of our eyes low murmurer of tender lullabies light hoverer around our happy pillows wreather of poppy buds and weeping willows silent entangler of a beautys tresses most happy listener when the morning blesses thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes that glance so brightly at the new sunrise  but what is higher beyond thought than thee fresher than berries of a mountain tree more strange more beautiful more smooth more regal than wings of swans than doves than dimseen eagle what is it and to what shall i compare it it has a glory and nought else can share it the thought thereof is awful sweet and holy chacing away all worldliness and folly coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder or the low rumblings earths regions under and sometimes like a gentle whispering of all the secrets of some wondrous thing that breathes about us in the vacant air so that we look around with prying stare perhaps to see shapes of light aerial lymning and catch soft floatings from a faintheard hymning to see the laurel wreath on high suspended that is to crown our name when life is ended sometimes it gives a glory to the voice and from the heart upsprings rejoice rejoice sounds which will reach the framer of all things and die away in ardent mutterings  no one who once the glorious sun has seen and all the clouds and felt his bosom clean for his great makers presence but must know what tis i mean and feel his being glow therefore no insult will i give his spirit by telling what he sees from native merit  o poesy for thee i hold my pen that am not yet a glorious denizen of thy wide heavenshould i rather kneel upon some mountaintop until i feel a glowing splendour round about me hung and echo back the voice of thine own tongue o poesy for thee i grasp my pen that am not yet a glorious denizen of thy wide heaven yet to my ardent prayer yield from thy sanctuary some clear air smoothed for intoxication by the breath of flowering bays that i may die a death of luxury and my young spirit follow the morning sunbeams to the great apollo like a fresh sacrifice or if i can bear the oerwhelming sweets twill bring to me the fair visions of all places a bowery nook will be elysiuman eternal book whence i may copy many a lovely saying about the leaves and flowersabout the playing of nymphs in woods and fountains and the shade keeping a silence round a sleeping maid and many a verse from so strange influence that we must ever wonder how and whence it came also imaginings will hover round my fireside and haply there discover vistas of solemn beauty where id wander in happy silence like the clear meander through its lone vales and where i found a spot of awfuller shade or an enchanted grot or a green hill oerspread with chequered dress of flowers and fearful from its loveliness write on my tablets all that was permitted all that was for our human senses fitted then the events of this wide world id seize like a strong giant and my spirit teaze till at its shoulders it should proudly see wings to find out an immortality  stop and consider life is but a day a fragile dewdrop on its perilous way from a trees summit a poor indians sleep while his boat hastens to the monstrous steep of montmorenci why so sad a moan life is the roses hope while yet unblown the reading of an everchanging tale the light uplifting of a maidens veil a pigeon tumbling in clear summer air a laughing schoolboy without grief or care riding the springy branches of an elm  o for ten years that i may overwhelm myself in poesy so i may do the deed that my own soul has to itself decreed then will i pass the countries that i see in long perspective and continually taste their pure fountains first the realm ill pass of flora and old pan sleep in the grass feed upon apples red and strawberries and choose each pleasure that my fancy sees catch the whitehanded nymphs in shady places to woo sweet kisses from averted faces play with their fingers touch their shoulders white into a pretty shrinking with a bite as hard as lips can make it till agreed a lovely tale of human life well read and one will teach a tame dove how it best may fan the cool air gently oer my rest another bending oer her nimble tread will set a green robe floating round her head and still will dance with ever varied case smiling upon the flowers and the trees another will entice me on and on through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon till in the bosom of a leafy world we rest in silence like two gems upcurld in the recesses of a pearly shell  and can i ever bid these joys farewell yes i must pass them for a nobler life where i may find the agonies the strife of human hearts for lo i see afar oer sailing the blue cragginess a car and steeds with streamy manesthe charioteer looks out upon the winds with glorious fear and now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly along a huge clouds ridge and now with sprightly wheel downward come they into fresher skies tipt round with silver from the suns bright eyes still downward with capacious whirl they glide and now i see them on a greenhills side in breezy rest among the nodding stalks the charioteer with wondrous gesture talks to the trees and mountains and there soon appear shapes of delight of mystery and fear passing along before a dusky space made by some mighty oaks as they would chase some everfleeting music on they sweep lo how they murmur laugh and smile and weep some with upholden hand and mouth severe some with their faces muffled to the ear between their arms some clear in youthful bloom go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom some looking back and some with upward gaze yes thousands in a thousand different ways flit onwardnow a lovely wreath of girls dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls and now broad wings most awfully intent the driver of those steeds is forward bent and seems to listen o that i might know all that he writes with such a hurrying glow  the visions all are fledthe car is fled into the light of heaven and in their stead a sense of real things comes doubly strong and like a muddy stream would bear along my soul to nothingness but i will strive against all doublings and will keep alive the thought of that same chariot and the strange journey it went              is there so small a range in the present strength of manhood that the high imagination cannot freely fly as she was wont of old prepare her steeds paw up against the light and do strange deeds upon the clouds has she not shewn us all from the clear space of ether to the small breath of new buds unfolding from the meaning of joves large eyebrow to the tender greening of april meadows here her altar shone een in this isle and who could paragon the fervid choir that lifted up a noise of harmony to where it aye will poise its mighty self of convoluting sound huge as a planet and like that roll round eternally around a dizzy void ay in those days the muses were nigh cloyd with honors nor had any other care than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair  could all this be forgotten yes a schism nurtured by foppery and barbarism made great apollo blush for this his land men were thought wise who could not understand his glories with a puling infants force they swayd about upon a rocking horse and thought it pegasus ah dismal sould the winds of heaven blew the ocean rolld its gathering wavesye felt it not the blue bared its eternal bosom and the dew of summer nights collected still to make the morning precious beauty was awake why were ye not awake but ye were dead to things ye knew not ofwere closely wed to musty laws lined out with wretched rule and compass vile so that ye taught a school of dolts to smooth inlay and clip and fit till like the certain wands of jacobs wit their verses tallied easy was the task a thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask of poesy illfated impious race that blasphemed the bright lyrist to his face and did not know itno they went about holding a poor decrepid standard out markd with most flimsy mottos and in large the name of one boileau                                o ye whose charge it is to hover round our pleasant hills whose congregated majesty so fills my boundly reverence that i cannot trace your hallowed names in this unholy place so near those common folk did not their shames affright you did our old lamenting thames delight you did ye never cluster round delicious avon with a mournful sound and weep or did ye wholly bid adieu to regions where no more the laurel grew or did ye stay to give a welcoming to some lone spirits who could proudly sing their youth away and die twas even so but let me think away those times of woe now tis a fairer season ye have breathed rich benedictions oer us ye have wreathed fresh garlands for sweet music has been heard in many placessome has been upstirrd from out its crystal dwelling in a lake by a swans ebon bill from a thick brake nested and quiet in a valley mild bubbles a pipe fine sounds are floating wild about the earth happy are ye and glad  these things are doubtless yet in truth weve had strange thunders from the potency of song mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong from majesty but in clear truth the themes are ugly clubs the poets polyphemes disturbing the grand sea a drainless shower of light is poesy tis the supreme of power tis might half slumbring on its own right arm the very archings of her eyelids charm a thousand willing agents to obey and still she governs with the mildest sway but strength alone though of the muses born is like a fallen angel trees uptorn darkness and worms and shrouds and sepulchres delight it for it feeds upon the burrs and thorns of life forgetting the great end of poesy that it should be a friend to sooth the cares and lift the thoughts of man    yet i rejoice a myrtle fairer than eer grew in paphos from the bitter weeds lifts its sweet head into the air and feeds a silent space with ever sprouting green all tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering nibble the little cupped flowers and sing then let us clear away the choaking thorns from round its gentle stem let the young fawns yeaned in after times when we are flown find a fresh sward beneath it overgrown with simple flowers let there nothing be more boisterous than a lovers bended knee nought more ungentle than the placid look of one who leans upon a closed book nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes between two hills all hail delightful hopes as she was wont th imagination into most lovely labyrinths will be gone and they shall be accounted poet kings who simply tell the most hearteasing things o may these joys be ripe before i die  will not some say that i presumptuously have spoken that from hastening disgrace twere better far to hide my foolish face that whining boyhood should with reverence bow ere the dread thunderbolt could reach how if i do hide myself it sure shall be in the very fane the light of poesy if i do fall at least i will be laid beneath the silence of a poplar shade and over me the grass shall be smooth shaven and there shall be a kind memorial graven but oft despondence miserable bane they should not know thee who athirst to gain a noble end are thirsty every hour what though i am not wealthy in the dower of spanning wisdom though i do not know the shiftings of the mighty winds that blow hither and thither all the changing thoughts of man though no great ministring reason sorts out the dark mysteries of human souls to clear conceiving yet there ever rolls a vast idea before me and i glean therefrom my liberty thence too ive seen the end and aim of poesy tis clear as any thing most true as that the year is made of the four seasonsmanifest as a large cross some old cathedrals crest lifted to the white clouds therefore should i be but the essence of deformity a coward did my very eyelids wink at speaking out what i have dared to think ah rather let me like a madman run over some precipice let the hot sun melt my dedalian wings and drive me down convulsd and headlong stay an inward frown of conscience bids me be more calm awhile an ocean dim sprinkled with many an isle spreads awfully before me how much toil how many days what desperate turmoil ere i can have explored its widenesses ah what a task upon my bended knees i could unsay thoseno impossible impossible                   for sweet relief ill dwell on humbler thoughts and let this strange assay begun in gentleness die so away een now all tumult from my bosom fades i turn full hearted to the friendly aids that smooth the path of honour brotherhood and friendliness the nurse of mutual good the hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet into the brain ere one can think upon it the silence when some rhymes are coming out and when theyre come the very pleasant rout the message certain to be done tomorrow tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow some precious book from out its snug retreat to cluster round it when we next shall meet scarce can i scribble on for lovely airs are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs many delights of that glad day recalling when first my senses caught their tender falling and with these airs come forms of elegance stooping their shoulders oer a horses prance careless and grandfingers soft and round parting luxuriant curlsand the swift bound of bacchus from his chariot when his eye made ariadnes cheek look blushingly thus i remember all the pleasant flow of words at opening a portfolio  things such as these are ever harbingers to trains of peaceful images the stirs of a swans neck unseen among the rushes a linnet starting all about the bushes a butterfly with golden wings broad parted nestling a rose convulsd as though it smarted with over pleasuremany many more might i indulge at large in all my store of luxuries yet i must not forget sleep quiet with his poppy coronet for what there may be worthy in these rhymes i partly owe to him and thus the chimes of friendly voices had just given place to as sweet a silence when i gan retrace the pleasant day upon a couch at ease it was a poets house who keeps the keys of pleasures temple round about were hung the glorious features of the bards who sung in other agescold and sacred busts smiled at each other happy he who

timorous limbs a fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims at the baths edge and keeps a gentle motion with the subsiding crystal as when ocean heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness oer its rocky marge and balances once more the patient weeds that now unshent by foam feel all about their undulating home  sapphos meek head was there half smiling down at nothing just as though the earnest frown of over thinking had that moment gone from off her brow and left her all alone  great alfreds too with anxious pitying eyes as if he always listened to the sighs of the goaded world and kosciuskos worn by horrid suffrancemightily forlorn  petrarch outstepping from the shady green starts at the sight of laura nor can wean his eyes from her sweet face most happy they for over them was seen a free display of outspread wings and from between them shone the face of poesy from off her throne she overlookd things that i scarce could tell the very sense of where i was might well keep sleep aloof but more than that there came thought after thought to nourish up the flame within my breast so that the morning light surprised me even from a sleepless night and up i rose refreshd and glad and gay
