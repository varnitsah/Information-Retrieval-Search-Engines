44894915	the human drift by jack london   contents  the human drift smallboat sailing four horses and a sailor nothing that ever came to anything that dead men rise up never a classic of the sea     a wicked woman curtain raiser     the birth mark sketch     the human drift      the revelations of devout and learnd    who rose before us and as prophets burnd       are all but stories which awoke from sleep    they told their comrades and to sleep returnd  the history of civilisation is a history of wandering sword in hand in search of food  in the misty younger world we catch glimpses of phantom races rising slaying finding food building rude civilisations decaying falling under the swords of stronger hands and passing utterly away  man like any other animal has roved over the earth seeking what he might devour and not romance and adventure but the hungerneed has urged him on his vast adventures  whether a bankrupt gentleman sailing to colonise virginia or a lean cantonese contracting to labour on the sugar plantations of hawaii in each case gentleman and coolie it is a desperate attempt to get something to eat to get more to eat than he can get at home  it has always been so from the time of the first prehuman anthropoid crossing a mountaindivide in quest of better berrybushes beyond down to the latest slovak arriving on our shores today to go to work in the coalmines of pennsylvania  these migratory movements of peoples have been called drifts and the word is apposite  unplanned blind automatic spurred on by the pain of hunger man has literally drifted his way around the planet  there have been drifts in the past innumerable and forgotten and so remote that no records have been left or composed of such lowtyped humans or prehumans that they made no scratchings on stone or bone and left no monuments to show that they had been  these early drifts we conjecture and know must have occurred just as we know that the first uprightwalking brutes were descended from some kin of the quadrumana through having developed a pair of great toes out of two opposable thumbs  dominated by fear and by their very fear accelerating their development these early ancestors of ours suffering hungerpangs very like the ones we experience today drifted on hunting and being hunted eating and being eaten wandering through thousandyear long odysseys of screaming primordial savagery until they left their skeletons in glacial gravels some of them and their bonescratchings in cavemens lairs  there have been drifts from east to west and west to east from north to south and back again drifts that have crisscrossed one another and drifts colliding and recoiling and caroming off in new directions  from central europe the aryans have drifted into asia and from central asia the turanians have drifted across europe  asia has thrown forth great waves of hungry humans from the prehistoric roundbarrow broadheads who overran europe and penetrated to scandinavia and england down through the hordes of attila and tamerlane to the present immigration of chinese and japanese that threatens america  the phoenicians and the greeks with unremembered drifts behind them colonised the mediterranean  rome was engulfed in the torrent of germanic tribes drifting down from the north before a flood of drifting asiatics  the angles saxons and jutes after having drifted whence no man knows poured into britain and the english have carried this drift on around the world  retreating before stronger breeds hungry and voracious the eskimo has drifted to the inhospitable polar regions the pigmy to the feverrotten jungles of africa  and in this day the drift of the races continues whether it be of chinese into the philippines and the malay peninsula of europeans to the united states or of americans to the wheat lands of manitoba and the northwest  perhaps most amazing has been the south sea drift  blind fortuitous precarious as no other drift has been nevertheless the islands in that waste of ocean have received drift after drift of the races  down from the mainland of asia poured an aryan drift that built civilisations in ceylon java and sumatra  only the monuments of these aryans remain they themselves have perished utterly though not until after leaving evidences of their drift clear across the great south pacific to far easter island  and on that drift they encountered races who had accomplished the drift before them and they the aryans passed in turn before the drift of other and subsequent races whom we today call the polynesian and the melanesian  man early discovered death  as soon as his evolution permitted he made himself better devices for killing than the old natural ones of fang and claw  he devoted himself to the invention of killing devices before he discovered fire or manufactured for himself religion  and to this day his finest creative energy and technical skill are devoted to the same old task of making better and ever better killing weapons  all his days down all the past have been spent in killing  and from the fearstricken junglelurking cavehaunting creature of long ago he won to empery over the whole animal world because he developed into the most terrible and awful killer of all the animals  he found himself crowded he killed to make room and as he made room ever he increased and found himself crowded and ever he went on killing to make more room  like a settler clearing land of its weeds and forest bushes in order to plant corn so man was compelled to clear all manner of life away in order to plant himself  and sword in hand he has literally hewn his way through the vast masses of life that occupied the earth space he coveted for himself  and ever he has carried the battle wider and wider until to day not only is he a far more capable killer of men and animals than ever before but he has pressed the battle home to the infinite and invisible hosts of menacing lives in the world of microorganisms  it is true that they that rose by the sword perished by the sword  and yet not only did they not all perish but more rose by the sword than perished by it else man would not today be overrunning the world in such huge swarms  also it must not be forgotten that they who did not rise by the sword did not rise at all  they were not  in view of this there is something wrong with doctor jordans wartheory which is to the effect that the best being sent out to war only the second best the men who are left remain to breed a secondbest race and that therefore the human race deteriorates under war  if this be so if we have sent forth the best we bred and gone on breeding from the men who were left and since we have done this for ten thousand millenniums and are what we splendidly are today then what unthinkably splendid and godlike beings must have been our forebears those ten thousand millenniums ago unfortunately for doctor jordans theory those ancient forebears cannot live up to this fine reputation  we know them for what they were and before the monkey cage of any menagerie we catch truer glimpses and hints and resemblances of what our ancestors really were long and long ago  and by killing incessant killing by making a shambles of the planet those apelike creatures have developed even into you and me  as henley has said in the song of the sword     the sword singing     driving the darkness    even as the banners    and spear of the morning    sifting the nations    the slag from the metal    the waste and the weak    from the fit and the strong    fighting the brute    the abysmal fecundity    checking the gross    multitudinous blunders    the groping the purblind    excesses in service    of the womb universal    the absolute drudge  as time passed and man increased he drifted ever farther afield in search of room  he encountered other drifts of men and the killing of men became prodigious  the weak and the decadent fell under the sword nations that faltered that waxed prosperous in fat valleys and rich river deltas were swept away by the drifts of stronger men who were nourished on the hardships of deserts and mountains and who were more capable with the sword  unknown and unnumbered billions of men have been so destroyed in prehistoric times  draper says that in the twenty years of the gothic war italy lost 15000000 of her population and that the wars famines and pestilences of the reign of justinian diminished the human species by the almost incredible number of 100000000  germany in the thirty years war lost 6000000 inhabitants  the record of our own american civil war need scarcely be recalled  and man has been destroyed in other ways than by the sword  flood famine pestilence and murder are potent factors in reducing populationin making room  as mr charles woodruff in his expansion of races has instanced in 1886 when the dikes of the yellow river burst 7000000 people were drowned  the failure of crops in ireland in 1848 caused 1000000 deaths  the famines in india of 18967 and 18991900 lessened the population by 21000000  the taiping rebellion and the mohammedan rebellion combined with the famine of 187778 destroyed scores of millions of chinese  europe has been swept repeatedly by great plagues  in india for the period of 1903 to 1907 the plague deaths averaged between one and two millions a year  mr woodruff is responsible for the assertion that 10000000 persons now living in the united states are doomed to die of tuberculosis  and in this same country ten thousand persons a year are directly murdered  in china between three and six millions of infants are annually destroyed while the total infanticide record of the whole world is appalling  in africa now human beings are dying by millions of the sleeping sickness  more destructive of life than war is industry  in all civilised countries great masses of people are crowded into slums and labourghettos where disease festers vice corrodes and famine is chronic and where they die more swiftly and in greater numbers than do the soldiers in our modern wars  the very infant mortality of a slum parish in the east end of london is three times that of a middleclass parish in the west end  in the united states in the last fourteen years a total of coalminers greater than our entire standing army has been killed and injured  the united states bureau of labour states that during the year 1908 there were between 30000 and 35000 deaths of workers by accidents while 200000 more were injured  in fact the safest place for a workingman is in the army  and even if that army be at the front fighting in cuba or south africa the soldier in the ranks has a better chance for life than the workingman at home  and yet despite this terrible roll of death despite the enormous killing of the past and the enormous killing of the present there are to day alive on the planet a billion and three quarters of human beings  our immediate conclusion is that man is exceedingly fecund and very tough never before have there been so many people in the world  in the past centuries the worlds population has been smaller in the future centuries it is destined to be larger  and this brings us to that old bugbear that has been so frequently laughed away and that still persists in raising its grisly headnamely the doctrine of malthus  while mans increasing efficiency of foodproduction combined with colonisation of whole virgin continents has for generations given the apparent lie to malthus mathematical statement of the law of population nevertheless the essential significance of his doctrine remains and cannot be challenged  population does press against subsistence  and no matter how rapidly subsistence increases population is certain to catch up with it  when man was in the hunting stage of development wide areas were necessary for the maintenance of scant populations  with the shepherd stages the means of subsistence being increased a larger population was supported on the same territory  the agricultural stage gave support to a still larger population and today with the increased foodgetting efficiency of a machine civilisation an even larger population is made possible  nor is this theoretical  the population is here a billion and three quarters of men women and children and this vast population is increasing on itself by leaps and bounds  a heavy european drift to the new world has gone on and is going on yet europe whose population a century ago was 170000000 has today 500000000  at this rate of increase provided that subsistence is not overtaken a century from now the population of europe will be 1500000000  and be it noted of the present rate of increase in the united states that only onethird is due to immigration while twothirds is due to excess of births over deaths  and at this present rate of increase the population of the united states will be 500000000 in less than a century from now  man the hungry one the killer has always suffered for lack of room the world has been chronically overcrowded  belgium with her 572 persons to the square mile is no more crowded than was denmark when it supported only 500 palaeolithic people  according to mr woodruff cultivated land will produce 1600 times as much food as hunting land  from the time of the norman conquest for centuries europe could support no more than 25 to the square mile  today europe supports 81 to the square mile  the explanation of this is that for the several centuries after the norman conquest her population was saturated  then with the development of trading and capitalism of exploration and exploitation of new lands and with the invention of laboursaving machinery and the discovery and application of scientific principles was brought about a tremendous increase in europes foodgetting efficiency  and immediately her population sprang up  according to the census of ireland of 1659 that country had a population of 500000  one hundred and fifty years later her population was 8000000  for many centuries the population of japan was stationary  there seemed no way of increasing her foodgetting efficiency  then sixty years ago came commodore perry knocking down her doors and letting in the knowledge and machinery of the superior food getting efficiency of the western world  immediately upon this rise in subsistence began the rise of population and it is only the other day that japan finding her population once again pressing against subsistence embarked sword in hand on a westward drift in search of more room  and sword in hand killing and being killed she has carved out for herself formosa and korea and driven the vanguard of her drift far into the rich interior of manchuria  for an immense period of time chinas population has remained at 400000000the saturation point  the only reason that the yellow river periodically drowns millions of chinese is that there is no other land for those millions to farm  and after every such catastrophe the wave of human life rolls up and now millions flood out upon that precarious territory  they are driven to it because they are pressed remorselessly against subsistence  it is inevitable that china sooner or later like japan will learn and put into application our own superior foodgetting efficiency  and when that time comes it is likewise inevitable that her population will increase by unguessed millions until it again reaches the saturation point  and then inoculated with western ideas may she not like japan take sword in hand and start forth colossally on a drift of her own for more room  this is another reputed bogiethe yellow peril yet the men of china are only men like any other race of men and all men down all history have drifted hungrily here there and everywhere over the planet seeking for something to eat  what other men do may not the chinese do  but a change has long been coming in the affairs of man  the more recent drifts of the stronger races carving their way through the lesser breeds to more earthspace has led to peace ever to wider and more lasting peace  the lesser breeds under penalty of being killed have been compelled to lay down their weapons and cease killing among themselves the scalptalking indian and the headhunting melanesian have been either destroyed or converted to a belief in the superior efficacy of civil suits and criminal prosecutions  the planet is being subdued  the wild and the hurtful are either tamed or eliminated  from the beasts of prey and the cannibal humans down to the deathdealing microbes no quarter is given and daily wider and wider areas of hostile territory whether of a warring deserttribe in africa or a pestilential feverhole like panama are made peaceable and habitable for mankind  as for the great mass of stayathome folk what percentage of the present generation in the united states england or germany has seen war or knows anything of war at first hand  there was never so much peace in the world as there is today  war itself the old red anarch is passing  it is safer to be a soldier than a workingman  the chance for life is greater in an active campaign than in a factory or a coalmine  in the matter of killing war is growing impotent and this in face of the fact that the machinery of war was never so expensive in the past nor so dreadful  warequipment to day in time of peace is more expensive than of old in time of war  a standing army costs more to maintain than it used to cost to conquer an empire  it is more expensive to be ready to kill than it used to be to do the killing  the price of a dreadnought would furnish the whole army of xerxes with killing weapons  and in spite of its magnificent equipment war no longer kills as it used to when its methods were simpler  a bombardment by a modern fleet has been known to result in the killing of one mule  the casualties of a twentieth century war between two worldpowers are such as to make a worker in an ironfoundry turn green with envy  war has become a joke  men have made for themselves monsters of battle which they cannot face in battle  subsistence is generous these days life is not cheap and it is not in the nature of flesh and blood to indulge in the carnage made possible by presentday machinery  this is not theoretical as will be shown by a comparison of deaths in battle and men involved in the south african war and the spanishamerican war on the one hand and the civil war or the napoleonic wars on the other  not only has war by its own evolution rendered itself futile but man himself with greater wisdom and higher ethics is opposed to war  he has learned too much  war is repugnant to his common sense  he conceives it to be wrong to be absurd and to be very expensive  for the damage wrought and the results accomplished it is not worth the price  just as in the disputes of individuals the arbitration of a civil court instead of a blood feud is more practical so man decides is arbitration more practical in the disputes of nations  war is passing disease is being conquered and mans foodgetting efficiency is increasing  it is because of these factors that there are a billion and three quarters of people alive today instead of a billion or threequarters of a billion  and it is because of these factors that the worlds population will very soon be two billions and climbing rapidly toward three billions  the lifetime of the generation is increasing steadily  men live longer these days  life is not so precarious  the newborn infant has a greater chance for survival than at any time in the past  surgery and sanitation reduce the fatalities that accompany the mischances of life and the ravages of disease  men and women with deficiencies and weaknesses that in the past would have effected their rapid extinction live today and father and mother a numerous progeny  and high as the foodgetting efficiency may soar population is bound to soar after it  the abysmal fecundity of life has not altered  given the food and life will increase  a small percentage of the billion and threequarters that live today may hush the clamour of life to be born but it is only a small percentage  in this particular the life in the mananimal is very like the life in the other animals  and still another change is coming in human affairs  though politicians gnash their teeth and cry anathema and man whose superficial booklearning is vitiated by crystallised prejudice assures us that civilisation will go to smash the trend of society today the world over is toward socialism  the old individualism is passing  the state interferes more and more in affairs that hitherto have been considered sacredly private  and socialism when the last word is said is merely a new economic and political system whereby more men can get food to eat in short socialism is an improved foodgetting efficiency  furthermore not only will socialism get food more easily and in greater quantity but it will achieve a more equitable distribution of that food socialism promises for a time to give all men women and children all they want to eat and to enable them to eat all they want as often as they want  subsistence will be pushed back temporarily an exceedingly long way  in consequence the flood of life will rise like a tidal wave there will be more marriages and more children born  the enforced sterility that obtains today for many millions will no longer obtain nor will the fecund millions in the slums and labourghettos who today die of all the ills due to chronic underfeeding and overcrowding and who die with their fecundity largely unrealised die in that future day when the increased foodgetting efficiency of socialism will give them all they want to eat  it is undeniable that population will increase prodigiouslyjust as it has increased prodigiously during the last few centuries following upon the increase in foodgetting efficiency  the magnitude of population in that future day is well nigh unthinkable  but there is only so much land and water on the surface of the earth  man despite his marvellous accomplishments will never be able to increase the diameter of the planet  the old days of virgin continents will be gone  the habitable planet from icecap to icecap will be inhabited  and in the matter of foodgetting as in everything else man is only finite  undreamedof efficiencies in foodgetting may be achieved but soon or late man will find himself face to face with malthus grim law  not only will population catch up with subsistence but it will press against subsistence and the pressure will be pitiless and savage  somewhere in the future is a date when man will face consciously the bitter fact that there is not food enough for all of him to eat  when this day comes what then  will there be a recrudescence of old obsolete war  in a saturated population life is always cheap as it is cheap in china in india today  will new human drifts take place questing for room carving earthspace out of crowded life  will the sword again sing     follow o follow then    heroes my harvesters    where the tall grain is ripe    thrust in your sickles    stripped and adust    in a stubble of empire    scything and binding    the full sheaves of sovereignty  even if as of old man should wander hungrily sword in hand slaying and being slain the relief would be only temporary  even if one race alone should hew down the last survivor of all the other races that one race drifting the world around would saturate the planet with its own life and again press against subsistence  and in that day the death rate and the birth rate will have to balance  men will have to die or be prevented from being born  undoubtedly a higher quality of life will obtain and also a slowly decreasing fecundity  but this decrease will be so slow that the pressure against subsistence will remain  the control of progeny will be one of the most important problems of man and one of the most important functions of the state  men will simply be not permitted to be born  disease from time to time will ease the pressure  diseases are parasites and it must not be forgotten that just as there are drifts in the world of man so are there drifts in the world of microorganisms hungerquests for food  little is known of the microorganic world but that little is appalling and no census of it will ever be taken for there is the true literal abysmal fecundity  multitudinous as man is all his totality of individuals is as nothing in comparison with the inconceivable vastness of numbers of the microorganisms  in your body or in mine right now are swarming more individual entities than there are human beings in the world today  it is to us an invisible world  we only guess its nearest confines  with our powerful microscopes and ultramicroscopes enlarging diameters twenty thousand times we catch but the slightest glimpses of that profundity of infinitesimal life  little is known of that world save in a general way  we know that out of it arise diseases new to us that afflict and destroy man  we do not know whether these diseases are merely the drifts in a fresh direction of alreadyexisting breeds of microorganisms or whether they are new absolutely new breeds themselves just spontaneously generated  the latter hypothesis is tenable for we theorise that if spontaneous generation still occurs on the earth it is far more likely to occur in the form of simple organisms than of complicated organisms  another thing we know and that is that it is in crowded populations that new diseases arise  they have done so in the past  they do so today and no matter how wise are our physicians and bacteriologists no matter how successfully they cope with these invaders new invaders continue to arisenew drifts of hungry life seeking to devour us  and so we are justified in believing that in the saturated populations of the future when life is suffocating in the pressure against subsistence that new and ever new hosts of destroying microorganisms will continue to arise and fling themselves upon earthcrowded man to give him room  there may even be plagues of unprecedented ferocity that will depopulate great areas before the wit of man can overcome them  and this we know that no matter how often these invisible hosts may be overcome by mans becoming immune to them through a cruel and terrible selection new hosts will ever arise of these microorganisms that were in the world before he came and that will be here after he is gone  after he is gone  will he then some day be gone and this planet know him no more  is it thither that the human drift in all its totality is trending  god himself is silent on this point though some of his prophets have given us vivid representations of that last day when the earth shall pass into nothingness  nor does science despite its radium speculations and its attempted analyses of the ultimate nature of matter give us any other word than that man will pass  so far as mans knowledge goes law is universal  elements react under certain unchangeable conditions  one of these conditions is temperature  whether it be in the test tube of the laboratory or the workshop of nature all organic chemical reactions take place only within a restricted range of heat  man the latest of the ephemera is pitifully a creature of temperature strutting his brief day on the thermometer  behind him is a past wherein it was too warm for him to exist  ahead of him is a future wherein it will be too cold for him to exist  he cannot adjust himself to that future because he cannot alter universal law because he cannot alter his own construction nor the molecules that compose him  it would be well to ponder these lines of herbert spencers which follow and which embody possibly the wildest vision the scientific mind has ever achieved     motion as well as matter being fixed in quantity it would seem that    the change in the distribution of matter which motion effects coming    to a limit in whichever direction it is carried the indestructible    motion thereupon necessitates a reverse distribution  apparently the    universallycoexistent forces of attraction and repulsion which as    we have seen necessitate rhythm in all minor changes throughout the    universe also necessitate rhythm in the totality of its    changesproduce now an immeasurable period during which the    attractive forces predominating cause universal concentration and    then an immeasurable period during which the repulsive forces    predominating cause universal diffusionalternate eras of evolution    and dissolution  and thus there is suggested the conception of a    past during which there have been successive evolutions analogous to    that which is now going on a future during which successive other    evolutions may go onever the same in principle but never the same in    concrete result  that is itthe most we knowalternate eras of evolution and dissolution  in the past there have been other evolutions similar to that one in which we live and in the future there may be other similar evolutionsthat is all  the principle of all these evolutions remains but the concrete results are never twice alike  man was not he was and again he will not be  in eternity which is beyond our comprehension the particular evolution of that solar satellite we call the earth occupied but a slight fraction of time  and of that fraction of time man occupies but a small portion  all the whole human drift from the first apeman to the last savant is but a phantom a flash of light and a flutter of movement across the infinite face of the starry night  when the thermometer drops man ceaseswith all his lusts and wrestlings and achievements with all his raceadventures and racetragedies and with all his red killings billions upon billions of human lives multiplied by as many billions more  this is the last word of science unless there be some further unguessed word which science will some day find and utter  in the meantime it sees no farther than the starry void where the fleeting systems lapse like foam  of what ledgeraccount is the tiny life of man in a vastness where stars snuff out like candles and great suns blaze for a timetick of eternity and are gone  and for us who live no worse can happen than has happened to the earliest drifts of man marked today by ruined cities of forgotten civilisationruined cities which on excavation are found to rest on ruins of earlier cities city upon city and fourteen cities down to a stratum where still earlier wandering herdsmen drove their flocks and where even preceding them wild hunters chased their prey long after the caveman and the man of the squattingplace cracked the knucklebones of wild animals and vanished from the earth  there is nothing terrible about it  with richard hovey when he faced his death we can say behold  i have lived  and with another and greater one we can lay ourselves down with a will  the one drop of living the one taste of being has been good and perhaps our greatest achievement will be that we dreamed immortality even though we failed to realise it     smallboat sailing   a sailor is born not made  and by sailor is meant not the average efficient and hopeless creature who is found today in the forecastle of deepwater ships but the man who will take a fabric compounded of wood and iron and rope and canvas and compel it to obey his will on the surface of the sea  barring captains and mates of big ships the small boat sailor is the real sailor  he knowshe must knowhow to make the wind carry his craft from one given point to another given point  he must know about tides and rips and eddies bar and channel markings and day and night signals he must be wise in weatherlore and he must be sympathetically familiar with the peculiar qualities of his boat which differentiate it from every other boat that was ever built and rigged  he must know how to gentle her about as one instance of a myriad and to fill her on the other tack without deadening her way or allowing her to fall off too far  the deepwater sailor of today needs know none of these things  and he doesnt  he pulls and hauls as he is ordered swabs decks washes paint and chips ironrust  he knows nothing and cares less  put him in a small boat and he is helpless  he will cut an even better figure on the hurricane deck of a horse  i shall never forget my childastonishment when i first encountered one of these strange beings  he was a runaway english sailor  i was a lad of twelve with a deckedover fourteenfoot centreboard skiff which i had taught myself to sail  i sat at his feet as at the feet of a god while he discoursed of strange lands and peoples deeds of violence and hairraising gales at sea  then one day i took him for a sail  with all the trepidation of the veriest little amateur i hoisted sail and got under way  here was a man looking on critically i was sure who knew more in one second about boats and the water than i could ever know after an interval in which i exceeded myself he took the tiller and the sheet  i sat on the little thwart amidships openmouthed prepared to learn what real sailing was  my mouth remained open for i learned what a real sailor was in a small boat  he couldnt trim the sheet to save himself he nearly capsized several times in squalls and once again by blunderingly jibing over he didnt know what a centreboard was for nor did he know that in running a boat before the wind one must sit in the middle instead of on the side and finally when we came back to the wharf he ran the skiff in full tilt shattering her nose and carrying away the maststep  and yet he was a really truly sailor fresh from the vasty deep  which points my moral  a man can sail in the forecastles of big ships all his life and never know what real sailing is  from the time i was twelve i listened to the lure of the sea  when i was fifteen i was captain and owner of an oysterpirate sloop  by the time i was sixteen i was sailing in scowschooners fishing salmon with the greeks up the sacramento river and serving as sailor on the fish patrol  and i was a good sailor too though all my cruising had been on san francisco bay and the rivers tributary to it  i had never been on the ocean in my life  then the month i was seventeen i signed before the mast as an able seaman on a threetopmast schooner bound on a sevenmonths cruise across the pacific and back again  as my shipmates promptly informed me i had had my nerve with me to sign on as able seaman  yet behold i was an able seaman  i had graduated from the right school  it took no more than minutes to learn the names and uses of the few new ropes  it was simple  i did not do things blindly  as a smallboat sailor i had learned to reason out and know the why of everything  it is true i had to learn how to steer by compass which took maybe half a minute but when it came to steering fullandby and closeandby i could beat the average of my shipmates because that was the very way i had always sailed  inside fifteen minutes i could box the compass around and back again  and there was little else to learn during that sevenmonths cruise except fancy ropesailorising such as the more complicated lanyard knots and the making of various kinds of sennit and ropemats the point of all of which is that it is by means of smallboat sailing that the real sailor is best schooled  and if a man is a born sailor and has gone to the school of the sea never in all his life can he get away from the sea again  the salt of it is in his bones as well as his nostrils and the sea will call to him until he dies  of late years i have found easier ways of earning a living  i have quit the forecastle for keeps but always i come back to the sea  in my case it is usually san francisco bay than which no lustier tougher sheet of water can be found for smallboat sailing  it really blows on san francisco bay  during the winter which is the best cruising season we have southeasters southwesters and occasional howling northers  throughout the summer we have what we call the sea breeze an unfailing wind off the pacific that on most afternoons in the week blows what the atlantic coast yachtsmen would name a gale  they are always surprised by the small spread of canvas our yachts carry  some of them with schooners they have sailed around the horn have looked proudly at their own lofty sticks and huge spreads then patronisingly and even pityingly at ours  then perchance they have joined in a club cruise from san francisco to mare island  they found the morning run up the bay delightful  in the afternoon when the brave west wind ramped across san pablo bay and they faced it on the long beat home things were somewhat different  one by one like a flight of swallows our more meagrely sparred and canvassed yachts went by leaving them wallowing and dead and shortening down in what they called a gale but which we called a dandy sailing breeze  the next time they came out we would notice their sticks cut down their booms shortened and their afterleeches nearer the luffs by whole cloths  as for excitement there is all the difference in the world between a ship in trouble at sea and a small boat in trouble on landlocked water yet for genuine excitement and thrill give me the small boat  things happen so quickly and there are always so few to do the workand hard work too as the smallboat sailor knows  i have toiled all night both watches on deck in a typhoon off the coast of japan and been less exhausted than by two hours work at reefing down a thirtyfoot sloop and heaving up two anchors on a lee shore in a screaming southeaster  hard work and excitement  let the wind baffle and drop in a heavy tide way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow drawbridge  behold your sails upon which you are depending flap with sudden emptiness and then see the impish wind with a haul of eight points fill your jib aback with a gusty puff  around she goes and sweeps not through the open draw but broadside on against the solid piles  hear the roar of the tide sucking through the trestle  and hear and see your pretty freshpainted boat crash against the piles  feel her stout little hull give to the impact  see the rail actually pinch in  hear your canvas tearing and see the black squareended timbers thrusting holes through it  smash  there goes your topmast stay and the topmast reels over drunkenly above you  there is a ripping and crunching  if it continues your starboard shrouds will be torn out grab a ropeany ropeand take a turn around a pile  but the free end of the rope is too short  you cant make it fast and you hold on and wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope  hold on  you hold on till you are purple in the face till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers  but you hold and your partner gets the longer rope and makes it fast  you straighten up and look at your hands they are ruined  you can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers  the pain is sickening  but there is no time  the skiff which is always perverse is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off  its drop the peak  down jib  then you run lines and pull and haul and heave and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridgetender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee  and finally at the end of an hour with aching back sweatsoaked shirt and slaughtered hands you are through and swinging along on the placid beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand kneedeep and gaze wonderingly at you  excitement  work can you beat it in a calm day on the deep sea  ive tried it both ways  i remember labouring in a fourteen days gale off the coast of new zealand  we were a tramp collier rusty and battered with six thousand tons of coal in our hold  life lines were stretched fore and aft and on our weather side attached to smokestack guys and rigging were huge ropenettings hung there for the purpose of breaking the force of the seas and so saving our messroom doors  but the doors were smashed and the messrooms washed out just the same  and yet out of it all arose but the one feeling namely of monotony  in contrast with the foregoing about the liveliest eight days of my life were spent in a small boat on the west coast of korea  never mind why i was thus voyaging up the yellow sea during the month of february in below zero weather  the point is that i was in an open boat a sampan on a rocky coast where there were no lighthouses and where the tides ran from thirty to sixty feet  my crew were japanese fishermen  we did not speak each others language  yet there was nothing monotonous about that trip never shall i forget one particular cold bitter dawn when in the thick of driving snow we took in sail and dropped our small anchor  the wind was howling out of the northwest and we were on a lee shore  ahead and astern all escape was cut off by rocky headlands against whose bases burst the unbroken seas  to windward a short distance seen only between the snowsqualls was a low rocky reef  it was this that inadequately protected us from the whole yellow sea that thundered in upon us  the japanese crawled under a communal rice mat and went to sleep  i joined them and for several hours we dozed fitfully  then a sea deluged us out with icy water and we found several inches of snow on top the mat  the reef to windward was disappearing under the rising tide and moment by moment the seas broke more strongly over the rocks  the fishermen studied the shore anxiously  so did i and with a sailors eye though i could see little chance for a swimmer to gain that surf hammered line of rocks  i made signs toward the headlands on either flank  the japanese shook their heads  i indicated that dreadful lee shore  still they shook their heads and did nothing  my conclusion was that they were paralysed by the hopelessness of the situation  yet our extremity increased with every minute for the rising tide was robbing us of the reef that served as buffer  it soon became a case of swamping at our anchor  seas were splashing on board in growing volume and we baled constantly  and still my fishermen crew eyed the surfbattered shore and did nothing  at last after many narrow escapes from complete swamping the fishermen got into action  all hands tailed on to the anchor and hove it up forard as the boats head paid off we set a patch of sail about the size of a floursack  and we headed straight for shore  i unlaced my shoes unbottoned my greatcoat and coat and was ready to make a quick partial strip a minute or so before we struck  but we didnt strike and as we rushed in i saw the beauty of the situation  before us opened a narrow channel frilled at its mouth with breaking seas  yet long before when i had scanned the shore closely there had been no such channel  i had forgotten the thirtyfoot tide  and it was for this tide that the japanese had so precariously waited  we ran the frill of breakers curved into a tiny sheltered bay where the water was scarcely flawed by the gale and landed on a beach where the salt sea of the last tide lay frozen in long curving lines  and this was one gale of three in the course of those eight days in the sampan  would it have been beaten on a ship  i fear me the ship would have gone aground on the outlying reef and that its people would have been incontinently and monotonously drowned  there are enough surprises and mishaps in a threedays cruise in a small boat to supply a great ship on the ocean for a full year  i remember once taking out on her trial trip a little thirtyfooter i had just bought  in six days we had two stiff blows and in addition one proper southwester and one ripsnorting southeaster  the slight intervals between these blows were dead calms  also in the six days we were aground three times  then too we tied up to the bank in the sacramento river and grounding by an accident on the steep slope on a falling tide nearly turned a side somersault down the bank  in a stark calm and heavy tide in the carquinez straits where anchors skate on the channel scoured bottom we were sucked against a big dock and smashed and bumped down a quarter of a mile of its length before we could get clear  two hours afterward on san pablo bay the wind was piping up and we were reefing down  it is no fun to pick up a skiff adrift in a heavy sea and gale  that was our next task for our skiff swamping parted both towing painters we had bent on  before we recovered it we had nearly killed ourselves with exhaustion and we certainly had strained the sloop in every part from keelson to truck  and to cap it all coming into our home port beating up the narrowest part of the san antonio estuary we had a shave of inches from collision with a big ship in tow of a tug  i have sailed the ocean in far larger craft a year at a time in which period occurred no such chapter of moving incident  after all the mishaps are almost the best part of smallboat sailing looking back they prove to be punctuations of joy  at the time they try your mettle and your vocabulary and may make you so pessimistic as to believe that god has a grudge against youbut afterward ah afterward with what pleasure you remember them and with what gusto do you relate them to your brother skippers in the fellowhood of smallboat sailing  a narrow winding slough a half tide exposing mud surfaced with gangrenous slime the water itself filthy and discoloured by the waste from the vats of a nearby tannery the marsh grass on either side mottled with all the shades of a decaying orchid a crazy ramshackled ancient wharf and at the end of the wharf a small whitepainted sloop nothing romantic about it  no hint of adventure  a splendid pictorial argument against the alleged joys of smallboat sailing  possibly that is what cloudesley and i thought that sombre leaden morning as we turned out to cook breakfast and wash decks  the latter was my stunt but one look at the dirty water overside and another at my freshpainted deck deterred me  after breakfast we started a game of chess  the tide continued to fall and we felt the sloop begin to list  we played on until the chess men began to fall over  the list increased and we went on deck  bowline and sternline were drawn taut  as we looked the boat listed still farther with an abrupt jerk  the lines were now very taut  as soon as her belly touches the bottom she will stop i said  cloudesley sounded with a boathook along the outside  seven feet of water he announced  the bank is almost up and down the first thing that touches will be her mast when she turns bottom up  an ominous minute snapping noise came from the sternline  even as we looked we saw a strand fray and part  then we jumped  scarcely had we bent another line between the stern and the wharf when the original line parted  as we bent another line forard the original one there crackled and parted  after that it was an inferno of work and excitement  we ran more and more lines and more and more lines continued to part and more and more the pretty boat went over on her side  we bent all our spare lines we unrove sheets and halyards we used our twoinch hawser we fastened lines part way up the mast half way up and everywhere else we toiled and sweated and enounced our mutual and sincere conviction that gods grudge still held against us  country yokels came down on the wharf and sniggered at us  when cloudesley let a coil of rope slip down the inclined deck into the vile slime and fished it out with seasick countenance the yokels sniggered louder and it was all i could do to prevent him from climbing up on the wharf and committing murder  by the time the sloops deck was perpendicular we had unbent the boom lift from below made it fast to the wharf and with the other end fast nearly to the masthead heaved it taut with block and tackle  the lift was of steel wire  we were confident that it could stand the strain but we doubted the holdingpower of the stays that held the mast  the tide had two more hours to ebb and it was the big runout which meant that five hours must elapse ere the returning tide would give us a chance to learn whether or not the sloop would rise to it and right herself  the bank was almost up and down and at the bottom directly beneath us the fastebbing tide left a pit of the vilest illestsmelling illest appearing muck to be seen in many a days ride  said cloudesley to me gazing down into it  i love you as a brother  id fight for you  id face roaring lions and sudden death by field and flood  but just the same dont you fall into that  he shuddered nauseously  for if you do i havent the grit to pull you out  i simply couldnt  youd be awful  the best i could do would be to take a boathook and shove you down out of sight  we sat on the upper sidewall of the cabin dangled our legs down the top of the cabin leaned our backs against the deck and played chess until the rising tide and the block and tackle on the boomlift enabled us to get her on a respectable keel again  years afterward down in the south seas on the island of ysabel i was caught in a similar predicament  in order to clean her copper i had careened the snark broadside on to the beach and outward  when the tide rose she refused to rise  the water crept in through the scuppers mounted over the rail and the level of the ocean slowly crawled up the slant of the deck  we battened down the engineroom hatch and the sea rose to it and over it and climbed perilously near to the cabin companionway and skylight  we were all sick with fever but we turned out in the blazing tropic sun and toiled madly for several hours  we carried our heaviest lines ashore from our mastheads and heaved with our heaviest purchase until everything crackled including ourselves  we would spell off and lie down like dead men then get up and heave and crackle again  and in the end our lower rail five feet under water and the wavelets lapping the companionway combing the sturdy little craft shivered and shook herself and pointed her masts once more to the zenith  there is never lack of exercise in smallboat sailing and the hard work is not only part of the fun of it but it beats the doctors  san francisco bay is no mill pond  it is a large and draughty and variegated piece of water  i remember one winter evening trying to enter the mouth of the sacramento  there was a freshet on the river the flood tide from the bay had been beaten back into a strong ebb and the lusty west wind died down with the sun  it was just sunset and with a fair to middling breeze dead aft we stood still in the rapid current  we were squarely in the mouth of the river but there was no anchorage and we drifted backward faster and faster and dropped anchor outside as the last breath of wind left us  the night came on beautiful and warm and starry  my one companion cooked supper while on deck i put everything in shape bristol fashion  when we turned in at nine oclock the weather promise was excellent  if i had carried a barometer id have known better  by two in the morning our shrouds were thrumming in a piping breeze and i got up and gave her more scope on her hawser  inside another hour there was no doubt that we were in for a southeaster  it is not nice to leave a warm bed and get out of a bad anchorage in a black blowy night but we arose to the occasion put in two reefs and started to heave up  the winch was old and the strain of the jumping head sea was too much for it  with the winch out of commission it was impossible to heave up by hand  we knew because we tried it and slaughtered our hands  now a sailor hates to lose an anchor  it is a matter of pride  of course we could have buoyed ours and slipped it instead however i gave her still more hawser veered her and dropped the second anchor  there was little sleep after that for first one and then the other of us would be rolled out of our bunks  the increasing size of the seas told us we were dragging and when we struck the scoured channel we could tell by the feel of it that our two anchors were fairly skating across  it was a deep channel the farther edge of it rising steeply like the wall of a canyon and when our anchors started up that wall they hit in and held  yet when we fetched up through the darkness we could hear the seas breaking on the solid shore astern and so near was it that we shortened the skiffs painter  daylight showed us that between the stern of the skiff and destruction was no more than a score of feet  and how it did blow  there were times in the gusts when the wind must have approached a velocity of seventy or eighty miles an hour  but the anchors held and so nobly that our final anxiety was that the forard bitts would be jerked clean out of the boat  all day the sloop alternately ducked her nose under and sat down on her stern and it was not till late afternoon that the storm broke in one last and worst mad gust  for a full five minutes an absolute dead calm prevailed and then with the suddenness of a thunderclap the wind snorted out of the southwesta shift of eight points and a boisterous gale  another night of it was too much for us and we hove up by hand in a cross headsea  it was not stiff work  it was heartbreaking  and i know we were both near to crying from the hurt and the exhaustion  and when we did get the first anchor upanddown we couldnt break it out  between seas we snubbed her nose down to it took plenty of turns and stood clear as she jumped  almost everything smashed and parted except the anchorhold  the chocks were jerked out the rail torn off and the very coveringboard splintered and still the anchor held  at last hoisting the reefed mainsail and slacking off a few of the hardwon feet of the chain we sailed the anchor out  it was nip and tuck though and there were times when the boat was knocked down flat  we repeated the manoeuvre with the remaining anchor and in the gathering darkness fled into the shelter of the rivers mouth  i was born so long ago that i grew up before the era of gasolene  as a result i am oldfashioned  i prefer a sailboat to a motorboat and it is my belief that boatsailing is a finer more difficult and sturdier art than running a motor  gasolene engines are becoming foolproof and while it is unfair to say that any fool can run an engine it is fair to say that almost any one can  not so when it comes to sailing a boat more skill more intelligence and a vast deal more training are necessary  it is the finest training in the world for boy and youth and man  if the boy is very small equip him with a small comfortable skiff  he will do the rest  he wont need to be taught  shortly he will be setting a tiny legofmutton and steering with an oar  then he will begin to talk keels and centreboards and want to take his blankets out and stop aboard all night  but dont be afraid for him  he is bound to run risks and encounter accidents  remember there are accidents in the nursery as well as out on the water  more boys have died from hothouse culture than have died on boats large and small and more boys have been made into strong and reliant men by boatsailing than by lawncroquet and dancingschool  and once a sailor always a sailor  the savour of the salt never stales the sailor never grows so old that he does not care to go back for one more wrestling bout with wind and wave  i know it of myself  i have turned rancher and live beyond sight of the sea  yet i can stay away from it only so long  after several months have passed i begin to grow restless  i find myself daydreaming over incidents of the last cruise or wondering if the striped bass are running on wingo slough or eagerly reading the newspapers for reports of the first northern flights of ducks  and then suddenly there is a hurried pack of suitcases and overhauling of gear and we are off for vallejo where the little roamer lies waiting always waiting for the skiff to come alongside for the lighting of the fire in the galleystove for the pulling off of gaskets the swinging up of the mainsail and the rattattat of the reefpoints for the heaving short and the breaking out and for the twirling of the wheel as she fills away and heads up bay or down  jack london on board roamer sonoma creek april 15 1911     four horses and a sailor   huh  drive four horses  i wouldnt sit behind younot for a thousand dollarsover them mountain roads  so said henry and he ought to have known for he drives four horses himself  said another glen ellen friend what  london  he drive four horses cant drive one  and the best of it is that he was right  even after managing to get a few hundred miles with my four horses i dont know how to drive one just the other day swinging down a steep mountain road and rounding an abrupt turn i came full tilt on a horse and buggy being driven by a woman up the hill  we could not pass on the narrow road where was only a foot to spare and my horses did not know how to back especially up hill  about two hundred yards down the hill was a spot where we could pass  the driver of the buggy said she didnt dare back down because she was not sure of the brake  and as i didnt know how to tackle one horse i didnt try it  so we unhitched her horse and backed down by hand which was very well till it came to hitching the horse to the buggy again  she didnt know how  i didnt either and i had depended on her knowledge  it took us about half an hour with frequent debates and consultations though it is an absolute certainty that never in its life was that horse hitched in that particular way  no i cant harness up one horse  but i can four which compels me to back up again to get to my beginning  having selected sonoma valley for our abiding place charmian and i decided it was about time we knew what we had in our own county and the neighbouring ones  how to do it was the first question  among our many weaknesses is the one of being old fashioned  we dont mix with gasolene very well  and as true sailors should we naturally gravitate toward horses  being one of those lucky individuals who carries his office under his hat i should have to take a typewriter and a load of books along  this put saddlehorses out of the running  charmian suggested driving a span  she had faith in me besides she could drive a span herself  but when i thought of the many mountains to cross and of crossing them for three months with a poor tired span i vetoed the proposition and said wed have to come back to gasolene after all  this she vetoed just as emphatically and a deadlock obtained until i received inspiration  why not drive four horses i said  but you dont know how to drive four horses was her objection  i threw my chest out and my shoulders back  what man has done i can do i proclaimed grandly  and please dont forget that when we sailed on the snark i knew nothing of navigation and that i taught myself as i sailed  very well she said  and theres faith for you   they shall be four saddle horses and well strap our saddles on behind the rig  it was my turn to object  our saddle horses are not broken to harness  then break them  and what i knew about horses much less about breaking them was just about as much as any sailor knows  having been kicked bucked off fallen over backward upon and thrown out and run over on very numerous occasions i had a mighty vigorous respect for horses but a wifes faith must be lived up to and i went at it  king was a polo pony from st louis and prince a manygaited lovehorse from pasadena  the hardest thing was to get them to dig in and pull they rollicked along on the levels and galloped down the hills but when they struck an upgrade and felt the weight of the breakingcart they stopped and turned around and looked at me  but i passed them and my troubles began  milda was fourteen years old an unadulterated broncho and in temperament was a combination of mule and jackrabbit blended equally  if you pressed your hand on her flank and told her to get over she lay down on you  if you got her by the head and told her to back she walked forward over you  and if you got behind her and shoved and told her to giddap she sat down on you  also she wouldnt walk  for endless weary miles i strove with her but never could i get her to walk a step  finally she was a mangerglutton  no matter how near or far from the stable when six oclock came around she bolted for home and never missed the directest crossroad  many times i rejected her  the fourth and most rejected horse of all was the outlaw  from the age of three to seven she had defied all horsebreakers and broken a number of them  then a long lanky cowboy with a fiftypound saddle and a mexican bit had got her proud goat  i was the next owner  she was my favourite riding horse  charmian said id have to put her in as a wheeler where i would have more control over her  now charmian had a favourite riding mare called maid  i suggested maid as a substitute charmian pointed out that my mare was a branded range horse while hers was a nearthoroughbred and that the legs of her mare would be ruined forever if she were driven for three months  i acknowledged her mares thoroughbredness and at the same time defied her to find any thoroughbred with as small and delicatelyviciously pointed ears as my outlaw  she indicated maids exquisitely thin shinbone  i measured the outlaws  it was equally thin although i insinuated possibly more durable  this stabbed charmians pride  of course her nearthoroughbred maid carrying the blood of old lexington morella and a streak of the superenduring morgan could run walk and work my unregistered outlaw into the ground and that was the very precise reason why such a paragon of a saddle animal should not be degraded by harness  so it was that charmian remained obdurate until one day i got her behind the outlaw for a fortymile drive  for every inch of those forty miles the outlaw kicked and jumped in between the kicks and jumps finding time and space in which to seize its teammate by the back of the neck and attempt to drag it to the ground  another trick the outlaw developed during that drive was suddenly to turn at right angles in the traces and endeavour to butt its teammate over the grade  reluctantly and nobly did charmian give in and consent to the use of maid  the outlaws shoes were pulled off and she was turned out on range  finally the four horses were hooked to the riga light studebaker trap with two hours and a half of practice in which the excitement was not abated by several jackpoles and numerous kicking matches i announced myself as ready for the start  came the morning and prince who was to have been a wheeler with maid showed up with a badly kicked shoulder  he did not exactly show up we had to find him for he was unable to walk his leg swelled and continually swelled during the several days we waited for him  remained only the outlaw  in from pasture she came shoes were nailed on and she was harnessed into the wheel  friends and relatives strove to press accident policies on me but charmian climbed up alongside and nakata got into the rear seat with the typewriternakata who sailed cabinboy on the snark for two years and who had shown himself afraid of nothing not even of me and my amateur jamborees in experimenting with new modes of locomotion  and we did very nicely thank you especially after the first hour or so during which time the outlaw had kicked about fifty various times chiefly to the damage of her own legs and the paintwork and after she had bitten a couple of hundred times to the damage of maids neck and charmians temper  it was hard enough to have her favourite mare in the harness without also enduring the spectacle of its being eaten alive  our leaders were joys  king being a polo pony and milda a rabbit they rounded curves beautifully and darted ahead like coyotes out of the way of the wheelers  mildas besetting weakness was a frantic desire not to have the leadbar strike her hocks  when this happened one of three things occurred either she sat down on the leadbar kicked it up in the air until she got her back under it or exploded in a straightahead harnessdisrupting jump  not until she carried the leadbar clean away and danced a breakdown on it and the traces did she behave decently nakata and i made the repairs with good oldfashioned balerope which is stronger than wroughtiron any time and we went on our way  in the meantime i was learningi shall not say to tool a fourinhandbut just simply to drive four horses  now it is all right enough to begin with four workhorses pulling a load of several tons  but to begin with four light horses all running and a light rig that seems to outrun themwell when things happen they happen quickly  my weakness was total ignorance  in particular my fingers lacked training and i made the mistake of depending on my eyes to handle the reins  this brought me up against a disastrous optical illusion  the bight of the off headline being longer and heavier than that of the off wheelline hung lower  in a moment requiring quick action i invariably mistook the two lines  pulling on what i thought was the wheelline in order to straighten the team i would see the leaders swing abruptly around into a jackpole  now for sensations of sheer impotence nothing can compare with a jackpole when the horrified driver beholds his leaders prancing gaily up the road and his wheelers jogging steadily down the road all at the same time and all harnessed together and to the same rig  i no longer jackpole and i dont mind admitting how i got out of the habit  it was my eyes that enslaved my fingers into ill practices  so i shut my eyes and let the fingers go it alone  today my fingers are independent of my eyes and work automatically  i do not see what my fingers do  they just do it  all i see is the satisfactory result  still we managed to get over the ground that first daydown sunny sonoma valley to the old town of sonoma founded by general vallejo as the remotest outpost on the northern frontier for the purpose of holding back the gentiles as the wild indians of those days were called  here history was made  here the last spanish mission was reared here the bear flag was raised and here kit carson and fremont and all our early adventurers came and rested in the days before the days of gold  we swung on over the low rolling hills through miles of dairy farms and chicken ranches where every blessed hen is white and down the slopes to petaluma valley  here in 1776 captain quiros came up petaluma creek from san pablo bay in quest of an outlet to bodega bay on the coast  and here later the russians with alaskan hunters carried skin boats across from fort ross to poach for seaotters on the spanish preserve of san francisco bay  here too still later general vallejo built a fort which still standsone of the finest examples of spanish adobe that remain to us  and here at the old fort to bring the chronicle up to date our horses proceeded to make peculiarly personal history with astonishing success and dispatch  king our peerless polopony leader went lame  so hopelessly lame did he go that no expert then and afterward could determine whether the lameness was in his frogs hoofs legs shoulders or head  maid picked up a nail and began to limp milda figuring the day already sufficiently spent and maniacal with mangergluttony began to rabbitjump  all that held her was the bale rope  and the outlaw game to the last exceeded all previous exhibitions of skinremoving paintmarring and horseeating  at petaluma we rested over while king was returned to the ranch and prince sent to us  now prince had proved himself an excellent wheeler yet he had to go into the lead and let the outlaw retain his old place there is an axiom that a good wheeler is a poor leader  i object to the last adjective  a good wheeler makes an infinitely worse kind of a leader than that  i know    now  i ought to know  since that day i have driven prince a few hundred miles in the lead  he is neither any better nor any worse than the first mile he ran in the lead and his worst is even extremely worse than what you are thinking  not that he is vicious  he is merely a goodnatured rogue who shakes hands for sugar steps on your toes out of sheer excessive friendliness and just goes on loving you in your harshest moments  but he wont get out of the way  also whenever he is reproved for being in the wrong he accuses milda of it and bites the back of her neck  so bad has this become that whenever i yell prince in a loud voice milda immediately rabbitjumps to the side straight ahead or sits down on the leadbar  all of which is quite disconcerting  picture it yourself  you are swinging round a sharp downgrade mountain curve at a fast trot the rock wall is the outside of the curve  the inside of the curve is a precipice  the continuance of the curve is a narrow unrailed bridge you hit the curve throwing the leaders in against the wall and making the polohorse do the work  all is lovely  the leaders are hugging the wall like nestling doves  but the moment comes in the evolution when the leaders must shoot out ahead  they really must shoot or else theyll hit the wall and miss the bridge  also behind them are the wheelers and the rig and you have just eased the brake in order to put sufficient snap into the manoeuvre  if ever teamwork is required now is the time milda tries to shoot  she does her best but prince bubbling over with roguishness lags behind  he knows the trick  milda is half a length ahead of him  he times it to the fraction of a second  maid in the wheel overrunning him naturally bites him  this disturbs the outlaw who has been behaving beautifully and she immediately reaches across for maid  simultaneously with a fine display of firm conviction that its all mildas fault prince sinks his teeth into the back of mildas defenceless neck  the whole thing has occurred in less than a second under the surprise and pain of the bite milda either jumps ahead to the imminent peril of harness and leadbar or smashes into the wall stops short with the leadbar over her back and emits a couple of hysterical kicks  the outlaw invariably selects this moment to remove paint  and after things are untangled and you have had time to appreciate the close shave you go up to prince and reprove him with your choicest vocabulary and prince gazelleeyed and tender offers to shake hands with you for sugar  i leave it to any one a boat would never act that way  we have some history north of the bay  nearly three centuries and a half ago that doughty pirate and explorer sir francis drake combing the pacific for spanish galleons anchored in the bight formed by point reyes on which today is one of the richest dairy regions in the world here less than two decades after drake sebastien carmenon piled up on the rocks with a silkladen galleon from the philippines  and in this same bay of drake long afterward the russian furpoachers rendezvousd their bidarkas and stole in through the golden gate to the forbidden waters of san francisco bay  farther up the coast in sonoma county we pilgrimaged to the sites of the russian settlements  at bodega bay south of what today is called russian river was their anchorage while north of the river they built their fort  and much of fort ross still stands  logbastions church and stables hold their own and so well with rusty hinges creaking that we warmed ourselves at the hundredyearsold double fireplace and slept under the handhewn roof beams still held together by spikes of handwrought iron  we went to see where history had been made and we saw scenery as well one of our stretches in a days drive was from beautiful inverness on tomales bay down the olema valley to bolinas bay along the eastern shore of that body of water to willow camp and up over the seabluffs around the bastions of tamalpais and down to sausalito  from the head of bolinas bay to willow camp the drive on the edge of the beach and actually for halfmile stretches in the waters of the bay itself was a delightful experience  the wonderful part was to come  very few san franciscans much less californians know of that drive from willow camp to the south and east along the poppyblown cliffs with the sea thundering in the sheer depths hundreds of feet below and the golden gate opening up ahead disclosing smoky san francisco on her many hills  far off blurred on the breast of the sea can be seen the farallones which sir francis drake passed on a s w course in the thick of what he describes as a stynking fog  well might he call it that and a few other names for it was the fog that robbed him of the glory of discovering san francisco bay  it was on this part of the drive that i decided at last i was learning real mountaindriving  to confess the truth for delicious titillation of ones nerve i have since driven over no mountain road that was worse or better rather than that piece  and then the contrast  from sausalito over excellent parklike boulevards through the splendid redwoods and homes of mill valley across the blossomed hills of marin county along the knollstudded picturesque marshes past san rafael resting warmly among her hills over the divide and up the petaluma valley and on to the grassy feet of sonoma mountain and home  we covered fiftyfive miles that day  not so bad eh for prince the rogue the paintremoving outlaw the thinshanked thoroughbred and the rabbitjumper  and they came in cool and dry ready for their mangers and the straw  oh we didnt stop  we considered we were just starting and that was many weeks ago  we have kept on going over six counties which are comfortably large even for california and we are still going  we have twisted and tabled crisscrossed our tracks made fascinating and lengthy dives into the interior valleys in the hearts of napa and lake counties travelled the coast for hundreds of miles on end and are now in eureka on humboldt bay which was discovered by accident by the gold seekers who were trying to find their way to and from the trinity diggings  even here the white mans history preceded them for dim tradition says that the russians once anchored here and hunted seaotter before the first yankee trader rounded the horn or the first rocky mountain trapper thirsted across the great american desert and trickled down the snowy sierras to the sunkissed land  no we are not resting our horses here on humboldt bay  we are writing this article gorging on abalones and mussels digging clams and catching recordbreaking sea trout and rockcod in the intervals in which we are not sailing motor boating and swimming in the most temperately equable climate we have ever experienced  these comfortably large counties  they are veritable empires  take humboldt for instance  it is three times as large as rhode island one and a half times as large as delaware almost as large as connecticut and half as large as massachusetts  the pioneer has done his work in this north of the bay region the foundations are laid and all is ready for the inevitable inrush of population and adequate development of resources which so far have been no more than skimmed and casually and carelessly skimmed at that  this region of the six counties alone will some day support a population of millions  in the meanwhile o you home seekers you wealthseekers and above all you climateseekers now is the time to get in on the ground floor  robert ingersoll once said that the genial climate of california would in a fairly brief time evolve a race resembling the mexicans and that in two or three generations the californians would be seen of a sunday morning on their way to a cockfight with a rooster under each arm  never was made a rasher generalisation based on so absolute an ignorance of facts  it is to laugh  here is a climate that breeds vigour with just sufficient geniality to prevent the expenditure of most of that vigour in fighting the elements  here is a climate where a man can work three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year without the slightest hint of enervation and where for three hundred and sixtyfive nights he must perforce sleep under blankets  what more can one say  i consider myself somewhat of climate expert having adventured among most of the climates of five out of the six zones  i have not yet been in the antarctic but whatever climate obtains there will not deter me from drawing the conclusion that nowhere is there a climate to compare with that of this region  maybe i am as wrong as ingersoll was  nevertheless i take my medicine by continuing to live in this climate  also it is the only medicine i ever take  but to return to the horses  there is some improvement  milda has actually learned to walk  maid has proved her thoroughbredness by never tiring on the longest days and while being the strongest and highest spirited of all by never causing any trouble save for an occasional kick at the outlaw  and the outlaw rarely gallops no longer butts only periodically kicks comes in to the pole and does her work without attempting to vivisect maids medulla oblongata andmarvel of marvelsis really and truly getting lazy  but prince remains the same incorrigible loving and lovable rogue he has always been  and the country weve been over  the drives through napa and lake counties  one from sonoma valley via santa rosa we could not refrain from taking several ways and on all the ways we found the roads excellent for machines as well as horses  one route and a more delightful one for an automobile cannot be found is out from santa rosa past old altruria and mark west springs then to the right and across to calistoga in napa valley  by keeping to the left the drive holds on up the russian river valley through the miles of the noted asti vineyards to cloverdale and then by way of pieta witter and highland springs to lakeport  still another way we took was down sonoma valley skirting san pablo bay and up the lovely napa valley  from napa were side excursions through pope and berryessa valleys on to aetna springs and still on into lake county crossing the famous langtry ranch  continuing up the napa valley walled on either hand by great rock palisades and redwood forests and carpeted with endless vineyards and crossing the many stone bridges for which the county is noted and which are a joy to the beautyloving eyes as well as to the fourhorse tyro driver past calistoga with its old mudbaths and chickensoup springs with st helena and its giant saddle ever towering before us we climbed the mountains on a good grade and dropped down past the quicksilver mines to the canyon of the geysers  after a stop over night and an exploration of the miniaturegrand volcanic scene we pulled on across the canyon and took the grade where the cicadas simmered audibly in the noon sunshine among the hillside manzanitas  then higher came the big cattledotted upland pastures and the rocky summit  and here on the summit abruptly we caught a vision or what seemed a mirage  the ocean we had left long days before yet far down and away shimmered a blue sea framed on the farther shore by rugged mountains on the near shore by fat and rolling farm lands  clear lake was before us and like proper sailors we returned to our sea going for a sail a fish and a swim ere the day was done and turning into tired lakeport blankets in the early evening  well has lake county been called the walledin county  but the railroad is coming  they say the approach we made to clear lake is similar to the approach to lake lucerne  be that as it may the scenery with its distant snowcapped peaks can well be called alpine  and what can be more exquisite than the drive out from clear lake to ukiah by way of the blue lakes chainevery turn bringing into view a picture of breathless beauty every glance backward revealing some perfect composition in line and colour the intense blue of the water margined with splendid oaks green fields and swaths of orange poppies but those side glances and backward glances were provocative of trouble charmian and i disagreed as to which way the connecting stream of water ran  we still disagree for at the hotel where we submitted the affair to arbitration the hotel manager and the clerk likewise disagreed  i assume now that we never will know which way that stream runs  charmian suggests both ways  i refuse such a compromise  no stream of water i ever saw could accomplish that feat at one and the same time  the greatest concession i can make is that sometimes it may run one way and sometimes the other and that in the meantime we should both consult an oculist  more valley from ukiah to willits and then we turned westward through the virgin sherwood forest of magnificent redwood stopping at alpine for the night and continuing on through mendocino county to fort bragg and salt water  we also came to fort bragg up the coast from fort ross keeping our coast journey intact from the golden gate  the coast weather was cool and delightful the coast driving superb  especially in the fort ross section did we find the roads thrilling while all the way along we followed the sea  at every stream the road skirted dizzy cliff edges dived down into lush growths of forest and ferns and climbed out along the cliffedges again  the way was lined with flowerswild lilac wild roses poppies and lupins  such lupinsgiant clumps of them of every lupinshade andcolour  and it was along the mendocino roads that charmian caused many delays by insisting on getting out to pick the wild blackberries strawberries and thimbleberries which grew so profusely and ever we caught peeps far down of steam schooners loading lumber in the rocky coves ever we skirted the cliffs day after day crossing stretches of rolling farm lands and passing through thriving villages and sawmill towns  memorable was our launchtrip from mendocino city up big river where the steering gears of the launches work the reverse of anywhere else in the world where we saw a stream of logs of six to twelve and fifteen feet in diameter which filled the river bed for miles to the obliteration of any sign of water and where we were told of a white or albino redwood tree  we did not see this last so cannot vouch for it  all the streams were filled with trout and more than once we saw the sidehill salmon on the slopes  no sidehill salmon is not a peripatetic fish it is a deer out of season  but the trout  at gualala charmian caught her first one  once before in my life i had caught two    on angleworms  on occasion i had tried fly and spinner and never got a strike and i had come to believe that all this talk of flyfishing was just so much naturefaking  but on the gualala river i caught trouta lot of themon fly and spinners and i was beginning to feel quite an expert until nakata fishing on bottom with a pellet of bread for bait caught the biggest trout of all  i now affirm there is nothing in science nor in art  nevertheless since that day poles and baskets have been added to our baggage we tackle every stream we come to and we no longer are able to remember the grand total of our catch  at usal many hilly and picturesque miles north of fort bragg we turned again into the interior of mendocino crossing the ranges and coming out in humboldt county on the south fork of eel river at garberville throughout the trip from marin county north we had been warned of bad roads ahead  yet we never found those bad roads  we seemed always to be just ahead of them or behind them  the farther we came the better the roads seemed though this was probably due to the fact that we were learning more and more what four horses and a light rig could do on a road  and thus do i save my face with all the counties  i refuse to make invidious road comparisons  i can add that while save in rare instances on steep pitches i have trotted my horses down all the grades i have never had one horse fall down nor have i had to send the rig to a blacksmith shop for repairs  also i am learning to throw leather  if any tyro thinks it is easy to take a shorthandled longlashed whip and throw the end of that lash just where he wants it let him put on automobile goggles and try it  on reconsideration i would suggest the substitution of a wire fencingmask for the goggles  for days i looked at that whip  it fascinated me and the fascination was composed mostly of fear  at my first attempt charmian and nakata became afflicted with the same sort of fascination and for a long time afterward whenever they saw me reach for the whip they closed their eyes and shielded their heads with their arms  heres the problem  instead of pulling honestly prince is lagging back and manoeuvring for a bite at mildas neck  i have four reins in my hands  i must put these four reins into my left hand properly gather the whip handle and the bight of the lash in my right hand and throw that lash past maid without striking her and into prince  if the lash strikes maid her thoroughbredness will go up in the air and ill have a case of horse hysteria on my hands for the next half hour  but follow the whole problem is not yet stated  suppose that i miss maid and reach the intended target  the instant the lash cracks the four horses jump prince most of all and his jump with spread wicked teeth is for the back of mildas neck  she jumps to escapewhich is her second jump for the first one came when the lash exploded  the outlaw reaches for maids neck and maid who has already jumped and tried to bolt tries to bolt harder  and all this infinitesimal fraction of time i am trying to hold the four animals with my left hand while my whiplash writhing through the air is coming back to me  three simultaneous things i must do keep hold of the four reins with my left hand slam on the brake with my foot and on the rebound catch that flying lash in the hollow of my right arm and get the bight of it safely into my right hand  then i must get two of the four lines back into my right hand and keep the horses from running away or going over the grade  try it some time  you will find life anything but wearisome  why the first time i hit the mark and made the lash go off like a revolver shot i was so astounded and delighted that i was paralysed  i forgot to do any of the multitudinous other things tangled the whip lash in maids harness and was forced to call upon charmian for assistance  and now confession  i carry a few pebbles handy  theyre great for reaching prince in a tight place  but just the same im learning that whip every day and before i get home i hope to discard the pebbles  and as long as i rely on pebbles i cannot truthfully speak of myself as tooling a fourinhand  from garberville where we ate eel to repletion and got acquainted with the aborigines we drove down the eel river valley for two days through the most unthinkably glorious body of redwood timber to be seen anywhere in california  from dyerville on to eureka we caught glimpses of railroad construction and of great concrete bridges in the course of building which advertised that at least humboldt county was going to be linked to the rest of the world  we still consider our trip is just begun  as soon as this is mailed from eureka its heigh ho for the horses and pull on  we shall continue up the coast turn in for hoopa reservation and the gold mines and shoot down the trinity and klamath rivers in indian canoes to requa  after that we shall go on through del norte county and into oregon  the trip so far has justified us in taking the attitude that we wont go home until the winter rains drive us in  and finally i am going to try the experiment of putting the outlaw in the lead and relegating prince to his old position in the near wheel  i wont need any pebbles then     nothing that ever came to anything   it was at quito the mountain capital of ecuador that the following passage at correspondence took place  having occasion to buy a pair of shoes in a shop six feet by eight in size and with walls three feet thick i noticed a mangy leopard skin on the floor  i had no spanish the shopkeeper had no english  but i was an adept at sign language  i wanted to know where i should go to buy leopard skins  on my scribble pad i drew the interesting streets of a city  then i drew a small shop which after much effort i persuaded the proprietor into recognising as his shop  next i indicated in my drawing that on the many streets there were many shops  and finally i made myself into a living interrogation mark pointing all the while from the mangy leopard skin to the many shops i had sketched  but the proprietor failed to follow me  so did his assistant  the street came in to helpthat is as many as could crowd into the sixby eight shop while those that could not force their way in held an overflow meeting on the sidewalk  the proprietor and the rest took turns at talking to me in rapidfire spanish and from the expressions on their faces all concluded that i was remarkably stupid  again i went through my programme pointing on the sketch from the one shop to the many shops pointing out that in this particular shop was one leopard skin and then questing interrogatively with my pencil among all the shops  all regarded me in blank silence until i saw comprehension suddenly dawn on the face of a small boy  tigres montanya he cried  this appealed to me as mountain tigers namely leopards and in token that he understood the boy made signs for me to follow him which i obeyed  he led me for a quarter of a mile and paused before the doorway of a large building where soldiers slouched on sentry duty and in and out of which went other soldiers  motioning for me to remain he ran inside  fifteen minutes later he was out again without leopard skins but full of information  by means of my card of my hotel card of my watch and of the boys fingers i learned the following that at six oclock that evening he would arrive at my hotel with ten leopard skins for my inspection  further i learned that the skins were the property of one captain ernesto becucci  also i learned that the boys name was eliceo  the boy was prompt  at six oclock he was at my room  in his hand was a small roll addressed to me  on opening it i found it to be manuscript piano music the hora tranquila valse or tranquil hour waltz by ernesto becucci  i came for leopard skins thought i and the owner sends me sheet music instead  but the boy assured me that he would have the skins at the hotel at nine next morning and i entrusted to him the following letter of acknowledgment     dear captain becucci     a thousand thanks for your kind presentation of hora tranquila    valse  mrs london will play it for me this evening     sincerely yours     jack london  next morning eliceo was back but without the skins  instead he gave me a letter written in spanish of which the following is a free translation     to my dearest and always appreciated friend i submit myself     dear sir     i sent you last night an offering by the bearer of this note and you    returned me a letter which i translated     be it known to you sir that i am giving this waltz away in the best    society and therefore to your honoured self  therefore it is    beholden to you to recognise the attention i mean by a tangible    return as this composition was made by myself  you will therefore    send by your humble servant the bearer any offering however minute    that you may be prompted to make  send it under cover of an envelope    the bearer may be trusted     i did not indulge in the pleasure of visiting your honourable self    this morning as i find my body not to be enjoying the normal exercise    of its functions     as regards the skins from the mountain you shall be waited on by a    small boy at seven oclock at night with ten skins from which you may    select those which most satisfy your aspirations     in the hope that you will look upon this in the same light as myself    i beg to be allowed to remain     your most faithful servant     captain ernesto becucci  well thought i this captain ernesto becucci has shown himself to be such an undependable person that while i dont mind rewarding him for his composition i fear me if i do i never shall lay eyes on those leopard skins  so to eliceo i gave this letter for the captain     my dear captain becucci     have the boy bring the skins at seven oclock this evening when i    shall be glad to look at them  this evening when the boy brings the    skins i shall be pleased to give him in an envelope for you a    tangible return for your musical composition     please put the price on each skin and also let me know for what sum    all the skins will sell together     sincerely yours     jack london  now thought i i have him  no skins no tangible return and evidently he is set on receiving that tangible return  at seven oclock eliceo was back but without leopard skins  he handed me this letter     senor london     i wish to instil in you the belief that i lost today at half past    three in the afternoon the key to my cubicle  while distributing    rations to the soldiers i dropped it  i see in this loss the act of    god     i received a letter from your honourable self delivered by the one    who bears you this poor response of mine  tomorrow i will burst open    the door to permit me to keep my word with you  i feel myself    eternally shamed not to be able to dominate the evils that afflict    colonial mankind  please send me the trifle that you offered me  send    me this proof of your appreciation by the bearer who is to be    trusted  also give to him a small sum of money for himself and earn    the undying gratitude of     your most faithful servant     captain ernesto becucci  also inclosed in the foregoing letter was the following original poem a propos neither of leopard skins nor tangible returns so far as i can make out     effusion     thou canst not weep    nor ask i for a year    to rid me of my woes    or make my life more dear     the mystic chains that bound    thy allfond heart to mine    alas asundered are    for now and for all time     in vain you strove to hide    from vulgar gaze of man    the burning glance of love    that none but love can scan     go on thy starlit way    and leave me to my fate    our souls must needs unite    but god twill be too late  to all and sundry of which i replied     my dear captain becucci     i regret exceedingly to hear that by act of god at half past three    this afternoon you lost the key to your cubicle  please have the boy    bring the skins at seven oclock tomorrow morning at which time    when he brings the skins i shall be glad to make you that tangible    return for your tranquil hour waltz     sincerely yours     jack london  at seven oclock came no skins but the following     sir     after offering you my most sincere respects i beg to continue by    telling you that no one up to the time of writing has treated me    with such lack of attention  it was a present to gentlemen who were    to retain the piece of music and who have all without exception    made me a present of five dollars  it is beyond my humble capacity to    believe that you after having offered to send me money in an    envelope should fail to do so     send me i pray of you the money to remunerate the small boy for his    repeated visits to you  please be discreet and send it in an envelope    by the bearer     last night i came to the hotel with the boy  you were dining  i    waited more than an hour for you and then went to the theatre  give    the boy some small amount and send me a like offering of larger    proportions     awaiting incessantly a slight attention on your part     captain ernesto becucci  and here like one of george moores realistic studies ends this intercourse with captain ernesto becucci  nothing happened  nothing ever came to anything  he got no tangible return and i got no leopard skins  the tangible return he might have got i presented to eliceo who promptly invested it in a pair of trousers and a ticket to the bullfight  note to editorthis is a faithful narration of what actually happened in quito ecuador     that dead men rise up never   the month in which my seventeenth birthday arrived i signed on before the mast on the sophie sutherland a threetopmast schooner bound on a sevenmonths sealhunting cruise to the coast of japan  we sailed from san francisco and immediately i found confronting me a problem of no inconsiderable proportions  there were twelve men of us in the forecastle ten of whom were hardened tarrythumbed sailors  not alone was i a youth and on my first voyage but i had for shipmates men who had come through the hard school of the merchant service of europe  as boys they had had to perform their ships duty and in addition by immemorial sea custom they had had to be the slaves of the ordinary and ablebodied seamen  when they became ordinary seamen they were still the slaves of the ablebodied  thus in the forecastle with the watch below an able seaman lying in his bunk will order an ordinary seaman to fetch him his shoes or bring him a drink of water  now the ordinary seaman may be lying in his bunk  he is just as tired as the able seaman  yet he must get out of his bunk and fetch and carry  if he refuses he will be beaten  if perchance he is so strong that he can whip the able seaman then all the able seamen or as many as may be necessary pitch upon the luckless devil and administer the beating  my problem now becomes apparent  these hardbit scandinavian sailors had come through a hard school  as boys they had served their mates and as able seamen they looked to be served by other boys  i was a boywithal with a mans body  i had never been to sea beforewithal i was a good sailor and knew my business  it was either a case of holding my own with them or of going under  i had signed on as an equal and an equal i must maintain myself or else endure seven months of hell at their hands  and it was this very equality they resented  by what right was i an equal  i had not earned that high privilege  i had not endured the miseries they had endured as maltreated boys or bullied ordinaries  worse than that i was a landlubber making his first voyage  and yet by the injustice of fate on the ships articles i was their equal  my method was deliberate and simple and drastic  in the first place i resolved to do my work no matter how hard or dangerous it might be so well that no man would be called upon to do it for me  further i put ginger in my muscles  i never malingered when pulling on a rope for i knew the eagle eyes of my forecastle mates were squinting for just such evidences of my inferiority  i made it a point to be among the first of the watch going on deck among the last going below never leaving a sheet or tackle for some one else to coil over a pin  i was always eager for the run aloft for the shifting of topsail sheets and tacks or for the setting or taking in of topsails and in these matters i did more than my share  furthermore i was on a hairtrigger of resentment myself  i knew better than to accept any abuse or the slightest patronizing  at the first hint of such i went offi exploded  i might be beaten in the subsequent fight but i left the impression that i was a wildcat and that i would just as willingly fight again  my intention was to demonstrate that i would tolerate no imposition  i proved that the man who imposed on me must have a fight on his hands  and doing my work well the innate justice of the men assisted by their wholesome dislike for a clawing and rending wildcat ruction soon led them to give over their hectoring after a bit of strife my attitude was accepted and it was my pride that i was taken in as an equal in spirit as well as in fact  from then on everything was beautiful and the voyage promised to be a happy one  but there was one other man in the forecastle  counting the scandinavians as ten and myself as the eleventh this man was the twelfth and last  we never knew his name contenting ourselves with calling him the bricklayer  he was from missouriat least he so informed us in the one meagre confidence he was guilty of in the early days of the voyage  also at that time we learned several other things he was a bricklayer by trade  he had never even seen salt water until the week before he joined us at which time he had arrived in san francisco and looked upon san francisco bay  why he of all men at forty years of age should have felt the prod to go to sea was beyond all of us for it was our unanimous conviction that no man less fitted for the sea had ever embarked on it  but to sea he had come  after a weeks stay in a sailors boardinghouse he had been shoved aboard of us as an able seaman  all hands had to do his work for him  not only did he know nothing but he proved himself unable to learn anything  try as they would they could never teach him to steer  to him the compass must have been a profound and awful whirligig  he never mastered its cardinal points much less the checking and steadying of the ship on her course  he never did come to know whether ropes should be coiled from left to right or from right to left  it was mentally impossible for him to learn the easy muscular trick of throwing his weight on a rope in pulling and hauling the simplest knots and turns were beyond his comprehension while he was mortally afraid of going aloft  bullied by captain and mate he was one day forced aloft  he managed to get underneath the crosstrees and there he froze to the ratlines  two sailors had to go after him to help him down  all of which was bad enough had there been no worse  but he was vicious malignant dirty and without common decency  he was a tall powerful man and he fought with everybody  and there was no fairness in his fighting  his first fight on board the first day out was with me when he desiring to cut a plug of chewing tobacco took my personal table knife for the purpose and whereupon i on a hairtrigger promptly exploded  after that he fought with nearly every member of the crew when his clothing became too filthy to be bearable by the rest of us we put it to soak and stood over him while he washed it  in short the bricklayer was one of those horrible and monstrous things that one must see in order to be convinced that they exist  i will only say that he was a beast and that we treated him like a beast  it is only by looking back through the years that i realise how heartless we were to him  he was without sin  he could not by the very nature of things have been anything else than he was  he had not made himself and for his making he was not responsible  yet we treated him as a free agent and held him personally responsible for all that he was and that he should not have been  as a result our treatment of him was as terrible as he was himself terrible  finally we gave him the silent treatment and for weeks before he died we neither spoke to him nor did he speak to us  and for weeks he moved among us or lay in his bunk in our crowded house grinning at us his hatred and malignancy  he was a dying man and he knew it and we knew it  and furthermore he knew that we wanted him to die  he cumbered our life with his presence and ours was a rough life that made rough men of us  and so he died in a small space crowded by twelve men and as much alone as if he had died on some desolate mountain peak  no kindly word no last word was passed between  he died as he had lived a beast and he died hating us and hated by us  and now i come to the most startling moment of my life  no sooner was he dead than he was flung overboard  he died in a night of wind drawing his last breath as the men tumbled into their oilskins to the cry of all hands  and he was flung overboard several hours later on a day of wind  not even a canvas wrapping graced his mortal remains nor was he deemed worthy of bars of iron at his feet  we sewed him up in the blankets in which he died and laid him on a hatchcover forard of the mainhatch on the port side  a gunnysack half full of galley coal was fastened to his feet  it was bitter cold  the weatherside of every rope spar and stay was coated with ice while all the rigging was a harp singing and shouting under the fierce hand of the wind  the schooner hove to lurched and floundered through the sea rolling her scuppers under and perpetually flooding the deck with icy salt water  we of the forecastle stood in sea boots and oilskins  our hands were mittened but our heads were bared in the presence of the death we did not respect  our ears stung and numbed and whitened and we yearned for the body to be gone  but the interminable reading of the burial service went on  the captain had mistaken his place and while he read on without purpose we froze our ears and resented this final hardship thrust upon us by the helpless cadaver  as from the beginning so to the end everything had gone wrong with the bricklayer  finally the captains son irritated beyond measure jerked the book from the palsied fingers of the old man and found the place  again the quavering voice of the captain arose  then came the cue and the body shall be cast into the sea  we elevated one end of the hatchcover and the bricklayer plunged outboard and was gone  back into the forecastle we cleaned house washing out the dead mans bunk and removing every vestige of him  by sea law and sea custom we should have gathered his effects together and turned them over to the captain who later would have held an auction in which we should have bid for the various articles  but no man wanted them so we tossed them up on deck and overboard in the wake of the departed bodythe last ill treatment we could devise to wreak upon the one we had hated so  oh it was raw believe me but the life we lived was raw and we were as raw as the life  the bricklayers bunk was better than mine  less sea water leaked down through the deck into it and the light was better for lying in bed and reading  partly for this reason i proceeded to move into his bunk  my other reason was pride  i saw the sailors were superstitious and by this act i determined to show that i was braver than they  i would cap my proved equality by a deed that would compel their recognition of my superiority  oh the arrogance of youth  but let that pass  the sailors were appalled by my intention  one and all they warned me that in the history of the sea no man had taken a dead mans bunk and lived to the end of the voyage  they instanced case after case in their personal experience  i was obdurate  then they begged and pleaded with me and my pride was tickled in that they showed they really liked me and were concerned about me  this but served to confirm me in my madness  i moved in and lying in the dead mans bunk all afternoon and evening listened to dire prophecies of my future  also were told stories of awful deaths and gruesome ghosts that secretly shivered the hearts of all of us  saturated with this yet scoffing at it i rolled over at the end of the second dogwatch and went to sleep  at ten minutes to twelve i was called and at twelve i was dressed and on deck relieving the man who had called me  on the sealing grounds when hove to a watch of only a single man is kept through the night each man holding the deck for an hour  it was a dark night though not a black one  the gale was breaking up and the clouds were thinning  there should have been a moon and though invisible in some way a dim suffused radiance came from it  i paced back and forth across the deck amidships  my mind was filled with the event of the day and with the horrible tales my shipmates had told and yet i dare to say here and now that i was not afraid  i was a healthy animal and furthermore intellectually i agreed with swinburne that dead men rise up never  the bricklayer was dead and that was the end of it  he would rise up neverat least never on the deck of the sophie sutherland  even then he was in the ocean depths miles to windward of our leeward drift and the likelihood was that he was already portioned out in the maws of many sharks  still my mind pondered on the tales of the ghosts of dead men i had heard and i speculated on the spirit world  my conclusion was that if the spirits of the dead still roamed the world they carried the goodness or the malignancy of the earthlife with them  therefore granting the hypothesis which i didnt grant at all the ghost of the bricklayer was bound to be as hateful and malignant as he in life had been  but there wasnt any bricklayers ghostthat i insisted upon  a few minutes thinking thus i paced up and down  then glancing casually forard along the port side i leaped like a startled deer and in a blind madness of terror rushed aft along the poop heading for the cabin  gone was all my arrogance of youth and my intellectual calm  i had seen a ghost  there in the dim light where we had flung the dead man overboard i had seen a faint and wavering form  sixfeet in length it was slender and of substance so attenuated that i had distinctly seen through it the tracery of the forerigging  as for me i was as panicstricken as a frightened horse  i as i had ceased to exist  through me were vibrating the fibreinstincts of ten thousand generations of superstitious forebears who had been afraid of the dark and the things of the dark  i was not i  i was in truth those ten thousand forebears  i was the race the whole human race in its superstitious infancy  not until part way down the cabincompanionway did my identity return to me  i checked my flight and clung to the steep ladder suffocating trembling and dizzy  never before nor since have i had such a shock  i clung to the ladder and considered  i could not doubt my senses  that i had seen something there was no discussion  but what was it  either a ghost or a joke there could be nothing else  if a ghost the question was would it appear again  if it did not and i aroused the ships officers i would make myself the laughing stock of all on board  and by the same token if it were a joke my position would be still more ridiculous  if i were to retain my hardwon place of equality it would never do to arouse any one until i ascertained the nature of the thing  i am a brave man  i dare to say so for in fear and trembling i crept up the companionway and went back to the spot from which i had first seen the thing  it had vanished  my bravery was qualified however  though i could see nothing i was afraid to go forard to the spot where i had seen the thing  i resumed my pacing up and down and though i cast many an anxious glance toward the dread spot nothing manifested itself  as my equanimity returned to me i concluded that the whole affair had been a trick of the imagination and that i had got what i deserved for allowing my mind to dwell on such matters  once more my glances forard were casual and not anxious and then suddenly i was a madman rushing wildly aft  i had seen the thing again the long wavering attenuated substance through which could be seen the forerigging  this time i had reached only the break of the poop when i checked myself  again i reasoned over the situation and it was pride that counselled strongest  i could not afford to make myself a laughingstock  this thing whatever it was i must face alone  i must work it out myself  i looked back to the spot where we had tilted the bricklayer  it was vacant  nothing moved  and for a third time i resumed my amidships pacing  in the absence of the thing my fear died away and my intellectual poise returned  of course it was not a ghost  dead men did not rise up  it was a joke a cruel joke  my mates of the forecastle by some unknown means were frightening me  twice already must they have seen me run aft  my cheeks burned with shame  in fancy i could hear the smothered chuckling and laughter even then going on in the forecastle  i began to grow angry  jokes were all very well but this was carrying the thing too far  i was the youngest on board only a youth and they had no right to play tricks on me of the order that i well knew in the past had made raving maniacs of men and women  i grew angrier and angrier and resolved to show them that i was made of sterner stuff and at the same time to wreak my resentment upon them  if the thing appeared again i made my mind up that i would go up to itfurthermore that i would go up to it knife in hand  when within striking distance i would strike  if a man he would get the knifethrust he deserved  if a ghost well it wouldnt hurt the ghost any while i would have learned that dead men did rise up  now i was very angry and i was quite sure the thing was a trick but when the thing appeared a third time in the same spot long attenuated and wavering fear surged up in me and drove most of my anger away  but i did not run  nor did i take my eyes from the thing  both times before it had vanished while i was running away so i had not seen the manner of its going  i drew my sheathknife from my belt and began my advance  step by step nearer and nearer the effort to control myself grew more severe  the struggle was between my will my identity my very self on the one hand and on the other the ten thousand ancestors who were twisted into the fibres of me and whose ghostly voices were whispering of the dark and the fear of the dark that had been theirs in the time when the world was dark and full of terror  i advanced more slowly and still the thing wavered and flitted with strange eerie lurches  and then right before my eyes it vanished  i saw it vanish  neither to the right nor left did it go nor backward right there while i gazed upon it it faded away ceased to be  i didnt die but i swear from what i experienced in those few succeeding moments that i know full well that men can die of fright  i stood there knife in hand swaying automatically to the roll of the ship paralysed with fear  had the bricklayer suddenly seized my throat with corporeal fingers and proceeded to throttle me it would have been no more than i expected  dead men did rise up and that would be the most likely thing the malignant bricklayer would do  but he didnt seize my throat  nothing happened  and since nature abhors a status i could not remain there in the one place forever paralysed  i turned and started aft  i did not run  what was the use what chance had i against the malevolent world of ghosts  flight with me was the swiftness of my legs  the pursuit with a ghost was the swiftness of thought  and there were ghosts  i had seen one  and so stumbling slowly aft i discovered the explanation of the seeming  i saw the mizzen topmast lurching across a faint radiance of cloud behind which was the moon  the idea leaped in my brain  i extended the line between the cloudy radiance and the mizzentopmast and found that it must strike somewhere near the forerigging on the port side  even as i did this the radiance vanished  the driving clouds of the breaking gale were alternately thickening and thinning before the face of the moon but never exposing the face of the moon  and when the clouds were at their thinnest it was a very dim radiance that the moon was able to make  i watched and waited  the next time the clouds thinned i looked forard and there was the shadow of the topmast long and attenuated wavering and lurching on the deck and against the rigging  this was my first ghost  once again have i seen a ghost  it proved to be a newfoundland dog and i dont know which of us was the more frightened for i hit that newfoundland a full rightarm swing to the jaw  regarding the bricklayers ghost i will say that i never mentioned it to a soul on board  also i will say that in all my life i never went through more torment and mental suffering than on that lonely nightwatch on the sophie sutherland  to the editorthis is not a fiction  it is a true page out of my life     a classic of the sea      introduction to two years before the mast  once in a hundred years is a book written that lives not alone for its own century but which becomes a document for the future centuries  such a book is danas  when marryats and coopers sea novels are gone to dust stimulating and joyful as they have been to generations of men still will remain two years before the mast  paradoxical as it may seem danas book is the classic of the sea not because there was anything extraordinary about dana but for the precise contrary reason that he was just an ordinary normal man clearseeing hardheaded controlled fitted with adequate education to go about the work  he brought a trained mind to put down with untroubled vision what he saw of a certain phase of workaday life  there was nothing brilliant nor flyaway about him  he was not a genius  his heart never rode his head  he was neither overlorded by sentiment nor hagridden by imagination  otherwise he might have been guilty of the beautiful exaggerations in melvilles typee or the imaginative orgies in the latters moby dick  it was danas cool poise that saved him from being spreadeagled and flogged when two of his mates were so treated it was his lack of abandon that prevented him from taking up permanently with the sea that prevented him from seeing more than one poetical spot and more than one romantic spot on all the coast of old california  yet these apparent defects were his strength  they enabled him magnificently to write and for all time the picture of the sealife of his time  written close to the middle of the last century such has been the revolution worked in mans method of trafficking with the sea that the life and conditions described in danas book have passed utterly away gone are the crack clippers the driving captains the hardbitten but efficient foremast hands  remain only crawling cargo tanks dirty tramps greyhound liners and a sombre sordid type of sailing ship  the only records broken today by sailing vessels are those for slowness they are no longer built for speed nor are they manned before the mast by as sturdy a sailor stock nor aft the mast are they officered by sail carrying captains and driving mates  speed is left to the liners who run the silk and tea and spices admiralty courts boards of trade and underwriters frown upon driving and sailcarrying  no more are the freeandeasy daredevil days when fortunes were made in fast runs and lucky ventures not alone for owners but for captains as well  nothing is ventured now  the risks of swift passages cannot be abided  freights are calculated to the last least fraction of per cent  the captains do no speculating no bargainmaking for the owners  the latter attend to all this and by wire and cable rake the ports of the seven seas in quest of cargoes and through their agents make all business arrangements  it has been learned that small crews only and large carriers only can return a decent interest on the investment  the inevitable corollary is that speed and spirit are at a discount  there is no discussion of the fact that in the sailing merchant marine the seamen as a class have sadly deteriorated  men no longer sell farms to go to sea  but the time of which dana writes was the heyday of fortunemaking and adventure on the seawith the full connotation of hardship and peril always attendant  it was danas fortune for the sake of the picture that the pilgrim was an average ship with an average crew and officers and managed with average discipline  even the hazing that took place after the california coast was reached was of the average sort  the pilgrim savoured not in any way of a hellship  the captain while not the sweetestnatured man in the world was only an average downeast driver neither brilliant nor slovenly in his seamanship neither cruel nor sentimental in the treatment of his men  while on the one hand there were no extra liberty days no delicacies added to the meagre forecastle fare nor grog or hot coffee on double watches on the other hand the crew were not chronically crippled by the continual play of knuckledusters and belaying pins  once and once only were men flogged or ironeda very fair average for the year 1834 for at that time flogging on board merchant vessels was already well on the decline  the difference between the sealife then and now can be no better epitomised than in danas description of the dress of the sailor of his day  the trousers tight around the hips and thence hanging long and loose around the feet a superabundance of checked shirt a lowcrowned well varnished black hat worn on the back of the head with half a fathom of black ribbon hanging over the left eye and a peculiar tie to the black silk neckerchief  though dana sailed from boston only threequarters of a century ago much that is at present obsolete was then in full sway  for instance the old word larboard was still in use  he was a member of the larboard watch  the vessel was on the larboard tack  it was only the other day because of its similarity in sound to starboard that larboard was changed to port  try to imagine all larboard bowlines on deck being shouted down into the forecastle of a present day ship  yet that was the call used on the pilgrim to fetch dana and the rest of his watch on deck  the chronometer which is merely the least imperfect timepiece man has devised makes possible the surest and easiest method by far of ascertaining longitude  yet the pilgrim sailed in a day when the chronometer was just coming into general use  so little was it depended upon that the pilgrim carried only one and that one going wrong at the outset was never used again  a navigator of the present would be aghast if asked to voyage for two years from boston around the horn to california and back again without a chronometer  in those days such a proceeding was a matter of course for those were the days when dead reckoning was indeed something to reckon on when running down the latitude was a common way of finding a place and when lunar observations were direly necessary  it may be fairly asserted that very few merchant officers of today ever make a lunar observation and that a large percentage are unable to do it  sept 22nd upon coming on deck at seven bells in the morning we found the other watch aloft throwing water upon the sails and looking astern we saw a small clipperbuilt brig with a black hull heading directly after us  we went to work immediately and put all the canvas upon the brig which we could get upon her rigging out oars for studdingsail yards and contined wetting down the sails by buckets of water whipped up to the masthead    she was armed and full of men and showed no colours  the foregoing sounds like a paragraph from midshipman easy or the water witch rather than a paragraph from the soberest faithfullest and most literal chronicle of the sea ever written  and yet the chase by a pirate occurred on board the brig pilgrim on september 22nd 1834something like only two generations ago  dana was the thoroughgoing type of man not overbalanced and erratic without quirk or quibble of temperament  he was efficient but not brilliant  his was a general allround efficiency  he was efficient at the law he was efficient at college he was efficient as a sailor he was efficient in the matter of pride when that pride was no more than the pride of a forecastle hand at twelve dollars a month in his seamans task well done in the smart sailing of his captain in the clearness and trimness of his ship  there is no sailor whose cockles of the heart will not warm to danas description of the first time he sent down a royal yard  once or twice he had seen it done  he got an old hand in the crew to coach him  and then the first anchorage at monterey being pretty thick with the second mate he got him to ask the mate to be sent up the first time the royal yards were struck  fortunately as dana describes it i got through without any word from the officer and heard the well done of the mate when the yard reached the deck with as much satisfaction as i ever felt at cambridge on seeing a bene at the foot of a latin exercise  this was the first time i had taken a weather earring and i felt not a little proud to sit astride of the weather yardarm past the earring and sing out haul out to leeward  he had been over a year at sea before he essayed this able seamans task but he did it and he did it with pride  and with pride he went down a fourhundred foot cliff on a pair of topgallant studdingsail halyards bent together to dislodge several dollars worth of stranded bullock hides though all the acclaim he got from his mates was what a dd fool you were to risk your life for half a dozen hides  in brief it was just this efficiency in pride as well as work that enabled dana to set down not merely the photograph detail of life before the mast and hidedroghing on the coast of california but of the untarnished simple psychology and ethics of the forecastle hands who droghed the hides stood at the wheel made and took in sail tarred down the rigging holystoned the decks turned in allstanding grumbled as they cut about the kid criticised the seamanship of their officers and estimated the duration of their exile from the cubic space of the hide house  jack london glen ellen california august 13 1911    a wicked woman curtain raiser by jack

conviction  eight at least  loretta  reproachfully still weeping  you told me it was all right  billy  emphatically  so it was all rightuntil you said you wouldnt marry me after all  then it was a scandalonly no one knows it yet  if you marry me no one ever will know it  looks at watch  ive got to go  stands up  wheres my hat  loretta  sobbing  this is awful  billy  approvingly  you bet its

hastily tries to kiss her succeeds only in shaking hand starts across stage toward left  all right  you write to me  write tomorrow  stops for a moment in doorway and speaks very solemnly  remember loretta there must be no scandal  billy goes out  loretta sits in chair quietly weeping  slowly dries eyes rises from chair and stands undecided as to what she will do next  ned enters from right peeping  discovers that loretta is alone and comes quietly across stage to her  when ned comes up to her she begins weeping again and tries to turn her head away  ned catches both her hands in his and compels her to look at him  she weeps harder  ned  putting one arm protectingly around her shoulder and drawing her toward him  there there little one dont cry  loretta  turning her face to his shoulder like a tired child sobbing oh ned if you only knew how wicked i am  ned  smiling indulgently  what is the matter little one  has your dearly beloved sister failed to write to you  loretta

and then the other and looks at them  leaving card and parcel on table she struts around like a man looks at pictures of pugilists on walls reading aloud their names and making appropriate remarks  but she stops before the portrait of fitzsimmons and reads aloud  robert fitzsimmons the greatest warrior of them all  clasps hands and looking up at portrait murmurs  oh you dear  continues strutting around imitating what she considers are a mans stride and swagger returns to table and proceeds to unwrap parcel well ill go out like a girl if i did come in like a man  drops wrapping paper on table and holds up a womans long automobile cloak and a motor bonnet  is suddenly startled by sound of approaching footsteps and glances in a frightened way toward door  mercy  here comes somebody now  glances about her in alarm drops cloak and bonnet on floor close to table seizes a handful of newspapers and runs to large leather chair to right of table where she seats herself hurriedly  one paper she holds up before her hiding her face as she pretends to read unfortunately the paper is upside down  the other papers lie on her lap  enter robert fitzsimmons  he looks about advances to table takes out cigarette case and is about to select one when he notices motor cloak and bonnet on floor  he lays cigarette case on table and picks them up  they strike him as profoundly curious things to be in a club room  he looks at maud then sees card on table  he picks it up and reach it to himself then looks at her with comprehension  hidden by her newspaper she sees nothing  he looks at card again and reads and speaks in an aside  fitzsimmons  maudie  john h sylvester  that must be jack sylvesters sister maud  fitzsimmons shows by his expression that he is going to play a joke  tossing cloak and bonnet under the table he places card in his vest pocket selects a chair sits down and looks at maud he notes paper is upside down is hugely tickled and laughs silently hello  newspaper is agitated by slight tremor  he speaks more loudly hello  newspaper shakes badly  he speaks very loudly  hello  maud  peeping at him over top of paper and speaking hesitatingly  hh hello  fitzsimmons  gruffly  you are a queer one reading a paper upside down  maud  lowering newspaper and trying to appear at ease  its quite a trick isnt it  i often practise it  im real clever at it you know

 fitzsimmons  glad to see you harry  he wrings her hand so that it hurts  glad to see you again harry  he continues wringing her hand and pumping her arm  maud  struggling to withdraw her hand and finally succeeding  her voice is rather faint  yees er    bob    er    glad to see you again  she looks ruefully at her bruised fingers and sinks into chair  then recollecting her part she crosses her legs in a mannish way  fitzsimmons  crossing to desk at right against which he leans facing her  you were a wild young rascal in those san francisco days chuckling  lord lord how it all comes back to

fighters horrid  fitzsimmons  they are men  maud  but there is so much crookedness in the game  one hears about it all the time  fitzsimmons  there are crooked men in every business and profession  the best fighters are not crooked  maud  ieri thought they all faked fights when there was enough in it  fitzsimmons  not the best ones  maud  did youerever fake a fight  fitzsimmons  looking at her sharply then speaking solemnly  yes once  maud  shocked speaking sadly  and i always heard of you and thought of you as the one clean champion who never faked  fitzsimmons  gently and seriously  let me tell you about it  it was down in australia  i had just begun to fight my way up  it was with old bill hobart out at rushcutters bay  i threw the fight to him  maud  repelled disgusted  oh  i could not have believed it of you  fitzsimmons  let me tell you about it  bill was an old fighter  not an old man you know but hed been in the fighting game a long time  he was about thirtyeight and a gamer man never entered the ring  but he was in hard luck  younger fighters were coming up and he was being crowded out  at that time it wasnt often he got a fight and the purses were small  besides it was a drought year in australia  you dont know what that means  it means that the rangers are starved  it means that the sheep are starved and die by the millions  it means that there is no money and no work and that the men and women and kiddies starve  bill hobart had a missus and three kids and at the time of his fight with me they were all starving  they did not have enough to eat  do you understand  they did not have enough to eat  and bill did not have enough to eat  he trained on an empty stomach which is no way to train youll admit  during that drought year there was little enough money in the ring but he had failed to get any fights  he had worked at long shoring ditchdigging coalshovellinganything to keep the life in the missus and the kiddies  the trouble was the jobs didnt hold out and there he was matched to fight with me behind in his rent a tough old choppingblock but weak from lack of food  if he did not win the fight the landlord was going to put them into the street  maud  but why would you want to fight with him in such weak condition  fitzsimmons  i did not know  i did not learn till at the ringside just before the fight  it was in the dressing rooms waiting our turn to go on  bill came out of his room ready for the ring  bill i saidin fun you know  bill ive got to do you tonight  he said nothing but he looked at me with the saddest and most pitiful face i have ever seen  he went back into his dressing room and sat down  poor bill one of my seconds said  hes been fair starving these last weeks  and ive got it straight the landlord chucks him out if he loses tonight  then the call came and we went into the ring  bill was desperate  he fought like a tiger a madman  he was fair crazy  he was fighting for more than i was fighting for  i was a rising fighter and i was fighting for the money and the recognition  but bill was fighting for lifefor the life of his loved ones  well condition told  the strength went out of him and i was fresh as a daisy  whats the matter bill i said to him in a clinch   youre weak  i aint had a bit to eat this day he answered  that was all  by the seventh round he was about all in hanging on and panting and sobbing for breath in the clinches and i knew i could put him out any time  i drew back my right for the shortarm jab that would do the business  he knew it was coming and he was powerless to prevent it  for the love of god bob he said andpause  maud  yes  yes  fitzsimmons  i held back the blow  we were in a clinch  for the love of god bob he said again the misses and the kiddies  and right there i saw and knew it all  i saw the hungry children asleep and the missus sitting up and waiting for bill to come home waiting to know whether they were to have food to eat or be thrown out in the street  bill i said in the next clinch so low only he could hear  bill remember the la blanche swing  give it to me hard  we broke away and he was tottering and groggy  he staggered away and started to whirl the swing  i saw it coming  i made believe i didnt and started after him in a rush  biff  it caught me on the jaw and i went down  i was young and strong  i could eat punishment  i could have got up the first second  but i lay there and let them count me out and making believe i was still dazed i let them carry me to my corner and work to bring me to  pause  well i faked that fight  maud  springing to him and shaking his hand  thank god  oh  you are a man  aaa hero  fitzsimmons  dryly feeling in his pocket  lets have a smoke  he fails to find cigarette case  maud  i cant tell you how glad i am you told me that  fitzsimmons  gruffly  forget it  he looks on table and fails to find cigarette case  looks at her suspiciously then crosses to desk at right and reaches for telephone  maud  curiously  what are you going to do  fitzsimmons  call the police  maud  what for  fitzsimmons  for you  maud  for me  fitzsimmons  you are not harry jones  and not only are you an impostor but you are a thief  maud  indignantly  how dare you  fitzsimmons  you have stolen my cigarette case  maud  remembering and taken aback pulls out cigarette case  here it is  fitzsimmons  too

girl  there sinks down in chair burying her face in her hands  fitzsimmons hanging up receiver grunts  maud removes hands and looks at him indignantly  as she speaks her indignation grows  maud  i only wanted your cigarette case to prove to my brother that i had been here  iim maud sylvester and you never took me out once and im not a black sheep  and i dont dress loudly and i havent aa tapeworm  fitzsimmons  grinning and pulling out card from vest pocket  i knew you were miss sylvester all the time  maud  oh  you brute  ill never speak to you again  fitzsimmons  gently  youll let me see you safely out of here  maud  relenting  yees  she rises crosses to table and is about to stoop for motor cloak and bonnet but he forestall her holds cloak and helps her into it  thank you  she takes off wig fluffs her own hair becomingly and puts on bonnet looking every inch a pretty young girl ready for an automobile ride  fitzsimmons  who all the time watching her transformation has been
