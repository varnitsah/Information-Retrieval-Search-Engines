travel both   and be one traveler long i stood   and looked down one as far as i could   to where it bent in the undergrowth    then took the other as just as fair   and having perhaps the better claim   because it was grassy and wanted wear   though as for that the passing there   had worn them really about the same    and both that morning equally lay   in leaves no step had trodden black   oh i kept the first for another day   yet knowing how way leads on to way   i doubted if i should ever come back    i shall be telling this with a sigh   somewhere ages and ages hence   two roads diverged in a wood and i   i took the one less traveled by   and that has made all the difference     christmas trees  a christmas circular letter     the city had withdrawn into itself   and left at last the country to the country   when between whirls of snow not come to lie   and whirls of foliage not yet laid there drove   a stranger to our yard who looked the city   yet did in country fashion in that there   he sat and waited till he drew us out   abuttoning coats to ask him who he was   he proved to be the city come again   to look for something it had left behind   and could not do without and keep its christmas   he asked if i would sell my christmas trees   my woodsthe young fir balsams like a place   where houses all are churches and have spires   i hadnt thought of them as christmas trees   i doubt if i was tempted for a moment   to sell them off their feet to go in cars   and leave the slope behind the house all bare   where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon   id hate to have them know it if i was   yet more id hate to hold my trees except   as others hold theirs or refuse for them   beyond the time of profitable growth   the trial by market everything must come to   i dallied so much with the thought of selling   then whether from mistaken courtesy   and fear of seeming short of speech or whether   from hope of hearing good of what was mine   i said there arent enough to be worth while   i could soon tell how many they would cut   you let me look them over                                       you could look   but dont expect im going to let you have them   pasture they spring in some in clumps too close   that lop each other of boughs but not a few   quite solitary and having equal boughs   all round and round the latter he nodded yes to   or paused to say beneath some lovelier one   with a buyers moderation that would do   i thought so too but wasnt there to say so   we climbed the pasture on the south crossed over   and came down on the north                                 he said a thousand    a thousand christmas treesat what apiece    he felt some need of softening that to me   a thousand trees would come to thirty dollars    then i was certain i had never meant   to let him have them never show surprise   but thirty dollars seemed so small beside   the extent of pasture i should strip three cents   for that was all they figured out apiece   three cents so small beside the dollar friends   i should be writing to within the hour   would pay in cities for good trees like those   regular vestrytrees whole sunday schools   could hang enough on to pick off enough   a thousand christmas trees i didnt know i had   worth three cents more to give away than sell   as may be shown by a simple calculation   too bad i couldnt lay one in a letter   i cant help wishing i could send you one   in wishing you herewith a merry christmas     an old mans winter night     all out of doors looked darkly in at him   through the thin frost almost in separate stars   that gathers on the pane in empty rooms   what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze   was the lamp tilted near them in his hand   what kept him from remembering what it was   that brought him to that creaking room was age   he stood with barrels round himat a loss   and having scared the cellar under him   in clomping there he scared it once again   in clomping offand scared the outer night   which has its sounds familiar like the roar   of trees and crack of branches common things   but nothing so like beating on a box   a light he was to no one but himself   where now he sat concerned with he knew what   a quiet light and then not even that   he consigned to the moon such as she was   so latearising to the broken moon   as better than the sun in any case   for such a charge his snow upon the roof   his icicles along the wall to keep   and slept the log that shifted with a jolt   once in the stove disturbed him and he shifted   and eased his heavy breathing but still slept   one aged manone mancant fill a house   a farm a countryside or if he can   its thus he does it of a winter night     a patch of old snow     theres a patch of old snow in a corner     that i should have guessed   was a blowaway paper the rain     had brought to rest    it is speckled with grime as if     small print overspread it   the news of a day ive forgotten     if i ever read it     in the home stretch     she stood against the kitchen sink and looked   over the sink out through a dusty window   at weeds the water from the sink made tall   she wore her cape her hat was in her hand   behind her was confusion in the room   of chairs turned upside down to sit like people   in other chairs and something come to look   for every room a house hasparlor bedroom   and diningroomthrown pellmell in the kitchen   and now and then a smudged infernal face   looked in a door behind her and addressed   her back she always answered without turning    where will i put this walnut bureau lady   put it on top of something thats on top   of something else she laughed oh put it where   you can tonight and go its almost dark   you must be getting started back to town   another blackened face thrust in and looked   and smiled and when she did not turn spoke gently   what are you seeing out the window lady    never was i beladied so before   would evidence of having been called lady   more than so many times make me a lady   in common law i wonder                                                   but i ask   what are you seeing out the window lady    what ill be seeing more of in the years   to come as here i stand and go the round   of many plates with towels many times    and what is that you only put me off    rank weeds that love the water from the dishpan   more than some women like the dishpan joe   a little stretch of mowingfield for you   not much of that until i come to woods   that end all and its scarce enough to call   a view                        and yet you think you like it dear    thats what youre so concerned to know you hope   i like it bang goes something big away   off there upstairs the very tread of men   as great as those is shattering to the frame   of such a little house once left alone   you and i dear will go with softer steps   up and down stairs and through the rooms and none   but sudden winds that snatch them from our hands   will ever slam the doors                                              i think you see   more than you like to own to out that window    no for besides the things i tell you of   i only see the years they come and go   in alternation with the weeds the field   the wood                      what kind of years                                         why latter years   different from early years                                            i see them too   you didnt count them                                         no the further off   so ran together that i didnt try to   it can scarce be that they would be in number   wed care to know for we are not young now   and bang goes something else away off there   it sounds as if it were the men went down   and every crash meant one less to return   to lighted city streets we too have known   but now are giving up for country darkness    come from that window where you see too much for me   and take a livelier view of things from here   theyre going watch this husky swarming up   over the wheel into the skyhigh seat   lighting his pipe now squinting down his nose   at the flame burning downward as he sucks it    see how it makes his noseside bright a proof   how dark its getting can you tell what time   it is by that or by the moon the new moon   what shoulder did i see her over neither   a wire she is of silver as new as we   to everything her light wont last us long   its something though to know were going to have her   night after night and stronger every night   to see us through our first two weeks but joe   the stove before they go knock on the window   ask them to help you get it on its feet   we stand here dreaming hurry call them back    theyre not gone yet                                 weve got to have the stove   whatever else we want for and a light   have we a piece of candle if the lamp   and oil are buried out of reach                                                        again   the house was full of tramping and the dark   doorfilling men burst in and seized the stove   a cannonmouthlike hole was in the wall   to which they set it true by eye and then   came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands   so much too light and airy for their strength   it almost seemed to come ballooning up   slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling   a fit said one and banged a stovepipe shoulder   its good luck when you move in to begin   with good luck with your stovepipe never mind   its not so bad in the country settled down   when peoplere getting on in life youll like it   joe said you big boys ought to find a farm   and make good farmers and leave other fellows   the city work to do theres not enough   for everybody as it is in there   god one said wildly and when no one spoke   say that to jimmy here he needs a farm   but jimmy only made his jaw recede   foollike and rolled his eyes as if to say   he saw himself a farmer then there was a french boy   who said with seriousness that made them laugh   ma friend you aint know what it is youre ask   he doffed his cap and held it with both hands   across his chest to make as twere a bow   were giving you our chances on de farm   and then they all turned to with deafening boots   and put each other bodily out of the house   goodby to them we puzzle them they think   i dont know what they think we see in what   they leave us to that pasture slope that seems   the back some farm presents us and your woods   to northward from your window at the sink   waiting to steal a step on us whenever   we drop our eyes or turn to other things   as in the game tenstep the children play    good boys they seemed and let them love the city   all they could say was god when you proposed   their coming out and making useful farmers    did they make something lonesome go through you   it would take more than them to sicken you   us of our bargain but they left us so   as to our fate like fools past reasoning with   they almost shook me                                             its all so much   what we have always wanted i confess   its seeming bad for a moment makes it seem   even worse still and so on down down down   its nothing its their leaving us at dusk   i never bore it well when people went   the first night after guests have gone the house   seems haunted or exposed i always take   a personal interest in the locking up   at bedtime but the strangeness soon wears off   he fetched a dingy lantern from behind   a door theres that we didnt lose and these   some matches he unpocketed for food   the meals weve had no one can take from us   i wish that everything on earth were just   as certain as the meals weve had i wish   the meals we havent had were anyway   what have you you know where to lay your hands on    the bread we bought in passing at the store   theres butter somewhere too                                        lets rend the bread   ill light the fire for company for you   youll not have any other company   till ed begins to get out on a sunday   to look us over and give us his idea   of what wants pruning shingling breaking up   hell know what he would do if he were we   and all at once hell plan for us and plan   to help us but hell take it out in planning   well you can set the table with the loaf   lets see you find your loaf ill light the fire   i like chairs occupying other chairs   not offering a lady                                            there again joe   youre tired                             im drunknonsensical tired out   dont mind a word i say its a days work   to empty one house of all household goods   and fill another with em fifteen miles away   although you do no more than dump them down    dumped down in paradise we are and happy    its all so much what i have always wanted   i cant believe its what you wanted too    shouldnt you like to know                                             id like to know   if it is what you wanted then how much   you wanted it for me                                       a troubled conscience   you dont want me to tell if i dont know    i dont want to find out what cant be known    but who first said the word to come                                                     my dear   its who first thought the thought youre searching joe   for things that dont exist i mean beginnings   ends and beginningsthere are no such things   there are only middles                              what is this                                                  this life   our sitting here by lanternlight together   amid the wreckage of a former home   you wont deny the lantern isnt new   the stove is not and you are not to me   nor i to you                                     perhaps you never were    it would take me forever to recite   all thats not new in where we find ourselves   new is a word for fools in towns who think   style upon style in dress and thought at last   must get somewhere ive heard you say as much   no this is no beginning                                                then an end   end is a gloomy word                                               is it too late   to drag you out for just a goodnight call   on the old peach trees on the knoll to grope   by starlight in the grass for a last peach   the neighbors may not have taken as their right   when the house wasnt lived in ive been looking   i doubt if they have left us many grapes   before we set ourselves to right the house   the first thing in the morning out we go   to go the round of apple cherry peach   pine alder pasture mowing well and brook   all of a farm it is                                            i know this much   im going to put you in your bed if first   i have to make you build it come the light    when there was no more lantern in the kitchen   the fire got out through crannies in the stove   and danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling   as much at home as if theyd always danced there     the telephone     when i was just as far as i could walk   from here today   there was an hour   all still   when leaning with my head against a flower   i heard you talk   dont say i didnt for i heard you say   you spoke from that flower on the window sill   do you remember what it was you said    first tell me what it was you thought you heard    having found the flower and driven a bee away   i leaned my head   and holding by the stalk   i listened and i thought i caught the word   what was it did you call me by my name   or did you say   someone said comei heard it as i bowed    i may have thought as much but not aloud    well so i came     meeting and passing     as i went down the hill along the wall   there was a gate i had leaned at for the view   and had just turned from when i first saw you   as you came up the hill we met but all   we did that day was mingle great and small   footprints in summer dust as if we drew   the figure of our being less than two   but more than one as yet your parasol    pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust   and all the time we talked you seemed to see   something down there to smile at in the dust   oh it was without prejudice to me   afterward i went past what you had passed   before we met and you what i had passed     hyla brook     by june our brooks run out of song and speed   sought for much after that it will be found   either to have gone groping underground   and taken with it all the hyla breed   that shouted in the mist a month ago   like ghost of sleighbells in a ghost of snow   or flourished and come up in jewelweed   weak foliage that is blown upon and bent   even against the way its waters went   its bed is left a faded paper sheet   of dead leaves stuck together by the heat   a brook to none but who remember long   this as it will be seen is other far   than with brooks taken otherwhere in song   we love the things we love for what they are     the oven bird     there is a singer everyone has heard   loud a midsummer and a midwood bird   who makes the solid tree trunks sound again   he says that leaves are old and that for flowers   midsummer is to spring as one to ten   he says the early petalfall is past   when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers   on sunny days a moment overcast   and comes that other fall we name the fall   he says the highway dust is over all   the bird would cease and be as other birds   but that he knows in singing not to sing   the question that he frames in all but words   is what to make of a diminished thing     bond and free     love has earth to which she clings   with hills and circling arms about   wall within wall to shut fear out   but thought has need of no such things   for thought has a pair of dauntless wings    on snow and sand and turf i see   where love has left a printed trace   with straining in the worlds embrace   and such is love and glad to be   but thought has shaken his ankles free    thought cleaves the interstellar gloom   and sits in sirius disc all night   till day makes him retrace his flight   with smell of burning on every plume   back past the sun to an earthly room    his gains in heaven are what they are   yet some say love by being thrall   and simply staying possesses all   in several beauty that thought fares far   to find fused in another star     birches     when i see birches bend to left and right   across the lines of straighter darker trees   i like to think some boys been swinging them   but swinging doesnt bend them down to stay   icestorms do that often you must have seen them   loaded with ice a sunny winter morning   after a rain they click upon themselves   as the breeze rises and turn manycolored   as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel   soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells   shattering and avalanching on the snowcrust   such heaps of broken glass to sweep away   youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen   they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load   and they seem not to break though once they are bowed   so low for long they never right themselves   you may see their trunks arching in the woods   years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground   like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair   before them over their heads to dry in the sun   but i was going to say when truth broke in   with all her matteroffact about the icestorm   now am i free to be poetical   i should prefer to have some boy bend them   as he went out and in to fetch the cows   some boy too far from town to learn baseball   whose only play was what he found himself   summer or winter and could play alone   one by one he subdued his fathers trees   by riding them down over and over again   until he took the stiffness out of them   and not one but hung limp not one was left   for him to conquer he learned all there was   to learn about not launching out too soon   and so not carrying the tree away   clear to the ground he always kept his poise   to the top branches climbing carefully   with the same pains you use to fill a cup   up to the brim and even above the brim   then he flung outward feet first with a swish   kicking his way down through the air to the ground   so was i once myself a swinger of birches   and so i dream of going back to be   its when im weary of considerations   and life is too much like a pathless wood   where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs   broken across it and one eye is weeping   from a twigs having lashed across it open   id like to get away from earth awhile   and then come back to it and begin over   may no fate willfully misunderstand me   and half grant what i wish and snatch me away   not to return earths the right place for love   i dont know where its likely to go better   id like to go by climbing a birch tree   and climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk   toward heaven till the tree could bear no more   but dipped its top and set me down again   that would be good both going and coming back   one could do worse than be a swinger of birches     pea brush     i walked down alone sunday after church     to the place where john has been cutting trees   to see for myself about the birch     he said i could have to bush my peas    the sun in the newcut narrow gap     was hot enough for the first of may   and stifling hot with the odor of sap     from stumps still bleeding their life away    the frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill     wherever the ground was low and wet   the minute they heard my step went still     to watch me and see what i came to get    birch boughs enough piled everywhere     all fresh and sound from the recent axe   time someone came with cart and pair     and got them off the wild flowers backs    they might be good for garden things     to curl a little finger round   the same as you seize catscradle strings     and lift themselves up off the ground    small good to anything growing wild     they were crooking many a trillium   that had budded before the boughs were piled     and since it was coming up had to come     putting in the seed     you come to fetch me from my work tonight   when suppers on the table and well see   if i can leave off burying the white   soft petals fallen from the apple tree   soft petals yes but not so barren quite   mingled with these smooth bean and wrinkled pea   and go along with you ere you lose sight   of what you came for and become like me   slave to a springtime passion for the earth   how love burns through the putting in the seed   on through the watching for that early birth   when just as the soil tarnishes with weed    the sturdy seedling with arched body comes   shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs     a time to talk     when a friend calls to me from the road   and slows his horse to a meaning walk   i dont stand still and look around   on all the hills i havent hoed   and shout from where i am what is it   no not as there is a time to talk   i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground   bladeend up and five feet tall   and plod i go up to the stone wall   for a friendly visit     the cow in apple time     something inspires the only cow of late   to make no more of a wall than an open gate   and think no more of wallbuilders than fools   her face is flecked with pomace and she drools   a cider syrup having tasted fruit   she scorns a pasture withering to the root   she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten   the windfalls spiked with stubble and wormeaten   she leaves them bitten when she has to fly   she bellows on a knoll against the sky   her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry     an encounter     once on the kind of day called weather breeder   when the heat slowly hazes and the sun   by its own power seems to be undone   i was half boring through half climbing through   a swamp of cedar choked with oil of cedar   and scurf of plants and weary and overheated   and sorry i ever left the road i knew   i paused and rested on a sort of hook   that had me by the coat as good as seated   and since there was no other way to look   looked up toward heaven and there against the blue   stood over me a resurrected tree   a tree that had been down and raised again   a barkless spectre he had halted too   as if for fear of treading upon me   i saw the strange position of his hands   up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands   of wire with something in it from men to men   you here i said where arent you nowadays   and whats the news you carryif you know   and tell me where youre off formontreal   me im not off for anywhere at all   sometimes i wander out of beaten ways   half looking for the orchid calypso     rangefinding     the battle rent a cobweb diamondstrung   and cut a flower beside a ground birds nest   before it stained a single human breast   the stricken flower bent double and so hung   and still the bird revisited her young   a butterfly its fall had dispossessed   a moment sought in air his flower of rest   then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung    on the bare upland pasture there had spread   oernight twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread   and straining cables wet with silver dew   a sudden passing bullet shook it dry   the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly   but finding nothing sullenly withdrew     the hill wife   loneliness  her word    one ought not to have to care     so much as you and i   care when the birds come round the house     to seem to say goodbye    or care so much when they come back     with whatever it is they sing   the truth being we are as much     too glad for the one thing    as we are too sad for the other here     with birds that fill their breasts   but with each other and themselves     and their built or driven nests   house fear    alwaysi tell you this they learned   always at night when they returned   to the lonely house from far away   to lamps unlighted and fire gone gray   they learned to rattle the lock and key   to give whatever might chance to be   warning and time to be off in flight   and preferring the out to the indoor night   they learned to leave the housedoor wide   until they had lit the lamp inside   the smile  her word    i didnt like the way he went away   that smile it never came of being gay   still he smileddid you see himi was sure   perhaps because we gave him only bread   and the wretch knew from that that we were poor   perhaps because he let us give instead   of seizing from us as he might have seized   perhaps he mocked at us for being wed   or being very young and he was pleased   to have a vision of us old and dead   i wonder how far down the road hes got   hes watching from the woods as like as not   the oftrepeated dream    she had no saying dark enough     for the dark pine that kept   forever trying the windowlatch     of the room where they slept    the tireless but ineffectual hands     that with every futile pass   made the great tree seem as a little bird     before the mystery of glass    it never had been inside the room     and only one of the two   was afraid in an oftrepeated dream     of what the tree might do   the impulse    it was too lonely for her there     and too wild   and since there were but two of them     and no child    and work was little in the house     she was free   and followed where he furrowed field     or felled tree    she rested on a log and tossed     the fresh chips   with a song only to herself     on her lips    and once she went to break a bough     of black alder   she strayed so far she scarcely heard     when he called her    and didnt answerdidnt speak     or return   she stood and then she ran and hid     in the fern    he never found her though he looked     everywhere   and he asked at her mothers house     was she there    sudden and swift and light as that     the ties gave   and he learned of finalities     besides the grave     the bonfire     oh lets go up the hill and scare ourselves   as reckless as the best of them tonight   by setting fire to all the brush we piled   with pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow   oh lets not wait for rain to make it safe   the pile is ours we dragged it bough on bough   down dark converging paths between the pines   lets not care what we do with it tonight   divide it no but burn it as one pile   the way we piled it and lets be the talk   of people brought to windows by a light   thrown from somewhere against their wallpaper   rouse them all both the free and not so free   with saying what theyd like to do to us   for what theyd better wait till we have done   lets all but bring to life this old volcano   if that is what the mountain ever was   and scare ourselves let wild fire loose we will    and scare you too the children said together    why wouldnt it scare me to have a fire   begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know   that still if i repent i may recall it   but in a moment not a little spurt   of burning fatness and then nothing but   the fire itself can put it out and that   by burning out and before it burns out   it will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars   and sweeping round it with a flaming sword   made the dim trees stand back in wider circle   done so much and i know not how much more   i mean it shall not do if i can bind it   well if it doesnt with its draft bring on   a wind to blow in earnest from some quarter   as once it did with me upon an april   the breezes were so spent with winter blowing   they seemed to fail the bluebirds under them   short of the perch their languid flight was toward   and my flame made a pinnacle to heaven   as i walked once round it in possession   but the wind out of doorsyou know the saying   there came a gust you used to think the trees   made wind by fanning since you never knew   it blow but that you saw the trees in motion   something or someone watching made that gust   it put the flame tipdown and dabbed the grass   of overwinter with the least tiptouch   your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand   the place it reached to blackened instantly   the black was all there was by daylight   that and the merest curl of cigarette smoke   and a flame slender as the hepaticas   bloodroot and violets so soon to be now   but the black spread like black death on the ground   and i think the sky darkened with a cloud   like winter and evening coming on together   there were enough things to be thought of then   where the field stretches toward the north   and setting sun to hyla brook i gave it   to flames without twice thinking where it verges   upon the road to flames too though in fear   they might find fuel there in withered brake   grass its full length old silver goldenrod   and alder and grape vine entanglement   to leap the dusty deadline for my own   i took what front there was beside i knelt   and thrust hands in and held my face away   fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating   a board is the best weapon if you have it   i had my coat and oh i knew i knew   and said out loud i couldnt bide the smother   and heat so close in but the thought of all   the woods and town on fire by me and all   the town turned out to fight for methat held me   i trusted the brook barrier but feared   the road would fail and on that side the fire   died not without a noise of crackling wood   of something more than tindergrass and weed   that brought me to my feet to hold it back   by leaning back myself as if the reins   were round my neck and i was at the plough   i won but im sure no one ever spread   another color over a tenth the space   that i spread coalblack over in the time   it took me neighbors coming home from town   couldnt believe that so much black had come there   while they had backs turned that it hadnt been there   when they had passed an hour or so before   going the other way and they not seen it   they looked about for someone to have done it   but there was no one i was somewhere wondering   where all my weariness had gone and why   i walked so light on air in heavy shoes   in spite of a scorched fourthofjuly feeling   why wouldnt i be scared remembering that    if it scares you what will it do to us    scare you but if you shrink from being scared   what would you say to war if it should come   thats what for reasons i should like to know   if you can comfort me by any answer    oh but wars not for childrenits for men    now we are digging almost down to china   my dears my dears you thought thatwe all thought it   so your mistake was ours havent you heard though   about the ships where war has found them out   at sea about the towns where war has come   through opening clouds at night with droning speed   further oerhead than all but stars and angels   and children in the ships and in the towns   havent you heard what we have lived to learn   nothing so newsomething we had forgotten   war is for everyone for children too   i wasnt going to tell you and i mustnt   the best way is to come up hill with me   and have our fire and laugh and be afraid     a girls garden     a neighbor of mine in the village     likes to tell how one spring   when she was a girl on the farm she did     a childlike thing    one day she asked her father     to give her a garden plot   to plant and tend and reap herself     and he said why not    in casting about for a corner     he thought of an idle bit   of walledoff ground where a shop had stood     and he said just it    and he said that ought to make you     an ideal onegirl farm   and give you a chance to put some strength     on your slimjim arm    it was not enough of a garden     her father said to plough   so she had to work it all by hand     but she dont mind now    she wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow     along a stretch of road   but she always ran away and left     her notnice load    and hid from anyone passing     and then she begged the seed   she says she thinks she planted one     of all things but weed    a hill each of potatoes     radishes lettuce peas   tomatoes beets beans pumpkins corn     and even fruit trees    and yes she has long mistrusted     that a cider apple tree   in bearing there today is hers     or at least may be    her crop was a miscellany     when all was said and done   a little bit of everything     a great deal of none    now when she sees in the village     how village things go   just when it seems to come in right     she says i know    its as when i was a farmer     oh never by way of advice   and she never sins by telling the tale     to the same person twice     the exposed nest     you were forever finding some new play   so when i saw you down on hands and knees   in the meadow busy with the newcut hay   trying i thought to set it up on end   i went to show you how to make it stay   if that was your idea against the breeze   and if you asked me even help pretend   to make it root again and grow afresh   but twas no makebelieve with you today   nor was the grass itself your real concern   though i found your hand full of wilted fern   steelbright junegrass and blackening heads of clover   twas a nest full of young birds on the ground   the cutterbar had just gone champing over   miraculously without tasting flesh   and left defenseless to the heat and light   you wanted to restore them to their right   of something interposed between their sight   and too much world at oncecould means be found   the way the nestfull every time we stirred   stood up to us as to a motherbird   whose coming home has been too long deferred   made me ask would the motherbird return   and care for them in such a change of scene   and might our meddling make her more afraid   that was a thing we could not wait to learn   we saw the risk we took in doing good   but dared not spare to do the best we could   though harm should come of it so built the screen   you had begun and gave them back their shade   all this to prove we cared why is there then   no more to tell we turned to other things   i havent any memoryhave you   of ever coming to the place again   to see if the birds lived the first night through   and so at last to learn to use their wings     out out     the buzzsaw snarled and rattled in the yard   and made dust and dropped stovelength sticks of wood   sweetscented stuff when the breeze drew across it   and from there those that lifted eyes could count   five mountain ranges one behind the other   under the sunset far into vermont   and the saw snarled and rattled snarled and rattled   as it ran light or had to bear a load   and nothing happened day was all but done   call it a day i wish they might have said   to please the boy by giving him the half hour   that a boy counts so much when saved from work   his sister stood beside them in her apron   to tell them supper at the word the saw   as if to prove saws knew what supper meant   leaped out at the boys hand or seemed to leap   he must have given the hand however it was   neither refused the meeting but the hand   the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh   as he swung toward them holding up the hand   half in appeal but half as if to keep   the life from spilling then the boy saw all   since he was old enough to know big boy   doing a mans work though a child at heart   he saw all spoiled dont let him cut my hand off   the doctor when he comes dont let him sister   so but the hand was gone already   the doctor put him in the dark of ether   he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath   and thenthe watcher at his pulse took fright   no one believed they listened at his heart   littlelessnothingand that ended it   no more to build on there and they since they   were not the one dead turned to their affairs     browns descent  or  the willynilly slide     brown lived at such a lofty farm     that everyone for miles could see   his lantern when he did his chores     in winter after halfpast three    and many must have seen him make     his wild descent from there one night   cross lots cross walls cross everything     describing rings of lantern light    between the house and barn the gale     got him by something he had on   and blew him out on the icy crust     that cased the world and he was gone    walls were all buried trees were few     he saw no stay unless he stove   a hole in somewhere with his heel     but though repeatedly he strove    and stamped and said things to himself     and sometimes something seemed to yield   he gained no foothold but pursued     his journey down from field to field    sometimes he came with arms outspread     like wings revolving in the scene   upon his longer axis and     with no small dignity of mien    faster or slower as he chanced     sitting or standing as he chose   according as he feared to risk     his neck or thought to spare his clothes    he never let the lantern drop     and some exclaimed who saw afar   the figures he described with it     i wonder what those signals are    brown makes at such an hour of night     hes celebrating something strange   i wonder if hes sold his farm     or been made master of the grange    he reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked     he fell and made the lantern rattle   but saved the light from going out     so halfway down he fought the battle    incredulous of his own bad luck     and then becoming reconciled   to everything he gave it up     and came down like a coasting child    wellibe that was all he said     as standing in the river road   he looked back up the slippery slope     two miles it was to his abode    sometimes as an authority     on motorcars im asked if i   should say our stock was petered out     and this is my sincere reply    yankees are what they always were     dont think brown ever gave up hope   of getting home again because     he couldnt climb that slippery slope    or even thought of standing there     until the january thaw   should take the polish off the crust     he bowed with grace to natural law    and then went round it on his feet     after the manner of our stock   not much concerned for those to whom     at that particular time oclock    it must have looked as if the course     he steered was really straight away   from that which he was headed for     not much concerned for them i say    no more so than became a man     and politician at odd seasons   ive kept brown standing in the cold     while i invested him with reasons    but now he snapped his eyes three times     then shook his lantern saying iles   bout out and took the long way home     by road a matter of several miles     the gumgatherer     there overtook me and drew me in   to his downhill earlymorning stride   and set me five miles on my road   better than if he had had me ride   a man with a swinging bag for load   and half the bag wound round his hand   we talked like barking above the din   of water we walked along beside   and for my telling him where id been   and where i lived in mountain land   to be coming home the way i was   he told me a little about himself   he came from higher up in the pass   where the grist of the newbeginning brooks   is blocks split off the mountain mass   and hopeless grist enough it looks   ever to grind to soil for grass   the way it is will do for moss   there he had built his stolen shack   it had to be a stolen shack   because of the fears of fire and loss   that trouble the sleep of lumber folk   visions of half the world burned black   and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke   we know who when they come to town   bring berries under the wagon seat   or a basket of eggs between their feet   what this man brought in a cotton sack   was gum the gum of the mountain spruce   he showed me lumps of the scented stuff   like uncut jewels dull and rough   it comes to market golden brown   but turns to pink between the teeth    i told him this is a pleasant life   to set your breast to the bark of trees   that all your days are dim beneath   and reaching up with a little knife   to loose the resin and take it down   and bring it to market when you please     the linegang     here come the linegang pioneering by   they throw a forest down less cut than broken   they plant dead trees for living and the dead   they string together with a living thread   they string an instrument against the sky   wherein words whether beaten out or spoken   will run as hushed as when they were a thought   but in no hush they string it they go past   with shouts afar to pull the cable taut   to hold it hard until they make it fast   to ease awaythey have it with a laugh   an oath of towns that set the wild at naught   they bring the telephone and telegraph     the vanishing red     he is said to have been the last red man   in acton and the miller is said to have laughed   if you like to call such a sound a laugh   but he gave no one else a laughers license   for he turned suddenly grave as if to say   whose businessif i take it on myself   whose businessbut why talk round the barn   when its just that i hold with getting a thing done with   you cant get back and see it as he saw it   its too long a story to go into now   youd have to have been there and lived it   then you wouldnt have looked on it as just a matter   of who began it between the two races    some guttural exclamation of surprise   the red man gave in poking about the mill   over the great big thumping shuffling millstone   disgusted the miller physically as coming   from one who had no right to be heard from   come john he said you want to see the wheel pit    he took him down below a cramping rafter   and showed him through a manhole in the floor   the water in desperate straits like frantic fish   salmon and sturgeon lashing with their tails   then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it   that jangled even above the general noise   and came up stairs aloneand gave that laugh   and said something to a man with a mealsack   that the man with the mealsack didnt catchthen   oh yes he showed john the wheel pit all right     snow     the three stood listening to a fresh access   of wind that caught against the house a moment   gulped snow and then blew free againthe coles   dressed but dishevelled from some hours of sleep   meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore    meserve was first to speak he pointed backward   over his shoulder with his pipestem saying   you

of the sanctimonious conceit   out of one of those pious scalawags    nonsense to that you want to see him safe    you like the runt                                           dont you a little                                                          well   i dont like what hes doing which is what   you like and like him for                                                oh yes you do   you like your fun as well as anyone   only you women have to put these airs on   to impress men youve got us so ashamed   of being men we cant look at a good fight   between two boys and not feel bound to stop it   let the man freeze an ear or two i say   hes here i leave him all to you go in   and save his lifeall right come in meserve   sit down sit down how did you find the horses    fine fine                          and ready for some more my wife here   says it wont do youve got to give it up    wont you to please me please if i say please   mr meserve ill leave it to your wife   what did your wife say on the telephone    meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp   or something not far from it on the table   by straightening out and lifting a forefinger   he pointed with his hand from where it lay   like a white crumpled spider on his knee   that leaf there in your open book it moved   just then i thought its stood erect like that   there on the table ever since i came   trying to turn itself backward or forward   ive had my eye on it to make out which   if forward then its with a friends impatience   you see i knowto get you on to things   it wants to see how you will take if backward   its from regret for something you have passed   and failed to see the good of never mind   things must expect to come in front of us   a many timesi dont say just how many   that varies with the thingsbefore we see them   one of the lies would make it out that nothing   ever presents itself before us twice   where would we be at last if that were so   our very life depends on everythings   recurring till we answer from within   the thousandth time may prove the charmthat leaf   it cant turn either way it needs the winds help   but the wind didnt move it if it moved   it moved itself the winds at naught in here   it couldnt stir so sensitively poised   a thing as that it couldnt reach the lamp   to get a puff of black smoke from the flame   or blow a rumple in the collies coat   you make a little foursquare block of air   quiet and light and warm in spite of all   the illimitable dark and cold and storm   and by so doing give these three lamp dog   and bookleaf that keep near you their repose   though for all anyone can tell repose   may be the thing you havent yet you give it   so false it is that what we havent we cant give   so false that what we always say is true   ill have to turn the leaf if no one else will   it wont lie down then let it stand who cares    i shouldnt want to hurry you meserve   but if youre goingsay youll stay you know   but let me raise this curtain on a scene   and show you how its piling up against you   you see the snowwhite through the white of frost   ask helen how far up the sash its climbed   since last we read the gage                                                 it looks as if   some pallid thing had squashed its features flat   and its eyes shut with overeagerness   to see what people found so interesting   in one another and had gone to sleep   of its own stupid lack of understanding   or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff   short off and died against the windowpane    brother meserve take care youll scare yourself   more than you will us with such nightmare talk   its you it matters to because its you   who have to go out into it alone    let him talk helen and perhaps hell stay    before you drop the curtainim reminded   you recollect the boy who came out here   to breathe the air one winterhad a room   down at the averys well one sunny morning   after a downy storm he passed our place   and found me banking up the house with snow   and i was burrowing in deep for warmth   piling it well above the windowsills   the snow against the window caught his eye   hey thats a pretty thoughtthose were his words   so you can think its six feet deep outside   while you sit warm and read up balanced rations   you cant get too much winter in the winter   those were his words and he went home and all   but banked the daylight out of averys windows   now you and i would go to no such length   at the same time you cant deny it makes   it not a mite worse sitting here we three   playing our fancy to have the snowline run   so high across the pane outside there where   there is a sort of tunnel in the frost   more like a tunnel than a holeway down   at the far end of it you see a stir   and quiver like the frayed edge of the drift   blown in the wind i like thati like that   well now i leave you people                                                 come meserve   we thought you were deciding not to go   the ways you found to say the praise of comfort   and being where you are you want to stay    ill own its cold for such a fall of snow   this house is frozen brittle all except   this room you sit in if you think the wind   sounds further off its not because its dying   youre further under in the snowthats all   and feel it less hear the soft bombs of dust   it bursts against us at the chimney mouth   and at the eaves i like it from inside   more than i shall out in it but the horses   are rested and its time to say goodnight   and let you get to bed again goodnight   sorry i had to break in on your sleep    lucky for you you did lucky for you   you had us for a halfway station   to stop at if you were the kind of man   paid heed to women youd take my advice   and for your familys sake stay where you are   but what good is my saying it over and over   youve done more than you had a right to think   you could donow you know the risk you take   in going on                                      our snowstorms as a rule   arent looked on as mankillers and although   id rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep   under it all his door sealed up and lost   than the man fighting it to keep above it   yet think of the small birds at roost and not   in nests shall i be counted less than they are   their bulk in water would be frozen rock   in no time out tonight and yet tomorrow   they will come budding boughs from tree to tree   flirting their wings and saying chickadee   as if not knowing what you meant by the word storm    but why when no one wants you to go on   your wifeshe doesnt want you to we dont   and you yourself dont want to who else is there    save us from being cornered by a woman   well theresshe told fred afterward that in   the pause right there she thought the dreaded word   was coming god but no he only said   well theresthe storm that says i must go on   that wants me as a war might if it came   ask any man                                  he threw her that as something   to last her till he got outside the door   he had cole with him to the barn to see him off   when cole returned he found his wife still standing   beside the table near the open book   not reading it                                       well what kind of a man   do you call that she said                                                he had the gift   of words or is it tongues i ought to say    was ever such a man for seeing likeness    or disregarding peoples civil questions   what weve found out in one hour more about him   than we had seeing him pass by in the road   a thousand times if thats the way he preaches   you didnt think youd keep him after all   oh im not blaming you he didnt leave you   much say in the matter and im just as glad   were not in for a night of him no sleep   if he had stayed the least thing set him going   its quiet as an empty church without him    but how much better off are we as it is   well have to sit here till we know hes safe    yes i suppose youll want to but i shouldnt   he knows what he can do or he wouldnt try   get into bed i say and get some rest   he wont come back and if he telephones   it wont be for an hour or two                                                     well then   we cant be any help by sitting here   and living his fight through with him i suppose                                         cole had been telephoning in the dark   mrs coles voice came from an inner room   did she call you or you call her                                                  she me   youd better dress you wont go back to bed   we must have been asleep its three and after    had she been ringing long ill get my wrapper   i want to speak to her                                        all she said was   he hadnt come and had he really started    she knew he had poor thing two hours ago    he had the shovel hell have made a fight    why did i ever let him leave this house    dont begin that you did the best you could   to keep himthough perhaps you didnt quite   conceal a wish to see him show the spunk   to disobey you much his wifell thank you    fred after all i said you shant make out   that it was any way but what it was   did she let on by any word she said   she didnt thank me                                  when i told her gone   well then she said and well thenlike a threat   and then her voice came scraping slow oh you   why did you let him go                                    asked why we let him   you let me there ill ask her why she let him   she didnt dare to speak when he was here   their numberstwentyone the thing wont work   someones receivers down the handle stumbles   the stubborn thing the way it jars your arm   its theirs shes dropped it from her hand and gone    try speaking say hello                                           hello hello    what do you hear                                   i hear an empty room   you knowit sounds that way and yes i hear   i think i hear a clockand windows rattling   no step though if shes there shes sitting down    shout she may hear you                                    shouting is no good    keep speaking then                                     hello hello hello   you dont suppose she wouldnt go out doors    im half afraid thats just what she might do    and leave the children                                     wait and call again   you cant hear whether she has left the door   wide open and the winds blown out the lamp   and the fires died and the rooms dark and cold    one of two things either shes gone to bed   or gone out doors                             in which case both are lost   do you know what shes like have you ever met her   its strange she doesnt want to speak to us          fred see if you can hear what i hear come    a clock maybe                          dont you hear something else    not talking                            no                           why yes i hearwhat is it    what do you say it is                      a babys crying   frantic it sounds though muffled and far off    its mother wouldnt let it cry like that   not if shes there                                 what do you make of it    theres only one thing possible to make   that is assumingthat she has gone out   of course she hasnt though they both sat down   helpless theres nothing we can do till morning    fred i shant let you think of going out    hold on the double bell began to chirp   they started up fred took the telephone   hello meserve youre there thenand your wife   good why i askedshe didnt seem to answer   he says she went to let him in the barn   were glad oh say no more about it man   drop in and see us when youre passing                                                    well   she has him then though what she wants him for   i dont see                                possibly not for herself   maybe she only wants him for the children    the whole todo seems to have been for nothing   what spoiled our night was to him just his fun   what did he come in forto talk and visit   thought hed just call to tell us it was snowing   if he thinks he is going to make our house   a halfway coffee house twixt town and nowhere    i thought youd feel youd been too much concerned    you think you havent been concerned yourself    if you mean he was inconsiderate   to rout us out to think for him at midnight   and then take our advice no more than nothing   why i agree with you but lets forgive him   weve had a share in one night of his life   whatll you bet he ever calls again     the sound of the trees     i wonder about the trees   why do we wish to bear   forever the noise of these   more than another noise   so close to our dwelling place   we suffer them by the day   till we lose all measure of pace   and fixity in our joys   and acquire a listening air   they are that that talks of going   but never gets away   and that talks no less for knowing   as it grows wiser and older   that now it means to stay   my feet tug at the floor   and my head sways to my shoulder   sometimes when i watch trees sway   from the window or the door   i shall set forth for somewhere   i shall make the reckless choice   some day when they are in voice   and tossing so as to scare   the white clouds over them on   i shall have less to say   but i shall be gone                                          some recent poetry    stephen vincent ben√©ts       heavens and earth    thomas burkes       the song book of quong lee of limehouse
