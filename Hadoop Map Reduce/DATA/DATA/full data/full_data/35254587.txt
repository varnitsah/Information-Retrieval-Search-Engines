35254587	passages from the english notebooks  of  nathaniel hawthorne   vol i    to francis bennoch esq  the dear and valued friend who by his generous and genial hospitality and unfailing sympathy contributed so largely as is attested by the book itself to render mr hawthornes residence in england agreeable and homelike these english notes are dedicated with sincere respect and regard by                 the editor     preface   it seems justly due to mr hawthorne that the occasion of any portion of his private journals being brought before the public should be made known since they were originally designed for his own reference only  there had been a constant and an urgent demand for a life or memoir of mr hawthorne yet from the extreme delicacy and difficulty of the subject the editor felt obliged to refuse compliance with this demand moreover mr hawthorne had frequently and emphatically expressed the hope that no one would attempt to write his biography and the editor perceived that it would be impossible for any person outside of his own domestic circle to succeed in doing it on account of his extreme reserve  but it was ungracious to do nothing and therefore the editor believing that mr hawthorne himself was alone capable of satisfactorily answering the affectionate call for some sketch of his life concluded to publish as much as possible of his private records and even extracts from his private letters in order to gratify the desire of his friends and of literary artists to become more intimately acquainted with him the editor has been severely blamed and wondered at in some instances for allowing many things now published to see the light but it has been a matter both of conscience and courtesy to withhold nothing that could be given up  many of the journals were doubtless destroyed for the earliest date found in his american papers was that of 1835  the editor has transcribed the manuscripts just as they were left without making any new arrangement or altering any sequencemerely omitting some passages and being especially careful to preserve whatever could throw any light upon his character  to persons on a quest for characteristics however each of his books reveals a great many and it is believed that with the aid of the notes both american and english the tales and romances will make out a very complete and true picture of his individuality and the notes are often an open sesame to the artistic works  several thickly written pages of observationsfine and accurate etchingshave been omitted sometimes because too personal with regard to himself or others and sometimes because they were afterwards absorbed into one or another of the romances or papers in our old home  it seemed a pity not to give these original cartoons fresh from his mind because they are so carefully finished at the first stroke  yet as mr hawthorne chose his own way of presenting them to the public it was thought better not to exhibit what he himself withheld  besides to any other than a fellowartist they might seem mere repetitions  it is very earnestly hoped that these volumes of notesamerican english and presently italianwill dispel an oftenexpressed opinion that mr hawthorne was gloomy and morbid  he had the inevitable pensiveness and gravity of a person who possessed what a friend of his called the awful power of insight but his mood was always cheerful and equal and his mind peculiarly healthful and the airy splendor of his wit and humor was the light of his home  he saw too far to be despondent though his vivid sympathies and shaping imagination often made him sad in behalf of others  he also perceived morbidness wherever it existed instantly as if by the illumination of his own steady cheer and he had the plastic power of putting himself into each persons situation and of looking from every point of view which made his charity most comprehensive  from this cause he necessarily attracted confidences and became confessor to very many sinning and suffering souls to whom he gave tender sympathy and help while resigning judgment to the omniscient and allwise  throughout his journals it will be seen that mr hawthorne is entertaining and not asserting opinions and ideas  he questions doubts and reflects with his pen and as it were instructs himself so that these notebooks should be read not as definitive conclusions of his mind but merely as passing impressions often  whatever conclusions be arrived at are condensed in the works given to the world by his own hand in which will never be found a careless word  he was so extremely scrupulous about the value and effect of every expression that the editor has felt great compunction in allowing a single sentence to be printed unrevised by himself but with the consideration of the above remarks always kept in mind these volumes are intrusted to the generous interpretation of the reader  if any one must be harshly criticised it ought certainly to be the editor  when a person breaks in unannounced upon the morning hours of an artist and finds him not in full dress the intruder and not the surprised artist is doubtless at fault         s  h  dresden april 1870      passages from hawthornes english notebooks     liverpool august 4th 1853a month lacking two days since we left americaa fortnight and some odd days since we arrived in england  i began my services such as they are on monday last august 1st and here i sit in my private room at the consulate while the viceconsul and clerk are carrying on affairs in the outer office  the pleasantest incident of the morning is when mr pearce the viceconsul makes his appearance with the accountbooks containing the receipts and expenditures of the preceding day and deposits on my desk a little rouleau of the queens coin wrapped up in a piece of paper  this morning there were eight sovereigns four halfcrowns and a shillinga pretty fair days work though not more than the average ought to be this forenoon thus far i have had two calls not of businessone from an american captain and his son another from mr h  b whom i met in america and who has showed us great attention here  he has arranged for us to go to the theatre with some of his family this evening  since i have been in liverpool we have hardly had a day until yesterday without more or less of rain and so cold and shivery that life was miserable  i am not warm enough even now but am gradually getting acclimated in that respect  just now i have been fooled out of half a crown by a young woman who represents herself as an american and destitute having come over to see an uncle whom she found dead and she has no means of getting back again her accent is not that of an american and her appearance is not particularly prepossessing though not decidedly otherwise  she is decently dressed and modest in deportment but i do not quite trust her face  she has been separated from her husband as i understand her by course of law has had two children both now dead  what she wants is to get back to america and perhaps arrangements may be made with some shipmaster to take her as stewardess or in some subordinate capacity  my judgment on the whole is that she is an english woman married to and separated from an american husbandof no very decided virtue  i might as well have kept my halfcrown and yet i might have bestowed it worse she is very decent in manner cheerful at least not despondent  at two oclock i went over to the royal rock hotel about fifteen or twenty minutes steaming from this side of the river  we are going there on saturday to reside for a while  returning i found that mr b from the american chamber of commerce had called to arrange the time and place of a visit to the consul from a delegation of that body  settled for tomorrow at quarter past one at mr blodgetts   august 5than invitation this morning from the mayor to dine at the town hall on friday next  heaven knows i had rather dine at the humblest inn in the city inasmuch as a speech will doubtless be expected from me however things must be as they may  at a quarter past one i was duly on hand at mr blodgetts to receive the deputation from the chamber of commerce  they arrived pretty seasonably in two or three carriages and were ushered into the drawingroomseven or eight gentlemen some of whom i had met before  hereupon ensued a speech from mr b the chairman of the delegation short and sweet alluding to my literary reputation and other laudatory matters and occupying only a minute or two  the speaker was rather embarrassed which encouraged me a little and yet i felt more diffidence on this occasion than in my effort at mr crittendens lunch where indeed i was perfectly selfpossessed  but here there being less formality and more of a conversational character in what was said my usual diffidence could not so well be kept in abeyance  however i did not break down to an intolerable extent and winding up my eloquence as briefly as possible we had a social talk  their whole stay could not have been much more than a quarter of an hour  a call this morning at the consulate from dr bowrug who is british minister or something of the kind in china and now absent on a twelvemonths leave  the doctor is a brisk person with the address of a man of the worldfree quick to smile and of agreeable manners  he has a good face rather american than english in aspect and does not look much above fifty though he says he is between sixty and seventy  i should take him rather for an active lawyer or a man of business than for a scholar and a literary man  he talked in a lively way for ten or fifteen minutes and then took his leave offering me any service in his power in londonas for instance to introduce me to the athenaeum club   august 8thday before yesterday i escorted my family to rock ferry two miles either up or down the mersey and i really dont know which by steamer which runs every halfhour  there are steamers going continually to birkenhead and other landings and almost always a great many passengers on the transit  at this time the boat was crowded so as to afford scanty standingroom it being saturday and therefore a kind of galaday  i think i have never seen a populace before coming to england but this crowd afforded a specimen of one both male and female the women were the most remarkable though they seemed not disreputable there was in them a coarseness a freedom ani dont know what that was purely english  in fact men and women here do things that would at least make them ridiculous in america  they are not afraid to enjoy themselves in their own way and have no pseudogentility to support some girls danced upon the crowded deck to the miserable music of a little fragment of a band which goes up and down the river on each trip of the boat  just before the termination of the voyage a man goes round with a bugle turned upwards to receive the eleemosynary pence and halfpence of the passengers  i gave one of them the other day a silver fourpence which fell into the vitals of the instrument and compelled the man to take it to pieces  at rock ferry there was a great throng forming a scene not unlike one of our musterdays or a fourth of july and there were bands of music and banners and small processions after them and a school of charity children i believe enjoying a festival  and there was a club of respectable persons playing at bowls on the bowlinggreen of the hotel and there were children infants riding on donkeys at a penny a ride while their mothers walked alongside to prevent a fall  yesterday while we were at dinner mr b came in his carriage to take us to his residence poulton hall  he had invited us to dine but i misunderstood him and thought he only intended to give us a drive  poulton hall is about three miles from rock ferry the road passing through some pleasant rural scenery and one or two villages with houses standing close together and old stone or brick cottages with thatched roofs and now and then a better mansion apart among trees  we passed an old church with a tower and spire and halfway up a patch of ivy dark green and some yellow wallflowers in full bloom growing out of the crevices of the stone  mr b told us that the tower was formerly quite clothed with ivy from bottom to top but that it had fallen away for lack of the nourishment that it used to find in the lime between the stones  this old church answered to my transatlantic fancies of england better than anything i have yet seen  not far from it was the rectory behind a deep grove of ancient trees and there lives the rector enjoying a thousand pounds a year and his nothingtodo while a curate performs the real duty on a stipend of eighty pounds  we passed through a considerable extent of private road and finally drove over a lawn studded with trees and closely shaven till we reached the door of poulton hall  part of the mansion is three or four hundred years old another portion is about a hundred and fifty and still another has been built during the present generation  the house is two stories high with a sort of beetlebrowed roof in front  it is not very striking and does not look older than many wooden houses which i have seen in america  there is a curious stately staircase with a twisted balustrade much like that of the old province house in boston  the drawingroom is a handsome modern apartment being beautifully painted and gilded and paperhung with a white marble fireplace and rich furniture so that the impression is that of newness not of age  it is the same with the diningroom and all the rest of the interior so far as i saw it  mr b did not inherit this old hall nor indeed is he the owner but only the tenant of it  he is a merchant of liverpool a bachelor with two sisters residing with him  in the entrancehall there was a stuffed fox with glass eyes which i never should have doubted to be an actual live fox except for his keeping so quiet also some grouse and other game  mr b seems to be a sportsman and is setting out this week on an excursion to scotland moorfowl shooting  while the family and two or three guests went to dinner we walked out to see the place  the gardener an irishman showed us through the garden which is large and well cared for  they certainly get everything from nature which she can possibly be persuaded to give them here in england there were peaches and pears growing against the high brick southern wallsthe trunk and branches of the trees being spread out perfectly flat against the wall very much like the skin of a dead animal nailed up to dry and not a single branch protruding  figs were growing in the same way  the brick wall very probably was heated within by means of pipes in order to reenforce the insufficient heat of the sun  it seems as if there must be something unreal and unsatisfactory in fruit that owes its existence to such artificial methods  squashes were growing under glass poor things  there were immensely large gooseberries in the garden and in this particular berry the english i believe have decidedly the advantage over ourselves  the raspberries too were large and good  i espied one gigantic hogweed in the garden and really my heart warmed to it being strongly reminded of the principal product of my own garden at concord  after viewing the garden sufficiently the gardener led us to other parts of the estate and we had glimpses of a delightful valley its sides shady with beautiful trees and a rich grassy meadow at the bottom  by means of a steamengine and subterranean pipes and hydrants the liquid manure from the barnyard is distributed wherever it is wanted over the estate being spouted in rich showers from the hydrants  under this influence the meadow at the bottom of the valley had already been made to produce three crops of grass during the present season and would produce another  the lawn around poulton hall like thousands of other lawns in england is very beautiful but requires great care to keep it so being shorn every three or four days  no other country will ever have this charm nor the charm of lovely verdure which almost makes up for the absence of sunshine  without the constant rain and shadow which strikes us as so dismal these lawns would be as brown as an autumn leaf  i have not thus far found any such magnificent trees as i expected  mr b told me that three oaks standing in a row on his lawn were the largest in the county  they were very good trees to be sure and perhaps four feet in diameter near the ground but with no very noble spread of foliage  in concord there are if not oaks yet certainly elms a great deal more stately and beautiful  but on the whole this lawn and the old hall in the midst of it went a good way towards realizing some of my fancies of english life  by and by a footman looking very quaint and queer in his livery coat drab breeches and white stockings came to invite me to the table where i found mr b and his sisters and guests sitting at the fruit and wine there were port sherry madeira and one bottle of claret all very good but they take here much heavier wines than we drink now in america after a tolerably long session we went to the tearoom where i drank some coffee and at about the edge of dusk the carriage drew up to the door to take us home  mr b and his sisters have shown us genuine kindness and they gave us a hearty invitation to come and ramble over the house whenever we pleased during their absence in scotland  they say that there are many legends and ghoststories connected with the house and there is an attic chamber with a skylight which is called the martyrs chamber from the fact of its having in old times been tenanted by a lady who was imprisoned there and persecuted to death for her religion  there is an old blackletter library but the room containing it is shut barred and padlockedthe owner of the house refusing to let it be opened lest some of the books should be stolen meanwhile the rats are devouring them and the damps destroying them   august 9tha pretty comfortable day as to warmth and i believe there is sunshine overhead but a seacloud composed of fog and coalsmoke envelops liverpool  at rock ferry when i left it at half past nine there was promise of a cheerful day  a good many gentlemen or rather respectable business people came in the boat and it is not unpleasant on these fine mornings to take the breezy atmosphere of the river  the huge steamer great britain bound for australia lies right off the rock ferry landing and at a little distance are two old hulks of ships of war dismantled roofed over and anchored in the river formerly for quarantine purposes but now used chiefly or solely as homes for old seamen whose light labor it is to take care of these condemned ships there are a great many steamers plying up and down the river to various landings in the vicinity and a good many steamtugs also many boats most of which have darkred or tancolored sails being oiled to resist the wet also here and there a yacht or pleasureboat and a few ships riding stately at their anchors probably on the point of sailing  the river however is by no means crowded because the immense multitude of ships are ensconced in the docks where their masts make an intricate forest for miles up and down the liverpool shore  the small black steamers whizzing industriously along many of them crowded with passengers snake up the chief life of the scene  the mersey has the color of a mudpuddle and no atmospheric effect as far as i have seen ever gives it a more agreeable tinge  visitors today thus far have been h a b with whom i have arranged to dine with us at rock ferry and then he is to take us on board the great britain of which his father is owner in great part  secondly monsieur h the french consul who can speak hardly any english and who was more powerfully scented with cigarsmoke than any man i ever encountered a polite grayhaired rednosed gentleman very courteous and formal  heaven keep him from me  at one oclock or thereabouts i walked into the city down through lord street church street and back to the consulate through various untraceable crookednesses  coming to chapel street i crossed the graveyard of the old church of st nicholas this is i suppose the oldest sacred site in liverpool a church having stood here ever since the conquest though probably there is little or nothing of the old edifice in the present one either the whole of the edifice or else the steeple being thereto shaken by a chime of bells perhaps both at different timeshas tumbled down but the present church is what we americans should call venerable  when the first church was built and long afterwards it must have stood on the grassy verge of the mersey but now there are pavements and warehouses and the thronged princes and georges docks between it and the river and all around it is the very busiest bustle of commerce rumbling wheels hurrying men portershops everything that pertains to the grossest and most practical life  and notwithstanding there is the broad churchyard extending on three sides of it just as it used to be a thousand years ago  it is absolutely paved from border to border with flat tombstones on a level with the soil and with each other so that it is one floor of stone over the whole space with grass here and there sprouting between the crevices  all these stones no doubt formerly had inscriptions but as many people continually pass in various directions across the churchyard and as the tombstones are not of a very hard material the records on many of them are effaced  i saw none very old  a quarter of a century is sufficient to obliterate the letters and make all smooth where the direct pathway from gate to gate lies over the stones  the climate and casual footsteps rub out any inscription in less than a hundred years  some of the monuments are cracked  on many is merely cut the burial place of so and so on others there is a long list of halfreadable names on some few a laudatory epitaph out of which however it were far too tedious to pick the meaning  but it really is interesting and suggestive to think of this old church first built when liverpool was a small village and remaining with its successive dead of ten centuries around it now that the greatest commercial city in the world has its busiest centre there  i suppose people still continue to be buried in the cemetery  the greatest upholders of burials in cities are those whose progenitors have been deposited around or within the city churches  if this spacious churchyard stood in a similar position in one of our american cities i rather suspect that long ere now it would have run the risk of being laid out in buildinglots and covered with warehouses even if the church itself escapedbut it would not escape longer than till its disrepair afforded excuse for tearing it down  and why should it when its purposes might be better served in another spot  we went on board the great britain before dinner between five and six oclocka great structure as to convenient arrangement and adaptation but giving me a strong impression of the tedium and misery of the long voyage to australia  by way of amusement she takes over fifty pounds worth of playingcards at two shillings per pack for the use of passengers also a small wellselected library  after a considerable time spent on board we returned to the hotel and dined and mr b took his leave at nine oclock   august 10thi left rock ferry for the city at half past nine  in the boat which arrived thence there were several men and women with baskets on their heads for this is a favorite way of carrying burdens and they trudge onward beneath them without any apparent fear of an overturn and seldom putting up a hand to steady them  one woman this morning had a heavy load of crockery another an immense basket of turnips freshly gathered that seemed to me as much as a man could well carry on his back  these must be a stiffnecked people  the women step sturdily and freely and with not ungraceful strength  the trip over to town was pleasant it being a fair morning only with a lowhanging fog  had it been in america i should have anticipated a day of burning heat  visitors this morning  mr ogden of chicago or somewhere in the western states who arrived in england a fortnight ago and who called on me at that time  he has since been in scotland and is now going to london and the continent secondly the captain of the collins steamer pacific which sails today thirdly an american shipmaster who complained that he had never in his heretofore voyages been able to get sight of the american consul  mr pearces customary matutinal visit was unusually agreeable today inasmuch as he laid on my desk nineteen golden sovereigns and thirteen shillings  it being the day of the steamers departure an unusual number of invoice certificates had been requiredmy signature to each of which brings me two dollars  the autograph of a living author has seldom been so much in request at so respectable a price  colonel crittenden told me that he had received as much as fifty pounds on a single day  heaven prosper the trade between america and liverpool   august 15thmany scenes which i should have liked to record have occurred but the pressure of business has prevented me from recording them from day to day  on thursday i went on invitation from mr b to the prodigious steamer great britain down the harbor and some miles into the sea to escort her off a little way on her voyage to australia  there is an immense enthusiasm among the english people about this ship on account of its being the largest in the world  the shores were lined with people to see her sail and there were innumerable small steamers crowded with men all the way out into the ocean  nothing seems to touch the english nearer than this question of nautical superiority and if we wish to hit them to the quick we must hit them there  on friday at 7 pm i went to dine with the mayor  it was a dinner given to the judges and the grand jury  the judges of england during the time of holding an assize are the persons first in rank in the kingdom  they take precedence of everybody elseof the highest military officers of the lord lieutenants of the archbishopsof the prince of walesof all except the sovereign whose authority and dignity they represent  in case of a royal dinner the judge would lead the queen to the table  the dinner was at the town hall and the rooms and the whole affair were all in the most splendid style  nothing struck me more than the footmen in the city livery  they really looked more magnificent in their goldlace and breeches and white silk stockings than any officers of state  the rooms were beautiful gorgeously painted and gilded gorgeously lighted gorgeously hung with paintingsthe plate was gorgeous and the dinner gorgeous in the english fashion  after the removal of the cloth the mayor gave various toasts prefacing each with some remarksthe first of course the sovereign after which god save the queen was sung the company standing up and joining in the chorus their ample faces glowing with wine enthusiasm and loyalty afterwards the bar and various other dignities and institutions were toasted and by and by came the toast to the united states and to me as their representative  hereupon either hail columbia or yankee doodle or some other of our national tunes but heaven knows which was played and at the conclusion being at bay and with no alternative i got upon my legs and made a response  they received me and listened to my nonsense with a good deal of rapping and my speech seemed to give great satisfaction my chief difficulty being in not knowing how to pitch my voice to the size of the room  as for the matter it is not of the slightest consequence  anybody may make an afterdinner speech who will be content to talk onward without saying anything  my speech was not more than two or three inches long and considering that i did not know a soul there except the mayor himself and that i am wholly unpractised in all sorts of oratory and that i had nothing to say it was quite successful  i hardly thought it was in me but being once started i felt no embarrassment and went through it as coolly as if i were going to be hanged  yesterday after dinner i took a walk with my family  we went through byways and private roads and saw more of rural england with its hedgerows its grassy fields and its whitewashed old stone cottages than we have before seen since our arrival   august 20ththis being saturday there early commenced a throng of visitants to rock ferry  the boat in which i came over brought from the city a multitude of factorypeople  they had bands of music and banners inscribed with the names of the mills they belong to and other devices palelooking people but not looking exactly as if they were underfed they are brought on reduced terms by the railways and steamers and come from great distances in the interior  these i believe were from preston  i have not yet had an opportunity of observing how they amuse themselves during these excursions  at the dock the other day the steamer arrived from rock ferry with a countless multitude of little girls in coarse blue gowns who as they landed formed in procession and walked up the dock  these girls had been taken from the workhouses and educated at a charityschool and would by and by be apprenticed as servants  i should not have conceived it possible that so many children could have been collected together without a single trace of beauty or scarcely of intelligence in so much as one individual such mean coarse vulgar features and figures betraying unmistakably a low origin and ignorant and brutal parents they did not appear wicked but only stupid animal and soulless  it must require many generations of better life to wake the soul in them all america could not show the like   august 22da captain auld an american having died here yesterday i went with my clerk and an american shipmaster to take the inventory of his effects  his boardinghouse was in a mean street an old dingy house with narrow entrancethe class of boardinghouse frequented by mates of vessels and inferior to those generally patronized by masters a fat elderly landlady of respectable and honest aspect and her daughter a pleasing young woman enough received us and ushered us into the deceaseds bedchamber  it was a dusky back room plastered and painted yellow its one window looking into the very narrowest of backyards or courts and out on a confused multitude of back buildings appertaining to other houses most of them old with rude chimneys of washrooms and kitchens the bricks of which seemed half loose  the chattels of the dead man were contained in two trunks a chest a sailcloth bag and a barrel and consisted of clothing suggesting a thickset middlesized man papers relative to ships and business a spyglass a loaded iron pistol some books of navigation some charts several great pieces of tobacco and a few cigars some little plaster images that he had probably bought for his children a cotton umbrella and other trumpery of no great value  in one of the trunks we found about twenty pounds worth of english and american gold and silver and some notes of hand due in america  of all these things the clerk made an inventory after which we took possession of the money and affixed the consular seal to the trunks bag and chest  while this was going on we heard a great noise of men quarrelling in an adjoining court and altogether it seemed a squalid and ugly place to live in and a most undesirable one to die in  at the conclusion of our labors the young woman asked us if we would not go into another chamber and look at the corpse and appeared to think that we should be rather glad than otherwise of the privilege  but never having seen the man during his lifetime i declined to commence his acquaintance now  his bills for board and nursing amount to about the sum which we found in his trunk his funeral expenses will be ten pounds more the surgeon has sent in a bill of eight pounds odd shillings and the account of another medical man is still to be rendered  as his executor i shall pay his landlady and nurse and for the rest of the expenses a subscription must be made according to the custom in such cases among the shipmasters headed by myself  the funeral pomp will consist of a hearse one coach four men with crape hatbands and a few other items together with a grave at five pounds over which his friends will be entitled to place a stone if they choose to do so within twelve months  as we left the house we looked into the dark and squalid diningroom where a lunch of cold meat was set out but having no associations with the house except through this one dead man it seemed as if his presence and attributes pervaded it wholly  he appears to have been a man of reprehensible habits though well advanced in years  i ought not to forget a brandyflask empty among his other effects  the landlady and daughter made a good impression on me as honest and respectable persons   august 24thyesterday in the forenoon i received a note and shortly afterwards a call at the consulate from miss h whom i apprehend to be a lady of literary tendencies  she said that miss l had promised her an introduction but that happening to pass through liverpool she had snatched the opportunity to make my acquaintance  she seems to be a mature lady rather plain but with an honest and intelligent face  it was rather a singular freedom methinks to come down upon a perfect stranger in this wayto sit with him in his private office an hour or two and then walk about the streets with him as she did for i did the honors of liverpool and showed her the public buildings  her talk was sensible but not particularly brilliant nor interesting a good solid personage physically and intellectually  she is an english woman  in the afternoon at three oclock i attended the funeral of captain auld  being ushered into the diningroom of his boardinghouse i found brandy gin and wine set out on a tray together with some little spicecakes  by and by came in a woman who asked if i were going to the funeral and then proceeded to put a mourningband on my hata blacksilk band covering the whole hat and streaming nearly a yard behind  after waiting the better part of an hour nobody else appeared although several shipmasters had promised to attend  hereupon the undertaker was anxious to set forth but the landlady who was arrayed in shining black silk thought it a shame that the poor man should be buried with such small attendance  so we waited a little longer during which interval i heard the landladys daughter sobbing and wailing in the entry and but for this tenderheartedness there would have been no tears at all  finally we set forththe undertaker a friend of his and a young man perhaps the landladys son and myself in the blackplumed coach and the landlady her daughter and a female friend in the coach behind  previous to this however everybody had taken some wine or spirits for it seemed to be considered disrespectful not to do so  before us went the plumed hearse a stately affair with a basrelief of funereal figures upon its sides  we proceeded quite across the city to the necropolis where the coffin was carried into a chapel in which we found already another coffin and another set of mourners awaiting the clergyman  anon he appeareda stern broadframed large and baldheaded man in a blacksilk gown  he mounted his desk and read the service in quite a feeble and unimpressive way though with no lack of solemnity  this done our four bearers took up the coffin and carried it out of the chapel but descending the steps and perhaps having taken a little too much brandy one of them stumbled and down came the coffinnot quite to the ground however for they grappled with it and contrived with a great struggle to prevent the misadventure  but i really expected to see poor captain auld burst forth among us in his graveclothes  the necropolis is quite a handsome burialplace shut in by high walls so overrun with shrubbery that no part of the brick or stone is visible part of the space within is an ornamental garden with flowers and green turf the rest is strewn with flat gravestones and a few raised monuments and straight avenues run to and fro between  captain aulds grave was dug nine feet deep  it is his own for twelve months but if his friends do not choose to give him a stone it will become a common grave at the end of that time and four or five more bodies may then be piled upon his  every one seemed greatly to admire the grave the undertaker praised it and also the dryness of its site which he took credit to himself for having chosen  the gravedigger too was very proud of its depth and the neatness of his handiwork  the clergyman who had marched in advance of us from the chapel now took his stand at the head of the grave and lifting his hat proceeded with what remained of the service while we stood bareheaded around  when he came to a particular part ashes to ashes dust to dust the undertaker lifted a handful of earth and threw it rattling on the coffinso did the landladys son and so did i  after the funeral the undertakers friend an elderly coarselooking man looked round him and remarked that the grass had never grown on the parties who died in the cholera year but at this the undertaker laughed in scorn  as we returned to the gate of the cemetery the sexton met us and pointed to a small office on entering which we found the clergyman who was waiting for his burialfees  there was now a dispute between the clergyman and the undertaker the former wishing to receive the whole amount for the gravestone which the undertaker of course refused to pay  i explained how the matter stood on which the clergyman acquiesced civilly enough but it was very strange to see the worldly businesslike way in which he entered into this squabble so soon after burying poor captain auld  during our drive back in the mourningcoach the undertaker his friend and the landladys son still kept descanting on the excellence of the gravesuch a fine gravesuch a nice gravesuch a splendid graveand really they seemed almost to think it worth while to die for the sake of being buried there  they deemed it an especial pity that such a grave should ever become a common grave  why said they to me by paying the extra price you may have it for your own grave or for your family meaning that we should have a right to pile ourselves over the defunct captain  i wonder how the english ever attain to any conception of a future existence since they so overburden themselves with earth and mortality in their ideas of funerals  a drive with an undertaker in a sableplumed coachtalking about gravesand yet he was a jolly old fellow wonderfully corpulent with a smile breaking out easily all over his facealthough once in a while he looked professionally lugubrious  all the time the scent of that horrible mourningcoach is in my nostrils and i breathe nothing but a funeral atmosphere   saturday august 27ththis being the galaday of the manufacturing people about liverpool the steamboats to rock ferry were seasonably crowded with large parties of both sexes  they were accompanied with two bands of music in uniform and these bands before i left the hotel were playing in competition and rivalry with each other in the coachyard loud martial strains from shining brass instruments  a prize is to be assigned to one or to the other of these bands and i suppose this was a part of the competition  meanwhile the merrymaking people who thronged the courtyard were quaffing coffee from blue earthen mugs which they brought with themas likewise they brought the coffee and had it made in the hotel  it had poured with rain about the time of their arrival notwithstanding which they did not seem disheartened for of course in this climate it enters into all their calculations to be drenched through and through by and by the sun shone out and it has continued to shine and shade every ten minutes ever since  all these people were decently dressed the men generally in dark clothes not so smartly as americans on a festal day but so as not to be greatly different as regards dress  they were paler smaller less wholesomelooking and less intelligent and i think less noisy than so many yankees would have been  the women and girls differed much more from what american girls and women would be on a pleasureexcursion being so shabbily dressed with no kind of smartness no silks nothing but cotton gowns i believe and illlooking bonnets which however was the only part of their attire that they seemed to care about guarding from the rain  as to their persons they generally looked better developed and healthier than the men but there was a woful lack of beauty and grace not a pretty girl among them all coarse and vulgar  their bodies it seems to me are apt to be very long in proportion to their limbsin truth this kind of make is rather characteristic of both sexes in england  the speech of these folks in some instances was so broad lancashire that i could not well understand it    a walk to bebbington   rock ferry august 29thyesterday we all took a walk into the country it was a fine afternoon with clouds of course in different parts of the sky but a clear atmosphere bright sunshine and altogether a septembrish feeling  the ramble was very pleasant along the hedgelined roads in which there were flowers blooming and the varnished holly certainly one of the most beautiful shrubs in the world so far as foliage goes  we saw one cottage which i suppose was several hundred years old  it was of stone filled into a wooden frame the blackoak of which was visible like an external skeleton it had a thatched roof and was whitewashed  we passed through a villagehigher bebbington i believewith narrow streets and mean houses all of brick or stone and not standing wide apart from each other as in american country villages but conjoined  there was an immense almshouse in the midst at least i took it to be so  in the centre of the village too we saw a moderatesized brick house built in imitation of a castle with a tower and turret in which an upper and an under row of small cannon were mountednow green with moss  there were also battlements along the roof of the house which looked as if it might have been built eighty or a hundred years ago  in the centre of it there was the dial of a clock but the inner machinery had been removed and the hands hanging listlessly moved to and fro in the wind  it was quite a novel symbol of decay and neglect  on the wall close to the street there were certain eccentric inscriptions cut into slabs of stone but i could make no sense of them  at the end of the house opposite the turret we peeped through the bars of an iron gate and beheld a little paved courtyard and at the farther side of it a small piazza beneath which seemed to stand the figure of a man  he appeared well advanced in years and was dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches with a white or straw hat on his head behold too in a kennel beside the porch a large dog sitting on his hind legs chained  also close beside the gateway another man seated in a kind of arbor  all these were wooden images and the whole castellated small villagedwelling with the inscriptions and the queer statuary was probably the whim of some halfcrazy person who has now no doubt been long asleep in bebbington churchyard  the bell of the old church was ringing as we went along and many respectablelooking people and cleanly dressed children were moving towards the sound  soon we reached the church and i have seen nothing yet in england that so completely answered my idea of what such a thing was as this old village church of bebbington  it is quite a large edifice built in the form of a cross a low peaked porch in the side over which rudely cut in stone is the date 1300 and something  the steeple has ivy on it and looks old old old so does the whole church though portions of it have been renewed but not so as to impair the aspect of heavy substantial endurance and long long decay which may go on hundreds of years longer before the church is a ruin  there it stands among the surrounding graves looking just the same as it did in bloody marys days just as it did in cromwells time a bird and perhaps many birds had its nest in the steeple and flew in and out of the loopholes that were opened into it  the stone framework of the windows looked particularly old  there were monuments about the church some lying flat on the ground others elevated on low pillars or on cross slabs of stone and almost all looking dark mossgrown and very antique  but on reading some of the inscriptions i was surprised to find them very recent for in fact twenty years of this climate suffices to give as much or more antiquity of aspect whether to gravestone or edifice than a hundred years of our ownso soon do lichens creep over the surface so soon does it blacken so soon do the edges lose their sharpness so soon does time gnaw away the records  the only really old monuments and those not very old were two standing close together and raised on low rude arches the dates on which were 1684 and 1686  on one a cross was rudely cut into the stone but there may have been hundreds older than this the records on which had been quite obliterated and the stones removed and the graves dug over anew  none of the monuments commemorate people of rank on only one the buried person was recorded as gent  while we sat on  the flat slabs resting ourselves several little girls healthylooking and prettily dressed enough came into the churchyard and began to talk and laugh and to skip merrily from one tombstone to another  they stared very broadly at us and one of them by and by ran up to u and j and gave each of them a green apple then they skipped upon the tombstones again while within the church we heard them singing sounding pretty much as i have heard it in our pinebuilt new england meetinghouses  meantime the rector had detected the voices of these naughty little girls and perhaps had caught glimpses of them through the windows for anon out came the sexton and addressing himself to us asked whether there had been any noise or disturbance in the churchyard  i should not have borne testimony against these little villagers but s was so anxious to exonerate our own children that she pointed out these poor little sinners to the sexton who forthwith turned them out  he would have done the same to us no doubt had my coat been worse than it was but as the matter stood his demeanor was rather apologetic than menacing when he informed us that the rector had sent him  we stayed a little longer looking at the graves some of which were between the buttresses of the church and quite close to the wall as if the sleepers anticipated greater comfort and security the nearer they could get to the sacred edifice  as we went out of the churchyard we passed the aforesaid little girls who were sitting behind the mound of a tomb and busily babbling together  they called after us expressing their discontent that we had betrayed them to the sexton and saying that it was not they who made the noise  going homeward we went astray in a green lane that terminated in the midst of a field without outlet so that we had to retrace a good many of our footsteps  close to the wall of the church beside the door there was an ancient baptismal font of stone  in fact it was a pile of roughly hewn stone steps five or six feet high with a block of stone at the summit in which was a hollow about as big as a washbowl  it was full of rainwater  the church seems to be st andrews church lower bebbington built in 1100   september 1sttoday we leave the rock ferry hotel where we have spent nearly four weeks  it is a comfortable place and we have had a good table and have been kindly treated  we occupied a large parlor extending through the whole breadth of the house with a bowwindow looking towards liverpool and adown the intervening river and to birkenhead on the hither side  the river would be a pleasanter object if it were blue and transparent instead of such a mudpuddly hue also if it were always full to its brine whereas it generally presents a margin and sometimes a very broad one of glistening mud with here and there a small vessel aground on it  nevertheless the parlorwindow has given us a pretty good idea of the nautical business of liverpool the constant objects being the little black steamers puffing unquietly along sometimes to our own ferry sometimes beyond it to eastham and sometimes towing a long string of boats from runcorn or otherwhere up the river laden with goods and sometimes gallanting a tall ship in or out  some of these ships lie for days together in the river very majestic and stately objects often with the flag of the stars and stripes waving over them  now and then after a gale at sea a vessel comes in with her masts broken short off in the midst and with marks of rough handling about the hull  once a week comes a cunard steamer with its red funnel pipe whitened by the salt spray and firing off cannon to announce her arrival she moors to a large iron buoy in the middle of the river and a few hundred yards from the stone pier of our ferry  immediately comes poring towards her a little mailsteamer to take away her mailbags and such of the passengers as choose to land and for several hours afterwards the cunard lies with the smoke and steam coming out of her as if she were smoking her pipe after her toilsome passage across the atlantic  once a fortnight comes an american steamer of the collins line and then the cunard salutes her with cannon to which the collins responds and moors herself to another iron buoy not far from the cunard  when they go to sea it is with similar salutes the two vessels paying each other the more ceremonious respect because they are inimical and jealous of each other  besides these there are other steamers of all sorts and sizes for pleasureexcursions for regular trips to dublin the isle of man and elsewhither and vessels which are stationary as floating lights but which seem to relieve one another at intervals and small vessels with sails looking as if made of tanned leather and schooners and yachts and all manner of oddlooking craft but none so odd as the chinese junk this junk lies by our own pier and looks as if it were copied from some picture on an old teacup  beyond all these objects we see the other side of the mersey with the delectably green fields opposite to us while the shore becomes more and more thickly populated until about two miles off we see the dense centre of the city with the dome of the custom house and steeples and towers and close to the water the spire of st nicholas and above and intermingled with the whole city scene the duskiness of the coalsmoke gushing upward  along the bank we perceive the warehouses of the albert dock and the queens tobacco warehouses and other docks and nigher to us a shipyard or two  in the evening all this sombre picture gradually darkens out of sight and in its place appear only the lights of the city kindling into a galaxy of earthly stars for a long distance up and down the shore and in one or two spots the bright red gleam of a furnace like the red planet mars and once in a while a bright wandering beam gliding along the river as a steamer cones or goes between us and liverpool    rock park   september 2dwe got into our new house in rock park yesterday  it is quite a good house with three apartments beside kitchen and pantry on the lower floor and it is three stories high with four good chambers in each story  it is a stone edifice like almost all the english houses and handsome in its design  the rent without furniture would probably have been one hundred pounds furnished it is one hundred and sixty pounds  rock park as the locality is called is private property and is now nearly covered with residences for professional people merchants and others of the upper middling class the houses being mostly built i suppose on speculation and let to those who occupy them  it is the quietest place imaginable there being a police station at the entrance and the officer on duty allows no ragged or illlooking person to pass there being a toll it precludes all unnecessary passage of carriages and never were there more noiseless streets than those that give access to these pretty residences  on either side there is thick shrubbery with glimpses through it of the ornamented portals or into the trim gardens with smoothshaven lawns of no large extent but still affording reasonable breathingspace  they are really an improvement on anything save what the very rich can enjoy in america  the former occupants of our house mrs campbell and family having been fond of flowers there are many rare varieties in the garden and we are told that there is scarcely a month in the year when a flower will not be found there  the house is respectably though not very elegantly furnished  it was a dismal rainy day yesterday and we had a coalfire in the sittingroom beside which i sat last evening as twilight came on and thought rather sadly how many times we have changed our home since we were married  in the first place our three years at the old manse then a brief residence at salem then at boston then two or three years at salem again then at lenox then at west newton and then again at concord where we imagined that we were fixed for life but spent only a year  then this farther flight to england where we expect to spend four years and afterwards another year or two in italy during all which time we shall have no real home  for as i sat in this english house with the chill rainy english twilight brooding over the lawn and a coalfire to keep me comfortable on the first evening of september and the picture of a strangerthe dead husband of mrs campbellgazing down at me from above the mantelpiecei felt that i never should be quite at home here nevertheless the fire was very comfortable to look at and the shape of the fireplacean arch with a deep cavitywas an improvement on the square shallow opening of an american coalgrate   september 7thit appears by the annals of liverpool contained in gores directory that in 1076 there was a baronial castle built by roger de poictiers on the site of the present st georges church  it was taken down in 1721  the church now stands at one of the busiest points of the principal street of the city  the old church of st nicholas founded about the time of the conquest and more recently rebuilt stood within a quarter of a mile of the castle  in 1150 birkenhead priory was founded on the cheshire side of the mersey  the monks used to ferry passengers across to liverpool until 1282 when woodside ferry was establishedtwopence for a horseman and a farthing for a footpassenger  steam ferryboats now cross to birkenhead monks ferry and woodside every ten minutes and i believe there are large hotels at all these places and many of the business men of liverpool have residences in them  in 1252 a tower was built by sir john stanley which continued to be a castle of defence to the stanley family for many hundred years and was not finally taken down till 1820 when its site had become the present water street in the densest commercial centre of the city  there appear to have been other baronial castles and residences in different parts of the city as a hall in old hall street built by sir john de la more on the site of which a countinghouse now stands  this knightly family of de la more sometimes supplied mayors to the city as did the family of the earls of derby  about 1582 edward earl of derby maintained two hundred and fifty citizens of liverpool fed sixty aged persons twice a day and provided twentyseven hundred persons with meat drink and money every good friday  in 1644 prince rupert besieged the town for twentyfour days and finally took it by storm  this was june 26th and the parliamentarians under sir john meldrum repossessed it the following october  in 1669 the mayor of liverpool kept an inn  in 1730 there was only one carriage in town and no stagecoach came nearer than warrington the roads being impassable  in 1734 the earl of derby gave a great entertainment in the tower  in 1737 the mayor was george norton a saddler who frequently took the chair with his leather apron on  his immediate predecessor seems to have been the earl of derby who gave the abovementioned entertainment during his mayoralty  where georges dock now is there used to be a battery of fourteen eighteenpounders for the defence of the town and the old sport of bullbaiting was carried on in that vicinity close to the church of st nicholas   september 12thon saturday a young man was found wandering about in west derby a suburb of liverpool in a state of insanity and being taken before a magistrate he proved to be an american  as he seemed to be in a respectable station of life the magistrate sent the master of the workhouse to me in order to find out whether i would take the responsibility of his expenses rather than have him put in the workhouse  my clerk went to investigate the matter and brought me his papers  his name proves to be   belonging to  twentyfive years of age  one of the papers was a passport from our legation in naples likewise there was a power of attorney from his mother who seems to have been married a second time to dispose of some property of hers abroad a hotel bill also of some length in which were various charges for wine and among other evidences of low funds a pawnbrokers receipt for a watch which he had pledged at five pounds there was also a ticket for his passage to america by the screw steamer andes which sailed on wednesday last  the clerk found him to the last degree incommunicative and nothing could be discovered from him but what the papers disclosed  there were about a dozen utterly unintelligible notes among the papers written by himself since his derangement  i decided to put him into the insane hospital where he now accordingly is and tomorrow by which time he may be in a more conversable mood i mean to pay him a visit  the clerk tells me that there is now and has been for three years an american lady in the liverpool almshouse in a state of insanity  she is very accomplished especially in music but in all this time it has been impossible to find out who she is or anything about her connections or previous life  she calls herself jenny lind and as for any other name or identity she keeps her own secret   september 14thit appears that mr  the insane young gentleman being unable to pay his bill at the inn where he was latterly staying the landlord had taken possession of his luggage and satisfied himself in that way  my clerk at my request has taken his watch out of pawn it proves to be not a very good one though doubtless worth more than five pounds for which it was pledged  the governor of the lunatic asylum wrote me yesterday stating that the patient was in want of a change of clothes and that according to his own account he had left his luggage at the american hotel  after officehours i took a cab and set out with my clerk to pay a visit to the asylum taking the american hotel in our way  the american hotel is a small house not at all such a one as american travellers of any pretension would think of stopping at but still very respectable cleanly and with a neat sittingroom where the guests might assemble after the american fashion  we asked for the landlady and anon down she came a round rosy comfortablelooking english dame of fifty or thereabouts  on being asked whether she knew a mr  she readily responded that he had been there but had left no luggage having taken it away before paying his bill and that she had suspected him of meaning to take his departure without paying her at all  hereupon she had traced him to the hotel before mentioned where she had found that he had stayed two nightsbut was then i think gone from thence afterwards she encountered him again and demanding her due went with him to a pawnbrokers where he pledged his watch and paid her  this was about the extent of the landladys knowledge of the matter  i liked the woman very well with her shrewd goodhumored worldly kindly disposition  then we proceeded to the lunatic asylum to which we were admitted by a porter at the gate  within doors we found some neat and comely servantwomen one of whom showed us into a handsome parlor and took my card to the governor  there was a large bookcase with a glass front containing handsomely bound books many of which i observed were of a religious character  in a few minutes the governor came in a middleaged man tall and thin for an englishman kindly and agreeable enough in aspect but not with the marked look of a man of force and ability  i should not judge from his conversation that he was an educated man or that he had any scientific acquaintance with the subject of insanity  he said that mr  was still quite incommunicative and not in a very promising state that i had perhaps better defer seeing him for a few days that it would not be safe at present to send him home to america without an attendant and this was about all  but on returning home i learned from my wife who had had a call from mrs blodgett that mrs blodgett knew mr  and his mother who has recently been remarried to a young husband and is now somewhere in italy  they seemed to have boarded at mrs blodgetts house on their way to the continent and within a week or two an acquaintance and pastor of mr  the rev dr  has sailed for america  if i could only have caught him i could have transferred the care expense and responsibility of the patient to him  the governor of the asylum mentioned by the way that mr  describes himself as having been formerly a midshipman in the navy  i walked through the st jamess cemetery yesterday  it is a very pretty place dug out of the rock having formerly i believe been a stonequarry  it is now a deep and spacious valley with graves and monuments on its level and grassy floor through which run gravelpaths and where grows luxuriant shrubbery  on one of the steep sides of the valley hewn out of the rock are tombs rising in tiers to the height of fifty feet or more some of them cut directly into the rock with arched portals and others built with stone  on the other side the bank is of earth and rises abruptly quite covered with trees and looking very pleasant with their green shades  it was a warm and sunny day and the cemetery really had a most agreeable aspect  i saw several gravestones of americans but what struck me most was one line of an epitaph on an english woman here rests in peace a virtuous wife  the statue of huskisson stands in the midst of the valley in a kind of mausoleum with a door of plateglass through which you look at the dead statesmans effigy   september 22d    some days ago an american captain came to the office and said he had shot one of his men shortly after sailing from new orleans and while the ship was still in the river  as he described the event he was in peril of his life from this man who was an irishman and he fired his pistol only when the man was coming upon him with a knife in one hand and some other weapon of offence in the other while he himself was struggling with one or two more of the crew  he was weak at the time having just recovered from the yellow fever  the shots struck the man in the pit of the stomach and he lived only about a quarter of an hour  no magistrate in england has a right to arrest or examine the captain unless by a warrant from the secretary of state on the charge of murder  after his statement to me the mother of the slain man went to the police officer and accused him of killing her son  two or three days since moreover two of the sailors came before me and gave their account of the matter and it looked very differently from that of the captain  according to them the man had no idea of attacking the captain and was so drunk that he could not keep himself upright without assistance  one of these two men was actually holding him up when the captain fired two barrels of his pistol one immediately after the other and lodged two balls in the pit of his stomach  the man sank down at once saying jack i am killedand died very shortly meanwhile the captain drove this man away under threats of shooting him likewise  both the seamen described the captains conduct both then and during the whole voyage as outrageous and i do not much doubt that it was so  they gave their evidence like men who wished to tell the truth and were moved by no more than a natural indignation at the captains wrong  i did not much like the captain from the firsta hard rough man with little education and nothing of the gentleman about him a red face and a loud voice  he seemed a good deal excited and talked fast and much about the event but yet not as if it had sunk deeply into him  he observed that he would not have had it happen for a thousand dollars that being the amount of detriment which he conceives himself to suffer by the ineffaceable bloodstain on his hand  in my opinion it is little short of murder if at all but what would be murder on shore is almost a natural occurrence when done in such a hell on earth as one of these ships in the first hours of the voyage  the men are then all drunk some of them often in delirium tremens and the captain feels no safety for his life except in making himself as terrible as a fiend  it is the universal testimony that there is a worse set of sailors in these short voyages between liverpool and america than in any other trade whatever  there is no probability that the captain will ever be called to account for this deed  he gave at the time his own version of the affair in his logbook and this was signed by the entire crew with the exception of one man who had hidden himself in the hold in terror of the captain his mates will sustain his side of the question and none of the sailors would be within reach of the american courts even should they be sought for   october 1ston thursday i went with mr ticknor to chester by railway it is quite an indescribable old town and i feel at last as if i had had a glimpse of old england  the wall encloses a large space within the town but there are numerous houses and streets not included within its precincts  some of the principal streets pass under the ancient gateways and at the side there are flights of steps giving access to the summit  around the top of the whole wall a circuit of about two miles there runs a walk well paved with flagstones and broad enough for three persons to walk abreast  on one sidethat towards the countrythere is a parapet of red freestone three or four feet high  on the other side there are houses rising up immediately from the wall so that they seem a part of it  the height of it i suppose may be thirty or forty feet and in some parts you look down from the parapet into orchards where there are tall appletrees and men on the branches gathering fruit and women and children among the grass filling bags or baskets  there are prospects of the surrounding country among the buildings outside the wall at one point a view of the river dee with an old bridge of arches  it is all very strange very quaint very curious to see how the town has overflowed its barrier and how like many institutions here the ancient wall still exists but is turned to quite another purpose than what it was meant forso far as it serves any purpose at all  there are three or four towers in the course of the circuit the most interesting being one from the top of which king charles the first is said to have seen the rout of his army by the parliamentarians  we ascended the short flight of steps that led up into the tower where an old man pointed out the site of the battlefield now thickly studded with buildings and told us what we had already learned from the guidebook  after this we went into the cathedral which i will perhaps describe on some other occasion when i shall have seen more of it and to better advantage  the cloisters gave us the strongest impression of antiquity the stone arches being so worn and blackened by time  still an american must always have imagined a better cathedral than this  there were some immense windows of painted glass but all modern  in the chapterhouse we found a coalfire burning in a grate and a large heap of old booksthe library of the cathedralin a discreditable state of decaymildewed rotten neglected for years the sexton told us that they were to be arranged and better ordered over the door inside hung two failed and tattered banners being those of the cheshire regiment  the most utterly indescribable feature of chester is the rows which every traveller has attempted to describe  at the height of several feet above some of the oldest streets a walk runs through the front of the houses which project over it  back of the walk there are shops on the outer side is a space of two or three yards where the shopmen place their tables and stands and showcases overhead just high enough for persons to stand erect a ceiling  at frequent intervals little narrow passages go winding in among the houses which all along are closely conjoined and seem to have no access or exit except through the shops or into these narrow passages where you can touch each side with your elbows and the top with your hand  we penetrated into one or two of them and they smelt anciently and disagreeably  at one of the doors stood a palelooking but cheerful and goodnatured woman who told us that she had come to that house when first married twentyone years before and had lived there ever since and that she felt as if she had been buried through the best years of her life  she allowed us to peep into her kitchen and parlorsmall dingy dismal but yet not wholly destitute of a home look  she said that she had seen two or three coffins in a day during cholera times carried out of that narrow passage into which her door opened  these avenues put me in mind of those which run through anthills or those which a mole makes underground  this fashion of rows does not appear to be going out and for aught i can see it may last hundreds of years longer  when a house becomes so old as to be uutenantable it is rebuilt and the new one is fashioned like the old so far as regards the walk running through its front  many of the shops are very good and even elegant and these rows are the favorite places of business in chester  indeed they have many advantages the passengers being sheltered from the rain and there being within the shops that dimmer light by which tradesmen like to exhibit their wares  a large proportion of the edifices in the rows must be comparatively modern but there are some very ancient ones with oaken frames visible on the exterior  the row passing through these houses is railed with oak so old that it has turned black and grown to be as hard as stone which it might be mistaken for if one did not see where names and initials have been cut into it with knives at some bygone period overhead crossbeams project through the ceiling so low as almost to hit the head  on the front of one of these buildings was the inscription gods providence is mine inheritance said to have been put there by the occupant of the house two hundred years ago when the plague spared this one house only in the whole city  not improbably the inscription has operated as a safeguard to prevent the demolition of the house hitherto but a shopman of an adjacent dwelling told us that it was soon to be taken down  here and there about some of the streets through which the rows do not run we saw houses of very aged aspect with steep peaked gables  the front gableend was supported on stone pillars and the sidewalk passed beneath  most of these old houses seemed to be tavernsthe black bear the green dragon and such names  we thought of dining at one of them but on inspection they looked rather too dingy and close and of questionable neatness  so we went to the royal hotel where we probably fared just as badly at much more expense and where there was a particularly gruff and crabbed old waiter who i suppose thought himself free to display his surliness because we arrived at the hotel on foot  for my part i love to see john bull show himself  i must go again and again and again to chester for i suppose there is not a more curious place in the world  mr ticknor who has been staying at rock park with us since tuesday has steamed away in the canada this morning  his departure seems to make me feel more abroad more dissevered from my native country than before   october 3dsaturday evening at six i went to dine with mr aiken a wealthy merchant here to meet two of the sons of burns  there was a party of ten or twelve mr aiken and his two daughters included  the two sons of burns have both been in the indian army and have attained the ranks of colonel and major one having spent thirty and the other twentyseven years in india  they are now old gentlemen of sixty and upwards the elder with a gray head the younger with a perfectly white onerather under than above the middle stature and with a british roundness of figureplain respectable intelligentlooking persons with quiet manners  i saw no resemblance in either of them to any portrait of their father  after the ladies left the table i sat next to the major the younger of the two and had a good deal of talk with him he seemed a very kindly and social man and was quite ready to speak about his father nor was he at all reluctant to let it be seen how much he valued the glory of being descended from the poet  by and by at mr aikens instance he sang one of burnss songsthe one about annie and the rigs of barley  he sings in a perfectly simple style so that it is little more than a recitative and yet the effect is very good as to humor sense and pathos  after rejoining the ladies he sang another a posie for my ain dear may and likewise a mans a man for a that  my admiration of his father and partly perhaps my being an american gained me some favor with him and he promised to give me what he considered the best engraving of burns and some other remembrance of him  the major is that son of burns who spent an evening at abbotsford with sir walter scott when as lockhart writes the children sang the ballads of their sires  he spoke with vast indignation of a recent edition of his fathers works by robert chambers in which the latter appears to have wronged the poet by some misstatementsi liked them both and they liked me and asked me to go and see there at cheltenham where they reside  we broke up at about midnight  the members of this dinnerparty were of the more liberal tone of thinking here in liverpool  the colonel and major seemed to be of similar principles and the eyes of the latter glowed when he sang his fathers noble verse the rank is but the guineas stamp etc  it would have been too pitiable if burns had left a son who could not feel the spirit of that verse   october 8thconing to my office two or three mornings ago i found mrs  the mother of mr  the insane young man of whom i had taken charge she is a lady of fifty or thereabouts and not very remarkable anyway nor particularly ladylike  however she was just come off a rapid journey having travelled from naples with three small children without taking rest since my letter reached her  a son this proved to be her new husband of about twenty had come with her to the consulate  she was of course infinitely grieved about the young mans insanity and had two or three bursts of tears while we talked the matter over  she said he was the hope of her lifethe best purest most innocent child that ever was and wholly free from every kind of vice but it appears that he had a previous attack of insanity lasting three months about three years ago  after i had told her all i knew about him including my personal observations at a visit a week or two since we drove in a cab to the asylum  it must have been a dismal moment to the poor lady as we entered the gateway through a tall prisonlike wall  being ushered into the parlor the governor soon appeared and informed us that mr  had had a relapse within a few days and was not now so well as when i saw him  he complains of unjust confinement and seems to consider himself if i rightly understand under persecution for political reasons  the governor however proposed to call him down and i took my leave feeling that it would be indelicate to be present at his first interview with his mother  so here ended my guardianship of the poor young fellow  in the afternoon i called at the waterloo hotel where mrs  was staying and found her in the coffeeroom with the children  she had determined to take a lodging in the vicinity of the asylum and was going to remove thither as soon as the children had had something to eat  they seemed to be pleasant and wellbehaved children and impressed me more favorably than the mother whom i suspect to be rather a foolish woman although her present grief makes her appear in a more respectable light than at other times  she seemed anxious to impress me with the respectability and distinction of her connections in america and i had observed the same tendency in the insane patient at my interview with him  however she has undoubtedly a mothers love for this poor shatterbrain and this may weigh against the folly of her marrying an incongruously youthful second husband and many other follies  this was day before yesterday and i have heard nothing of her since the same day i had applications for assistance in two other domestic affairs one from an irishman naturalized in america who wished me to get him a passage thither and to take charge of his wife and family here at my own private expense until he could remit funds to carry them across  another was from an irishman who had a power of attorney from a countrywoman of his in america to find and take charge of an infant whom she had left in the liverpool workhouse two years ago  i have a great mind to keep a list of all the business i am consulted about and employed in  it would be very curious  among other things all penniless americans or pretenders to americanism look upon me as their banker and i could ruin myself any week if i had not laid down a rule to consider every applicant for assistance an impostor until he prove himself a true and responsible manwhich it is very difficult to do yesterday there limped in a very respectablelooking old man who described himself as a citizen of baltimore who had been on a trip to england and elsewhere and being detained longer than he expected and having had an attack of rheumatism was now short of funds to pay his passage home and hoped that i would supply the deficiency  he had quite a plain homely though respectable manner and for aught i know was the very honestest man alive but as he could produce no kind of proof of his character and responsibility i very quietly explained the impossibility of my helping him  i advised him to try to obtain a passage on board of some baltimore ship the master of which might be acquainted with him or at all events take his word for payment after arrival  this he seemed inclined to do and took his leave  there was a decided aspect of simplicity about this old man and yet i rather judge him to be an impostor  it is easy enough to refuse money to strangers and unknown people or whenever there may be any question about identity but it will not be so easy when i am asked for money by persons whom i know but do not like to trust  they shall meet the eternal no however   october 13thin ormerods history of chester it is mentioned that randal earl of chester having made an inroad into wales about 1225 the welshmen gathered in mass against him and drove him into the castle of nothelert in flintshire  the earl sent for succor to the constable of chester roger lacy surnamed hell on account of his fierceness  it was then fairtime at chester and the constable collected a miscellaneous rabble of fiddlers players cobblers tailors and all manner of debauched people and led them to the relief of the earl  at sight of this strange army the welshmen fled and forever after the earl assigned to the constable of chester power over all fiddlers shoemakers etc within the bounds of cheshire  the constable retained for himself and his heirs the control of the shoemakers and made over to his own steward dutton that of the fiddlers and players and for many hundreds of years afterwards the duttons of dutton retained the power  on midsummerday they used to ride through chester attended by all the minstrels playing on their several instruments to the church of st john and there renew their licenses  it is a good theme for a legend sir peter leycester writing in charles the seconds time copies the latin deed from the constable to dutton rightly translated it seems to mean the magisterial power over all the lewd people     in the whole of cheshire but the custom grew into what is above stated  in the time of henry vii the duttons claimed by prescriptive right that the cheshire minstrels should deliver them at the feast of st john four bottles of wine and a lance and that each separate minstrel should pay fourpence halfpenny      another account says ralph dutton was the constables soninlaw and a lusty youth   october 19thcoming to the ferry this morning a few minutes before the boat arrived from town i went into the ferryhouse a small stone edifice and found there an irishman his wife and three children the oldest eight or nine years old and all girls  there was a good fire burning in the room and the family was clustered round it apparently enjoying the warmth very much but when i went in both husband and wife very hospitably asked me to come to the fire although there was not more than room at it for their own party  i declined on the plea that i was warm enough and then the woman said that they were very cold having been long on the road  the man was grayhaired and graybearded clad in an old drab overcoat and laden with a huge bag which seemed to contain bedclothing or something of the kind  the woman was pale with a thin anxious wrinkled face but with a good and kind expression  the children were quite pretty with delicate faces and a look of patience and endurance in them but yet as if they had suffered as little as they possibly could  the two elder were cuddled up close to the father the youngest about four years old sat in its mothers lap and she had taken off its small shoes and stockings and was warming its feet at the fire  their little voices had a sweet and kindly sound as they talked in low tones to their parents and one another  they all looked very shabby and yet had a decency about them and it was touching to see how they made themselves at home at this casual fireside and got all the comfort they could out of the circumstances  by and by two or three marketwomen came in and looked pleasantly at them and said a word or two to the children  they did not beg of me as i supposed they would but after looking at them awhile i pulled out a piece of silver and handed it to one of the little girls  she took it very readily as if she partly expected it and then the father and mother thanked me and said they had been travelling a long distance and had nothing to subsist upon except what they picked up on the road  they found it impossible to live in england and were now on their way to liverpool hoping to get a passage back to ireland where i suppose extreme poverty is rather better off than here  i heard the little girl say that she should buy bread with the money  there is not much that can be caught in the description of this scene but it made me understand better than before how poor people feel wandering about in such destitute circumstances and how they suffer and yet how they have a life not quite miserable after all and how family love goes along with them  soon the boat arrived at the pier and we all went on board and as i sat in the cabin looking up through a broken pane in the skylight i saw the womans thin face with its anxious motherly aspect and the youngest child in her arms shrinking from the chill wind but yet not impatiently and the eldest of the girls standing close by with her expression of childish endurance but yet so bright and intelligent that it would evidently take but a few days to make a happy and playful child of her  i got into the interior of this poor family and understand through sympathy more of them than i can tell  i am getting to possess some of the english indifference as to beggars and poor people but still whenever i come face to face with them and have any intercourse it seems as if they ought to be the better for me  i wish instead of sixpence i had given the poor family ten shillings and denied it to a begging subscriptionist who has just fleeced me to that amount  how silly a man feels in this latter predicament  i have had a good many visitors at the consulate from the united states within a short timeamong others mr d d barnard our late minister to berlin returning homeward today by the arctic and mr sickles secretary of legation to london a finelooking intelligent gentlemanly young man     with him came judge douglas the chosen man of young america  he is very short extremely short but has an uncommonly good head and uncommon dignity without seeming to aim at it being free and simple in manners  i judge him to be a very able man with the western sociability and freefellowship  generally i see no reason to be ashamed of my countrymen who come out here in public position or otherwise assuming the rank of gentlemen   october 20thone sees incidents in the streets here occasionally which could not be seen in an american city  for instance a week or two since i was passing a quietlooking elderly gentleman when all of a sudden without any apparent provocation he uplifted his stick and struck a blackgowned boy a smart blow on the shoulders  the boy looked at him wofully and resentfully but said nothing nor can i imagine why the thing was done  in tythebarne street today i saw a woman suddenly assault a man clutch at his hair and cuff him about the ears  the man who was of decent aspect enough immediately took to his heels full speed and the woman ran after him and as far as i could discern the pair the chase continued   october 22dat a dinnerparty at mr hollands last evening a gentleman in instance of charles dickenss unweariability said that during some theatrical performances in liverpool he acted in play and farce spent the rest of the night making speeches feasting and drinking at table and ended at seven oclock in the morning by jumping leapfrog over the backs of the whole company  in moores diary he mentions a beautiful guernsey lily having been given to his wife and says that the flower was originally from guernsey  a ship from there had been wrecked on the coast of japan having many of the lilies on board and the next year the flowers appearedspringing up i suppose on the wavebeaten strand  wishing to send a letter to a dead man who may be supposed to have gone to tophetthrow it into the fire  sir arthur aston had his brains beaten out with his own wooden leg at the storming of tredagh in ireland by cromwell  in the county of cheshire many centuries ago there lived a halfidiot named nixon who had the gift of prophecy and made many predictions about places families and important public events since fulfilled  he seems to have fallen into fits of insensibility previous to uttering his prophecies  the family of mainwaring pronounced mannering of bromborough had an asss head for a crest  richard dawson being sick of the plague and perceiving he must die rose out of his bed and made his grave and caused his nephew to cast straw into the grave which was not far from the house and went and laid him down in the said grave and caused clothes to be laid upon him and so departed out of this world  this he did because he was a strong man and heavier than his said nephew and a servingwench were able to bury he died about the 24th of august  thus was i credibly told he did 1625  this was in the township of malpas recorded in the parish register  at bickley hall taken down a few years ago used to be shown the room where the body of the earl of leicester was laid for a whole twelvemonth1659 to 1660he having been kept unburied all that time owing to a dispute which of his heirs should pay his funeral expenses   november 5thwe all together with mr squarey went to chester last sunday and attended the cathedral service  a great deal of ceremony and not unimposing but rather tedious before it was finishedoccupying two hours or more  the bishop was present but did nothing except to pronounce the benediction  in america the sermon is the principal thing but here all this magnificent ceremonial of prayer and chanted responses and psalms and anthems was the setting to a short meagre discourse which would not have been considered of any account among the elaborate intellectual efforts of new england ministers  while this was going on the light came through the stained glass windows and fell upon the congregation tingeing them with crimson  after service we wandered about the aisles and looked at the tombs and monumentsthe oldest of which was that of some nameless abbot with a staff and mitre half obliterated from his tomb which was under a shallow arch on one side of the cathedral  there were also marbles on the walls and lettered stones in the pavement under our feet but chiefly if not entirely of modern date  we lunched at the royal hotel and then walked round the city walls also crossing the bridge of one great arch over the dee and penetrating as far into wales as the entrance of the marquis of westminsters park at eaton  it was i think the most lovely day as regards weather that i have seen in england  i passed today a man chanting a ballad in the street about a recent murder in a voice that had innumerable cracks in it and was most lugubrious  the other day i saw a man who was reading in a loud voice what seemed to be an account of the late riots and loss of life in wigan he walked slowly along the street as he read surrounded by a small crowd of men women and children and close by his elbow stalked a policeman as if guarding against a disturbance   november 14ththere is a heavy dun fog on the river and over the city today the very gloomiest atmosphere that ever i was acquainted with on the river the steamboats strike gongs or ring bells to give warning of their approach  there are lamps burning in the countingrooms and lobbies of the warehouses and they gleam distinctly through the windows  the other day at the entrance of the markethouse i saw a woman sitting in a small handwagon apparently for the purpose of receiving alms there was no attendant at hand but i noticed that one or two persons who passed by seemed to inquire whether she wished her wagon to be moved perhaps this is her mode of making progress about the city by the voluntary aid of boys and other people who help to drag her  there is something in thisi dont yet well know whatthat has impressed me as if i could make a romance out of the idea of a woman living in this manner a public life and moving about by such means   november 29thmr h a b told me of his friend mr  who was formerly attache to the british legation at washington and whom i saw at concord that his father a clergyman married a second wife  after the marriage the noise of a coffin being nightly carried down the stairs was heard in the parsonage  it could be distinguished when the coffin reached a certain broad lauding and rested on it  finally his father had to remove to another residence  besides this mr  had had another ghostly experiencehaving seen a dim apparition of an uncle at the precise instant when the latter died in a distant place  the attache is a credible and honorable fellow and talks of these matters as if he positively believed them  but ghostland lies beyond the jurisdiction of veracity  in a garden near chester in taking down a summerhouse a tomb was discovered beneath it with a latin inscription to the memory of an old doctor of medicine william bentley who had owned the place long ago and died in 1680  and his dust and bones had lain beneath all the merry times in the summerhouse   december 1stit is curious to observe how many methods people put in practice here to pick up a halfpenny  yesterday i saw a man standing bareheaded and barelegged in the mud and misty weather playing on a fife in hopes to get a circle of auditors  nobody however seemed to take any notice  very often a whole band of musicians will strike up passing a hat round after playing a tune or two  on board the ferry until the coldest weather began there were always some wretched musicians with an old fiddle an old clarinet and an old verdigrised brass bugle performing during the passage and as the boat neared the shore sending round one of their number to gather contributions in the hollow of the brass bugle  they were a very shabby set and must have made a very scanty living at best  sometimes it was a boy with an accordion and his sister a smart little girl with a timbrelwhich being so shattered that she could not play on it she used only to collect halfpence in  balladsingers or rather chanters or croakers are often to be met with in the streets but handorgan players are not more frequent than in our cities  i still observe little girls and other children barelegged and barefooted on the wet sidewalks  there certainly never was anything so dismal as the november weather has been never any real sunshine almost always a mist sometimes a dense fog like slightly rarefied wool pervading the atmosphere  an epitaph on a person buried on a hillside in cheshire together with some others supposed to have died of the plague and therefore not admitted into the churchyards      think it not strange our bones ly here      thine may ly thou knowst not where                                elizabeth hampson  these graves were near the remains of two rude stone crosses the purpose of which was not certainly known although they were supposed to be boundary marks  probably as the plaguecorpses were debarred from sanctified ground the vicinity of these crosses was chosen as having a sort of sanctity  bang beggaran old cheshire term for a parish beadle  hawthorne hall cheshire macclesfield hundred parish of wilmslow and within the hamlet of morley  it was vested at an early period in the lathoms of irlam lancaster county and passed through the leighs to the pages of earlshaw  thomas leigh page sold it to mr ralph bower of wilmslow whose children owned it in 1817  the leighs built a chancel in the church of wilmslow where some of them are buried their arms painted in the windows  the hall is an ancient respectable mansion of brick   december 2dyesterday a chill misty december day yet i saw a woman barefooted in the street not to speak of children  cold and uncertain as the weather is there is still a great deal of small trade carried on in the open air  women and men sit in the streets with a stock of combs and such small things to sell the women knitting as if they sat by a fireside  cheap crockery is laid out in the street so far out that without any great deviation from the regular carriagetrack a wheel might pass straight through it  stalls of apples are innumerable but the apples are not fit for a pig  in some streets herrings are very abundant laid out on boards  coals seem to be for sale by the wheelbarrowful  here and there you see children with some small article for saleas for instance a girl with two linen caps  a somewhat overladen cart of coal was passing along and some small quantity of the coal fell off no sooner had the wheels passed than several women and children gathered to the spot like hens and chickens round a handful of corn and picked it up in their aprons  we have nothing similar to these streetwomen in our country   december 10thi dont know any place that brings all classes into contiguity on equal ground so completely as the waitingroom at rock ferry on these frosty days  the room is not more than eight feet square with walls of stone and wooden benches ranged round them and an open stove in one corner generally well furnished with coal  it is almost always crowded and i rather suspect that many persons who have no fireside elsewhere creep in here and spend the most comfortable part of their day  this morning when i looked into the room there were one or two gentlemen and other respectable persons but in the best place close to the fire and crouching almost into it was an elderly beggar with the raggedest of overcoats two great rents in the shoulders of it disclosing the dingy lining all bepatched with various stuff covered with dirt and on his shoes and trousers the mud of an interminable pilgrimage  owing to the posture in which he sat i could not see his face but only the battered crown and rim of the very shabbiest hat that ever was worn regardless of the presence of women which indeed englishmen seldom do regard when they wish to smoke he was smoking a pipe of vile tobacco but after all this was fortunate because the man himself was not personally fragrant  he was terribly squalidterribly and when i had a glimpse of his face it well befitted the rest of his development grizzled wrinkled weatherbeaten yet sallow and downlooking with a watchful kind of eye turning upon everybody and everything meeting the glances of other people rather boldly yet soon shrinking away a long thin nose a gray beard of a weeks growth hair not much mixed with gray but rusty and lifelessa miserable object but it was curious to see how he was not ashamed of himself but seemed to feel that he was one of the estates of the kingdom and had as much right to live as other men  he did just as he pleased took the best place by the fire nor would have cared though a nobleman were forced to stand aside for him when the steamers bell rang he shouldered a large and heavy pack like a pilgrim with his burden of sin but certainly journeying to hell instead of heaven  on board he looked round for the best position at first stationing himself near the boilerpipe but finding the deck damp underfoot he went to the cabindoor and took his stand on the stairs protected from the wind but very incommodiously placed for those who wished to pass  all this was done without any bravado or forced impudence but in the most quiet way merely because he was seeking his own comfort and considered that he had a right to seek it  it was an englishmans spirit but in our country i imagine a beggar considers himself a kind of outlaw and would hardly assume the privileges of a man in any place of public resort  here beggary is a system and beggars are a numerous class and make themselves in a certain way respected as such  nobody evinced the slightest disapprobation of the mans proceedings  in america i think we should see many aristocratic airs on such provocation and probably the ferry people would there have rudely thrust the beggar aside giving him a shilling however which no englishman would ever think of doing  there would also have been a great deal of fun made of his squalid and ragged figure whereas nobody smiled at him this morning nor in any way showed the slightest disrespect this is good but it is the result of a state of things by no means good for many days there has been a great deal of fog on the river and the boats have groped their way along continually striking their bells while on all sides there are responses of bell and gong and the vessels at anchor look shadowlike as we glide past them and the master of one steamer shouts a warning to the master of another which he meets the englishmen who hate to run any risk without an equivalent object show a good deal of caution and timidity on these foggy days  december 13thchill frosty weather such an atmosphere as forebodes snow in new england and there has been a little here  yet i saw a barefooted young woman yesterday  the feet of these poor creatures have exactly the red complexion of their hands acquired by constant exposure to the cold air  at the ferryroom this morning was a small thin anxiouslooking woman with a bundle seeming in rather poor circumstances but decently dressed and eying other women i thought with an expression of slight illwill and distrust also an elderly stout grayhaired woman of respectable aspect and two young ladylike persons quite pretty one of whom was reading a shilling volume of jamess arabella stuart  they talked to one another with that upanddown intonation which english ladies practise and which strikes an unaccustomed ear as rather affected especially in women of size and mass  it is very different from an american ladys mode of talking there is the difference between color and no color the tone variegates it  one of these young ladies spoke to me making some remark about the weatherthe first instance i have met with of a gentlewomans speaking to an unintroduced gentleman besides these a middleaged man of the lower class and also a gentlemans outdoor servant clad in a drab greatcoat corduroy breeches and drab cloth gaiters buttoned from the knee to the ankle  he complained to the other man of the cold weather said that a glass of whiskey every halfhour would keep a man comfortable and accidentally hitting his coarse foot against one of the young ladys feet said beg pardon maamwhich she acknowledged with a slight movement of the head  somehow or other different classes seem to encounter one another in an easier manner than with us the shock is less palpable  i suppose the reason is that the distinctions are real and therefore need not be continually asserted  nervous and excitable persons need to talk a great deal by way of letting off their steam  on board the rock ferry steamer a gentleman coming into the cabin a voice addresses him from a dark corner how do you do sirspeak again says the gentleman  no answer from the dark corner and the gentleman repeats speak again  the speaker now comes out of the dark corner and sits down in a place where he can be seen  ah cries the gentleman very well i thank you  how do you do  i did not recognize your voice  observable the english caution shown in the gentlemans not vouchsafing to say very well thank you till he knew his man  what was the after life of the young man whom jesus looking on loved and bade him sell all that he had and give to the poor and take up his cross and follow him  something very deep and beautiful might be made out of this   december 31stamong the beggars of liverpool the hardest to encounter is a man without any legs and if i mistake not likewise deficient in arms  you see him before you all at once as if he had sprouted halfway out of the earth and would sink down and reappear in some other place the moment he has done with you  his countenance is large fresh and very intelligent but his great power lies in his fixed gaze which is inconceivably difficult to bear  he never once removes his eye from you till you are quite past his range and you feel it all the same although you do not meet his glance  he is perfectly respectful but the intentness and directness of his silent appeal is far worse than any impudence  in fact it is the very flower of impudence  i would rather go a mile about than pass before his battery  i feel wronged by him and yet unutterably ashamed  there must be great force in the man to produce such an effect  there is nothing of the customary squalidness of beggary about him but remarkable trimness and cleanliness  a girl of twenty or thereabouts who vagabondizes about the city on her hands and knees possesses to a considerable degree the same characteristics  i think they hit their victims the more effectually from being below the common level of vision   january 3d 1854night before last there was a fall of snow about three or four inches and following it a pretty hard frost  on the river the vessels at anchor showed the snow along their yards and on every ledge where it could lie  a blue sky and sunshine overhead and apparently a clear atmosphere close at hand but in the distance a mistiness became perceptible obscuring the shores of the river and making the vessels look dim and uncertain  the steamers were ploughing along smoking their pipes through the frosty air  on the landing stage and in the streets hardtrodden snow looking more like my new england home than anything i have yet seen  last night the thermometer fell as low as 13 degrees nor probably is it above 20 degrees today  no such frost has been known in england these forty years and mr wilding tells me that he never saw so much snow before   january 6thi saw yesterday stopping at a cabinetmakers shop in church street a coach with four beautiful white horses and a postilion on each nearhorse behind in the dicky a footman and on the box a coachman all dressed in livery  the coachpanel bore a coatofarms with a coronet and i presume it must have been the equipage of the earl of derby  a crowd of people stood round gazing at the coach and horses and when any of them spoke it was in a lower tone than usual  i doubt not they all had a kind of enjoyment of the spectacle for these english are strangely proud of having a class above them  every englishman runs to the times with his little grievance as a child runs to his mother  i was sent for to the police court the other morning in the case of an american sailor accused of robbing a shipmate at sea  a large room with a great coalfire burning on one side and above it the portrait of mr rushton deceased a magistrate of many years continuance  a long table with chairs and a witnessbox  one of the borough magistrates a merchant of the city sat at the head of the table with paper and pen and ink before him but the real judge was the clerk of the court whose professional knowledge and experience governed all the proceedings  in the short time while i was waiting two cases were tried in the first of which the prisoner was discharged  the second case was of a womana thin sallow hardlooking careworn rather young womanfor stealing a pair of slippers out of a shop the trial occupied five minutes or less and she was sentenced to twentyone days imprisonmentwhereupon without speaking she looked up wildly first into one policemans face then into anothers at the same time wringing her hands with no theatric gesture but because her torment took this outward shapeand was led away  the yankee sailor was then brought upan intelligent but ruffianlike fellowand as the case was out of the jurisdiction of the english magistrates and as it was not worth while to get him sent over to america for trial he was forthwith discharged  he stole a comforter  if mankind were all intellect they would be continually changing so that one age would be entirely unlike another  the great conservative is the heart which remains the same in all ages so that commonplaces of a thousand years standing are as effective as ever   monday february 20that the police court on saturday i attended the case of the second mate and four seamen of the john and albert for assaulting beating and stabbing the chief mate  the chief mate has been in the hospital ever since the assault and was brought into the court today to give evidencea man of thirty black hair black eyes a dark complexion disagreeable expression sallow emaciated feeble apparently in pain one arm disabled  he sat bent and drawn upward and had evidently been severely hurt and was not yet fit to be out of bed he had some brandyandwater to enable him to sustain himself  he gave his evidence very clearly beginning sailorlike with telling in what quarter the wind was at the time of the assault and which sail was taken in  his testimony bore on one man only at whom he cast a vindictive look but i think he told the truth as far as he knew and remembered it of the prisoners the second mate was a mere youth with long sandy hair and an intelligent and not unprepossessing face dressed as neatly as a three or four weeks captive with small or no means could well allow in a frockcoat and with clean linenthe only linen or cotton shirt in the company  the other four were rude brutish sailors in flannel or redbaize shirts  three of them appeared to give themselves little concern but the fourth a redhaired and redbearded manparaman by nameevidently felt the pressure of the case upon himself  he was the one whom the mate swore to have given him the first blow and there was other evidence of his having been stabbed with a knife  the captain of the ship the pilot the cook and the steward all gave their evidence and the general bearing of it was that the chief mate had a devilish temper and had misused the second mate and crewthat the four seamen had attacked him and that paraman had stabbed him while all but the steward concurred in saying that the second mate had taken no part in the affray  the steward however swore to having seen him strike the chief mate with a wooden marlinspike which was broken by the blow  the magistrate dismissed all but paraman whom i am to send to america for trial  in my opinion the chief mate got pretty nearly what he deserved under the code of natural justice  while business was going forward the magistrate mr mansfield talked about a fancy ball at which he had been present the evening before and of other matters grave and gay  it was very informal we sat at the table or stood with our backs to the fire policemen came and went witnesses were sworn on the greasiest copy of the gospels i ever saw polluted by hundreds and thousands of perjured kisses and for hours the prisoners were kept standing at the foot of the table interested to the full extent of their capacity while all others were indifferent  at the close of the case the police officers and witnesses applied to me about their expenses  yesterday i took a walk with my wife and two children to bebbington church  a beautifully sunny morning  my wife and u attended church j and i continued our walk  when we were at a little distance from the church the bells suddenly chimed out with a most cheerful sound and sunny as the morning  it is a pity we have no chimes of bells to give the churchward summons at home  people were standing about the ancient churchporch and among the tombstones  in the course of our walk we passed many old thatched cottages built of stone and with what looked like a cowhouse or pigsty at one end making part of the cottage also an old stone farmhouse which may have been a residence of gentility in its day  we passed too a small methodist chapel making one of a row of low brick edifices  there was a sound of prayer within  i never saw a more unbeautiful place of worship and it had not even a separate existence for itself the adjoining tenement being an alehouse  the grass along the wayside was green with a few daisies  there was green holly in the hedges and we passed through a wood up some of the treetrunks of which ran clustering ivy   february 23dthere came to see me the other day a young gentleman with a mustache and a blue cloak who announced himself as william allingham and handed me a copy of his poems a thin volume with paper covers published by routledge  i thought i remembered hearing his name but had never seen any of his works  his face was intelligent dark pleasing and not at all johnbullish  he said that he had been employed in the customs in ireland and was now going to london to live by literature to be connected with some newspaper i imagine  he had been in london before and was acquainted with some of the principal literary people among others tennyson and carlyle  he seemed to have been on rather intimate terms with tennyson  we talked awhile in my dingy and dusky consulate and he then took leave  his manners are good and he appears to possess independence of mind  yesterday i saw a british regiment march down to georges pier to embark in the niagara for malta  the troops had nothing very remarkable about them but the thousands of ragged and squalid wretches who thronged the pier and streets to gaze on them were what i had not seen before in such masses  this was the first populace i have beheld for even the irish on the other side of the water acquire a respectability of aspect  john bull is going with his whole heart into the turkish war  he is very foolish  whatever the czar may propose to himself it is for the interest of democracy that he should not be easily put down  the regiment on its way to embark carried the queens colors and side by side with them the banner of the 28thyellow with the names of the peninsular and other battles in which it had been engaged inscribed on it in a double column  it is a very distinguished regiment and mr henry bright mentioned as one of its distinctions that washington had formerly been an officer in it  i never heard of this   february 27thwe walked to woodside in the pleasant forenoon and thence crossed to liverpool  on our way to woodside we saw the remains of the old birkenhead priory built of the common red freestone much timeworn with ivy creeping over it and birds evidently at hone in its old crevices  these ruins are pretty extensive and seem to be the remains of a quadrangle  a handsome modern church likewise of the same red freestone has been built on part of the site occupied by the priory and the organ was sounding within while we walked about the premises on some of the ancient arches there were grotesquely carved stone faces the old walls have been sufficiently restored to make them secure without destroying their venerable aspect  it is a very interesting spot and so much the more so because a modern town with its brick and stone houses its flags and pavements has sprung up about the ruins which were new a thousand years ago  the station of the chester railway is within a hundred yards  formerly the monks of this priory kept the only ferry that then existed on the mersey  at a dinner at mr bramley moores a little while ago we had a prairiehen from the west of america  it was a very delicate bird and a gentleman carved it most skilfully to a dozen guests and had still a second slice to offer to them  aboard the ferryboat yesterday there was a laboring man eating oysters he took them one by one from his pocket in interminable succession opened them with his jackknife swallowed each one threw the shell overboard and then sought for another  having concluded his meal he took out a clay tobaccopipe filled it lighted it with a match and smoked itall this while the other passengers were looking at him and with a perfect coolness and independence such as no single man can ever feel in america  here a man does not seem to consider what other people will think of his conduct but only whether it suits his own convenience to do so and so  it may be the better way  a french military man a veteran of all napoleons wars is now living with a false leg and arm both movable by springs false teeth a false eye a silver nose with a fleshcolored covering and a silver plate replacing part of the skull  he has the cross of the legion of honor   march 18thon saturday i went with mr b to the dingle a pleasant domain on the banks of the mersey almost opposite to rock ferry  walking home we looked into mr thorns unitarian chapel mr bs familys place of worship  there is a little graveyard connected with the chapel a most uninviting and unpicturesque square of ground perhaps thirty or forty yards across in the midst of back fronts of city buildings  about half the space was occupied by flat tombstones level with the ground the remainder being yet vacant  nevertheless there were perhaps more names of men generally known to the world on these few tombstones than in any other churchyard in liverpoolroscoe blanco white and the rev william enfield whose name has a classical sound in my ears because when a little boy i used to read his speaker at school  in the vestry of the chapel there were many books chiefly old theological works in ancient print and binding much mildewed and injured by the damp  the body of the chapel is neat but plain and being not very large has a kind of social and family aspect as if the clergyman and his people must needs have intimate relations among themselves  the unitarian sect in liverpool have as a body great wealth and respectability  yesterday i walked with my wife and children to the brow of a hill overlooking birkenhead and tranmere and commanding a fine view of the river and liverpool beyond  all round about new and neat residences for city people are springing up with fine nameseldon terrace rose cottage belvoir villa etc etc with little patches of ornamented garden or lawn in front and heaps of curious rockwork with which the english are ridiculously fond of adorning their front yards  i rather think the middling classesmeaning shopkeepers and other respectabilities of that levelare better lodged here than in america and what i did not expect the houses are a great deal newer than in our new country  of course this can only be the case in places circumstanced like liverpool and its suburbs  but scattered among these modern villas there are old stone cottages of the rudest structure and doubtless hundreds of years old with thatched roofs into which the grass has rooted itself and now looks verdant  these cottages are in themselves as ugly as possible resembling a large kind of pigsty but often by dint of the verdure on their thatch and the shrubbery clustering about them they look picturesque  the oldfashioned flowers in the gardens of new englandbluebells crocuses primroses foxglove and many othersappear to be wild flowers here on english soil  there is something very touching and pretty in this fact that the puritans should have carried their field and hedge flowers and nurtured theme in their gardens until to us they seem entirely the product of cultivation   march 16thyesterday at the coroners court attending the inquest on a black sailor who died on board an american vessel after her arrival at this port  the courtroom is capable of accommodating perhaps fifty people dingy with a pyramidal skylight above and a single window on one side opening into a gloomy back court  a private room also lighted with a pyramidal skylight is behind the courtroom into which i was asked and found the coroner a grayheaded grave intelligent broad redfaced man with an air of some authority well mannered and dignified but not exactly a gentlemandressed in a blue coat with a black cravat showing a shirtcollar above it  considering how many and what a variety of cases of the ugliest death are constantly coming before him he was much more cheerful than could be expected and had a kind of formality and orderliness which i suppose balances the exceptionalities with which he has to deal  in the private room with him was likewise the surgeon who professionally attends the court  we chatted about suicide and such mattersthe surgeon the coroner and iuntil the american case was ready when we adjourned to the courtroom and the coroner began the examination  the american captain was a rude uncouth downeaster about thirty years old and sat on a bench doubled and bent into an indescribable attitude out of which he occasionally straightened himself all the time toying with a ruler or some such article  the case was one of no interest the man had been frostbitten and died from natural causes so that no censure was deserved or passed upon the captain  the jury who had been examining the body were at first inclined to think that the man had not been frostbitten but that his feet had been immersed in boiling water but on explanation by the surgeon readily yielded their opinion and gave the verdict which the coroner put into their mouths exculpating the captain from all blame in fact it is utterly impossible that a jury of chance individuals should not be entirely governed by the judgment of so experienced and weighty a man as the coroner  in the courtroom were two or three police officers in uniform and some other officials a very few idle spectators and a few witnesses waiting to be examined  and while the case was going forward a poorlooking woman came in and i heard her in an undertone telling an attendant of a death that had just occurred the attendant received the communication in a very quiet and matterofcourse way said that it should be attended to and the woman retired  the diary of a coroner would be a work likely to meet with large popular acceptance  a dark passageway only a few yards in extent leads from the liveliest street in liverpool to this coroners courtroom where all the discussion is about murder and suicide  it seems that after a verdict of suicide the corpse can only be buried at midnight without religious rites  his lines are cast in pleasant placesapplied to a successful angler  a womans chastity consists like an onion of a series of coats  you may strip off the outer ones without doing much mischief perhaps none at all but you keep taking off one after another in expectation of coming to the inner nucleus including the whole value of the matter  it proves however that there is no such nucleus and that chastity is diffused through the whole series of coats is lessened with the removal of each and vanishes with the final one which you supposed would introduce you to the hidden pearl   march 23dmr b and i took a cab saturday afternoon and drove out of the city in the direction of knowsley  on our way we saw many gentlemens or rich peoples places some of them dignified with the title of hallswith lodges at their gates and standing considerably removed from the road  the greater part of them were built of bricka material with which i have not been accustomed to associate ideas of grandeur but it was much in use here in lancashire in the elizabethan agemore i think than now  these suburban residences however are of much later date than elizabeths time  among other places mr b called at the hazels the residence of sir thomas birch a kinsman of his  it is a large brick mansion and has old trees and shrubbery about it the latter very fine and verdanthazels holly rhododendron etc mr b went in and shortly afterwards sir thomas birch came outa very frank and hospitable gentlemanand pressed me to enter and take luncheon which latter hospitality i declined  his house is in very nice order  he had a good many pictures and amongst them a small portrait of his mother painted by sir thomas lawrence when a youth  it is unfinished and when the painter was at the height of his fame he was asked to finish it  but lawrence after looking at the picture refused to retouch it saying that there was a merit in this early sketch which he could no longer attain  it was really a very beautiful picture of a lovely woman  sir thomas birch proposed to go with us and get us admittance into knowsley park where we could not possibly find entrance without his aid so we went to the stables where the old groom had already shown hospitality to our cabman by giving his horse some provender and himself some beer  there seemed to be a kindly and familiar sort of intercourse between the old servant and the baronet each of them i presume looking on their connection as indissoluble  the gatewarden of knowsley park was an old woman who readily gave us admittance at sir thomas birchs request  the family of the earl of derby is not now at the park  it was a very bad time of year to see it the trees just showing the earliest symptoms of vitality while whole acres of ground were covered with large dry brown fernswhich i suppose are very beautiful when green  two or three hares scampered out of these ferns and sat on their hind legs looking about them as we drove by  a sheet of water had been drawn off in order to deepen its bed  the oaks did not seem to me so magnificent as they should be in an ancient noble property like this  a century does not accomplish so much for a tree in this slow region as it does in ours  i think however that they were more individual and picturesque with more character in their contorted trunks therein somewhat resembling appletrees  our foresttrees have a great sameness of character like our people because one and the other grow too closely  in one part of the park we came to a small tower for what purpose i know not unless as an observatory and near it was a marble statue on a high pedestal  the statue had been long exposed to the weather and was overgrown and ingrained with moss and lichens so that its classic beauty was in some sort gothicized  a halfmile or so from this point we saw the mansion of kuowsley in the midst of a very fine prospect with a tolerably high ridge of hills in the distance  the house itself is exceedingly vast a front and two wings with suites of rooms i suppose interminable  the oldest part sir thomas birch told us is a tower of the time of henry vii  nevertheless the effect is not overwhelming because the edifice looks low in proportion to its great extent over the ground and besides a good deal of it is built of brick with white windowframes so that looking at separate parts i might think them american structures without the smart addition of green venetian blinds so universal with us  portions however were built of red freestone and if i had looked at it longer no doubt i should have admired it more we merely drove round it from the rear to the front  it stands in my memory rather like a college or a hospital than as the ancestral residence of a great english noble  we left the park in another direction and passed through a part of lord seftons property by a private road  by the by we saw half a dozen policemen in their blue coats and embroidered collars after entering knowsley park but the earls own servants would probably have supplied their place had the family been at home  the mansion of croxteth the seat of lord sefton stands near the public road and though large looked of rather narrow compass after knowsley  the rooks were talking together very loquaciously in the high tops of the trees near sir thomas birchs house it being now their buildingtime it was a very pleasant sound the noise being comfortably softened by the remote height  sir thomas said that more than half a century ago the rooks used to inhabit another grove of lofty trees close in front of the house but being noisy and not altogether cleanly in their habits the ladies of the family grew weary of them and wished to remove them accordingly the colony was driven away and made their present settlement in a grove behind the house  ever since that time not a rook has built in the ancient grove every year however one or another pair of young rooks attempt to build among the deserted treetops but the old rooks tear the new nest to pieces as often as it is put together  thus either the memory of aged individual rooks or an authenticated tradition in their society has preserved the idea that the old grove is forbidden and inauspicious to them  a soil of general arnold named william fitch arnold and born in 1794 now possesses the estate of little messenden abbey bucks county and is a magistrate for that county  he was formerly captain of the 19th lancers  he has now two sons and four daughters  the other three sons of general arnold all older than this one and all military men do not appear to have left children but a daughter married to colonel phipps of the mulgrave family has a son and two daughters  i question whether any of our truehearted revolutionary heroes have left a more prosperous progeny than this archtraitor  i should like to know their feelings with respect to their ancestor   april 3di walked with j two days ago to eastham a village on the road to chester and five or six miles from rock ferry  on our way we passed through a village in the centre of which was a small stone pillar standing on a pedestal of several steps on which children were sitting and playing  i take it to have been an old catholic cross at least i know not what else it is  it seemed very ancient  eastham is the finest old english village i have seen with many antique houses and with altogether a rural and picturesque aspect unlike anything in america and yet possessing a familiar look as if it were something i had dreamed about  there were thatched stone cottages intermixed with houses of a better kind and likewise a gateway and gravelled walk that perhaps gave admittance to the squires mansion  it was not merely one long wide street as in most new england villages but there were several crooked ways gathering the whole settlement into a pretty small compass  in the midst of it stood a venerable church of the common red freestone with a most reverend air considerably smaller than that of bebbington but more beautiful and looking quite as old  there was ivy on its spire and elsewhere  it looked very quiet and peaceful and as if it had received the people into its low arched door every sabbath for many centuries  there were many tombstones about it some level with the ground some raised on blocks of stone on low pillars mossgrown and weatherworn and probably these were but the successors of other stones that had quite crumbled away or been buried by the accumulation of dead mens dust above them  in the centre of the churchyard stood an old yewtree with immense trunk which was all decayed within so that it is a wonder how the tree retains any lifewhich nevertheless it does it was called the old yew of eastham six hundred years ago  after passing through the churchyard we saw the village inn on the other side  the doors were fastened but a girl peeped out of the window at us and let us in ushering us into a very neat parlor  there was a cheerful fire in the grate a straw carpet on the floor a mahogany sideboard and a mahogany table in the middle of the room and on the walls the portraits of mine host no doubt and of his wife and daughtersa very nice parlor and looking like what i might have found in a country tavern at home only this was an ancient house and there is nothing at home like the glimpse from the window of the church and its red ivygrown tower  i ordered some lunch being waited on by the girl who was very neat intelligent and comelyand more respectful than a new england maid  as we came out of the inn some village urchins left their play and ran to me begging calling me master  they turned at once from play to begging and as i gave them nothing they turned to their play again  this village is too far from liverpool to have been much injured as yet by the novelty of cockney residences which have grown up almost everywhere else so far as i have visited  about a mile from it however is the landingplace of a steamer which runs regularly except in the winter months where a large new hotel is built  the grounds about it are extensive and well wooded  we got some biscuits at the hotel and i gave the waiter a splendid gentleman in black four halfpence being the surplus of a shilling  he bowed and thanked me very humbly  an american does not easily bring his mind to the small measure of english liberality to servants if anything is to be given we are ashamed not to give more especially to clericallooking persons in black suits and white neckcloths  i stood on the exchange at noon today to see the 18th regiment the connaught rangers marching down to embark for the east  they were a body of young healthy and cheerfullooking men and looked greatly better than the dirty crowd that thronged to gaze at them  the royal banner of england quartering the lion the leopard and the harp waved on the townhouse and looked gorgeous and venerable  here and there a woman exchanged greetings with an individual soldier as he marched along and gentlemen shook hands with officers with whom they happened to be acquainted  being a stranger in the land it seemed as if i could see the future in the present better than if i had been an englishman so i questioned with myself how many of these ruddycheeked young fellows marching so stoutly away would ever tread english ground again  the populace did not evince any enthusiasm yet there could not possibly be a war to which the country could assent more fully than to this  i somewhat doubt whether the english populace really feels a vital interest in the nation  some years ago a piece of rude marble sculpture representing st george and the dragon was found over the fireplace of a cottage near rock ferry on the road to chester  it was plastered over with pipeclay and its existence was unknown to the cottagers until a lady noticed the projection and asked what it was  it was supposed to have originally adorned the walls of the priory at birkenhead  it measured fourteen and a half by nine inches in which space were the heads of a king and queen with uplifted hands in prayer their daughters also in prayer and looking very grim a lamb the slain dragon and st george proudly prancing on what looks like a donkey brandishing a sword over his head  the following is a legend inscribed on the inner margin of a curious old box      from birkenhead into hilbree      a squirrel might leap from tree to tree  i do not know where hilbree is but all round birkenhead a squirrel would scarcely find a single tree to climb upon  all is pavement and brick buildings now   good fridaythe english and irish think it good to plant on this day because it was the day when our saviours body was laid in the grave seeds therefore are certain to rise again  at dinner the other day mrs  mentioned the origin of franklins adoption of the customary civil dress when going to court as a diplomatist  it was simply that his tailor had disappointed him of his court suit and he wore his plain one with great reluctance because he had no other  afterwards gaining great success and praise by his mishap he continued to wear it from policy  the grandmother of mrs  died fifty years ago at the age of twentyeight  she had great personal charms and among them a head of beautiful chestnut hair  after her burial in the family tomb the coffin of one of her children was laid on her own so that the lid seems to have decayed or been broken from this cause at any rate this was the case when the tomb was opened about a year ago  the grandmothers coffin was then found to be filled with beautiful glossy living chestnut ringlets into which her whole substance seems to have been transformed for there was nothing else but these shining curls the growth of half a century in the tomb  an old man with a ringlet of his youthful mistress treasured on his heart might be supposed to witness this wonderful thing  madam  who is now at my house and very infirm though not old was once carried to the grave and on the point of being buried  it was in barbary where her husband was consulgeneral  he was greatly attached to her and told the pallbearers at the grave that he must see her once more  when her face was uncovered he thought he discerned signs of life and felt a warmth  finally she revived and for many years afterwards supposed the funeral procession to have been a dream she having been partially conscious throughout and having felt the wind blowing on her and lifting the shroud from her feetfor i presume she was to be buried in oriental style without a coffin  long after in london when she was speaking of this dream her husband told her the facts and she fainted away  whenever it is now mentioned her face turns white  mr  her son was born on shipboard on the coast of spain and claims four nationalitiesthose of spain england ireland and the united states his father being irish his mother a native of england himself a naturalized citizen of the united states and his father having registered his birth and baptism in a catholic church of gibraltar which gives him spanish privileges  he has hereditary claims to a spanish countship  his infancy was spent in barbary and his lips first lisped in arabic  there has been an unsettled and wandering character in his whole life  the grandfather of madam  who was a british officer once horsewhipped paul jonesjones being a poltroon  how singular it is that the personal courage of famous warriors should be so often called in question   may 20thi went yesterday to a hospital to take the oath of a mate to a protest  he had met with a severe accident by a fall on shipboard  the hospital is a large edifice of red freestone with wide airy passages resounding with footsteps passing through them  a porter was waiting in the vestibule  mr wilding and myself were shown to the parlor in the first instancea neat plainly furnished room with newspapers and pamphlets lying on the table and sofas  soon the surgeon of the house camea brisk alacritous civil cheerful young man by whom we were shown to the apartment where the mate was lying  as we went through the principal passage a man was borne along in a chair looking very pale rather wild and altogether as if he had just been through great tribulation and hardly knew as yet whereabouts he was  i noticed that his left arm was but a stump and seemed done up in red baizeat all events it was of a scarlet line  the surgeon shook his right hand cheerily and he was carried on  this was a patient who had just had his arm cut off  he had been a rough person apparently but now there was a kind of tenderness about him through pain and helplessness  in the chamber where the mate lay there were seven beds all of them occupied by persons who had met with accidents  in the centre of the room was a stationary pine table about the length of a man intended i suppose to stretch patients upon for necessary operations  the furniture of the beds was plain and homely  i thought that the faces of the patients all looked remarkably intelligent though they were evidently men of the lower classes  suffering had educated them morally and intellectually  they gazed curiously at mr wilding and me but nobody said a word  in the bed next to the mate lay a little boy with a broken thigh  the surgeon observed that children generally did well with accidents and this boy certainly looked very bright and cheerful  there was nothing particularly interesting about the mate  after finishing our business the surgeon showed us into another room of the surgical ward likewise devoted to cases of accident and injury  all the beds were occupied and in two of them lay two american sailors who had recently been stabbed  they had been severely hurt but were doing very well  the surgeon thought that it was a good arrangement to have several cases together and that the patients kept up one anothers spiritsbeing often merry together  smiles and laughter may operate favorably enough from bed to bed but dying groans i should think must be somewhat of a discouragement  nevertheless the previous habits and modes of life of such people as compose the more numerous class of patients in a hospital must be considered before deciding this matter it is very possible that their misery likes such bedfellows as it here finds  as we were taking our leave the surgeon asked us if we should not like to see the operatingroom and before we could reply he threw open the door and behold there was a roll of linen garments rolled in blood and a bloody fragment of a human arm  the surgeon glanced at me and smiled kindly but as if pitying my discomposure  gervase elwes son of sir gervase elwes baronet of stoke suffolk married isabella daughter of sir thomas hervey knight and sister of the first earl of bristol  this gervase died before his father but left a son henry who succeeded to the baronetcy  sir henry died without issue and was succeeded by his sisters son john maggott twining who assumed the name of elwes  he was the famous miser and must have had hawthorne blood in him through his grandfather gervase whose mother was a hawthorne  it was to this gervase that my ancestor william hawthorne devised some land in massachusetts if he would come over and enjoy it  my ancestor calls him his nephew   june 12thbarry cornwall mr procter called on me a week or more ago but i happened not to be in the office  saturday last he called again and as i had crossed to rock park he followed me thither  a plain middlesized englishlooking gentleman elderly with short white hair and particularly quiet in his manners  he talks in a somewhat low tone without emphasis scarcely distinct  his head has a good outline and would look well in marble  i liked him very well  he talked unaffectedly showing an authors regard to his reputation and was evidently pleased to hear of his american celebrity  he said that in his younger days he was a scientific pugilist and once took a journey to have a sparring encounter with the gamechicken  certainly no one would have looked for a pugilist in this subdued old gentleman  he is now commissioner of lunacy and makes periodical circuits through the country attending to the business of his office  he is slightly deaf and this may be the cause of his unaccented utteranceowing to his not being able to regulate his voice exactly by his own ear  he is a good man and much better expressed by his real name procter than by his poetical one barry cornwall     he took my hand in both of his at parting       june 17that eleven at this season and how much longer i know not there is still a twilight  if we could only have such dry deliciously warm evenings as we used to have in our own land what enjoyment there might be in these interminable twilights  but here we close the windowshutters and make ourselves cosey by a coalfire  all three of the children and i think my wife and myself are going through the hoopingcough  the eastwind of this season and region is most horrible  there have been no really warm days for though the sunshine is sometimes hot there is never any diffused heat throughout the air  on passing from the sunshine into the shade we immediately feel too cool   june 20ththe vagabond musicians about town are very numerous  on board the steam ferryboats i have heretofore spoken of them  they infest them from may to november for very little gain apparently  a shilling a day per man must be the utmost of their emolument  it is rather sad to see somewhat respectable old men engaged in this way with two or three younger associates  their instruments look much the worse for wear and even my unmusical ear can distinguish more discord than harmony  they appear to be a very quiet and harmless people  sometimes there is a woman playing on a fiddle while her husband blows a wind instrument  in the streets it is not unusual to find a band of half a dozen performers who without any provocation or reason whatever sound their brazen instruments till the houses reecho  sometimes one passes a man who stands whistling a tune most unweariably though i never saw anybody give him anything  the balladsingers are the strangest from the total lack of any music in their cracked voices  sometimes you see a space cleared in the street and a foreigner playing while a girl weatherbeaten tanned and wholly uncomely in face and shabby in attire dances ballets  the common people look on and never criticise or treat any of these poor devils unkindly or uncivilly but i do not observe that they give them anything  a crowdor at all events a moderatesized groupis much more easily drawn together here than with us  the people have a good deal of idle and momentary curiosity and are always ready to stop when another person has stopped so as to see what has attracted his attention  i hardly ever pause to look at a shopwindow without being immediately incommoded by boys and men who stop likewise and would forthwith throng the pavement if i did not move on   june 30thif it is not known how and when a man dies it makes a ghost of him for many years thereafter perhaps for centuries  king arthur is an example also the emperor frederic and other famous men who were thought to be alive ages after their disappearance  so with private individuals  i had an uncle john who went a voyage to sea about the beginning of the war of 1812 and has never returned to this hour  but as long as his mother lived as many as twenty years she never gave up the hope of his return and was constantly hearing stories of persons whose description answered to his  some people actually affirmed that they had seen him in various parts of the world  thus so far as her belief was concerned he still walked the earth  and even to this day i never see his name which is no very uncommon one without thinking that this may be the lost uncle  thus too the french dauphin still exists or a kind of ghost of him the three tells too in the cavern of uri   july 6thmr cecil the other day was saying that england could produce as fine peaches as any other country  i asked what was the particular excellence of a peach and he answered its cooling and refreshing quality like that of a melon  just think of this idea of the richest most luscious of all fruits  but the untravelled englishman has no more idea of what fruit is than of what sunshine is he thinks he has tasted the first and felt the last but they are both alike watery  i heard a lady in lord street talking about the broiling sun when i was almost in a shiver  they keep up their animal heat by means of wine and ale else they could not bear this climate   july 19tha week ago i made a little tour in north wales with mr bright  we left birkenhead by railway for chester at two oclock thence for bangor thence by carriage over the menai bridge to beaumaris  at beaumaris a fine old castlequite coming up to my idea of what an old castle should be  a gray ivyhung exterior wall with large round towers at intervals within this another wall the place of the portcullis between and again within the second wall the castle itself with a spacious green courtyard in front  the outer wall is so thick that a passage runs in it all round the castle which covers a space of three acres  this passage gives access to a chapel still very perfect and to various apartments in the towersall exceedingly dismal and giving very unpleasant impressions of the way in which the garrison of the castle lived  the main castle is entirely roofless but the hall and other rooms are pointed out by the guide and the whole is tapestried with abundant ivy so that my impression is of gray walls with here and there a vast green curtain a carpet of green over the floors of halls and apartments and festoons around all the outer battlement with an uneven and rather perilous footpath running along the top  there is a fine vista through the castle itself and the two gateways of the two encompassing walls  the passage within the wall is very rude both underfoot and on each side with various ascents and descents of rough stepssometimes so low that your head is in danger and dark except where a little light comes through a loophole or window in the thickness of the wall  in front of the castle a tenniscourt was fitted up by laying a smooth pavement on the ground and casing the walls with tin or zinc if i recollect aright  all this was open to the sky and when we were there some young men of the town were playing at the game  there are but very few of these tenniscourts in england and this old castle was a very strange place for one  the castle is the property of sir richard bulkely whose seat is in the vicinity and who owns a great part of the island of anglesea on which beaumaris lies  the hotel where we stopped was the bulkely arms and sir richard has a kind of feudal influence in the town  in the morning we walked along a delightful road bordering on the menai straits to bangor ferry  it was really a very pleasant road overhung by a growth of young wood exceedingly green and fresh  english trees are green all about their stems owing to the creeping plants that overrun them  there were some flowers in the hedges such as we cultivate in gardens  at the ferry there was a whitewashed cottage a woman or two some children and a fishermanlike personage walking to and fro before the door  the scenery of the strait is very beautiful and picturesque and directly opposite to us lay bangorthe strait being here almost a mile across  an american ship from boston lay in the middle of it  the ferryboat was just putting off for the bangor side and by the aid of a sail soon neared the shore  at bangor we went to a handsome hotel and hired a carriage and two horses for some welsh place the name of which i forget neither can i remember a single name of the places through which we posted that day nor could i spell them if i heard them pronounced nor pronounce them if i saw them spelt  it was a circuit of about forty miles bringing us to conway at last  i remember a great slatequarry and also that many of the cottages in the first part of our drive were built of blocks of slate  the mountains were very bold thrusting themselves up abruptly in peaksnot of the dumpling formation which is somewhat too prevalent among the new england mountains  at one point we saw snowdon with its bifold summit  we also visited the smaller waterfall this is a translation of an unpronounceable welsh name which is the largest in wales  it was a very beautiful rapid and the guidebook considers it equal in sublimity to niagara  likewise there were one or two lakes which the guidebook greatly admired but which to me who remembered a hundred sheets of blue water in new england seemed nothing more than sullen and dreary puddles with bare banks and wholly destitute of beauty  i think they were nowhere more than a hundred yards across  but the hills were certainly very good and though generally bare of trees their outlines thereby were rendered the stronger and more striking  many of the welsh women particularly the older ones wear black beaver hats highcrowned and almost precisely like mens  it makes them look ugly and witchlike  welsh is still the prevalent language and the only one spoken by a great many of the inhabitants  i have had welsh people in my office on official business with whom i could not communicate except through an interpreter  at some unutterable village we went into a little church where we saw an old stone image of a warrior lying on his back with his hands clasped it was the natural son if i remember rightly of david prince of wales and was doubtless the better part of a thousand years old  there was likewise a stone coffin of still greater age some person of rank and renown had mouldered to dust within it but it was now open and empty also there were monumental brasses on the walls engraved with portraits of a gentleman and lady in the costumes of elizabeths time  also on one of the pews a brass record of some persons who slept in the vault beneath so that every sunday the survivors and descendants kneel and worship directly over their dead ancestors  in the churchyard on a flat tombstone there was the representation of a harp  i supposed that it must be the restingplace of a bard but the inscription was in memory of a merchant and a skilful manufacturer of harps  this was a very delightful town  we saw a great many things which it is now too late to describe the sharpness of the first impression being gone but i think i can produce something of the sentiment of it hereafter  we arrived at conway late in the afternoon to take the rail for chester i must see conway with its old gray wall and its unrivalled castle again  it was better than beaumaris and i never saw anything more picturesque than the prospect from the castlewall towards the sea  we reached chester at 10 p m  the next morning mr bright left for liverpool before i was awake  i visited the cathedral where the organ was sounding sauntered through the rows bought some playthings for the children and left for home soon after twelve   liverpool august 8thvisiting the zoological gardens the other day with j it occurred to me what a fantastic kind of life a person connected with them might be depicted as leadinga child for instance the grounds are very extensive and include arrangements for all kinds of exhibitions calculated to attract the idle people of a great city  in one enclosure is a bear who climbs a pole to get cake and gingerbread from the spectators  elsewhere a circular building with compartments for lions wolves and tigers  in another part of the garden is a colony of monkeys the skeleton of an elephant birds of all kinds  swans and various rare waterfowl were swimming on a piece of water which was green by the by and when the fowls dived they stirred up black mud  a stork was parading along the margin with melancholy strides of its long legs and came slowly towards its as if for companionship  in one apartment was an obstreperously noisy society of parrots and macaws most gorgeous and diversified of hue  these different colonies of birds and beasts were scattered about in various parts of the grounds so that you came upon them unexpectedly  also there were archery and shootinggrounds and a sewing  a theatre also at which a rehearsal was going onwe standing at one of the doors and looking in towards the dusky stage where the company in their ordinary dresses were rehearsing something that had a good deal of dance and action in it  in the open air there was an arrangement of painted scenery representing a wide expanse of mountains with a city at their feet and before it the sea with actual water and large vessels upon it the vessels having only the side that would be presented to the spectator  but the scenery was so good that at a first casual glance i almost mistook it for reality there was a refreshmentroom with drinks and cakes and pastry but so far as i saw no substantial victual  about in the centre of the garden there was an actual homelylooking small dwellinghouse where perhaps the overlookers of the place live  now this might be wrought in an imaginative description into a pleasant sort of a fools paradise where all sorts of unreal delights should cluster round some suitable personage and it would relieve in a very odd and effective way the stern realities of life on the outside of the gardenwalls  i saw a little girl simply dressed who seemed to have her habitat within the grounds  there was also a daguerreotypist with his wife and family carrying on his business in a shanty and perhaps having his home in its inner room  he seemed to be an honest intelligent pleasant young man and his wife a pleasant woman and i had js daguerreotype taken for three shillings in a little gilded frame  in the description of the garden the velvet turf of a charming verdure and the shrubbery and shadowy walks and large trees and the slopes and inequalities of ground must not he forgotten  in one place there was a maze and labyrinth where a person might wander a long while in the vain endeavor to get out although all the time looking at the exterior garden over the low hedges that border the walks of the maze  and this is like the inappreciable difficulties that often beset us in life  i will see it again before long and get some additional record of it   august 10thwe went to the isle of man a few weeks ago where s and the children spent a fortnight  i spent two sundays with them  i never saw anything prettier than the little church of kirk madden there  it stands in a perfect seclusion of shadowy treesa plain little church that would not be at all remarkable in another situation but is most picturesque in its solitude and bowery environment  the churchyard is quite full and overflowing with graves and extends down the gentle slope of a hill with a dark mass of shadow above it  some of the tombstones are flat on the ground some erect or laid horizontally on low pillars or masonry  there were no very old dates on any of these stones for the climate soon effaces inscriptions and makes a stone of fifty years look as old as one of five hundredunless it be slate or something harder than the usual red freestone  there was an old runic monument however near the centre of the churchyard that had some strange sculpture on it and an inscription still legible by persons learned in such matters  against the tower of the church too there is a circular stone with carving on it said to be of immemorial antiquity there is likewise a tall marble monument as much as fifty feet high erected some years ago to the memory of one of the athol family by his brotherofficers of a local regiment of which he was colonel  at one of the sideentrances of the church and forming the threshold within the thickness of the wall so that the feet of all who enter must tread on it is a flat tombstone of somebody who felt himself a sinner no doubt and desired to be thus trampled upon  the stone is much worn  the structure is extremely plain inside and very small  on the walls over the pews are several monumental sculpturesa quite elaborate one to a colonel murray of the coldstreamn guards his military profession being designated by banners and swords in marbleanother was to a farmer  on one side of the churchtower there was a little penthouse or leantomerely a stone roof about three or four feet high and supported by a single pillar beneath which was once deposited the bier  i have let too much time pass before attempting to record my impressions of the isle of man but as regards this church no description can come up to its quiet beauty its seclusion and its every requisite for an english country church  last sunday i went to eastham and entering the churchyard sat down on a tombstone under the yewtree which has been known for centuries as the great tree of eastham  some of the village people were sitting on the graves near the door and an old woman came towards me and said in a low kindly admonishing tone that i must not let the sexton see me because he would not allow any one to be there in sacramenttime  i inquired why she and her companions were there and she said they were waiting for the sacrament  so i thanked her gave her a sixpence and departed  close under the eaves i saw two upright stones in memory of two old servants of the stanley familyone over ninety and the other over eighty years of age  august 12thj and i went to birkenhead park yesterday  there is a large ornamental gateway to the park and the grounds within are neatly laid out with borders of shrubbery  there is a sheet of water with swans and other aquatic fowl which swim about and are fed with dainties by the visitors  nothing can be more beautiful than a swan  it is the ideal of a goosea goose beautified and beatified  there were not a great many visitors but some children were dancing on the green and a few loverlike people straying about  i think the english behave better than the americans at similar places  there was a cameraobscure very wretchedly indistinct  at the refreshmentroom were gingerbeer and british wines   august 21sti was in the crown court on saturday sitting in the sheriffs seat  the judge was baron  an old gentleman of sixty with very large long features  his wig helped him to look like some strange kind of animalvery queer but yet with a sagacious and on the whole beneficent aspect  during the session some mischievous young barrister occupied himself with sketching the judge in pencil and being handed about it found its way to me  it was very like and very laughable but hardly caricatured  the judicial wig is an exceedingly odd affair and as it covers both ears it would seem intended to prevent his lordship and justice in his person from hearing any of the case on either side that thereby he may decide the better  it is like the old idea of blindfolding the statue of justice  it seems to me there is less formality less distance between the judge jury witnesses and bar in the english courts than in our own  the judge takes a very active part in the trial constantly asking a question of the witness on the stand making remarks on the conduct of the trial putting in his word on all occasions and allowing his own sense of the matter in hand to be pretty plainly seen so that before the trial is over and long before his own charge is delivered he must have exercised a very powerful influence over the minds of the jury  all this is done not without dignity yet in a familiar kind of way  it is a sort of paternal supervision of the whole matter quite unlike the cold awfulness of an american judge  but all this may be owing partly to the personal characteristics of baron   it appeared to me however that from the closer relations of all parties truth was likely to be arrived at and justice to be done  as an innocent man i should not be afraid to be tried by baron     eaton hall   august 24thi went to eaton hall yesterday with my wife and mr g p bradford via chester  on our way at the latter place we visited st johns church  it is built of the same red freestone as the cathedral and looked exceedingly antique and venerable this kind of stone from its softness and its liability to be acted upon by the weather being liable to an early decay  nevertheless i believe the church was built above a thousand years agosome parts of it at leastand the surface of the tower and walls is worn away and hollowed in shallow sweeps by the hand of time  there were broken niches in several places where statues had formerly stood  all except two or three had fallen or crumbled away and those which remained were much damaged  the face and details of the figure were almost obliterated  there were many gravestones round the church but none of them of any antiquity  probably as the names become indistinguishable on the older stones the graves are dug over again and filled with new occupants and covered with new stones or perhaps with the old ones newly inscribed  closely connected with the church was the clergymans house a comfortablelooking residence and likewise in the churchyard with tombstones all about it even almost at the threshold so that the doorstep itself might have been a tombstone was another house of respectable size and aspect  we surmised that this might be the sextons dwelling but it proved not to be so and a woman answering our knock directed us to the place where he might be found  so mr bradford and i went in search of him leaving s seated on a tombstone  the sexton was a jollylooking ruddyfaced man a mechanic of some sort apparently and he followed us to the churchyard with much alacrity  we found s standing at a gateway which opened into the most ancient and now quite ruinous part of the church the present edifice covering much less ground than it did some centuries ago  we went through this gateway and found ourselves in an enclosure of venerable walls open to the sky with old norman arches standing about beneath the loftiest of which the sexton told us the high altar used to stand  of course there were weeds and ivy growing in the crevices but not so abundantly as i have seen them elsewhere  the sexton pointed out a piece of a statue that had once stood in one of the niches and which he himself i think had dug up from several feet below the earth also in a niche of the walls high above our heads he showed us an ancient wooden coffin hewn out of a solid log of oak the hollow being made rudely in the shape of a human figure  this too had been dug up and nobody knew how old it was while we looked at all this solemn old trumpery the curate quite a young man stood at the back door of his house elevated considerably above the ruins with his young wife i presume and a friend or two chatting cheerfully among themselves  it was pleasant to see them there after examining the ruins we went inside of the church and found it a dim and dusky old place quite paved over with tombstones not an inch of space being left in the aisles or near the altar or in any nook or corner uncovered by a tombstone  there were also mural monuments and escutcheons and close against the wall lay the mutilated statue of a crusader with his legs crossed in the style which one has so often read about  the old fellow seemed to have been represented in chain armor but he had been more battered and bruised since death than even during his pugnacious life and his nose was almost knocked away  this figure had been dug up many years ago and nobody knows whom it was meant to commemorate  the nave of the church is supported by two rows of saxon pillars not very lofty but six feet six inches so the sexton says in diameter they are covered with plaster which was laid on ages ago and is now so hard and smooth that i took the pillars to be really composed of solid shafts of gray stone  but at one end of the church the plaster had been removed from two of the pillars in order to discover whether they were still sound enough to support the building and they prove to be made of blocks of red freestone just as sound as when it came from the quarry for though this stone soon crumbles in the open air it is as good as indestructible when sheltered from the weather  it looked very strange to see the fresh hue of these two pillars amidst the dingy antiquity of the rest of the structure  the body of the church is covered with pews the wooden enclosures of which seemed of antique fashion  there were also modern stoves but the sexton said it was very cold there in spite of the stoves  it had i must say a disagreeable odor pervading it in which the dead people of long ago had doubtless some sharea musty odor by no means amounting to a stench but unpleasant and i should think unwholesome  old woodwork and old stones and antiquity of all kinds moral and physical go to make up this smell  i observed it in the cathedral and chester generally has it especially under the rows  after all the necessary damp and lack of sunshine in such a shadowy old church as this have probably more to do with it than the dead people have although i did think the odor was particularly strong over some of the tombstones  not having shillings to give the sexton we were forced to give him half a crown  the church of st john is outside of the city walls  entering the east gate we walked awhile under the rows bought our tickets for eaton hall and its gardens and likewise some playthings for the children for this old city of chester seems to me to possess an unusual number of toyshops  finally we took a cab and drove to the hall about four miles distant nearly the whole of the way lying through the wooded park there are many sorts of trees making up a wilderness which looked not unlike the woods of our own concord only less wild  the english oak is not a handsome tree being short and sturdy with a round thick mass of foliage lying all within its own bounds  it was a showery day  had there been any sunshine there might doubtless have been many beautiful effects of light and shadow in these woods  we saw one or two herds of deer quietly feeding a hundred yards or so distant  they appeared to be somewhat wilder than cattle but i think not much wilder than sheep their ancestors have probably been in a halfdomesticated state receiving food at the hands of man in winter for centuries  there is a kind of poetry in this quite as much as if they were really wild deer such as their forefathers were when hugh lupus used to hunt them  our miserable cab drew up at the steps of eaton hall and ascending under the portico the door swung silently open and we were received very civilly by two old menone a tall footman in livery the other of higher grade in plain clothes  the entrancehall is very spacious and the floor is tessellated or somehow inlaid with marble  there was statuary in marble on the floor and in niches stood several figures in antique armor of various dates some with lances and others with battleaxes and swords  there was a twohanded sword as much as six feet long but not nearly so ponderous as i have supposed this kind of weapon to be from reading of it  i could easily have brandished it  i dont think i am a good sightseer at least i soon get satisfied with looking at the sights and wish to go on to the next  the plainly dressed old man now led us into a long corridor which goes i think the whole length of the house about five hundred feet arched all the way and lengthened interminably by a lookingglass at the end in which i saw our own party approaching like a party of strangers  but i have so often seen this effect produced in drygoods stores and elsewhere that i was not much impressed  there were family portraits and other pictures and likewise pieces of statuary along this arched corridor and it communicated with a chapel with a scriptural altarpiece copied from rubens and a picture of st michael and the dragon and two or perhaps three richly painted windows  everything here is entirely new and fresh this part having been repaired and never yet inhabited by the family  this brandnewness makes it much less effective than if it had been lived in and i felt pretty much as if i were strolling through any other renewed house  after all the utmost force of man can do positively very little towards making grand things or beautiful things  the imagination can do so much more merely on shutting ones eyes that the actual effect seems meagre so that a new house unassociated with the past is exceedingly unsatisfactory especially when you have heard that the wealth mud skill of man has here done its best  besides the rooms as we saw them did not look by any means their best the carpets not being down and the furniture being covered with protective envelopes  however rooms cannot be seen to advantage by daylight it being altogether essential to the effect that they should be illuminated by artificial light which takes them somewhat out of the region of bare reality  nevertheless there was undoubtedly great splendor for the details of which i refer to the guidebook among the family portraits there was one of a lady famous for her beautiful hand and she was holding it up to notice in the funniest way and very beautiful it certainly was  the private apartments of the family were not shown us  i should think it impossible for the owner of this house to imbue it with his personality to such a degree as to feel it to be his home  it must be like a small lobster in a shell much too large for him  after seeing what was to be seen of the rooms we visited the gardens in which are noble conservatories and hothouses containing all manner of rare and beautiful flowers and tropical fruits  i noticed some large pines looking as if they were really made of gold  the gardener undergardener i suppose he was who showed this part of the spectacle was very intelligent as well as kindly and seemed to take an interest in his business  he gave s a purple everlasting flower which will endure a great many years as a memento of our visit to eaton hall finally we took a view of the front of the edifice which is very fine and much more satisfactory than the interiorand returned to chester  we strolled about under the unsavory rows sometimes scudding from side to side of the street through the shower took lunch in a confectioners shop and drove to the railway station in time for the threeoclock train  it looked picturesque to see two little girls hand in hand racing along the ancient passages of the rows but chester has a very evil smell  at the railroad station s saw a small edition of twicetold tales forming a volume of the cottage library and opening it there was the queerest imaginable portrait of myselfso very queer that we could not but buy it  the shilling edition of the scarlet letter and seven gables are at all the bookstalls and shopwindows but so is the lamplighter and still more trashy books   august 26thall past affairs all home conclusions all people whom i have known in america and meet again here are strangely compelled to undergo a new trial  it is not that they suffer by comparison with circumstances of english life and forms of english manhood or womanhood but being free from my old surroundings and the inevitable prejudices of home i decide upon them absolutely  i think i neglected to record that i saw miss martineau a few weeks since  she is a large robust elderly woman and plainly dressed but withal she has so kind cheerful and intelligent a face that she is pleasanter to look at than most beauties  her hair is of a decided gray and she does not shrink from calling herself old  she is the most continual talker i ever heard it is really like the babbling of a brook and very lively and sensible too and all the while she talks she moves the bowl of her eartrumpet from one auditor to another so that it becomes quite an organ of intelligence and sympathy between her and yourself  the eartrumpet seems a sensible part of her like the antennae of some insects  if you have any little remark to make you drop it in and she helps you to make remarks by this delicate little appeal of the trumpet as she slightly directs it towards you and if you have nothing to say the appeal is not strong enough to embarrass you all her talk was about herself and her affairs but it did not seem like egotism because it was so cheerful and free from morbidness  and this woman is an atheist and thinks that the principle of life will become extinct when her body is laid in the grave  i will not think so were it only for her sake  what only a few weeds to spring out of her mortality instead of her intellect and sympathies flowering and fruiting forever   september 13thmy family went to rhyl last thursday and on saturday i joined them there in company with osullivan who arrived in the behama from lisbon that morning  we went by way of chester and found s waiting for us at the rhyl station  rhyl is a most uninteresting place a collection of new lodginghouses and hotels on a long sandbeach which the tide leaves bare almost to the horizon  the sand is by no means a marble pavement but sinks under the foot and makes very heavy walking but there is a promenade in front of the principal range of houses looking on the sea whereon we have rather better footing almost all the houses were full and s had taken a parlor and two bedrooms and is living after the english fashion providing her own table lights fuel and everything  it is very awkward to our american notions but there is an independence about it which i think must make it agreeable on better acquaintance  but the place is certainly destitute of attraction and life seems to pass very heavily  the english do not appear to have a turn for amusing themselves  sunday was a bright and hot day and in the forenoon i set out on a walk not well knowing whither over a very dusty road with not a particle of shade along its dead level  the welsh mountains were before me at the distance of three or four mileslong ridgy hills descending pretty abruptly upon the plain on either side of the road here and there an old whitewashed thatched stone cottage or a stone farmhouse with an aspect of some antiquity  i never suffered so much before on this side of the water from heat and dust and should probably have turned back had i not espied the round towers and walls of an old castle at some distance before me  having looked at a guidebook previously to setting out i knew that this must be rhyddlan castle about three miles from rhyl so i plodded on and by and by entered an antiquated village on one side of which the castle stood  this welsh village is very much like the english villages with narrow streets and mean houses or cottages built in blocks and here and there a larger house standing alone everything far more compact than in our rural villages and with no grassy streetmargin nor trees aged and dirty also with dirty children staring at the passenger and an undue supply of mean inns most or many of the men in breeches and some of the women especially the elder ones in black beaver hats  the streets were paved with round pebbles and looked squalid and ugly  the children and grown people stared lazily at me as i passed but showed no such alert and vivacious curiosity as a community of yankees would have done  i turned up a street that led me to the castle which looked very picturesque close at handmore so than at a distance because the towers and walls have not a sufficiently broken outline against the sky there are several round towers at the angles of the wall very large in their circles built of gray stone crumbling ivygrown everything that one thinks of in an old ruin  i could not get into the inner space of the castle without climbing over a fence or clambering down into the moat so i contented myself with walking round it and viewing it from the outside  through the gateway i saw a cow feeding on the green grass in the inner court of the castle  in one of the walls there was a large triangular gap where perhaps the assailants had made a breach  of course there were weeds on the ruinous top of the towers and along the summit of the wall  this was the first castle built by edward i in wales and he resided here during the erection of conway castle and here queen eleanor gave birth to a princess  some few years since a meeting of welsh bards was held within it  after viewing it awhile and listening to the babble of some children who lay on the grass near by i resumed my walk and meeting a welshman in the village street i asked him my nearest way back to rhyl  dim sassenach said he after a pause  how odd that an hour or two on the railway should have brought me amongst a people who speak no english just below the castle there is an arched stone bridge over the river clwyd and the best view of the edifice is from hence  it stands on a gentle eminence commanding the passage of the river and two twin round towers rise close beside one another whence i suppose archers have often drawn their bows against the wild welshmen on the riverbanks behind was the line of mountains and this was the point of defence between the hill country and the lowlands  on the bridge stood a good many idle welshmen leaning over the parapet and looking at some small vessels that had come up the river from the sea  there was the frame of a new vessel on the stocks near by  as i returned on my way home i again inquired my way of a man in breeches who i found could speak english very well  he was kind and took pains to direct me giving me the choice of three ways viz the one by which i came another across the fields and a third by the embankment along the riverside  i chose the latter and so followed the course of the clwyd which is very ugly with a tidal flow and wide marshy banks on its farther side was rhyddlan marsh where a battle was fought between the welsh and saxons a thousand years ago  i have forgotten to mention that the castle and its vicinity was the scene of the famous battle of the fiddlers between de blandeville earl of chester and the welsh about the time of the conqueror    conway castle   september 13thon monday we went with osullivan to conway by rail certainly this must be the most perfect specimen of a ruinous old castle in the whole world it quite fills up ones idea  we first walked round the exterior of the wall at the base of which are hovels with dirty children playing about them and pigs rambling along and squalid women visible in the doorways but all these things melt into the picturesqueness of the scene and do not harm it  the whole town of conway is built in what was once the castleyard and the whole circuit of the wall is still standing in a delightful state of decay  at the angles and at regular intervals there are round towers having half their circle on the outside of the walls and half within  most of these towers have a great crack pervading them irregularly from top to bottom the ivy hangs upon themthe weeds grow on the tops  gateways three or four of them open through the walls and streets proceed from them into the town  at some points very old cottages or small houses are close against the sides and old as they are they must have been built after the whole structure was a ruin  in one place i saw the sign of an alehouse painted on the gray stones of one of the old round towers  as we entered one of the gates after making the entire circuit we saw an omnibus coming down the street towards us with its horn sounding llandudno was its place of destination and knowing no more about it than that it was four miles off we took our seats  llandudno is a wateringvillage at the base of the great ormes head at the mouth of the conway river  in this omnibus there were two pleasantlooking girls who talked welsh togethera guttural childish kind of a babble afterwards we got into conversation with them and found them very agreeable  one of them was reading tuppers proverbial philosophy  on reaching llandudno s waited at the hotel while osullivan u and i ascended the great ormes head  there are coppermines here and we heard of a large cave with stalactites but did not go so far as that  we found the old shaft of a mine however and threw stones down it and counted twenty before we heard them strike the bottom  at the base of the head on the side opposite the village we saw a small church with a broken roof and horizontal gravestones of slate within the stone enclosure around it  the view from the hill was most beautifula blue summer sea with the distant trail of smoke from a steamer and many snowy sails in another direction the mountains near and distant some of them with clouds below their peaks  we went to one of the mines which are still worked and boys came running to meet us with specimens of the copper ore for sale  the miners were not now hoisting ore from the shaft but were washing and selecting the valuable fragments from great heaps of crumbled stone and earth  all about this spot there are shafts and wellholes looking fearfully deep and black and without the slightest protection so that we might just as easily have walked into them as not  having examined these matters sufficiently we descended the hill towards the village meeting parties of visitors mounted on donkeys which is a much more sensible way of ascending in a hot day than to walk  on the sides and summit of the hill we found yellow gorseheath of two colors i think and very beautifuland here and there a harebell  owing to the longcontinued dry weather the grass was getting withered and brown though not so much so as on american hillpastures at this season  returning to the village we all went into a confectioners shop and made a good luncheon  the two prettiest young ladies whom i have seen in england came into the shop and ate cakes while we were there  they appeared to be living together in a lodginghouse and ordered some of their housekeeping articles from the confectioner  next we went into the village bazaara sort of tent or open shop full of knickknacks and gewgaws and bought some playthings for the children at half past one we took our seats in the omnibus to return to conway  we had as yet only seen the castle wall and the exterior of the castle now we were to see the inside  right at the foot of it an old woman has her stand for the sale of lithographic views of conway and other places but these views are ridiculously inadequate so that we did not buy any of them  the admittance into the castle is by a wooden door of modern construction and the present seneschal is i believe the sexton of a church  he remembered me as having been there a month or two ago and probably considering that i was already initiated or else because he had many other visitors he left us to wander about the castle at will it is altogether impossible to describe conway castle  nothing ever can have been so perfect in its own style and for its own purposes when it was first built and now nothing else can be so perfect as a picture of ivygrown peaceful ruin  the banquetinghall all open to the sky and with thick curtains of ivy tapestrying the walls and grass and weeds growing on the arches that overpass it is indescribably beautiful  the hearthstones of the great old fireplaces all about the castle seem to be favorite spots for weeds to grow  there are eight large round towers and out of four of them i think rise smaller towers ascending to a much greater height and once containing winding staircases all of which are now broken and inaccessible from below though in at least one of the towers the stairs seemed perfect high aloft  it must have been the rudest violence that broke down these stairs for each step was a thick and heavy slab of stone built into the wall of the tower  there is no such thing as a roof in any part towers hall kitchen all are open to the sky  one round tower directly overhanging the railway is so shattered by the falling away of the lower part that you can look quite up into it and through it while sitting in the cars and yet it has stood thus without falling into complete ruin for more than two hundred years  i think that it was in this tower that we found the castle oven an immense cavern big enough to bake bread for an army  the railway passes exactly at the base of the high rock on which this part of the castle is situated and goes into the town through a great arch that has been opened in the castle wall  the tubular bridge across the conway has been built in a style that accords with the old architecture and i observed that one little sprig of ivy had rooted itself in the new structure  there are numberless intricate passages in the thickness of the castle walls forming communications between tower and towerdamp chill passages with rough stone on either hand darksome and very likely leading to dark pitfalls  the thickness of the walls is amazing and the people of those days must have been content with very scanty light so small were the aperturessometimes merely slits and loopholes glimmering through many feet of thickness of stone  one of the towers was said to have been the residence of queen eleanor and this was better lighted than the others containing an orielwindow looking out of a little oratory as it seemed to be with groined arches and traces of ornamental sculpture so that we could dress up some imperfect image of a queenly chamber though the tower was roofless and floorless  there was another pleasant little windowed nook close beside the oratory where the queen might have sat sewing or looking down the river conway at the picturesque headlands towards the sea  we imagined her stately figure in antique robes standing beneath the groined arches of the oratory  there seem to have been three chambers one above another in these towers and the one in which was the embowed window was the middle one  i suppose the diameter of each of these circular rooms could not have been more than twenty feet on the inside  all traces of woodwork and ironwork are quite gone from the whole castle  these are said to have been taken away by a lord conway in the reign of charles ii  there is a grassy space under the windows of queen eleanors towera sort of outwork of the castle where probably when no enemy was near the queen used to take the open air in summer afternoons like this  here we sat down on the grass of the ruined wall and agreed that nothing in the world could be so beautiful and picturesque as conway castle and that never could there have been so fit a time to see it as this sunny quiet lovely afternoon  sunshine adapts itself to the character of a ruin in a wonderful way it does not flout the ruins gray as scott says but sympathizes with their decay and saddens itself for their sake  it beautifies the ivy too  we saw at the corner of this grassplot around queen eleanors tower a real trunk of a tree of ivy with so stalwart a stem and such a vigorous grasp of its strong branches that it would be a very efficient support to the wall were it otherwise inclined to fall  o that we could have ivy in america  what is there to beautify us when our time of ruin comes  before departing we made the entire circuit of the castle on its walls and osullivan and i climbed by a ladder to the top of one of the towers while there we looked down into the street beneath and saw a photographist preparing to take a view of the castle and calling out to some little girl in some niche or on some pinnacle of the walls to stand still that he might catch her figure and face  i think it added to the impressiveness of the old castle to see the streets and the kitchengardens and the homely dwellings that had grown up within the precincts of this feudal fortress and the people of today following their little businesses about it  this does not destroy the charm but tourists and idle visitors do impair it  the earnest life of today however petty and homely as it may be has a right to its place alongside of what is left of the life of other days and if it be vulgar itself it does not vulgarize the scene  but tourists do vulgarize it and i suppose we did so just like others  we took the train back to rhyl where we arrived at about four oclock and having dined we again took the rail for chester and thence to rock park that is osullivan and i and reached home at about eleven oclock  yesterday september 13th i began to wear a watch from bennets 65 cheapside london  w c bennet warrants it as the best watch which they can produce  if it prove as good and as durable as he prophesies j will find it a perfect timekeeper long after his father has done with time  if i had not thought of his wearing it hereafter i should have been content with a much inferior one  no 39620   september 20thi went back to rhyl last friday in the steamer  we arrived at the landingplace at nearly four oclock having started at twelve and i walked thence to our lodgings 18 west parade  the children and their mother were all gone out and i sat some time in our parlor before anybody came  the next morning i made an excursion in the omnibus as far as ruthin passing through rhyddlan st asaph denbigh and reaching ruthin at one oclock  all these are very ancient places st asaph has a cathedral which is not quite worthy of that name but is a very large and stately church in excellent repair  its square battlemented tower has a very fine appearance crowning the clump of village houses on the hilltop as you approach from rhyddlan  the ascent of the hill is very steep so it is at denbigh and at ruthinthe steepest streets indeed that i ever climbed  denbigh is a place of still more antique aspect than st asaph it looks i think even older than chester with its gabled houses many of their windows opening on hinges and their fronts resting on pillars with an open porch beneath the castle makes an admirably ruinous figure on the hill higher than the village  i had come hither with the purpose of inspecting it but as it began to rain just then i concluded to get into the omnibus and go to ruthin  there was another steep ascent from the commencement of the long street of ruthin till i reached the marketplace which is of nearly triangular shape and an exceedingly oldlooking place  houses of stone or plastered brick one or two with timber frames the roofs of an uneven line and bulging out or sinking in the slates mossgrown  some of them have two peaks and even three in a row fronting on the streets and there is a stone markethouse with a table of regulations  in this marketplace there is said to be a stone on which king arthur beheaded one of his enemies but this i did not see  all these villages were very lively as the omnibus drove in and i rather imagine it was marketday in each of themthere being quite a bustle of welsh people  the old women came round the omnibus courtesying and intimating their willingness to receive almswitchlike women such as one sees in pictures or reads of in romances and very unlike anything feminine in america  their style of dress cannot have changed for centuries  it was quite unexpected to me to hear welsh so universally and familiarly spoken everybody spoke it  the omnibusdriver could speak but imperfect english there was a jabber of welsh all through the streets and marketplaces and it flowed out with a freedom quite different from the way in which they expressed themselves in english  i had had an idea that welsh was spoken rather as a freak and in fun than as a native language it was so strange to find another language the peoples actual and earnest medium of thought within so short a distance of england  but english is scarcely more known to the body of the welsh people than to the peasantry of france  however they sometimes pretend to ignorance when they might speak it fairly enough  i took luncheon at the hotel where the omnibus stopped and then went to search out the castle  it appears to have been once extensive but the remains of it are now very few except a part of the external wall whatever other portion may still exist has been built into a modern castellated mansion which has risen within the wide circuit of the fortressa handsome and spacious edifice of red freestone with a high tower on which a flag was flying  the grounds were well laid out in walks and really i think the site of the castle could not have been turned to better account  i am getting tired of antiquity  it is certainly less interesting in the long run than novelty and so i was well content with the fresh warm red hue of the modern house and the unworn outline of its walls and its cheerful large windows and was willing that the old ivygrown ruins should exist now only to contrast with the modernisms  these ancient walls by the by are of immense thickness  there is a passage through the interior of a portion of them the width from this interior passage to the outer one being fifteen feet on one side and i know not how much on the other  it continued showery all day and the omnibus was crowded  i had chosen the outside from rhyl to denbigh but all the rest of the journey imprisoned myself within  on our way home an old lady got into the omnibusa lady of tremendous rotundity and as she tumbled from the door to the farthest part of the carriage she kept advising all the rest of the passengers to get out  i dont think there will be much rain gentlemen quoth she youll be much more comfortable on the outside as none of us complied she glanced along the seats  what are you all saasuach she inquired  as we drove along she talked welsh with great fluency to one of the passengers a young woman with a baby and to as many others as could understand her  it has a strange wild sound like a language half blown away by the wind  the ladys english was very good but she probably prided herself on her proficiency in welsh  my excursion today had been along the valley of the clwyd a very rich and fertile tract of country  the next day we all took a long walk on the beach picking up shells  on monday we took an open carriage and drove to rhyddlan whence we sent back the carriage meaning to walk home along the embankment of the river clwyd after inspecting the castle  the fortress is very ruinous having been dismantled by the parliamentarians  there are great gapstwo at least in the walls that connect the round towers of which there were six one on each side of a gateway in front and the same at a gateway towards the river where there is a steep descent to a wall and square tower at the waterside  great pains and a great deal of gunpowder must have been used in converting this castle into a ruin  there were one or two fragments lying where they had fallen more than two hundred years ago which though merely a conglomeration of small stones and mortar were just as hard as if they had been solid masses of granite  the substantial thickness of the walls is composed of these agglomerated small stones and mortar the casing being hewn blocks of red freestone this is much worn away by the weather wherever it has been exposed to the air but under shelter it looks as if it might have been hewn only a year or two ago  each of the round towers had formerly a small staircase turret rising beside and ascending above it in which a warder might be posted but they have all been so battered and shattered that it is impossible for an uninstructed observer to make out a satisfactory plan of then  the interior of each tower was a small room not more than twelve or fifteen feet across and of these there seem to have been three stories with loopholes for archery and not much other light than what came through them  then there are various passages and nooks and corners and square recesses in the stone some of which must have been intended for dungeons and the ugliest and gloomiest dungeons imaginable for they could not have had any light or air  there is not the least splinter of woodwork remaining in any part of the castlenothing but bare stone and a little plaster in one or two places on the wall  in the front gateway we looked at the groove on each side in which the portcullis used to rise and fall and in each of the contiguous round towers there was a loophole whence an enemy on the outer side of the portcullis might be shot through with an arrow  the inner courtyard is a parallelogram nearly a square and is about fortyfive of my paces across  it is entirely grassgrown and vacant except for two or three trees that have been recently set out and which are surrounded with palings to keep away the cows that pasture in and about the place  no window looks from the walls or towers into this courtyard nor are there any traces of buildings having stood within the enclosure unless it be what looks something like the flue of a chimney within one of the walls  i should suppose however that there must have been when the castle was in its perfect state a hall a kitchen and other commodious apartments and offices for the king and his train such as there were at conway and beaumaris  but if so all fragments have been carried away and all hollows of the old foundations scrupulously filled up  the round towers could not have comprised all the accommodation of the castle  there is nothing more striking in these ruins than to look upward from the crumbling base and see flights of stairs still comparatively perfect by which you might securely ascend to the upper heights of the tower although all traces of a staircase have disappeared below and the upper portion cannot be attained  on three sides of the fortress is a moat about sixty feet wide and cased with stone  it was probably of great depth in its day but it is now partly filled up with earth and is quite dry and grassy throughout its whole extent  on the inner side of the moat was the outer wall of the castle portions of which still remain  between the outer wall and the castle itself the space is also about sixty feet  the day was cloudy and lowering and there were several little spatterings of rain while we rambled about  the two children ran shouting hither and thither and were continually clambering into dangerous places racing along ledges of broken wall  at last they altogether disappeared for a good while their voices which had heretofore been plainly audible were hushed nor was there any answer when we began to call them while making ready for our departure  but they finally appeared coming out of the moat where they had been picking and eating blackberrieswhich they said grew very plentifully there and which they were very reluctant to leave  before quitting the castle i must not forget the ivy which makes a perfect tapestry over a large portion of the walls  we walked about the village which is old and ugly small irregular streets contriving to be intricate though there are few of them mean houses joining to each other  we saw in the principal one the parliament house in which edward i gave a charter or allowed rights of some kind to his welsh subjects  the ancient part of its wall is entirely distinguishable from what has since been built upon it  thence we set out to walk along the embankment although the sky looked very threatening  the wind however was so strong and had such a full sweep at us on the top of the bank that we decided on taking a path that led from it across the moor  but we soon had cause to repent of this for which way soever we turned we found ourselves cut off by a ditch or a little stream so that here we were fairly astray on rhyddlan moor the old battlefield of the saxons and britons and across which i suppose the fiddlers and mountebanks had marched to the relief of the earl of chester  anon too it began to shower and it was only after various leaps and scramblings that we made our way to a large farmhouse and took shelter under a cartshed  the back of the house to which we gained access was very dirty and illkept some dirty children peeped at us as we approached and nobody had the civility to ask us in so we took advantage of the first cessation of the shower to resume our way  we were shortly overtaken by a very intelligentlooking and civil man who seemed to have come from rhyddlan and said he was going to rhyl  we followed his guidance over stiles and along hedgerow paths which we never could have threaded rightly by ourselves  by and by our kind guide had to stop at an intermediate farm but he gave us full directions how to proceed and we went on till it began to shower again pretty briskly and we took refuge in a little bit of old stone cottage which small as it was had a greater antiquity than any mansion in america  the door was open and as we approached we saw several children gazing at us and their mother a pleasantlooking woman who seemed rather astounded at the visit that was about to befall her tried to draw a tattered curtain over a part of her interior which she fancied even less fit to be seen than the rest  to say the truth the house was not at all better than a pigsty and while we sat there a pig came familiarly to the door thrust in his snout and seemed surprised that he should he driven away instead of being admitted as one of the family the floor was of brick there was no ceiling but only the peaked gable overhead  the room was kitchen parlor and i suppose bedroom for the whole family at all events there was only the tattered curtain between us and the sleeping accommodations  the good woman either could not or would not speak a word of english only laughing when s said dim sassenach but she was kind and hospitable and found a chair for each of us  she had been making some bread and the dough was on the dresser life with these people is reduced to its simplest elements  it is only a pity that they cannot or do not choose to keep themselves cleaner poverty except in cities need not be squalid  when the shower abated a little we gave all the pennies we had to the children and set forth again  by the by there were several colored prints stuck up against the walls and there was a clock ticking in a corner and some paperhangings pinned upon the slanting roof  it began to rain again before we arrived at rhyl and we were driven into a small tavern  after staying there awhile we set forth between the drops but the rain fell still heavier so that we were pretty well damped before we got to our lodgings  after dinner i took the rail for chester and rock park and s and the children and maid followed the next day   september 22di dined on wednesday evening at mr john heywoods norris green  mr mouckton mimes and lady were of the company  mr mimes is a very agreeable kindly man resembling longfellow a good deal in personal appearance and he promotes by his genial manners the same pleasant intercourse which is so easily established with longfellow  he is said to be a very kind patron of literary men and to do a great deal of good among young and neglected people of that class  he is considered one of the best conversationists at present in society it may very well be so his style of talking being very simple and natural anything but obtrusive so that you might enjoy its agreeableness without suspecting it  he introduced me to his wife a daughter of lord crewe with whom and himself i had a good deal of talk  mr milnes told me that he owns the land in yorkshire whence some of the pilgrims of the mayflower emigrated to plymouth and that elder brewster was the postmaster of the village     he also said that in the next voyage of the mayflower after she carried the pilgrims she was employed in transporting a cargo of slaves from africato the west indies i suppose  this is a queer fact and would be nuts for the southerners  meman american would never understand the passage in bunyan about christian and hopeful going astray along a bypath into the grounds of giant despairfrom there being no stiles and bypaths in our country   september 26thon saturday evening my wife and i went to a soiree given by the mayor and mrs lloyd at the town hall to receive the earl of harrowby  it was quite brilliant the public rooms being really magnificent and adorned for the occasion with a large collection of pictures belonging to mr naylor  they were mostly if not entirely of modern artistsof turner wilkie landseer and others of the best english painters  turners seemed too ethereal to have been done by mortal hands  the british scientific association being now in session here many distinguished strangers were present   september 29thmr monekton milnes called on me at the consulate day before yesterday  he is pleasant and sensible  speaking of american politicians i remarked that they were seldom anything but politicians and had no literary or other culture beyond their own calling  he said the case was the same in england and instanced sir  who once called on him for information when an appeal had been made to him respecting two literary gentlemen  sir  had never heard the names of either of these gentlemen and applied to mr milnes as being somewhat conversant with the literary class to know whether they were distinguished and what were their claims  the names of the two literary men were james sheridan knowles and alfred tennyson   october 5thyesterday i was present at a dejeuner on board the james barnes on occasion of her coming under the british flag having been built for the messrs barnes by donald mckay of boston  she is a splendid vessel and magnificently fitted up though not with consummate taste  it would be worth while that ornamental architects and upholsterers should study this branch of art since the shipbuilders seem willing to expend a good deal of money on it  in fact i do not see that there is anywhere else so much encouragement to the exercise of ornamental art  i saw nothing to criticise in the solid and useful details of the ship the ventilation in particular being free and abundant so that the hundreds of passengers who will have their berths between decks and at a still lower depth will have good air and enough of it  there were four or five hundred persons principally liverpool merchants and their wives invited to the dejeuner and the tables were spread between decks the berths for passengers not being yet put in  there was not quite light enough to make the scene cheerful it being an overcast day and indeed there was an english plainness in the arrangement of the festal room which might have been better exchanged for the flowery american taste which i have just been criticising  with flowers and the arrangement of flags we should have made something very pretty of the space between decks but there was nothing to hide the fact that in a few days hence there would be crowded berths and seasick steerage passengers where we were now feasting  the cheer was very goodcold fowl and meats cold pies of foreign manufacture very rich and of mysterious composition and champagne in plenty with other wines for those who liked them  i sat between two ladies one of them mrs  a pleasant young woman who i believe is of american provincial nativity and whom i therefore regarded as half a countrywoman  we talked a good deal together and i confided to her my annoyance at the prospect of being called up to answer a toast but she did not pity me at all though she felt much alarm about her husband captain  who was in the same predicament  seriously it is the most awful part of my official duty this necessity of making dinnerspeeches at the mayors and other public or semipublic tables  however my neighborhood to mrs  was good for me inasmuch as by laughing over the matter with her came to regard it in a light and ludicrous way and so when the time actually came i stood up with a careless daredevil feeling  the chairman toasted the president immediately after the queen and did me the honor to speak of myself in a most flattering manner something like this great by his position under the republicgreater still i am bold to say in the republic of letters  i made no reply at all to this in truth i forgot all about it when i began to speak and merely thanked the company in behalf of the president and my countrymen and made a few remarks with no very decided point to them  however they cheered and applauded and i took advantage of the applause to sit down and mrs  informed me that i had succeeded admirably  it was no success at all to be sure neither was it a failure for i had aimed at nothing and i had exactly hit it  but after sitting down i was conscious of an enjoyment in speaking to a public assembly and felt as if i should like to rise again  it is something like being under firea sort of excitement not exactly pleasure but more piquant than most pleasures  i have felt this before in the same circumstances but while on my legs my impulse is to get through with my remarks and sit down again as quickly as possible the next speech i think was by rev dr  the celebrated arctic gentleman in reply to a toast complimentary to the clergy  he turned aside from the matter in hand to express his kind feelings towards america where he said he had been most hospitably received especially at cambridge university  he also made allusions to me and i suppose it would have been no more than civil in me to have answered with a speech in acknowledgment but i did not choose to make another venture so merely thanked him across the corner of the table for he sat near me he is a venerablelooking whitehaired gentleman tall and slender with a pale intelligent kindly face  other speeches were made but from beginning to end there was not one breath of eloquence nor even one neat sentence and i rather think that englishmen would purposely avoid eloquence or neatness in afterdinner speeches  it seems to be no part of their object  yet any englishman almost much more generally than americans will stand up and talk on in a plain way uttering one rough ragged and shapeless sentence after another and will have expressed himself sensibly though in a very rude manner before he sits down  and this is quite satisfactory to his audience who indeed are rather prejudiced against the man who speaks too glibly  the guests began to depart shortly after three oclock  this morning i have seen two reports of my little speechone exceedingly incorrect another pretty exact but not much to my taste for i seem to have left out everything that would have been fittest to say   october 6ththe people for several days have been in the utmost anxiety and latterly in the highest exultation about sebastopoland all england and europe to boot have been fooled by the belief that it had fallen  this however now turns out to be incorrect and the public visage is somewhat grim in consequence  i am glad of it  in spite of his actual sympathies it is impossible for a true american to be otherwise than glad  success makes an englishman intolerable and already on the mistaken idea that the way was open to a prosperous conclusion of the war the times had begun to throw out menaces against america  i shall never love england till she sues to us for help and in the mean time the fewer triumphs she obtains the better for all parties  an englishman in adversity is a very respectable character he does not lose his dignity but merely comes to a proper conception of himself  it is rather touching to an observer to see how much the universal heart is in this matterto see the merchants gathering round the telegraphic messages posted on the pillars of the exchange newsroom the people in the street who cannot afford to buy a paper clustering round the windows of the newsoffices where a copy is pinned upthe groups of corporals and sergeants at the recruiting rendezvous with a newspaper in the midst of them and all earnest and sombre and feeling like one man together whatever their rank  i seem to myself like a spy or a traitor when i meet their eyes and am conscious that i neither hope nor fear in sympathy with them although they look at me in full confidence of sympathy  their heart knoweth its own bitterness and as for me being a stranger and all alien i intermeddle not with their joy   october 9thmy ancestor left england in 1630  i return in 1853  i sometimes feel as if i myself had been absent these two hundred and twentythree years leaving england just emerging from the feudal system and finding it on my return on the verge of republicanism  it brings the two farseparated points of time very closely together to view the matter thus   october 16tha day or two ago arrived the sad news of the loss of the arctic by collision with a french steamer off newfoundland and the loss also of three or four hundred people  i have seldom been more affected by anything quite alien from my personal and friendly concerns than by the death of captain luce and his son  the boy was a delicate lad and it is said that he had never been absent from his mother till this time when his father had taken him to england to consult a physician about a complaint in his hip  so his father while the ship was sinking was obliged to decide whether he would put the poor weakly timorous child on board the boat to take his hard chance of life there or keep him to go down with himself and the ship  he chose the latter and within half an hour i suppose the boy was among the childangels  captain luce could not do less than die for his own part with the responsibility of all those lost lives upon him  he may not have been in the least to blame for the calamity but it was certainly too heavy a one for him to survive  he was a sensible man and a gentleman courteous quiet with something almost melancholy in his address and aspect  oftentimes he has come into my inner office to say goodby before his departures but i cannot precisely remember whether or no he took leave of me before this latest voyage  i never exchanged a great many words with him but those were kind ones   october 19thit appears to be customary for people of decent station but in distressed circumstances to go round among their neighbors and the public accompanied by a friend who explains the case  i have been accosted in the street in regard to one of these matters and today there came to my office a grocer who had become security for a friend and who was threatened with an executionwith another grocer for supporter and advocate  the beneficiary takes very little active part in the affair merely looking careworn distressed and pitiable and throwing in a word of corroboration or a sigh or an acknowledgment as the case may demand  in the present instance the friend a young respectablelooking tradesman with a lancashire accent spoke freely and simply of his clients misfortunes not pressing the case unduly but doing it full justice and saying at the close of the interview that it was no pleasant business for himself  the broken grocer was an elderly man of somewhat sickly aspect  the whole matter is very foreign to american habits  no respectable american would think of retrieving his affairs by such means but would prefer ruin ten times over no friend would take up his cause no public would think it worth while to prevent the small catastrophe  and yet the custom is not without its good side as indicating a closer feeling of brotherhood a more efficient sense of neighborhood than exists among ourselves although perhaps we are more careless of a fellowcreatures ruin because ruin with us is by no means the fatal and irretrievable event that it is in england  i am impressed with the ponderous and imposing look of an english legal documentan assignment of real estate in england for instance engrossed on an immense sheet of thickest paper in a formal hand beginning with this indenture in german text and with occasional phrases of form breaking out into large scriptvery long and repetitious fortified with the mayor of manchesters seal two or three inches in diameter which is certified by a notarypublic whose signature again is to have my consular certificate and official seal   november 2da young frenchman enters of gentlemanly aspect with a grayish cloak or paletot overspreading his upper person and a handsome and wellmade pair of black trousers and wellfitting boots below  on sitting down he does not throw off nor at all disturb the cloak  eying him more closely one discerns that he has no shirtcollar and that what little is visible of his shirtbosom seems not to be of today nor of yesterdayperhaps not even of the day before  his manner is not very good nevertheless he is a coxcomb and a jackanapes  he avers himself a naturalized citizen of america where he has been tutor in several families of distinction and has been treated like a son  he left america on account of his health and came near being tutor in the duke of norfolks family but failed for lack of testimonials he is exceedingly capable and accomplished but reduced in funds and wants employment here of the means of returning to america where he intends to take a situation under government which he is sure of obtaining  he mentioned a quarrel which he had recently had with an englishman in behalf of america and would have fought a duel had such been the custom of the country  he made the englishman foam at the mouth and told him that he had been twelve years at a military school and could easily kill him  i say to him that i see little or no prospect of his getting employment here but offer to inquire whether any situation as clerk or otherwise can be obtained for him in a vessel returning to america and ask his address  he has no address  much to my surprise he takes his leave without requesting pecuniary aid but hints that he shall call again  he is a very disagreeable young fellow like scores of others who call on me in the like situation  his english is very good for a frenchman and he says he speaks it the least well of five languages  he has been three years in america and obtained his naturalization papers he says as a special favor and by means of strong interest  nothing is so absolutely odious as the sense of freedom and equality pertaining to an american grafted on the mind of a native of any other country in the world  a naturalized citizen is hateful  nobody has a right to our ideas unless born to them   november 9thi lent the above frenchman a small sum he advertised for employment as a teacher and he called this morning to thank me for my aid and says mr c has engaged him for his children at a guinea a week and that he has also another engagement  the poor fellow seems to have been brought to a very low ebb  he has pawned everything even to his last shirt save the one he had on and had been living at the rate of twopence a day  i had procured him a chance to return to america but he was ashamed to go back in such poor circumstances and so determined to seek better fortune here  i like him better than i didpartly i suppose because i have helped him   november 14ththe other day i saw an elderly gentleman walking in dale street apparently in a state of mania for as he limped along being afflicted with lameness he kept talking to himself and sometimes breaking out into a threat against some casual passenger  he was a very respectablelooking man and i remember to have seen him last summer in the steamer returning from the isle of man where he had been staying at castle mona  what a strange and ugly predicament it would be for a person of quiet habits to be suddenly smitten with lunacy at noonday in a crowded street and to walk along through a dim maze of extravagances partly conscious of then but unable to resist the impulse to give way to them  a longsuppressed nature might be represented as bursting out in this way for want of any other safetyvalve  in america people seem to consider the government merely as a political administration and they care nothing for the credit of it unless it be the administration of their own political party  in england all people of whatever party are anxious for the credit of their rulers  our government as a knot of persons changes so entirely every four years that the institution has come to be considered a temporary thing  looking at the moon the other evening little r said it blooms out in the morning taking the moon to be the bud of the sun  the english are a most intolerant people  nobody is permitted nowadays to have any opinion but the prevalent one  there seems to be very little difference between their educated and ignorant classes in this respect if any it is to the credit of the latter who do not show tokens of such extreme interest in the war  it is agreeable however to observe how all englishmen pull togetherhow each man comes forward with his little scheme for helping on the warhow they feel themselves members of one family talking together about their common interest as if they were gathered around one fireside and then what a hearty meed of honor they award to their soldiers  it is worth facing death for  whereas in america when our soldiers fought as good battles with as great proportionate loss and far more valuable triumphs the country seemed rather ashamed than proud of them  mrs heywood tells me that there are many catholics among the lower classes in lancashire and cheshireprobably the descendants of retainers of the old catholic nobility and gentry who are more numerous in these shires than in other parts of england  the present lord seftons grandfather was the first of that race who became protestant   december 25thcommodore p called to see me this morninga brisk gentlemanly offhand but not rough unaffected and sensible man looking not so elderly as he ought on account of a very well made wig he is now on his return from a cruise in the east indian seas and goes home by the baltic with a prospect of being very well received on account of his treaty with japan  i seldom meet with a man who puts himself more immediately on conversable terms than the commodore  he soon introduced his particular business with meit being to inquire whether i would recommend some suitable person to prepare his notes and materials for the publication of an account of his voyage  he was good enough to say that he had fixed upon me in his own mind for this office but that my public duties would of course prevent me from engaging in it  i spoke of herman melville and one or two others but he seems to have some acquaintance with the literature of the day and did not grasp very cordially at any name that i could think of nor indeed could i recommend any one with full confidence  it would be a very desirable task for a young literary man or for that matter for an old one for the world can scarcely have in reserve a less hackneyed theme than japan  this is a most beautiful day of english winter clear and bright with the ground a little frozen and the green grass along the waysides at rock ferry sprouting up through the frozen pools of yesterdays rain england is forever green  on christmas day the children found wallflowers pansies and pinks in the garden and we had a beautiful rose from the garden of the hotel grown in the open air  yet one is sensible of the cold here as much as in the zero atmosphere of america the chief advantage of the english climate is that we are not tempted to heat our rooms to so unhealthy a degree as in new england  i think i have been happier this christmas than ever beforeby my own fireside and with my wife and children about memore content to enjoy what i haveless anxious for anything beyond it in this life  my early life was perhaps a good preparation for the declining half of life it having been such a blank that any thereafter would compare favorably with it  for a long long while i have occasionally been visited with a singular dream and i have an impression that i have dreamed it ever since i have been in england  it is that i am still at collegeor sometimes even at schooland there is a sense that i have been there unconscionably long and have quite failed to make such progress as my contemporaries have done and i seem to meet some of them with a feeling of shame and depression that broods over me as i think of it even when awake  this dream recurring all through these twenty or thirty years must be one of the effects of that heavy seclusion in which i shut myself up for twelve years after leaving college when everybody moved onward and left me behind  how strange that it should come now when i may call myself famous and prosperouswhen i am happy too   january 3d 1855the progress of the age is trampling over the aristocratic institutions of england and they crumble beneath it  this war has given the country a vast impulse towards democracy  the nobility will never hereafter i think assume or be permitted to rule the nation in peace or command armies in war on any ground except the individual ability which may appertain to one of their number as well as to a commoner  and yet the nobles were never positively more noble than now never perhaps so chivalrous so honorable so highly cultivated but relatively to the rest of the world they do not maintain their old place  the pressure of the war has tested and proved this fact at home and abroad  at this moment it would be an absurdity in the nobles to pretend to the position which was quietly conceded to them a year ago this one year has done the work of fifty ordinary ones or more accurately it has made apparent what has long been preparing itself   january 6ththe american ambassador called on me today and stayed a good whilean hour or two  he is visiting at mr william brownes at richmond hill having come to this region to bring his niece who is to be bridesmaid at the wedding of an american girl  i like mr  he cannot exactly be called gentlemanly in his manners there being a sort of rusticity about him moreover he has a habit of squinting one eye and an awkward carriage of his head hut withal a dignity in his large person and a consciousness of high position and importance which gives him ease and freedom  very simple and frank in his address he may be as crafty as other diplomatists are said to be but i see only good sense and plainness of speechappreciative too and genial enough to make himself conversable  he talked very freely of himself and of other public people and of american and english affairs  he returns to america he says next october and then retires forever from public life being sixtyfour years of age and having now no desire except to write memoirs of his times and especially of the administration of mr polk  i suggested a doubt whether the people would permit him to retire and he immediately responded to my hint as regards his prospects for the presidency  he said that his mind was fully made up and that he would never be a candidate and that he had expressed this decision to his friends in such a way as to put it out of his own power to change it  he acknowledged that he should have been glad of the nomination for the presidency in 1852 but that it was now too late and that he was too oldand in short he seemed to be quite sincere in his nolo episcopari although really he is the only democrat at this moment whom it would not be absurd to talk of for the office  as he talked his face flushed and he seemed to feel inwardly excited  doubtless it was the high vision of half his lifetime which he here relinquished  i cannot question that he is sincere but of course should the people insist upon having him for president he is too good a patriot to refuse i wonder whether he can have had any object in saying all this to me  he might see that it would be perfectly natural for me to tell it to general pierce  but it is a very vulgar ideathis of seeing craft and subtlety when there is a plain and honest aspect   january 9thi dined at mr william brownes m p last evening with a large party  the whole table and dessert service was of silver speaking of shakespeare mr  said that the duke of somerset who is now nearly fourscore told him that the father of john and charles kemble had made all possible research into the events of shakespeares life and that he had found reason to believe that shakespeare attended a certain revel at stratford and indulging too much in the conviviality of the occasion he tumbled into a ditch on his way home and died there the kemble patriarch was an aged man when he communicated this to the duke and their ages linked to each other would extend back a good way scarcely to the beginning of the last century however  if i mistake not it was from the traditions of stratford that kemble had learned the above  i do not remember ever to have seen it in printwhich is most singular  miss l has an english rather than an american aspectbeing of stronger outline than most of our young ladies although handsomer than english women generally extremely selfpossessed and well poised without affectation or assumption but quietly conscious of rank as much so as if she were an earls daughter  in truth she felt pretty much as an earls daughter would do towards the merchants wives and daughters who made up the feminine portion of the party  i talked with her a little and found her sensible vivacious and firmtextured rather than soft and sentimental  she paid me some compliments but i do not remember paying her any  mr js daughters two pale handsome girls were present  one of them is to be married to a grandson of mr  who was also at the dinner  he is a small young man with a thin and fair mustache     and a lady who sat next me whispered that his expectations are 6000 pounds per annum  it struck me that being a country gentlemans son he kept himself silent and reserved as feeling himself too good for this commercial dinnerparty but perhaps and i rather think so he was really shy and had nothing to say being only twentyone and therefore quite a boy among englishmen  the only man of cognizable rank present except mr  and the mayor of liverpool was a baronet sir thomas birch   january 17ths and i were invited to be present at the wedding of mr js daughter this morning but we were also bidden to the funeral services of mrs g a young american lady and we went to the house of mourning rather than to the house of feasting  her death was very sudden  i crossed to rock ferry on saturday and met her husband in the boat  he said his wife was rather unwell and that he had just been sent for to see her but he did not seem at all alarmed  and yet on reaching home he found her dead  the body is to be conveyed to america and the funeral service was read over her in her house only a few neighbors and friends being present  we were shown into a darkened room where there was a dim gaslight burning and a fire glimmering and here and there a streak of sunshine struggling through the drawn curtains  mr g looked pale and quite overcome with griefthis i suppose being his first sorrowand he has a young baby on his hands and no doubt feels altogether forlorn in this foreign land  the clergyman entered in his canonicals and we walked in a little procession into another room where the coffin was placed  mr g sat down and rested his head on the coffin the clergyman read the service then knelt down as did most of the company and prayed with great propriety of manner but with no earnestnessand we separated  mr g is a small smooth and pretty young man not emphasized in any way but grief threw its awfulness about him today in a degree which i should not have expected   january 20thmr steele a gentleman of rock ferry showed me this morning a pencilcase formerly belonging to dr johnson  it is six or seven inches long of large calibre and very clumsily manufactured of iron perhaps plated in its better days but now quite bare  indeed it looks as rough as an article of kitchen furniture  the intaglio on the end is a lion rampant  on the whole it well became dr johnson to have used such a stalwart pencilcase  it had a sixinch measure on a part of it so that it must have been at least eight inches long  mr steele says he has seen a cracked earthen teapot of large size in which miss williams used to make tea for dr johnson  god himself cannot compensate us for being born for any period short of eternity  all the misery endured here constitutes a claim for another life and still more all the happiness because all true happiness involves something more than the earth owns and needs something more than a mortal capacity for the enjoyment of it  after receiving an injury on the head a person fancied all the rest of his life that he heard voices flouting jeering and upbraiding him   february 19thi dined with the mayor at the town hall last friday evening  i sat next to mr w j an irishamerican merchant who is in very good standing here  he told me that he used to be very well acquainted with general jackson and that he was present at the street fight between him and the bentons and helped to take general jackson off the ground  colonel benton shot at him from behind but it was jesse bentons ball that hit him and broke his arm  i did not understand him to infer any treachery or cowardice from the circumstance of colonel bentons shooting at jackson from behind but suppose it occurred in the confusion and excitement of a street fight  mr w j seems to think that after all the reconciliation between the old general and benton was merely external and that they really hated one another as before  i do not think so  these dinners of the mayors are rather agreeable than otherwise except for the annoyance in my case of being called up to speak to a toast and that is less disagreeable than at first  the suite of rooms at the town house is stately and splendid and all the mayors as far as i have seen exercise hospitality in a manner worthy of the chief magistrates of a great city  they are supposed always to spend much more than their salary which is 2000 pounds in these entertainments  the town provides the wines i am told and it might be expected that they should be particularly goodat least those which improve by age for a quarter of a century should be only a moderate age for wine from the cellars of centurieslong institutions like a corporate borough  each mayor might lay in a supply of the best vintage he could find and trust his good name to posterity to the credit of that wine and so he would be kindly and warmly remembered long after his own nose had lost its rubicundity  in point of fact the wines seem to be good but not remarkable  the dinner was good and very handsomely served with attendance enough both in the hall belowwhere the door was wide open at the appointed hour notwithstanding the coldand at table some being in the rich livery of the borough and some in plain clothes servants too were stationed at various points from the hall to the receptionroom and the last one shouted forth the name of the entering guest  there were i should think about fifty guests at this dinner two bishops were present  the bishops of chester and new south wales dressed in a kind of long tunics with black breeches and silk stockings insomuch that i first fancied they were catholics  also dr mcneil in a stiffcollared coat looking more like a general than a divine  there were two officers in blue uniforms and all the rest of us were in black with only two white waistcoatsmy own being oneand a rare sprinkling of white cravats  how hideously a man looks in them  i should like to have seen such assemblages as must have gathered in that receptionroom and walked with stately tread to the dininghall in times past the mayor and other civic dignitaries in their robes noblemen in their state dresses the consul in his oliveleaf embroidery everybody in some sort of bedizenmentand then the dinner would have been a magnificent spectacle worthy of the gilded hall the rich tableservice and the powdered and goldlaced servitors  at a former dinner i remember seeing a gentleman in smallclothes with a dresssword but all formalities of the kind are passing away  the mayors dinners too will no doubt be extinct before many years go by  i drove home from the woodside ferry in a cab with bishop burke and two other gentlemen  the bishop is nearly seven feet high  after writing the foregoing account of a civic banquet where i ate turtlesoup salmon woodcock oyster patties and i know not what else i have been to the newsroom and found the exchange pavement densely thronged with people of all ages and of all manner of dirt and rags they were waiting for souptickets and waiting very patiently too without outcry or disturbance or even sour looksonly patience and meekness in their faces  well i dont know that they have a right to he impatient of starvation but still there does seem to be an insolence of riches and prosperity which one day or another will have a downfall and this will be a pity too  on saturday i went with my friend mr bright to otterpool and to larkhill to see the skaters on the private waters of those two seats of gentlemen and it is a wonder to beholdand it is always a new wonder to mehow comfortable englishmen know how to make themselves locating their dwellings far within private grounds with secure gateways and porters lodges and the smoothest roads and trimmest paths and shaven lawns and clumps of trees and every bit of the ground every hill and dell made the most of for convenience and beauty and so well kept that even winter cannot cause disarray and all this appropriated to the same family for generations so that i suppose they come to believe it created exclusively and on purpose for them  and really the result is good and beautiful  it is a homean institution which we americans have not but then i doubt whether anybody is entitled to a home in this world in so full a sense  the day was very cold and the skaters seemed to enjoy themselves exceedingly  they were i suppose friends of the owners of the grounds and mr bright said they were treated in a jolly way with hot luncheons the skaters practise skating more as an art and can perform finer manoeuvres on the ice than our new england skaters usually can though the english have so much less opportunity for practice  a beggarwoman was haunting the grounds at otterpool but i saw nobody give her anything  i wonder how she got inside of the gate  mr w j spoke of general jackson as having come from the same part of ireland as himself and perhaps of the same family  i wonder whether he meant to say that the general was born in irelandthat having been suspected in america   february 21styesterday two companies of workpeople came to our house in rock park asking assistance being out of work and with no resource other than charity  there were a dozen or more in each party  their deportment was quiet and altogether unexceptionableno rudeness no gruffness nothing of menace  indeed such demonstrations would not have been safe as they were followed about by two policemen but they really seem to take their distress as their own misfortune and gods will and impute it to nobody as a fault  this meekness is very touching and makes one question the more whether they have all their rights  there have been disturbances within a day or two in liverpool and shops have been broken open and robbed of bread and money but this is said to have been done by idle vagabonds and not by the really hungry workpeople these last submit to starvation gently and patiently as if it were an everyday matter with them or at least nothing but what lay fairly within their horoscope  i suppose in fact their stomachs have the physical habit that makes hunger not intolerable because customary  if they had been used to a full meat diet their hunger would be fierce like that of ravenous beasts but now they are trained to it  i think that the feeling of an american divided as i am by the ocean from his country has a continual and immediate correspondence with the national feeling at home and it seems to be independent of any external communication  thus my ideas about the russian war vary in accordance with the state of the public mind at home so that i am conscious whereabouts public sympathy is   march 7thj and i walked to tranmere and passed an old house which i suppose to be tranmere hall  our way to it was up a hollow lane with a bank and hedge on each side and with a few thatched stone cottages centuries old their ridgepoles crooked and the stones timeworn scattered along  at one point there was a wide deep well hewn out of the solid red freestone and with steps also hewn in solid rock leading down to it  these steps were much hollowed by the feet of those who had come to the well and they reach beneath the water which is very high  the well probably supplied water to the old cotters and retainers of tranmere hall five hundred years ago  the hall stands on the verge of a long hill which stretches behind tranmere and as far as birkenhead  it is an old gray stone edifice with a good many gables and windows with mullions and some of them extending the whole breadth of the gable in some parts of the house the windows seem to have been built up probably in the days when daylight was taxed  the form of the hall is multiplex the roofs sloping down and intersecting one another so as to make the general result indescribable  there were two sundials on different sides of the house both the dialplates of which were of stone and on one the figures so far as i could see were quite worn off but the gnomon still cast a shadow over it in such a way that i could judge that it was about noon  the other dial had some halfworn hourmarks but no gnomon  the chinks of the stones of the house were very weedy and the building looked quaint and venerable but it is now converted into a farmhouse with the farmyard and outbuildings closely appended  a village too has grown up about it so that it seems out of place among modern stuccoed dwellings such as are erected for tradesmen and other moderate people who have their residences in the neighborhood of a great city  among these there are a few thatched cottages the homeliest domiciles that ever mortals lived in belonging to the old estate  directly across the street is a wayside inn licensed to sell wine spirits ale and tobacco  the street itself has been laid out since the land grew valuable by the increase of liverpool and birkenhead for the old hall would never have been built on the verge of a public way   march 27thi attended court to day at st georges hall with my wife mr bright and mr channing sitting in the high sheriffs seat  it was the civil side and mr justice cresswell presided  the lawyers as far as aspect goes seemed to me inferior to an american bar judging from their countenances whether as intellectual men or gentlemen  their wigs and gowns do not impose on the spectator though they strike him as an imposition  their date is past  mr warren of the ten thousand a year was in courta pale thin intelligent face evidently a nervous man more unquiet than anybody else in courtalways restless in his seat whispering to his neighbors settling his wig perhaps with an idea that people single him out  st georges hallthe interior hall itself i meanis a spacious lofty and most rich and noble apartment and very satisfactory  the pavement is made of mosaic tiles and has a beautiful effect   april 7thi dined at mr j p heywoods on thursday and met there mr and mrs  of smithells hall  the hall is an old edifice of some five hundred years and mrs  says there is a bloody footstep at the foot of the great staircase  the tradition is that a certain martyr in bloody marys time being examined before the occupant of the hall and committed to prison stamped his foot in earnest protest against the injustice with which he was treated  blood issued from his foot which slid along the stone pavement leaving a long footmark printed in blood and there it has remained ever since in spite of the scrubbings of all succeeding generations  mrs  spoke of it with much solemnity real or affected  she says that they now cover the bloody impress with a carpet being unable to remove it  in the history of lancashire which i looked at last night there is quite a different accountaccording to which the footstep is not a bloody one but is a slight cavity or inequality in the surface of the stone somewhat in the shape of a mans foot with a peaked shoe  the martyrs name was george marsh  he was a curate and was afterwards burnt  mrs  asked me to go and see the hall and the footmark and as it is in lancashire and not a great way off and a curious old place perhaps i may   april 12ththe earl of  whom i saw the other day at st georges hall has a somewhat elderly looka pale and rather thin face which strikes one as remarkably short or compressed from top to bottom nevertheless it has great intelligence and sensitiveness too i should think but a cold disagreeable expression  i should take him to be a man of not very pleasant tempernot genial  he has no physical presence nor dignity yet one sees him to be a person of rank and consequence  but after all there is nothing about him which it need have taken centuries of illustrious nobility to produce especially in a man of remarkable ability as lord  certainly is  s who attended court all through the hapgood trial and saw lord  for hours together every day has come to conclusions quite different from mine  she thinks him a perfectly natural person without any assumption any selfconsciousness any scorn of the lower world  she was delighted with his ready appreciation and feeling of what was passing around him his quick enjoyment of a jokethe simplicity and unaffectedness of his emotion at whatever incidents excited his interestthe genial acknowledgment of sympathy causing him to look round and exchange glances with those near him who were not his individual friends but barristers and other casual persons  he seemed to her all that a nobleman ought to be entirely simple and free from pretence and selfassertion which persons of lower rank can hardly help bedevilling themselves with  i saw him only for a very few moments so cannot put my observation against hers especially as i was influenced by what i had heard the liverpool people say of him  i do not know whether i have mentioned that the handsomest man i have seen in england was a young footman of mr heywoods  in his rich livery he was a perfect joseph andrews  in my romance the original emigrant to america may have carried away with him a family secret whereby it was in his power had he so chosen to have brought about the ruin of the family  this secret he transmits to his american progeny by whom it is inherited throughout all the intervening generations  at last the hero of the romance comes to england and finds that by means of this secret he still has it in his power to procure the downfall of the family  it would be something similar to the story of meleager whose fate depended on the firebrand that his mother had snatched from the flames   april 24thon saturday i was present at a dejeuner on board the donald mckay the principal guest being mr layard m p  there were several hundred people quite filling the between decks of the ship which was converted into a saloon for the occasion  i sat next to mr layard at the head of the table and so had a good opportunity of seeing and getting acquainted with him  he is a man in early middle ageof middle stature with an open frank intelligent kindly face  his forehead is not expansive but is prominent in the perceptive regions and retreats a good deal  his mouth is fulli liked him from the first  he was very kind and complimentary to me and made me promise to go and see him in london  it would have been a very pleasant entertainment only that my pleasure in it was much marred by having to acknowledge a toast in honor of the president  however such things do not trouble me nearly so much as they used to do and i came through it tolerably enough  mr layards speech was the great affair of the day  he speaks with much fluency though he assured me that he had to put great force upon himself to speak publicly and as he warms up seems to engage with his whole moral and physical manquite possessed with what he has to say  his evident earnestness and good faith make him eloquent and stand him instead of oratorical graces  his views of the position of england and the prospects of the war were as dark as well could be and his speech was exceedingly to the purpose full of commonsense and with not one word of claptrap  judging from its effect upon the audience he spoke the voice of the whole english peoplealthough an english baronet who sat next below me seemed to dissent or at least to think that it was not exactly the thing for a stranger to hear  it concluded amidst great cheering  mr layard appears to be a true englishman with a moral force and strength of character and earnestness of purpose and fulness of commonsense such as have always served englands turn in her past successes but rather fit for resistance than progress  no doubt he is a good and very able man but i question whether he could get england out of the difficulties which he sees so clearly or could do much better than lord palmerston whom he so decries   april 25thtaking the deposition of sailors yesterday in a case of alleged illusage by the officers of a vessel one of the witnesses was an old seaman of sixty  in reply to some testimony of his the captain said you were the oldest man in the ship and we honored you as such the mate also said that he never could have thought of striking an old man like that  indeed the poor old fellow had a kind of dignity and venerableness about him though he confessed to having been drunk and seems to have been a mischiefmaker what they call a seapreacher promoting discontent and grumbling  he must have been a very handsome man in his youth having regular features of a noble and beautiful cast his beard was gray but his dark hair had hardly a streak of white and was abundant all over his head  he was deaf and seemed to sit in a kind of seclusion unless when loudly questioned or appealed to  once he broke forth from a deep silence thus i defy any man and then was silent again  it had a strange effect this general defiance which he meant i suppose in answer to some accusation that he thought was made against him  his general behavior throughout the examination was very decorous and proper and he said he had never but once hitherto been before a consul and that was in 1819 when a mate had illused him and being a young man then i gave him a beatingwhereupon his face gleamed with a quiet smile like faint sunshine on an old ruin  by many a tempest has his beard been shook and i suppose he must soon go into a workhouse and thence shortly to his grave  he is now in a hospital having as the surgeon certifies some ribs fractured but there does not appear to have been any violence used upon him aboard the ship of such a nature as to cause this injury though he swears it was a blow from a rope and nothing else  what struck me in the case was the respect and rank that his age seemed to give him in the view of the officers and how as the captains expression signified it lifted him out of his low position and made him a person to be honored  the dignity of his manner is perhaps partly owing to the ancient mariner with his long experience being an oracle among the forecastle men   may 3dit rains today after a very long period of eastwind and dry weather  the eastwind here blowing across the island seems to be the least damp of all the winds but it is full of malice and mischief of an indescribably evil temper and stabs one like a cold poisoned dagger  i never spent so disagreeable a spring as this although almost every day for a month has been bright   friday may 11tha few weeks ago a sailor a most pitiable object came to my office to complain of cruelty from his captain and mate  they had beaten him shamefully of which he bore grievous marks about his face and eyes and bruises on his head and other parts of his person and finally the ship had sailed leaving him behind  i never in my life saw so forlorn a fellow so ragged so wretched and even his wits seemed to have been beaten out of him if perchance he ever had any  he got an order for the hospital and there he has been off and on ever since till yesterday when i received a message that he was dying and wished to see the consul so i went with mr wilding to the hospital  we were ushered into the waitingrooma kind of parlor with a fire in the grate and a centretable whereon lay one or two medical journals with wood engravings and there was a young man who seemed to be an official of the house reading  shortly the surgeon appeareda brisk cheerful kindly sort of person whom i have met there on previous visits  he told us that the man was dying and probably would not be able to communicate anything but nevertheless ushered us up to the highest floor and into the room where he lay  it was a large oblong room with ten or twelve beds in it each occupied by a patient  the surgeon said that the hospital was often so crowded that they were compelled to lay some of the patients on the floor  the man whom we came to see lay on his bed in a little recess formed by a projecting window so that there was a kind of seclusion for him to die in  he seemed quite insensible to outward things and took no notice of our approach nor responded to what was said to himlying on his side breathing with short gaspshis apparent disease being inflammation of the chest although the surgeon said that he might be found to have sustained internal injury by bruises he was restless tossing his head continually mostly with his eyes shut and much compressed and screwed up but sometimes opening them and then they looked brighter and darker than when i first saw them  i think his face was not at any time so stupid as at his first interview with me but whatever intelligence he had was rather inward than outward as if there might be life and consciousness at a depth within while as to external matters he was in a mist  the surgeon felt his wrist and said that there was absolutely no pulsation and that he might die at any moment or might perhaps live an hour but that there was no prospect of his being able to communicate with me  he was quite restless nevertheless and sometimes half raised himself in bed sometimes turned himself quite over and then lay gasping for an instant  his woollen shirt being thrust up on his arm there appeared a tattooing of a ship and anchor and other nautical emblems on both of them which another sailorpatient on examining them said must have been done years ago this might be of some importance because the dying man had told me when i first saw him that he was no sailor but a farmer and that this being his first voyage he had been beaten by the captain for not doing a sailors duty which he had had no opportunity of learning  these seaemblems indicated that he was probably a seaman of some years service  while we stood in the little recess such of the other patients as were convalescent gathered near the foot of the bed and the nurse came and looked on and hovered about usa sharpeyed intelligent woman of middle age with a careful and kind expression neglecting nothing that was for the patients good yet taking his death as coolly as any other incident in her daily business  certainly it was a very forlorn deathbed and i feltwhat i have heretofore been inclined to doubt that it might be a comfort to have persons whom one loves to go with us to the threshold of the other world and leave us only when we are fairly across it  this poor fellow had a wife and two children on the other side of the water  at first he did not utter any sound but by and by he moaned a little and gave tokens of being more sensible to outward concernsnot quite so misty and dreamy as hitherto  we had been talking all the whilemyself in a whisper but the surgeon in his ordinary tonesabout his state without his paying any attention  but now the surgeon put his mouth down to the mans face and said do you know that you are dying  at this the patients head began to move upon the pillow and i thought at first that it was only the restlessness that he had shown all along but soon it appeared to be an expression of emphatic dissent a negative shake of the head  he shook it with all his might and groaned and mumbled so that it was very evident how miserably reluctant he was to die  soon after this he absolutely spoke  o i want you to get me well  i want to get away from here in a groaning and moaning utterance  the surgeons question had revived him but to no purpose for being told that the consul had come to see him and asked whether he had anything to communicate he said only o i want him to get me well and the whole life that was left in him seemed to be unwillingness to die  this did not last long for he soon relapsed into his first state only with his face a little more pinched and screwed up and his eyes strangely sunken and lost in his head and the surgeon said that there would be no use in my remaining  so i took my leave  mr wilding had brought a deposition of the mans evidence which he had clearly made at the consulate for him to sign and this we left with the surgeon in case there should be such an interval of consciousness and intelligence before death as to make it possible for him to sign it  but of this there is no probability  i have just received a note from the hospital stating that the sailor daniel smith died about three quarters of an hour after i saw him   may 18ththe abovementioned daniel smith had about him a bundle of letters which i have examined  they are all very yellow stained with seawater smelling of bad tobaccosmoke and much worn at the folds never were such illwritten letters nor such incredibly fantastic spelling  they seem to be from various members of his familymost of them from a brother who purports to have been a deckhand in the coasting and steamboat trade between charleston and other ports others from female relations one from his father in which he inquires how long his son has been in jail and when the trial is to come onthe offence however of which he was accused not being indicated  but from the tenor of his brothers letters it would appear that he was a small farmer in the interior of south carolina sending butter eggs and poultry to be sold in charleston by his brother and receiving the returns in articles purchased there  this was his own account of himself and he affirmed in his deposition before me that he had never had any purpose of shipping for liverpool or anywhere else but that going on board the ship to bring a mans trunk ashore he was compelled to remain and serve as a sailor  this was a hard fate certainly and a strange thing to happen in the united states at this daythat a free citizen should be absolutely kidnapped carried to a foreign country treated with savage cruelty during the voyage and left to die on his arrival  yet all this has unquestionably been done and will probably go unpunished  the seed of the longstapled cotton now cultivated in america was sent there in 1786 from the bahama islands by some of the royalist refugees who had settled there  the inferior shortstapled cotton had been previously cultivated for domestic purposes  the seeds of every other variety have been tried without success  the kind now grown was first introduced into georgia  thus to the refugees america owes as much of her prosperity as is due to the cottoncrops and much of whatever harm is to result from slavery   may 22dcaptain j says that he saw in his late voyage to australia and india a vessel commanded by an englishman who had with him his wife and thirteen children  this ship was the home of the family and they had no other  the thirteen children had all been born on board and had been brought up on board and knew nothing of dry land except by occasionally setting foot on it  captain j is a very agreeable specimen of the american shipmaster a pleasant gentlemanly man not at all refined and yet with fine and honorable sensibilities  very easy in his manners and conversation yet gentletalking on freely and not much minding grammar but finding a sufficient and picturesque expression for what he wishes to say very cheerful and vivacious accessible to feeling as yesterday when talking about the recent death of his mother  his voice faltered and the tears came into his eyes though before and afterwards he smiled merrily and made us smile fond of his wife and carrying her about the world with him and blending her with all his enjoyments an excellent and sagacious man of business liberal in his expenditure proud of his ship and flag always well dressed with some little touch of sailorlike flashiness but not a whit too much slender in figure with a handsome face and rather profuse brown beard and whiskers active and alert about thirtytwo  a daguerreotype sketch of any conversation of his would do him no justice for its slang its grammatical mistakes its mistaken words as portable for portly would represent a vulgar man whereas the impression he leaves is by no means that of vulgarity but he is a character quite perfect within itself fit for the deck and the cabin and agreeable in the drawingroom though not amenable altogether to its rules  being so perfectly natural he is more of a gentleman for those little violations of rule which most men with his opportunities might escape  the men whose appeals to the consuls charity are the hardest to be denied are those who have no countryhungarians poles cubans spanishamericans and french republicans  all exiles for liberty come to me if the representative of america were their representative yesterday came an old french soldier and showed his wounds today a spaniard a friend of lopezbringing his little daughter with him  he said he was starving and looked so  the little girl was in good condition enough and decently dressedmay 23d   may 30ththe two past days have been whitsuntide holidays and they have been celebrated at tranmere in a manner very similar to that of the old election in massachusetts as i remember it a good many years ago though the festival has now almost or quite died out  whitsuntide was kept up on our side of the water i am convinced under pretence of rejoicings at the election of governor  it occurred at precisely the same period of the yearthe same week the only difference being that monday and tuesday are the whitsun festival days whereas in massachusetts wednesday was election day and the acme of the merrymaking  i passed through tranmere yesterday forenoon and lingered awhile to see the sports  the greatest peculiarity of the crowd to my eye was that they seemed not to have any best clothes and therefore had put on no holiday suitsa grimy people as at all times heavy obtuse with thick beer in their blood  coarse roughcomplexioned women and girls were intermingled the girls with no maiden trimness in their attire large and blowsy  nobody seemed to have been washed that day  all the enjoyment was of an exceedingly sombre character so far as i saw it though there was a richer variety of sports than at similar festivals in america  there were wooden horses revolving in circles to be ridden a certain number of rounds for a penny also swinging cars gorgeously painted and the newest named after lord raglan and four cars balancing one another and turned by a winch and people with targets and rifles the principal aim being to hit an apple bobbing on a string before the target other guns for shooting at the distance of a foot or two for a prize of filberts and a game much in fashion of throwing heavy sticks at earthen mugs suspended on lines three throws for a penny  also there was a posturemaster showing his art in the centre of a ring of miscellaneous spectators and handing round his bat after going through all his attitudes  the collection amounted to only one halfpenny and to eke it out i threw in three more  there were some large booths with tables placed the whole length at which sat men and women drinking and smoking pipes orangegirls a great many selling the worst possible oranges which had evidently been boiled to give them a show of freshness  there were likewise two very large structures the walls made of boards roughly patched together and rooted with canvas which seemed to have withstood a thousand storms  theatres were there and in front there were pictures of scenes which were to be represented within the price of admission being twopence to one theatre and a penny to the other  but small as the price of tickets was i could not see that anybody bought them  behind the theatres close to the board wall and perhaps serving as the general dressingroom was a large windowed wagon in which i suppose the company travel and live together  never to my imagination was the mysterious glory that has surrounded theatrical representation ever since my childhood brought down into such dingy reality as this  the tragedy queens were the same coarse and homely women and girls that surrounded me on the green  some of the people had evidently been drinking more than was good for them but their drunkenness was silent and stolid with no madness in it  no ebullition of any sort was apparent   may 31stlast sunday week for the first time i heard the note of the cuckoo  cuckoocuckoo it says repeating the word twice not in a brilliant metallic tone but low and flutelike without the excessive sweetness of the flutewithout an excess of saccharine juice in the sound  there are said to be always two cuckoos seen together  the note is very soft and pleasant  the larks i have not yet heard in the sky though it is not infrequent to hear one singing in a cage in the streets of liverpool  brewers draymen are allowed to drink as much of their masters beverage as they like and they grow very brawny and corpulent resembling their own horses in size and presenting one would suppose perfect pictures of physical comfort and wellbeing  but the least bruise or even the hurt of a finger is liable to turn to gangrene or erysipelas and become fatal  when the wind blows violently however clear the sky the english say it is a stormy day  and on the other hand when the air is still and it does not actually rain however dark and lowering the sky may be they say the weather is fine   june 2dthe english women of the lower classes have a grace of their own not seen in each individual but nevertheless belonging to their order which is not to be found in american women of the corresponding class  the other day in the police court a girl was put into the witnessbox whose native graces of this sort impressed me a good deal she was coarse and her dress was none of the cleanest and nowise smart she appeared to have been up all night too drinking at the tranmere wake and had since ridden in a cart covered up with a rug  she described herself as a servantgirl out of place and her charm lay in all her manifestationsher tones her gestures her look her way of speaking and what she said being so appropriate and natural in a girl of that class nothing affected no proper grace thrown away by attempting to appear ladylikewhich an american girl would have attemptedand she would also have succeeded in a certain degree  if each class would but keep within itself and show its respect for itself by aiming at nothing beyond they would all be more respectable  but this kind of fitness is evidently not to be expected in the future and something else must be substituted for it  these scenes at the police court are often well worth witnessing  the controlling genius of the court except when the stipendiary magistrate presides is the clerk who is a man learned in the law  nominally the cases are decided by the aldermen who sit in rotation but at every important point there comes a nod or a whisper from the clerk and it is that whisper which sets the defendant free or sends him to prison nevertheless i suppose the aldermans commonsense and native shrewdness are not without their efficacy in producing a general tendency towards the right and no doubt the decisions of the police court are quite as often just as those of any other court whatever  june 11thi walked with j yesterday to bebington church  when i first saw this church nearly two years since it seemed to me the fulfilment of my ideal of an old english country church  it is not so satisfactory now although certainly a venerable edifice  there used some time ago to be ivy all over the tower and at my first view of it there was still a little remaining on the upper parts of the spire  but the main roots i believe were destroyed and pains were taken to clear away the whole of the ivy so that now it is quite barenothing but homely gray stone with marks of age but no beauty  the most curious thing about the church is the font  it is a massive pile composed of five or six layers of freestone in an octagon shape placed in the angle formed by the projecting side porch and the wall of the church and standing under a stainedglass window  the base is six or seven feet across and it is built solidly up in successive steps to the height of about six feetan octagonal pyramid with the basin of the font crowning the pile hewn out of the solid stone and about a foot in diameter and the same in depth  there was water in it from the recent rainswater just from heaven and therefore as holy as any water it ever held in old romish times  the aspect of this aged font is extremely venerable with moss in the basin and all over the stones grass and weeds of various kinds and little shrubs rooted in the chinks of the stones and between the successive steps  at each entrance of rock park where we live there is a small gothic structure of stone each inhabited by a policeman and his family very small dwellings indeed with the main apartment opening directly outofdoors and when the door is open one can see the household fire the good wife at work perhaps the table set and a throng of children clustering round and generally overflowing the threshold  the policeman walks about the park in stately fashion with his silverlaced blue uniform and snowwhite gloves touching his hat to gentlemen who reside in the park  in his public capacity he has rather an awful aspect but privately he is a humble man enough glad of any little job and of old clothes for his many children or i believe for himself  one of the two policemen is a shoemaker and cobbler  his pay officially is somewhere about a guinea a week  the park just now is very agreeable to look at shadowy with trees and shrubs and with glimpses of green leaves and flowergardens through the branches and twigs that line the iron fences  after a shower the hawthorn blossoms are delightfully fragrant  golden tassels of the laburnum are abundant  i may have mentioned elsewhere the traditional prophecy that when the ivy should reach the top of bebbington spire the tower was doomed to fall  it lies still therefore a chance of standing for centuries  mr turner tells me that the font now used is inside of the church but the one outside is of unknown antiquity and that it was customary in papistical time to have the font without the church  there is a little boy often on board the rock ferry steamer with an accordionan instrument i detest but nevertheless it becomes tolerable in his hands not so much for its music as for the earnestness and interest with which he plays it  his body and the accordion together become one musical instrument on which his soul plays tunes for he sways and vibrates with the music from head to foot and throughout his frame half closing his eyes and uplifting his face as painters represent st cecilia and other famous musicians and sometimes he swings his accordion in the air as if in a perfect rapture  after all my ears though not very nice are somewhat tortured by his melodies especially when confined within the cabin  the boy is ten years old perhaps and rather pretty clean too and neatly dressed very unlike all other street and vagabond children whom i have seen in liverpool  people give him their halfpence more readily than to any other musicians who infest the boat  j the other day was describing a soldiercrab to his mother he being much interested in natural history and endeavoring to give as strong an idea as possible of its warlike characteristics and power to harm those who molest it  little r sat by quietly listening and sewing and at last lifting her head she remarked i hope god did not hurt himself when he was making him    leamington   june 21stwe left rock ferry and liverpool on monday the 18th by the rail for this place a very dim and rainy day so that we had no pleasant prospects of the country neither would the scenery along the great western railway have been in any case very striking though sunshine would have made the abundant verdure and foliage warm and genial  but a railway naturally finds its way through all the common places of a country and is certainly a most unsatisfactory mode of travelling the only object being to arrive  however we had a whole carriage to ourselves and the children enjoyed the earlier part of the journey very much  we skirted shrewsbury and i think i saw the old tower of a church near the station perhaps the same that struck falstaffs long hour as we left the town i saw the wrekin a round pointed hill of regular shape and remembered the old toast to all friends round the wrekin as we approached birmingham the country began to look somewhat brummagemish with its manufacturing chimneys and pennons of flame quivering out of their tops its forges and great heaps of mineral refuse its smokiness and other ugly symptoms  of birmingham itself we saw little or nothing except the mean and new brick lodginghouses on the outskirts of the town  passing through warwick we had a glimpse of the castlean ivied wall and two turrets rising out of imbosoming foliage ones very idea of an old castle  we reached leamington at a little past six and drove to the clarendon hotela very spacious and stately house by far the most splendid hotel i have yet seen in england the landlady a courteous old lady in black showed my wife our rooms and we established ourselves in an immensely large and lofty parlor with red curtains and ponderous furniture perhaps a very little out of date the waiter brought me the book of arrivals containing the names of all visitors for from three to five years back  during two years i estimated that there had been about three hundred and fifty persons only and while we were there i saw nobody but ourselves to support the great hotel among the names were those of princes earls countesses and baronets and when the people of the house heard from rs nurse that i too was a man of office and held the title of honorable in my own country they greatly regretted that i entered myself as plain mister in the book we found this hotel very comfortable and might doubtless have made it luxurious had we chosen to go to five times the expense of similar luxuries in america but we merely ordered comfortable things and so came off at no very extravagant rateand with great honor at all events in the estimation of the waiter  during the afternoon we found lodgings and established ourselves in them before dark  this english custom of lodgings of which we had some experience at rhyl last year has its advantages but is rather uncomfortable for strangers who in first settling themselves down find that they must undertake all the responsibility of housekeeping at an instants warming and cannot get even a cup of tea till they have made arrangements with the grocer soon however there comes a sense of being at home and by our exclusive selves which never can be attained at hotels nor boardinghouses  our house is well situated and respectably furnished with the dinginess however which is inseparable from lodginghousesas if others had used these things before and would use them again after we had gonea wellenough adaptation but a lack of peculiar appropriateness and i think one puts off real enjoyment from a sense of not being truly fitted   july 1ston friday i took the rail with j for coventry  it was a bright and very warm day oppressively so indeed though i think that there is never in this english climate the pervading warmth of an american summer day  the sunshine may be excessively hot but an overshadowing cloud or the shade of a tree or of a building at once affords relief and if the slightest breeze stirs you feel the latent freshness of the air  coventry is some nine or ten miles from leamington  the approach to it from the railway presents nothing very strikinga few churchtowers and one or two tall steeples and the houses first seen are of modern and unnoticeable aspect  getting into the interior of the town however you find the streets very crooked and some of them very narrow  i saw one place where it seemed possible to shake hands from one jutting storied old house to another  there were whole streets of the same kind of houses one story impending over another such as used to be familiar to me in salem and in some streets of boston  in fact the whole aspect of the townits irregularity and continual indirectnessreminded me very much of boston as i used to see it in rare visits thither when a child  these coventry houses however many of them are much larger than any of similar style that i have seen elsewhere and they spread into greater bulk as they ascend by means of one story jutting over the other probably the newenglanders continued to follow this fashion of architecture after it had been abandoned in the mother country  the old house built by philip english in salem dated about 1692 and it was in this stylemany gabled and impending  here the edifices of such architecture seem to be elizabethan and of earlier date  a woman in stratford told us that the rooms very low on the groundfloor grew loftier from story to story to the attic  the fashion of windows in coventry is such as i have not hitherto seen  in the highest story a window of the ordinary height extends along the whole breadth of the house ten fifteen perhaps twenty feet just like any other window of a commonplace house except for this inordinate width  one does not easily see what the inhabitants want of so much windowlight but the fashion is very general and in modern houses or houses that have been modernized this style of window is retained  thus young people who grow up amidst old people contract quaint and oldfashioned manners and aspect  i imagine that these ancient townssuch as chester and stratford warwick and coventrycontain even a great deal more antiquity than meets the eye  you see many modern fronts but if you peep or penetrate inside you find an antique arrangementold rafters intricate passages and ancient staircases which have put on merely a new outside and are likely still to prove good for the usual date of a new house they put such an immense and stalwart ponderosity into their frameworks that i suppose a house of elizabeths time if renewed has at least an equal chance of durability with one that is new in every part  all the hotels in coventry so far as i noticed them are old with new fronts and they have an archway for the admission of vehicles into the courtyard and doors opening into the rooms of the building on each side of the arch  maids and waiters are seen darting across the arched passage from door to door and it requires a guide in my case at least to show you the way to the coffeeroom or the bar  i have never been up stairs in any of them but can conceive of infinite bewilderment of zigzag corridors between staircase and chamber  it was fairday in coventry and this gave what no doubt is an unusual bustle to the streets  in fact i have not seen such crowded and busy streets in any english town various kinds of merchandise being for sale in the open air and auctioneers disposing of miscellaneous wares pretty much as they do at musters and other gatherings in the united states the oratory of the american auctioneer however greatly surpasses that of the englishman in vivacity and fun  but this movement and throng together with the white glow of the sun on the pavements make the scene in my recollection assume an american aspect and this is strange in so antique and quaint a town as coventry  we rambled about without any definite aim but found our way i believe to most of the objects that are worth seeing  st michaels church was most magnificentso old yet enduring so huge so rich with such intricate minuteness in its finish that look as long as you will at it you can always discover something new directly before your eyes  i admire this in gothic architecturethat you cannot master it all at once that it is not a naked outline but as deep and rich as human nature itself always revealing new ideas  it is as if the builder had built himself and his age up into it and as if the edifice had life grecian temples are less interesting to me being so cold and crystalline  i think this is the only church i have seen where there are any statues still left standing in the niches of the exterior walls  we did not go inside  the steeple of st michaels is three hundred and three feet high and no doubt the clouds often envelop the tip of the spire  trinity another church with a tall spire stands near st michaels but did not attract me so much though i perhaps might have admired it equally had i seen it first or alone  we certainly know nothing of churchbuilding in america and of all english things that i have seen methinks the churches disappoint me least  i feel too that there is something much more wonderful in them than i have yet had time to know and experience  in the course of the forenoon searching about everywhere in quest of gothic architecture we found our way into st marys hall  the doors were wide open it seemed to be publicthere was a notice on the wall desiring visitors to give nothing to attendants for showing it and so we walked in  i observed in the guidebooks that we should have obtained an order for admission from some member of the town council but we had none and found no need of it  an old woman and afterwards an old man both of whom seemed to be at home on the premises told us that we might enter and troubled neither themselves nor us any further  st marys hall is now the property of the corporation of coventry and seems to be the place where the mayor and council hold their meetings it was built by one of the old guilds or fraternities of merchants and tradesmen  the woman shut the kitchen door when i approached so that i did not see the great fireplaces and huge cookingutensils which are said to be there  whether these are ever used nowadays and whether the mayor of coventry gives such hospitable banquets as the mayor of liverpool i do not know  we went to the red lion and had a luncheon of cold lamb and cold pigeonpie  this is the best way of dining at english hotelsto call the meal a luncheon in which case you will get as good or better a variety than if it were a dinner and at less than half the cost  having lunched we again wandered about town and entered a quadrangle of gabled houses with a church and its churchyard on one side  this proved to be st johns church and a part of the houses were the locality of bonds hospital for the reception of ten poor men and the remainder was devoted to the bablake school  into this latter i peered with a real american intrusiveness which i never found in myself before but which i must now assume or miss a great many things which i am anxious to see running along the front of the house under the jut of the impending story there was a cloistered walk with windows opening on the quadrangle  an arched oaken door with long iron hinges admitted us into a schoolroom about twenty feet square paved with brick tiles blue and red  adjoining this there is a larger schoolroom which we did not enter but peeped at through one of the inner windows from the cloistered walk  in the room which we entered there were seven scholars desks and an immense arched fireplace with seats on each side under the chimney on  a stone slab resting on a brick pedestal the opening of the fireplace was at least twelve feet in width  on one side of the room were pegs for fiftytwo boys hats and clothes and there was a boys coat of peculiar cut hanging on a peg with the number 50 in brass upon it  the coat looked ragged and shabby  an old schoolbook was lying on one of the desks much tattered and without a title but it seemed to treat wholly of saints days and festivals of the church  a flight of stairs with a heavy balustrade of carved oak ascended to a gallery about eight or nine feet from the lower floor which runs along two sides of the room looking down upon it  the room is without a ceiling and rises into a peaked gable about twenty feet high  there is a large clock in it and it is lighted by two windows each about ten feet wideone in the gallery and the other beneath it two benches or settles with backs stood one on each side of the fireplace  an old woman in black passed through the room while i was making my observations and looked at me but said nothing  the school was founded in 1563 by thomas whealby mayor of coventry the revenue is about 900 pounds and admits children of the workingclasses at eleven years old clothes and provides for them and finally apprentices them for seven years  we saw some of the boys playing in the quadrangle dressed in long blue coats or gowns with cloth caps on their heads  i know not how the atmosphere of antiquity and massive continuance from age to age which was the charm to me in this scene of a charityschoolroom can be thrown over it in description  after noting down these matters i looked into the quiet precincts of bonds hospital which no doubt was more than equally interesting but the old men were lounging about or lolling at length looking very drowsy and i had not the heart nor the face to intrude among them  there is something altogether strange to an american in these charitable institutionsin the preservation of antique modes and customs which is effected by them insomuch that doubtless without at all intending it the founders have succeeded in preserving a model of their own longpast age down into the midst of ours and how much later nobody can know  we were now rather tired and went to the railroad intending to go home but we got into the wrong train and were carried by express with hurricane speed to bradon where we alighted and waited a good while for the return train to coventry  at coventry again we had more than an hour to wait and therefore wandered wearily up into the city and took another look at its bustling streets in which there seems to be a good emblem of what england itself really iswith a great deal of antiquity in it and which is now chiefly a modification of the old  the new things are based and supported on the sturdy old things and often limited and impeded by them but this antiquity is so massive that there seems to be no means of getting rid of it without tearing society to pieces   july 2dtoday i shall set out on my return to liverpool leaving my family here    to the lakes   july 4thi left leamington on monday shortly after twelve having been accompanied to the railway station by u and j whom i sent away before the train started  while i was waiting a rather gentlemanly welltodo englishlooking man sat down by me and began to talk of the crimea of human affairs in general of god and his providence of the coming troubles of the world and of spiritualism in a strange free way for an englishman or indeed for any man  it was easy to see that he was an enthusiast of some line or other  he being bound for birmingham and i for rugby we soon had to part but he asked my name and told me his own which i did not much attend to and immediately forgot  here follows a long account of a visit to lichfield and uttoxeter condensed in our old home   july 6ththe day after my arrival by way of lichfield and uttoxeter at liverpool the door of the consulate opened and in came the very sociable personage who accosted me at the railway station at leamington he was on his way towards edinburgh to deliver a course of lectures or a lecture and had called he said to talk with me about spiritualism being desirous of having the judgment of a sincere mind on the subject in his own mind i should suppose he is past the stage of doubt and inquiry for he told me that in every action of his life he is governed by the counsels received from the spiritual world through a medium  i did not inquire whether this medium who is a small boy had suggested his visit to me  my remarks to him were quite of a sceptical character in regard to the faith to which he had surrendered himself  he has formerly lived in america and had had a son born there  he gave me a pamphlet written by himself on the cure of consumption and other diseases by antiseptic remedies  i hope he will not bore me any more though he seems to be a very sincere and good man but these enthusiasts who adopt such extravagant ideas appear to one to lack imagination instead of being misled by it as they are generally supposed to be    newby bridgefoot of windermere   july 13thi left liverpool on saturday last by the london and northwestern railway for leamington spent sunday there and started on monday for the english lakes with the whole family  we should not have taken this journey just now but i had an official engagement which it was convenient to combine with a pleasureexcursion  the first night we arrived at chester and put up at the albion hotel where we found ourselves very comfortable  we took the rail at twelve the next day and went as far as milnethorpe station where we engaged seats in an oldfashioned stagecoach and came to newby bridge  i suppose there are not many of these coaches now running on any road in great britain but this appears to be the genuine machine in all respects and especially in the round ruddy coachman well moistened with ale goodnatured courteous and with a proper sense of his dignity and important position u j and i mounted atop s nurse and r got inside and we bowled off merrily towards the hearts of the hills  it was more than half past nine when we arrived at newby bridge and alighted at the swan hotel where we now are  it is a very agreeable place not striking as to scenery but with a pleasant rural aspect  a stone bridge of five arches crosses the river severn which is the communication between windermere lake and morecambe bay close to the house which sits lowand well sheltered in the lap of hillsan oldfashioned inn where the landlord and his people have a simple and friendly way of dealing with their guests and yet provide them with all sorts of facilities for being comfortable  they load our supper and breakfast tables with trout cold beef ham toast and muffins and give us three fair courses for dinner and excellent wine the cost of all which remains to be seen  this is not one of the celebrated stations among the lakes but twice a day the stagecoach passes from milnethorpe towards ulverton and twice returns and three times a little steamer passes to and fro between our hotel and the head of the lake  young ladies in broadbrimmed hats stroll about or row on the river in the light shallops of which there are abundance sportsmen sit on the benches under the windows of the hotel arranging their fishingtackle phaetons and postchaises with postilions in scarlet jackets and white breeches with one hightopped boot and the other leathered far up on the leg to guard against friction between the horses dash up to the door  morning and night comes the stagecoach and we inspect the outside passengers almost face to face with us from our parlorwindows up one pair of stairs  little boys and j among them spend hours on hours fishing in the clear shallow river for the perch chubs and minnows that may be seen flashing like gleams of light over the flat stones with which the bottom is paved  i cannot answer for the other boys but j catches nothing  there are a good many trees on the hills and roundabout and pleasant roads loitering along by the gentle riverside and it has been so sunny and warm since we came here that we shall have quite a genial recollection of the place if we leave it before the skies have time to frown  the day after we came we climbed a high and pretty steep hill through a path shadowed with trees and shrubbery up to a tower from the summit of which we had a wide view of mountain scenery and the greater part of windermere  this lake is a lovely little pool among the hills long and narrow beautifully indented with tiny bays and headlands and when we saw it it was one smile as broad a smile as its narrowness allowed with really brilliant sunshine  all the scenery we have yet met with is in excellent taste and keeps itself within very proper bounds never getting too wild and rugged to shock the sensibilities of cultivated people as american scenery is apt to do  on the rudest surface of english earth there is seen the effect of centuries of civilization so that you do not quite get at naked nature anywhere  and then every point of beauty is so well known and has been described so much that one must needs look through other peoples eyes and feels as if he were seeing a picture rather than a reality  man has in short entire possession of nature here and i should think young men might sometimes yearn for a fresher draught  but an american likes it    furness abbey   yesterday july 12th we took a phaeton and went to furness abbeya drive of about sixteen miles passing along the course of the leam to morecambe bay and through ulverton and other villages  these villages all look antique and the smallest of them generally are formed of such close contiguous clusters of houses and have such narrow and crooked streets that they give you an idea of a metropolis in miniature  the houses along the road of which there are not many except in the villages are almost invariably old built of stone and covered with a light gray plaster generally they have a little flowergarden in front and often honeysuckles roses or some other sweet and pretty rustic adornment are flowering over the porch  i have hardly had such images of simple quiet rustic comfort and beauty as from the look of these houses and the whole impression of our winding and undulating road bordered by hedges luxuriantly green and not too closely clipped accords with this aspect  there is nothing arid in an english landscape and one cannot but fancy that the same may be true of english rural life the people look wholesome and welltodonot specimens of hard dry sunburnt muscle like our yeomenand are kind and civil to strangers sometimes making a little inclination of the head in passing  miss martineau however does not seem to think well of their mental and moral condition  we reached furness abbey about twelve  there is a railway station close by the ruins and a new hotel stands within the precincts of the abbey grounds and continually there is the shriek the whiz the rumble the bellringing denoting the arrival of the trains and passengers alight and step at once as their choice may be into the refreshmentroom to get a glass of ale or a cigaror upon the gravelled paths of the lawn leading to the old broken walls and arches of the abbey  the ruins are extensive and the enclosure of the abbey is stated to have covered a space of sixtyfive acres  it is impossible to describe them  the most interesting part is that which was formerly the church and which though now roofless is still surrounded by walls and retains the remnants of the pillars that formerly supported the intermingling curves of the arches  the floor is all overgrown with grass strewn with fragments and capitals of pillars  it was a great and stately edifice the length of the nave and choir having been nearly three hundred feet and that of the transept more than half as much  the pillars along the nave were alternately a round solid one and a clustered one  now what remains of some of them is even with the ground others present a stump just high enough to form a seat and others are perhaps a mans height from the groundand all are mossy and with grass and weeds rooted into their chinks and here and there a tuft of flowers giving its tender little beauty to their decay  the material of the edifice is a soft red stone and it is now extensively overgrown with a lichen of a very light gray line which at a little distance makes the walls look as if they had long ago been whitewashed and now had partially returned to their original color  the arches of the nave and transept were noble and immense there were four of them together supporting a tower which has long since disappearedarches loftier than i ever conceived to have been made by man  very possibly in some cathedral that i have seen or am yet to see there may be arches as stately as these but i doubt whether they can ever show to such advantage in a perfect edifice as they do in this ruinmost of them broken only one as far as i recollect still completing its sweep  in this state they suggest a greater majesty and beauty than any finished human work can show the crumbling traces of the halfobliterated design producing somewhat of the effect of the first idea of anything admirable when it dawns upon the mind of an artist or a poetan idea which do what he may he is sure to fall short of in his attempt to embody it  in the middle of the choir is a muchdilapidated monument of a crosslegged knight a crusader of course in armor very rudely executed and against the wall lie two or three more bruised and battered warriors with square helmets on their heads and visors down nothing can be uglier than these figures the sculpture of those days seems to have been far behind the architecture  and yet they knew how to put a grotesque expression into the faces of their images and we saw some fantastic shapes and heads at the lower points of arches which would do to copy into punch  in the chancel just at the point below where the high altar stands was the burialplace of the old barons of kendal  the broken crusader perhaps represents one of them and some of their stalwart bones might be found by digging down  against the wall of the choir near the vacant space where the altar was are some stone seats with canopies richly carved in stone all quite perfectly preserved where the priests used to sit at intervals during the celebration of mass  conceive all these shattered walls with here and there an arched door or the great arched vacancy of a window these broken stones and monuments scattered about these rows of pillars up and down the nave these arches through which a giant might have stepped and not needed to bow his head unless in reverence to the sanctity of the placeconceive it all with such verdure and embroidery of flowers as the gentle kindly moisture of the english climate procreates on all old things making them more beautiful than newconceive it with the grass for sole pavement of the long and spacious aisle and the sky above for the only roof  the sky to be sure is more majestic than the tallest of those arches and yet these latter perhaps make the stronger impression of sublimity because they translate the sweep of the sky to our finite comprehension it was a most beautiful warm sunny day and the ruins had all the pictorial advantage of bright light and deep shadows  i must not forget that birds flew in and out among the recesses and chirped and warbled and made themselves at home there  doubtless the birds of the present generation are the posterity of those who first settled in the ruins after the reformation and perhaps the old monks of a still earlier day may have watched them building about the abbey before it was a ruin at all  we had an old description of the place with us aided by which we traced out the principal part of the edifice such as the church as already mentioned and contiguous to this the chapterhouse which is better preserved than the church also the kitchen and the room where the monks met to talk and the range of wall where their cells probably were  i never before had given myself the trouble to form any distinct idea of what an abbey or monastery wasa place where holy rites were daily and continually to be performed with places to eat and sleep contiguous and convenient in order that the monks might always be at hand to perform those rites  they lived only to worship and therefore lived under the same roof with their place of worship which of course was the principal object in the edifice and hallowed the whole of it  we found too at one end of the ruins what is supposed to have been a schoolhouse for the children of the tenantry or villeins of the abbey all round this room is a bench of stone against the wall and the pedestal also of the masters seat  there are likewise the ruins of the mill and the millstream which is just as new as ever it was still goes murmuring and babbling and passes under two or three old bridges consisting of a low gray arch overgrown with grass and shrubbery  that stream was the most fleeting and vanishing thing about the ponderous and highpiled abbey and yet it has outlasted everything else and might still outlast another such edifice and be none the worse for wear  there is not a great deal of ivy upon the walls and though an ivied wall is a beautiful object yet it is better not to have too muchelse it is but one wall of unbroken verdure on which you can see none of the sculptural ornaments nor any of the hieroglyphics of time  a sweep of ivy here and there with the gray wall everywhere showing through makes the better picture and i think that nothing is so effective as the little bunches of flowers a mere handful that grow in spots where the seeds have been carried by the wind ages ago  i have made a miserable botch of this description it is no description but merely an attempt to preserve something of the impression it made on me and in this i do not seem to have succeeded at all  i liked the contrast between the sombreness of the old walls and the sunshine falling through them and gladdening the grass that floored the aisles also i liked the effect of so many idle and cheerful people strolling into the haunts of the dead monks and going babbling about and peering into the dark nooks and listening to catch some idea of what the building was from a clericallooking personage who was explaining it to a party of his friends  i dont know how well acquainted this gentleman might be with the subject but he seemed anxious not to impart his knowledge too extensively and gave a pretty direct rebuff to an honest man who ventured an inquiry of him  i think that the railway and the hotel within the abbey grounds add to the charm of the place  a moonlight solitary visit might be very good too in its way but i believe that one great charm and beauty of antiquity is that we view it out of the midst of quite another mode of life and the more perfectly this can be done the better  it can never be done more perfectly than at furness abbey which is in itself a very sombre scene and stands moreover in the midst of a melancholy valley the saxon name of which means the vale of the deadly nightshade  the entrance to the stableyard of the hotel is beneath a pointed arch of saxon architecture and on one side of this stands an old building looking like a chapel but which may have been a porters lodge  the abbots residence was in this quarter and the clerical personage before alluded to spoke of these as the oldest part of the ruins  about half a mile on the hither side of the abbey stands the village of dalton in which is a castle built on a roman foundation and which was afterwards used by the abbots in their capacity of feudal lords as a prison  the abbey was founded about 1027 by king stephen before he came to the throne and the faces of himself and of his queen are still to be seen on one of the walls  we had a very agreeable drive home our drive hither had been uncomfortably sunny and hot and we stopped at ulverton to buy a pair of shoes for j and some drawingbooks and stationery  as we passed through the little town in the morning it was all alive with the bustle and throng of the weekly market and though this had ceased on our return the streets still looked animated because the heat of the day drew most of the population i should imagine out of doors  old men look very antiquated here in their oldfashioned coats and breeches sunning themselves by the wayside  we reached home somewhere about eight oclockhome i see i have called it and it seems as homelike a spot as any we have found in englandthe old inn close by the bridge beside the clear river pleasantly overshadowed by trees  it is entirely english and like nothing that one sees in america and yet  i feel as if i might have lived here a long while ago and had now come back because i retained pleasant recollections of it  the children too make themselves at home  j spends his time from morning to night fishing for minnows or trout and catching nothing at all and u and r have been riding between fields and barn in a haycart  the roads give us beautiful walks along the riverside or wind away among the gentle hills and if we had nothing else to look at in these walks the hedges and stone fences would afford interest enough so many and pretty are the flowers roses honeysuckles and other sweet things and so abundantly does the moss and ivy grow among the old stones of the fences which would never have a single shoot of vegetation on them in america till the very end of time but here no sooner is a stone fence built than nature sets to work to make it a part of herself  she adopts it and adorns it as if it were her own child  a little sprig of ivy may be seen creeping up the side and clinging fast with its many feet a tuft of grass roots itself between two of the stones where a little dust from the road has been moistened into soil for it a small bunch of fern grows in another such crevice a deep soft green moss spreads itself over the top and all along the sides of the fence and wherever nothing else will grow lichens adhere to the stones and variegate their lines  finally a great deal of shrubbery is sure to cluster along its extent and take away all hardness from the outline and so the whole stone fence looks as if god had had at least as much to do with it as man  the trunks of the trees too exhibit a similar parasitical vegetation  parasitical is an unkind phrase to bestow on this beautiful love and kindness which seems to exist here between one plant and another the strong thingbeing always ready to give support and sustenance and the weak thing to repay with beauty so that both are the richeras in the case of ivy and woodbine clustering up the trunk of a tall tree and adding corinthian grace to its lofty beauty  mr w our landlord has lent us a splendid work with engravings illustrating the antiquities of furness abbey  i gather from it that the hotel must have been rebuilt or repaired from an old manorhouse which was itself erected by a family of prestons after the reformation and was a renewal from the abbots residence  much of the edifice probably as it exists now may have been part of the original one and there are basreliefs of scripture subjects sculptured in stone and fixed in the wall of the diningroom which have been there since the abbots time this author thinks that what we had supposed to be the schoolhouse on the authority of an old book was really the building for the reception of guests with its chapel  he says that the tall arches in the church are sixty feet high  the earl of burlington i believe is the present proprietor of the abbey    the lakes   july 16thon saturday we left newby bridge and came by steamboat up windermere lake to lowwood hotel where we now are  the foot of the lake is just above newby bridge and it widens from that point but never to such a breadth that objects are not pretty distinctly visible from shore to shore  the steamer stops at two or three places in the course of its voyage the principal one being bowness which has a little bustle and air of business about it proper to the principal port of the lake  there are several small yachts and many skiffs rowing about  the banks are everywhere beautiful and the water in one portion is strewn with islands few of which are large enough to be inhabitable but they all seem to be appropriated and kept in the neatest order  as yet i have seen no wildness everything is perfectly subdued and polished and imbued with human taste except indeed the outlines of the hills which continue very much the same as god made them  as we approached the head of the lake the congregation of great hills in the distance became very striking  the shapes of these english mountains are certainly far more picturesque than those which i have seen in eastern america where their summits are almost invariably rounded as i remember them  they are great hillocks great bunches of earth similar to one another in their developments  here they have variety of shape rising into peaks falling in abrupt precipices stretching along in zigzag outlines and thus making the most of their not very gigantic masses and producing a remarkable effect  we arrived at the lowwood hotel which is very near the head of the lake not long after two oclock  it stands almost on the shore of windermere with only a green lawn betweenan extensive hotel covering a good deal of ground but low and rather villageinnlike than lofty  we found the house so crowded as to afford us no very comfortable accommodations either as to parlor or sleepingrooms and we find nothing like the homefeeling into which we at once settled down at newby bridge  there is a very pretty vicinity and a fine view of mountains to the northwest sitting together in a family group sometimes in full sunshine sometimes with only a golden gleam on one or two of them sometimes all in a veil of cloud from which here and there a great dusky head raises itself while you are looking at a dim obscurity  nearer there are high green slopes well wooded but with such decent and wellbehaved wood as you perceive has grown up under the care of man still no wildness no ruggednessas how should there be when every halfmile or so a porters lodge or a gentlemans gateway indicates that the whole region is used up for villas  on the opposite shore of the lake there is a mimic castle which i suppose i might have mistaken for a real one two years ago  it is a great foolish toy of gray stone  a steamboat comes to the pier as many as six times a day and stagecoaches and omnibuses stop at the door still oftener communicating with ambleside and the town of windermere and with the railway which opens london and all the world to us  we get no knowledge of our fellowguests all of whom like ourselves live in their own circles and are just as remote from us as if the lake lay between  the only words i have spoken since arriving here have been to my own family or to a waiter save to one or two young pedestrians who met me on a walk and asked me the distance to lowwood hotel  just beyond here said i and i might stay for months without occasion to speak again  yesterday forenoon j and i walked to amblesidedistant barely two miles  it is a little town chiefly of modern aspect built on a very uneven hillside and with very irregular streets and lanes which bewilder the stranger as much as those of a larger city  many of the houses look old and are probably the cottages and farmhouses which composed the rude village a century ago but there are stuccoed shops and dwellings such as may have been built within a year or two and three hotels one of which has the look of a good old village inn and the others are fashionable or commercial establishments  through the midst of the village comes tumbling and rumbling a mountain streamlet rushing through a deep rocky dell gliding under an old stone inch and turning when occasion calls the great block of a watermill  this is the only very striking feature of the villagethe stream taking its rough pathway to the lake as it used to do before the poets had made this region fashionable  in the evening just before eight oclock i took a walk alone by a road which goes up the hill back of our hotel and which i supposed might be the road to the town of windermere  but it went up higher and higher and for the mile or two that it led me along winding up i saw no traces of a town but at last it turned into a valley between two high ridges leading quite away from the lake within view of which the town of windermere is situated  it was a very lonely road though as smooth hard and well kept as any thoroughfare in the suburbs of a city hardly a dwelling on either side except one half barn half farmhouse and one gentlemans gateway near the beginning of the road and another more than a mile above  at two or three points there were stone barns which are here built with great solidity  at one place there was a painted board announcing that a field of five acres was to be sold and referring those desirous of purchasing to a solicitor in london  the lake country is but a london suburb  nevertheless the walk was lonely and lovely the copses and the broad hillside the glimpses of the lake the great misty company of pikes and fells beguiled me into a sense of something like solitude and the bleating of the sheep remote and near had a like tendency  gaining the summit of the hill i had the best view of windermere which i have yet attainedthe best i should think that can be had though being towards the south it brings the softer instead of the more striking features of the landscape into view  but it shows nearly the whole extent of the lake all the way from lowwood beyond newby bridge and i think there can hardly be anything more beautiful in the world  the water was like a strip and gleam of sky fitly set among lovely slopes of earth  it was no broader than many a river and yet you saw at once that it could be no river its outline being so different from that of a running stream not straight nor winding but stretching to one side or the other as the shores made room for it  this morning it is raining and we are not very comfortable nor contented being all confined to our little parlor which has a broken window against which i have pinned the times to keep out the chill damp air  u has been ill in consequence of having been overheated at newby bridge  we have no books except guidebooks no means of amusement nothing to do  there are no newspapers and i shall remember lowwood not very agreeably  as far as we are concerned it is a scrambling illordered hotel with insufficient attendance wretched sleepingaccommodations a pretty fair table but germansilver forks and spoons our food does not taste very good and yet there is really no definite fault to be found with it  since writing the above i have found the first volume of sir charles grandison and two of g p r jamess works in the coffeeroom  the days pass heavily here and leave behind them a sense of having answered no very good purpose  they are long enough at all events for the sun does not set till after eight oclock and rises i know not when  one of the most remarkable distinctions between england and the united states is the ignorance into which we fall of whatever is going on in the world the moment we get away from the great thoroughfares and centres of life  in leamington we heard no news from weeks end to weeks end and knew not where to find a newspaper and here the case is neither better nor worse the rural people really seem to take no interest in public affairs at all events they have no intelligence on such subjects  it is possible that the cheap newspapers may in time find their way into the cottages or at least into the country taverns but it is not at all so now  if they generally know that sebastopol is besieged it is the extent of their knowledge  the public life of america is lived through the mind and heart of every man in it here the people feel that they have nothing to do with what is going forward and i suspect care little or nothing about it  such things they permit to be the exclusive concern of the higher classes  in front of our hotel on the lawn between us and the lake there are two trees which we have hitherto taken to be yews but on examining them more closely i find that they are pinetrees and quite dead and dry although they have the aspect of dark rich life  but this is caused by the verdure of two great ivyvines which have twisted round them like gigantic snakes and clambering up and throttling the life out of them have put out branches and made crowns of thick green leaves so that at a little distance it is quite impossible not to take them for genuine trees  the trunks of the ivyvines must be more than a foot in circumference and one feels they have stolen the life that belonged to the pines  the dead branches of one of the pines stick out horizontally through the ivyboughs  the other shows nothing but the ivy and in shape a good deal resembles a poplar  when the pine trunks shall have quite crumbled away the ivystems will doubtless have gained sufficient strength to sustain themselves independently   july 19thyesterday s went down the lake in the steamboat to take u baby and nurse to newby bridge while the three rest of us should make a tour through the lake region  after mammas departure and when i had finished some letters j and i set out on a walk which finally brought us to bowness through much delightful shade of woods and past beautiful rivulets or brooklets and up and down many hills  this chief harbor of the lakes seemed alive and bustling with tourists it being a sunny and pleasant day so that they were all abroad like summer insects  the town is a confused and irregular little place of very uneven surface  there is an old church in it and two or three large hotels  we stayed there perhaps half an hour and then went to the pier where shortly a steamer arrived with music soundingon the deck of which with her back to us sat a lady in a gray travellingdress j cried out mamma mamma to which the lady deigned no notice but he repeating it she turned round and was as much surprised no doubt to see her husband and son as if this little lake had been the great ocean and we meeting each other from opposite shores of it  we soon steamed back to lowwood and took a car thence for rydal and grasmere after a cold luncheon  at bowness i met miss charlotte cushman who has been staying at the lowwood hotel with us since monday without either party being aware of it  our road to rydal lay through ambleside which is certainly a very pretty town and looks cheerfully in a sunny day  we saw miss martineaus residence called the knoll standing high up on a hillock and having at its foot a methodist chapel for which or whatever place of christian worship this good lady can have no occasion  we stopped a moment in the street below her house and deliberated a little whether to call on her but concluded we would not  after leaving ambleside the road winds in and out among the hills and soon brings us to a sheet or napkin rather than a sheet of water which the driver tells us is rydal lake  we had already heard that it was but three quarters of a mile long and one quarter broad still it being an idea of considerable size in our minds we had inevitably drawn its ideal physical proportions on a somewhat corresponding scale  it certainly did look very small and i said in my american scorn that i could carry it away easily in a porringer for it is nothing more than a grassbordered pool among the surrounding hills which ascend directly from its margin so that one might fancy it not a permanent body of water but a rather extensive accumulation of recent rain  moreover it was rippled with a breeze and so as i remember it though the sun shone it looked dull and sulky like a child out of humor  now the best thing these small ponds can do is to keep perfectly calm and smooth and not attempt to show off any airs of their own but content themselves with serving as a mirror for whatever of beautiful or picturesque there may be in the scenery around them  the hills about rydal water are not very lofty but are sufficiently so as objects of everyday view objects to live with and they are craggier than those we have hitherto seen and bare of wood which indeed would hardly grow on some of their precipitous sides  on the roadside as we reach the foot of the lake stands a spruce and rather large house of modern aspect but with several gables and much overgrown with ivya very pretty and comfortable house built adorned and cared for with commendable taste  we inquired whose it was and the coachman said it was mr wordsworths and that mrs wordsworth was still residing there  so we were much delighted to have seen his abode and as we were to stay the night at grasmere about two miles farther on we determined to come back and inspect it as particularly as should be allowable  accordingly after taking rooms at browns hotel we drove back in our return car and reaching the head of rydal water alighted to walk through this familiar scene of so many years of wordsworths life  we ought to have seen de quinceys former residence and hartley coleridges cottage i believe on our way but were not aware of it at the time  near the lake there is a stonequarry and a cavern of some extent artificially formed probably by taking out the stone  above the shore of the lake not a great way from wordsworths residence there is a flight of steps hewn in a rock and ascending to a rock seat where a good view of the lake may be attained and as wordsworth has doubtless sat there hundreds of times so did we ascend and sit down and look at the hills and at the flags on the lakes shore  reaching the house that had been pointed out to us as wordsworths residence we began to peer about at its front and gables and over the garden wall on both sides of the road quickening our enthusiasm as much as we could and meditating to pilfer some flower or ivyleaf from the house or its vicinity to be kept as sacred memorials  at this juncture a man approached who announced himself as the gardener of the place and said too that this was not wordsworths house at all but the residence of mr ball a quaker gentleman but that his ground adjoined wordsworths and that he had liberty to take visitors through the latter  how absurd it would have been if we had carried away ivyleaves and tender recollections from this domicile of a respectable quaker  the gardener was an intelligent man of pleasant sociable and respectful address and as we went along he talked about the poet whom he had known and who he said was very familiar with the country people  he led us through mr balls grounds up a steep hillside by winding gravelled walks with summerhouses at points favorable for them  it was a very shady and pleasant spot containing about an acre of ground and all turned to good account by the manner of laying it out so that it seemed more than it really is  in one place on a small smooth slab of slate let into a rock there is an inscription by wordsworth which i think i have read in his works claiming kindly regards from those who visit the spot after his departure because many trees had been spared at his intercession  his own grounds or rather his ornamental garden is separated from mr balls only by a wire fence or some such barrier and the gates have no fastening so that the whole appears like one possession and doubtless was so as regarded the poets walks and enjoyments  we approached by paths so winding that i hardly know how the house stands in relation to the road but after much circuity we really did see wordsworths residencean old house with an uneven ridgepole built of stone no doubt but plastered over with some neutral tinta house that would not have been remarkably pretty in itself but so delightfully situated so secluded so hedged about with shrubbery and adorned with flowers so ivygrown on one side so beautified with the personal care of him who lived in it and loved it that it seemed the very place for a poets residence and as if while he lived so long in it his poetry had manifested itself in flowers shrubbery and ivy  i never smelt such a delightful fragrance of flowers as there was all through the garden  in front of the house there is a circular terrace of two ascents in raising which wordsworth had himself performed much of the labor and here there are seats from which we obtained a fine view down the valley of the rothay with windermere in the distancea view of several miles and which we did not suppose could be seen after winding among the hills so far from the lake  it is very beautiful and picturelike  while we sat here s happened to refer to the ballad of little barbara lewthwaite and j began to repeat the poem concerning her and the gardener said that little barbara had died not a great while ago an elderly woman leaving grownup children behind her  her marriagename was thompson and the gardener believed there was nothing remarkable in her character  there is a summerhouse at one extremity of the grounds in deepest shadow but with glimpses of mountain views through trees which shut it in and which have spread intercepting boughs since wordsworth died  it is lined with pinecones in a pretty way enough but of doubtful taste i rather wonder that people of real taste should help nature out and beautify her or perhaps rather prettify her so much as they doopening vistas showing one thing hiding another making a scene picturesque whether or no  i cannot rid myself of the feeling that there is something falsea kind of humbugin all this  at any rate the traces of it do not contribute to my enjoyment and indeed it ought to be done so exquisitely as to leave no trace  but i ought not to criticise in any way a spot which gave me so much pleasure and where it is good to think of wordsworth in quiet past days walking in his homeshadow of trees which he knew and training flowers and trimming shrubs and chanting in an undertone his own verses up and down the winding walks  the gardener gave j a cone from the summerhouse which had fallen on the seat and s got some mignonette and leaves of laurel and ivy and we wended our way back to the hotel  wordsworth was not the owner of this house it being the property of lady fleming  mrs wordsworth still lives there and is now at home  five oclockall day it has been cloudy and showery with thunder now and then the mists hang low on the surrounding hills adown which at various points we can see the snowwhite fall of little streamlets forces they call them here swollen by the rain  an overcast day is not so gloomy in the hillcountry as in the lowlands there are more breaks more transfusion of skylight through the gloom as has been the case today and as i found in lenox we get better acquainted with clouds by seeing at what height they be on the hillsides and find that the difference betwixt a fair day and a cloudy and rainy one is very superficial after all  nevertheless rain is rain and wets a man just as much among the mountains as anywhere else so we have been kept within doors all day till an hour or so ago when j and i went down to the village in quest of the postoffice  we took a path that leads from the hotel across the fields and coming into a wood crosses the rothay by a onearched bridge and passes the village church  the rothay is very swift and turbulent today and hurries along with foamspecks on its surface filling its banks from brim to brima stream perhaps twenty feet wide perhaps more for i am willing that the good little river should have all it can fairly claim it is the st lawrence of several of these english lakes through which it flows and carries off their superfluous waters  in its haste and with its rushing sound it was pleasant both to see and hear and it sweeps by one side of the old churchyard where wordsworth lies buried the side where his grave is made  the church of grasmere is a very plain structure with a low body on one side of which is a small porch with a pointed arch  the tower is square and looks ancient but the whole is overlaid with plaster of a buff or pale yellow hue  it was originally built i suppose of rough shingly stones as many of the houses hereabouts are now and like many of them the plaster is used to give a finish  we found the gate of the churchyard wide open and the grass was lying on the graves having probably been mowed yesterday  it is but a small churchyard and with few monuments of any pretension in it most of them being slate headstones standing erect  from the gate at which we entered a distinct foottrack leads to the corner nearest the riverside and i turned into it by a sort of instinct the more readily as i saw a touristlooking man approaching from that point and a woman looking among the gravestones  both of these persons had gone by the time i came up so that j and i were left to find wordsworths grave all by ourselves  at this corner of the churchyard there is a hawthorn bush or tree the extremest branches of which stretch as far as where wordsworth lies this whole corner seems to be devoted to himself and his family and friends and they all lie very closely together side by side and head to foot as room could conveniently be found  hartley coleridge lies a little behind in the direction of the church his feet being towards wordsworths head who lies in the row of those of his own blood  i found out hartley coleridges grave sooner than wordsworths for it is of marble and though simple enough has more of sculptured device about it having been erected as i think the inscription states by his brother and sister  wordsworth has only the very simplest slab of slate with william wordsworth and nothing else upon it  as i recollect it it is the midmost grave of the row  it is or has been well grassgrown but the grass is quite worn away from the top though sufficiently luxuriant at the sides  it looks as if people had stood upon it and so does the grave next to it which i believe is one of his children  i plucked some grass and weeds from it and as he was buried within so few years they may fairly be supposed to have drawn their nutriment from his mortal remains and i gathered them from just above his head  there is no fault to be found with his gravewithin view of the hills within sound of the river murmuring near byno fault except that he is crowded so closely with his kindred and moreover that being so old a churchyard the earth over him must all have been human once  he might have had fresh earth to himself but he chose this grave deliberately no very stately and broadbased monument can ever be erected over it without infringing upon covering and overshadowing the graves not only of his family but of individuals who probably were quite disconnected with him  but it is pleasant to think and knowwere it but on the evidence of this choice of a restingplacethat he did not care for a stately monument  after leaving the churchyard we wandered about in quest of the postoffice and for a long time without success  this little town of grasmere seems to me as pretty a place as ever i met with in my life  it is quite shut in by hills that rise up immediately around it like a neighborhood of kindly giants  these hills descend steeply to the verge of the level on which the village stands and there they terminate at once the whole site of the little town being as even as a floor  i call it a village but it is no village at allall the dwellings standing apart each in its own little domain and each i believe with its own little lane leading to it independently of the rest  most of these are old cottages plastered white with antique porches and roses and other vines trained against them and shrubbery growing about them and some are covered with ivy  there are a few edifices of more pretension and of modern build but not so strikingly so as to put the rest out of countenance  the postoffice when we found it proved to be an ivied cottage with a good deal of shrubbery round it having its own pathway like the other cottages  the whole looks like a real seclusion shut out from the great world by these encircling hills on the sides of which whenever they are not too steep you see the division lines of property and tokens of cultivationtaking from them their pretensions to savage majesty but bringing them nearer to the heart of man  since writing the above i have been again with s to see wordsworths grave and finding the door of the church open we went in a woman and little girl were sweeping at the farther end and the woman came towards us out of the cloud of dust which she had raised  we were surprised at the extremely antique appearance of the church  it is paved with bluishgray flagstones over which uncounted generations have trodden leaving the floor as well laid as ever  the walls are very thick and the arched windows open through them at a considerable distance above the floor  there is no middle aisle but first a row of pews next either wall and then an aisle on each side of the pews occupying the centre of the churchthen two side aisles but no middle one  and down through the centre or the church runs a row of five arches very rude and roundheaded all of rough stone supported by rough and massive pillars or rather square stone blocks which stand in the pews and stood in the same places probably long before the wood of those pews began to grow above this row of arches is another row built upon the same mass of stone and almost as broad but lower and on this upper row rests the framework the oaken beams the black skeleton of the roof  it is a very clumsy contrivance for supporting the roof and if it were modern we certainly should condemn it as very ugly but being the relic of a simple age it comes in well with the antique simplicity of the whole structure the roof goes up barnlike into its natural angle and all the rafters and crossbeams are visible  there is an old font and in the chancel is a niche where judging from a similar one in furness abbey the holy water used to be placed for the priests use while celebrating mass  around the inside of the porch is a stone bench against the wall narrow and uneasy but where a great many people had sat who now have found quieter restingplaces  the woman was a very intelligentlooking person not of the usual english ruddiness but rather thin and somewhat pale though bright of aspect her way of talking was very agreeable  she inquired if we wished to see wordsworths monument and at once showed it to usa slab of white marble fixed against the upper end of the central row of stone arches with a pretty long inscription and a profile bust in basrelief of his aged countenance  the monument is placed directly over wordsworths pew and could best be seen and read from the very corner seat where he used to sit  the pew is one of those occupying the centre of the church and is just across the aisle from the pulpit and is the best of all for the purpose of seeing and hearing the clergyman and likewise as convenient as any from its neighborhood to the altar  on the other side of the aisle beneath the pulpit is lady flemings pew  this and one or two others are curtained wordsworths was not  i think i can bring up his image in that corner seat of his pewa whiteheaded tall spare man plain in aspectbetter than in any other situation  the woman said that she had known him very well and that he had made some verses on a sister of hers  she repeated the first lines something about a lamb but neither s nor i remembered them  on the walls of the chancel there are monuments to the flemings and painted escutcheons of their arms and along the side walls also and on the square pillars of the row of arches there are other monuments generally of white marble with the letters of the inscription blackened on these pillars likewise and in many places in the walls were hung verses from scripture painted on boards  at one of the doors was a poorboxan elaborately carved little box of oak with the date 1648 and the name of the churchst oswaldsupon it  the whole interior of the edifice was plain simple almost to grimnessor would have been so only that the foolish churchwardens or other authority have washed it over with the same buff color with which they have overlaid the exterior  it is a pity it lightens it up and desecrates it greatly especially as the woman says that there were formerly paintings on the walls now obliterated forever  i could have stayed in the old church much longer and could write much more about it but there must be an end to everything  pacing it from the farther end to the elevation before the altar i found that it was twentyfive paces long  on looking again at the rothay i find i did it some injustice for at the bridge in its present swollen state it is nearer twenty yards than twenty feet across  its waters are very clear and it rushes along with a speed which is delightful to see after an acquaintance with the muddy and sluggish avon and leam  since tea i have taken a stroll from the hotel in a different direction from heretofore and passed the swan inn where scott used to go daily to get a draught of liquor when he was visiting wordsworth who had no wine nor other inspiriting fluid in his house  it stands directly on the waysidea small whitewashed house with an addition in the rear that seems to have been built since scotts time  on the door is the painted sign of a swan and the name scotts swan hotel  i walked a considerable distance beyond it but a shower cooling up i turned back entered the inn and following the mistress into a snug little room was served with a glass of bitter ale  it is a very plain and homely inn and certainly could not have satisfied scotts wants if he had required anything very farfetched or delicate in his potations  i found two westmoreland peasants in the room with ale before them  one went away almost immediately but the other remained and entering into conversation with him he told me that he was going to new zealand and expected to sail in september  i announced myself as an american and he said that a large party had lately gone from hereabouts to america but he seemed not to understand that there was any distinction between canada and the states  these people had gone to quebec  he was a very civil wellbehaved kindly sort of person of a simple character which i took to belong to the class and locality rather than to himself individually i could not very well understand all that he said owing to his provincial dialect and when he spoke to his own countrymen or to the women of the house i really could but just catch a word here and there how long it takes to melt english down into a homogeneous mass  he told me that there was a public library in grasmere to which he has access in common with the other inhabitants and a readingroom connected with it where he reads the times in the evening  there was no american smartness in his mind  when i left the house it was showering briskly but the drops quite ceased and the clouds began to break away before i reached my hotel and i saw the new moon over my right shoulder   july 21stwe left grasmere yesterday after breakfast it being a delightful morning with some clouds but the cheerfullest sunshine on great part of the mountainsides and on ourselves  we returned in the first place to ambleside along the border of grasmere lake which would be a pretty little piece of water with its steep and high surrounding hills were it not that a stubborn and straightlined stone fence running along the eastern shore by the roadside quite spoils its appearance  rydal water though nothing can make a lake of it looked prettier and less diminutive than at the first view and in fact i find that it is impossible to know accurately how any prospect or other thing looks until after at least a second view which always essentially corrects the first  this i think is especially true in regard to objects which we have heard much about and exercised our imagination upon the first view being a vain attempt to reconcile our idea with the reality and at the second we begin to accept the thing for what it really is  wordsworths situation is really a beautiful one and nab scaur behind his house rises with a grand protecting air  we passed nabs cottage in which de quincey formerly lived and where hartley coleridge lived and died  it is a small bufftinted plastered stone cottage immediately on the roadside and originally i should think of a very humble class but it now looks as if persons of taste might some time or other have sat down in it and caused flowers to spring up about it  it is very agreeably situated under the great precipitous hill and with rydal water close at band on the other side of the road  an advertisement of lodgings to let was put up on this cottage  i question whether any part of the world looks so beautiful as england this part of england at leaston a fine summer morning  it makes one think the more cheerfully of human life to see such a bright universal verdure such sweet rural peaceful flowerbordered cottagesnot cottages of gentility but dwellings of the laboring poor such nice villas along the roadside so tastefully contrived for comfort and beauty and adorned more and more year after year with the care and afterthought of people who mean to live in them a great while and feel as if their children might live in them also and so they plant trees to overshadow their walks and train ivy and all beautiful vines up against their walls and thus live for the future in another sense than we americans do  and the climate helps them out and makes everything moist and green and full of tender life instead of dry and arid as human life and vegetable life is so apt to be with us  certainly england can present a more attractive face than we can even in its humbler modes of life to say nothing of the beautiful lives that might be led one would think by the higher classes whose gateways with broad smooth gravelled drives leading through them one sees every mile or two along the road winding into some proud seclusion  all this is passing away and society most assume new relations but there is no harm in believing that there has been something very good in english life good for all classes while the world was in a state out of which these forms naturally grew  passing through ambleside our phaeton and pair turned towards ullswater which we were to reach through the pass of kirkstone  this is some three or four miles from ambleside and as we approached it the road kept ascending higher and higher the hills grew more bare and the country lost its soft and delightful verdure  at last the road became so steep that j and i alighted to walk  this is the aspiring road that wordsworth speaks of in his ode it passes through the gorge of precipitous hillsor almost precipitoustoo much so for even the grass to grow on many portions which are covered with gray smugly stones and i think this pass in its middle part must have looked just the same when the romans marched through it as it looks now  no trees could ever have grown on the steep hillsides whereon even the english climate can generate no available soil  i do not know that i have seen anything more impressive than the stern gray sweep of these naked mountains with nothing whatever to soften or adorn them  the notch of the white mountains as i remember it in my youthful days is more wonderful and richly picturesque but of quite a different character  about the centre and at the highest point of the pass stands an old stone building of mean appearance with the usual sign of an alehouse licensed to retail foreign spirits ale and tobacco over the door and another small sign designating it as the highest inhabitable house in england  it is a chill and desolate place for a residence  they keep a visitors book here and we recorded our names in it and were not too sorry to leave the mean little hovel smelling as it did of tobaccosmoke and possessing all other characteristics of the humblest alehouse on the level earth  the kirkstone which gives the pass its name is not seen in approaching from ambleside until some time after you begin to descend towards brothers water  when the driver first pointed it out a little way up the hill on our left it looked no more than a bowlder of a ton or two in weight among a hundred others nearly as big and i saw hardly any resemblance to a church or churchspire to which the fancies of past generations have likened it  as we descended the pass however and left the stone farther and farther behind it continued to show itself and assumed a more striking and prominent aspect standing out clearly relieved against the sky so that no traveller would fail to observe it where there are so few defined objects to attract notice amid the naked monotony of the stern hills though indeed if i had taken it for any sort of an edifice it would rather have been for a wayside inn or a shepherds hut than for a church  we lost sight of it and again beheld it more and more brought out against the sky by the turns of the road several times in the course of our descent  there is a very fine view of brothers water shut in by steep hills as we go down kirkstone pass  at about half past twelve we reached patterdale at the foot of ullswater and here took luncheon  the hotels are mostly very good all through this region and this deserved that character  a blackcoated waiter of more gentlemanly appearance than most englishmen yet taking a sixpence with as little scruple as a lawyer would take his fee the mistress in ladylike attire receiving us at the door and waiting upon us to the carriagesteps clean comely housemaids everywhere at hand all appliances in short for being comfortable and comfortable too within ones own circle  and on taking leave everybody who has done anything for you or who might by possibility have done anything is to be feed  you pay the landlord enough in all conscience and then you pay all his servants who have been your servants for the time  but to say the truth there is a degree of the same kind of annoyance in an american hotel although it is not so much an acknowledged custom  here in the houses where attendance is not charged in the bill no wages are paid by the host to those servantschambermaid waiter and bootswho come into immediate contact with travellers  the drivers of the cars phaetons and flys are likewise unpaid except by their passengers and claim threepence a mile with the same sense of right as their masters in charging for the vehicles and horses  when you come to understand this claim not as an appeal to your generosity but as an actual and necessary part of the cost of the journey it is yielded to with a more comfortable feeling and the traveller has really option enough as to the amount which he will give to insure civility and good behavior on the drivers part  ullswater is a beautiful lake with steep hills walling it about so steep on the eastern side that there seems hardly room for a road to run along the base  we passed up the western shore and turned off from it about midway to take the road towards keswick  we stopped however at lyulphs tower while our chariot went on up a hill and took a guide to show us the way to airey forcea small cataract which is claimed as private property and out of which no doubt a pretty little revenue is raised  i do not think that there can be any rightful appropriation as private property of objects of natural beauty  the fruits of the land and whatever human labor can produce from it belong fairly enough to the person who has a deed or a lease but the beautiful is the property of him who can hive it and enjoy it  it is very unsatisfactory to think of a cataract under lock and key  however we were shown to airey force by a tall and graceful mountainmaid with a healthy cheek and a step that had no possibility of weariness in it  the cascade is an irregular streak of foamy water pouring adown a rude shadowy glen  i liked well enough to see it but it is wearisome on the whole to go the rounds of what everybody thinks it necessary to see  it makes me a little ashamed it is somewhat as if we were drinking out of the same glass and eating from the same dish as a multitude of other people  within a few miles of keswick we passed along at the foot of saddleback and by the entrance of the vale of st john and down the valley on one of the slopes we saw the enchanted castle  thence we drove along by the course of the greta and soon arrived at keswick which lies at the base of skiddaw and among a brotherhood of picturesque eminences and is itself a compact little town with a markethouse built of the old stones of the earl of derwentwaters ruined castle standing in the centrethe principal street forking into two as it passes it  we alighted at the kings arms and went in search of southeys residence which we found easily enough as it lies just on the outskirts of the town  we inquired of a group of people two of whom i thought did not seem to know much about the matter but the third an elderly man pointed it out at oncea house surrounded by trees so as to be seen only partially and standing on a little eminence a hundred yards or so from the road  we went up a private lane that led to the rear of the place and so penetrated quite into the backyard without meeting anybodypassing a small kennel in which were two hounds who gazed at us but neither growled nor wagged their tails  the house is three stories high and seems to have a great deal of room in it so as not to discredit its name greta halla very spacious dwelling for a poet  the windows were nearly all closed there were no signs of occupancy but a general air of neglect  s who is bolder than i in these matters ventured through what seemed a back garden gate and i soon heard her in conversation with some man who now presented himself and proved to be a gardener  he said he had formerly acted in that capacity for southey although a gardener had not been kept by him as a regular part of his establishment  this was an old man with an odd crookedness of legs and strange disjointed limp  s had told him that we were americans and he took the idea that we had come this long distance over sea and land with the sole purpose of seeing southeys residence so that he was inclined to do what he could towards exhibiting it  this was but little the present occupant a mr radday i believe the gardener called him being away and the house shut up  but he showed us about the grounds and allowed us to peep into the windows of what had been southeys library and into those of another of the front apartments and showed us the window of the chamber in the rear in which southey died  the apartments into which we peeped looked rather small and lownot particularly so but enough to indicate an old building  they are now handsomely furnished and we saw over one of the fireplaces an inscription about southey and in the corner of the same room stood a suit of bright armor  it is taller than the countryhouses of english gentlemen usually are and it is even stately  all about in front beside it and behind there is a great profusion of trees most of which were planted by southey who came to live here more than fifty years ago and they have of course grown much more shadowy now than he ever beheld them for he died about fourteen years since  the grounds are well laid out and neatly kept with the usual lawn and gravelled walks and quaint little devices in the ornamental way  these may be of later date than southeys time  the gardener spoke respectfully of southey and of his first wife and observed that it was a great loss to the neighborhood when that family went down  the house stands directly above the greta the murmur of which is audible all about it for the greta is a swift little river and goes on its way with a continual sound which has both depth and breadth  the gardener led us to a walk along its banks close by the hall where he said southey used to walk for hours and hours together  he might indeed get there from his study in a moment  there are two paths one above the other well laid out on the steep declivity of the high bank and there is such a very thick shade of oaks and elms planted by southey himself over the bank that all the ground and grass were moist although it had been a sunny day  it is a very sombre walk not many glimpses of the sky through those dense boughs  the greta is here perhaps twenty yards across and very dark of hue and its voice is melancholy and very suggestive of musings and reveries but i should question whether it were favorable to any settled scheme of thought  the gardener told us that there used to be a pebbly beach on the margin of the river and that it was southeys habit to sit and write there using a tree of peculiar shape for a table  an alteration in the current of the river has swept away the beach and the tree too has fallen  all these things were interesting to me although southey was not i think a picturesque man not one whose personal character takes a strong hold on the imagination  in these walks he used to wear a pair of shoes heavily clamped with iron very ponderous they must have been from the particularity with which the gardener mentioned them  the gardener took leave of us at the front entrance of the grounds and returning to the kings arms we ordered a onehorse fly for the fall of lodore  our drive thither was along the banks of derwentwater and it is as beautiful a road i imagine as can be found in england or anywhere else  i like derwentwater the best of all the lakes so far as i have yet seen them  skiddaw lies at the head of a long even ridge of mountains rising into several peaks and one higher than the rest  on the eastern side there are many noble eminences and on the west along which we drove there is a part of the way a lovely wood and nearly the whole distance a precipitous range of lofty cliffs descending sheer down without any slope except what has been formed in the lapse of ages by the fall of fragments and the washing down of smaller stones  the declivity thus formed along the base of the cliffs is in some places covered with trees or shrubs elsewhere it is quite bare and barren  the precipitous parts of the cliffs are very grand the whole scene indeed might be characterized as one of stern grandeur with an embroidery of rich beauty without lauding it too much  all the sternness of it is softened by vegetative beauty wherever it can possibly be thrown in and there is not here so strongly as along windermere evidence that human art has been helping out nature  i wish it were possible to give any idea of the shapes of the hills with these at least man has nothing to do nor ever will have anything to do  as we approached the bottom of the lake and of the beautiful valley in which it lies we saw one hill that seemed to crouch down like a titanic watchdog with its rear towards the spectator guarding the entrance to the valley  the great superiority of these mountains over those of new england is their variety and definiteness of shape besides the abundance everywhere of water prospects which are wanting among our own hills  they rise up decidedly and each is a hill by itself while ours mingle into one another and besides have such large bases that you can tell neither where they begin nor where they end  many of these cumberland mountains have a marked vertebral shape so that they often look like a group of huge lions lying down with their backs turned toward each other  they slope down steeply from narrow ridges hence their picturesque seclusions of valleys and dales which subdivide the lake region into so many communities  our hills like appledumplings in a dish have no such valleys as these  there is a good inn at lodorea small primitive country inn which has latterly been enlarged and otherwise adapted to meet the convenience of the guests brought thither by the fame of the cascade but it is still a country inn though it takes upon itself the title of hotel  we found pleasant rooms here and established ourselves for the night from this point we have a view of the beautiful lake and of skiddaw at the head of it  the cascade is within three or four minutes walk through the garden gate towards the cliff at the base of which the inn stands  the visitor would need no other guide than its own voice which is said to be audible sometimes at the distance of four miles  as we were coming from keswick we caught glimpses of its white foam high up the precipice and it is only glimpses that can be caught anywhere because there is no regular sheet of falling water  once i think it must have fallen abruptly over the edge of the long line of precipice that here extends along parallel with the shore of the lake but in the course of time it has gnawed and sawed its way into the heart of the cliffthis persistent little streamso that now it has formed a rude gorge adown which it hurries and tumbles in the wildest way over the roughest imaginable staircase  standing at the bottom of the fall you have a far vista sloping upward to the sky with the water everywhere as white as snow pouring and pouring down now on one side of the gorge now on the other among immense bowlders which try to choke its passage it does not attempt to leap over these huge rocks but finds its way in and out among then and finally gets to the bottom after a hundred tumbles  it cannot be better described than in southeys verses though it is worthy of better poetry than that  after all i do not know that the cascade is anything more than a beautiful fringe to the grandeur of the scene for it is very grandthis fissure through the cliffwith a steep lofty precipice on the right hand sheer up and down and on the other hand too another lofty precipice with a slope of its own ruin on which trees and shrubbery have grown  the righthand precipice however has shelves affording sufficient hold for small trees but nowhere does it slant  if it were not for the white little stream falling gently downward and for the soft verdure upon either precipice and even along the very pathway of the cascade it would be a very stern vista up that gorge  i shall not try to describe it any more  it has not been praised too much though it may have been praised amiss  i went thither again in the morning and climbed a good way up through the midst of its rocky descent and i think i could have reached the top in this way  it is remarkable that the bounds of the water from one step of its broken staircase to another give an impression of softness and gentleness but there are black turbulent pools among the great bowlders where the stream seems angry at the difficulties which it meets with  looking upward in the sunshine i could see a rising mist and i should not wonder if a speck of rainbow were sometimes visible  i noticed a small oak in the bed of the cascade and there is a lighter vegetation scattered about  at noon we took a car for portinscale and drove back along the road to keswick through which we passed stopping to get a perhaps of letters at the postoffice and reached portinscale which is a mile from keswick after dinner we walked over a bridge and through a green lane to the church where southey is buried  it is a white church of norman architecture with a low square tower  as we approached we saw two persons entering the portal and following them in we found the sexton who was a tall thin old man with white hair and an intelligent reverent face showing the edifice to a stout redfaced selfimportant goodnatured john bull of a gentleman  without any question on our part the old sexton immediately led us to southeys monument which is placed in a side aisle where there is not breadth for it to stand free of the wall neither is it in a very good light  but it seemed to me a good work of arta recumbent figure of white marble on a couch the drapery of which he has drawn about himbeing quite enveloped in what may be a shroud  the sculptor has not intended to represent death for the figure lies on its side and has a book in its hand and the face is lifelike and looks full of expressiona thin highfeatured poetic face with a finely proportioned head and abundant hair  it represents southey rightly at whatever age he died in the full maturity of manhood when he was strongest and richest  i liked the statue and wished that it lay in a broader aisle or in the chancel where there is an old tomb of a knight and lady of the ratcliffe family who have held the place of honor long enough to yield it now to a poet  southeys sculptor was lough  i must not forget to mention that john bull climbing on a bench to get a better view of the statue tumbled off with a racket that resounded irreverently through the church  the old whiteheaded thin sexton was a model man of his class and appeared to take a loving and cheerful interest in the building and in those who from age to age have worshipped and been buried there  it is a very ancient and interesting church  within a few years it has been thoroughly repaired as to the interior and now looks as if it might endure ten more centuries and i suppose we see little that is really ancient except the double row of norman arches of light freestone that support the oaken beams and rafters of the roof  all the walls however are venerable and quite preserve the identity of the edifice  there is a stainedglass window of modern manufacture and in one of the side windows set amidst plain glass there is a single piece five hundred years old representing st anthony very finely executed though it looks a little faded  along the walls on each side between the arched windows there are marble slabs affixed with inscriptions to the memories of those who used to occupy the seats beneath  i remember none of great antiquity nor any old monument except that in the chancel over the knight and lady of the ratcliffe family  this consists of a slab of stone on four small stone pillars about two feet high  the slab is inlaid with a brass plate on which is sculptured the knight in armor and the lady in the costume of elizabeths time exceedingly well done and well preserved and each figure about eighteen inches in length the sexton showed us a rubbing of them on paper  under the slab which supported by the low stone pillars forms a canopy for them lie two sculptured figures of stone of life size and at full length representing the same persons but i think the sculptor was hardly equal in his art to the engraver  the mostcurious antique relic in the church is the font  the bowl is very capacious sufficiently so to admit of the complete immersion of a child of two or three months old  on the outside in several compartments there are basreliefs of scriptural and symbolic subjects such as the tree of life the word proceeding out of gods mouth the crown of thornsall in the quaintest taste sculptured by some hand of a thousand years ago and preserving the fancies of monkish brains in stone  the sexton was very proud of this font and its sculpture and took a kindly personal interest in showing it and when we had spent as much time as we could inside he led us to southeys grave in the churchyard  he told us that he had known southey long and well from early manhood to old age for he was only twentynine when he came to keswick to reside  he had known wordsworth too and coleridge and lovell and he had seen southey and wordsworth walking arm in arm together in that churchyard  he seemed to revere southeys memory and said that he had been much lamented and that as many as a hundred people came to the churchyard when he was buried  he spoke with great praise of mrs southey his first wife telling of her charity to the poor and how she was a blessing to the neighborhood but he said nothing in favor of the second mrs southey and only mentioned her selling the library and other things after her husbands death and going to london  yet i think she was probably a good woman and meets with less than justice because she took the place of another good woman and had not time and opportunity to prove herself as good  as for southey himself my idea is that few better or more blameless men have ever lived but he seems to lack color passion warmth or something that should enable me to bring him into close relation with myself  the graveyard where his body lies is not so rural and picturesque as that where wordsworth is buried although skiddaw rises behind it and the greta is murmuring at no very great distance away  but the spot itself has a somewhat bare and bold aspect with no shadow of trees no shrubbery  over his grave there is a ponderous oblong block of slate a native mineral of this region as hard as iron and which will doubtless last quite as long as southeys works retain any vitality in english literature  it is not a monument fit for a poet  there is nothing airy or graceful about itand indeed there cannot he many men so solid and matteroffact as to deserve a tomb like that  wordsworths grave is much better with only a simple headstone and the grass growing over his mortality which for a thousand years at least it never can over southeys  most of the monuments are of this same black slate and some erect headstones are curiously sculptured and seem to have been recently erected  we now returned to the hotel and took a car for the valley of st john the sky seemed to portend rain in no long time and skiddaw had put on his cap but the people of the hotel and the driver said that there would be no rain this afternoon and their opinion proved correct  after driving a few miles we again cane within sight of the enchanted castle it stands rather more than midway adown the declivity of one of the ridges that form the valley to the left as you go southward and its site would have been a good one for a fortress intended to defend the lower entrance of this mountain defile  at a proper distance it looks not unlike the gray dilapidation of a gothic castle which has been crumbling and crumbling away for ages until time might be supposed to have imperceptibly stolen its massive pile from man and given it back to nature its towers and battlements and arched entrances being so much defaced and decayed that all the marks of human labor had nearly been obliterated and the angles of the hewn stone rounded away while mosses and weeds and bushes grow over it as freely as over a natural ledge of rocks  it is conceivable that in some lights and in some states of the atmosphere a traveller at the entrance of the valley might really imagine that he beheld a castle here but for myself i must acknowledge that it required a willing fancy to make me see it  as we drew nearer the delusion did not immediately grow less strong but at length we found ourselves passing at the foot of the declivity and behold it was nothing but an enormous ledge of rock coming squarely out of the hillside with other parts of the ledge cropping out in its vicinity looking back after passing we saw a knoll or hillock of which the castled rock is the bare face  there are two or three stone cottages along the roadside beneath the magic castle and within the enchanted ground  scott in the bridal of triermain locates the castle in the middle of the valley and makes king arthur ride around it which any mortal would have great difficulty in doing  this vale of st john has very striking scenery  blencathra shuts it in to the northward lying right across the entrance and on either side there are lofty crags and declivities those to the west being more broken and better wooded than the ridge to the eastward which stretches along for several miles steep high and bare producing only grass enough for sheep pasture until it rises into the dark brow of helvellyn  adown this ridge seen afar like a white ribbon comes here and there a cascade sending its voice before it which distance robs of all its fury and makes it the quietest sound in the world and while you see the foamy leap of its upper course a mile or two away you may see and hear the selfsame little brook babbling through a field and passing under the arch of a rustic bridge beneath your feet  it is a deep seclusion with mountains and crags on all sides  about a mile beyond the castle we stopped at a little wayside inn the kings head and put up for the night  this i believe is the only inn which i have found in englandthe only one where i have eaten and slept that does not call itself a hotel  it is very primitive in its arrangementsa long low whitewashed unadorned and ugly cottage of two stories  at one extremity is a barn and cowhouse and next to these the part devoted to the better class of guests where we had our parlor and chambers contiguous to which is the kitchen and common room paved with flagstonesand lastly another barn and stable all which departments are not under separate roofs but under the same long contiguity and forming the same building  our parlor opens immediately upon the roadside without any vestibule  the house appears to be of some antiquity with beams across the low ceilings but the people made us pretty comfortable at bed and board and fed us with ham and eggs vealsteaks honey oatcakes gooseberrytarts and such cates and daintiesmaking a moderate charge for all  the parlor was adorned with rude engravings  i remember only a plate of the duke of wellington at three stages of his life and there were minerals delved doubtless out of the hearts of the mountains upon the mantelpiece  the chairs were of an antiquated fashion and had very capacious seats  we were waited upon by two women who looked and acted not unlike the countryfolk of new englandsay of new hampshireexcept that these may have been more deferential  while we remained here i took various walks to get a glimpse of helvellyn and a view of thirlmerewhich is rather two lakes than one being so narrow at one point as to be crossed by a footbridge  its shores are very picturesque coming down abruptly upon it and broken into crags and prominences which view their shaggy faces in its mirror and helvellyn slopes steeply upward from its southern shore into the clouds  on its eastern bank near the footbridge stands armboth house which miss martineau says is haunted and i saw a painted board at the entrance of the road which leads to it advertising lodgings there  the ghosts of course pay nothing for their accommodations  at noon on the day after our arrival j and i went to visit the enchanted castle and we were so venturesome as to turn aside from the road and ascend the declivity towards its walls which indeed we hoped to surmount  it proved a very difficult undertaking the site of the fortress being much higher and steeper than we had supposed but we did clamber upon what we took for the most elevated portion when lo we found that we had only taken one of the outworks and that there was a gorge of the hill betwixt us and the main walls while the citadel rose high above at more than twice the elevation which we had climbed j wished to go on and i allowed him to climb till he appeared to have reached so steep and lofty a height that he looked hardly bigger than a monkey and i should not at all have wondered had he come rolling down to the base of the rock where i sat  but neither did he get actually within the castle though he might have done so but for a high stone fence too difficult for him to climb which runs from the rock along the hillside  the sheep probably go thither much oftener than any other living thing and to them we left the castle of st john with a shrub waving from its battlements instead of a banner  after dinner we ordered a car for ambleside and while it was getting ready i went to look at the river of st john which indeed flows close beside our inn only just across the road though it might well be overlooked unless you specially sought for it  it is a brook brawling over the stones very much as brooks do in new england only we never think of calling them rivers there  i could easily have made a leap from shore to shore and j scrambled across on no better footing than a rail  i believe i have complained of the want of brooks in other parts of england but there is no want of them here and they are always interesting being of what size they may  we drove down the valley and gazed at the vast slope of helvellyn and at thirlmere beneath it and at eagles crag and ravens crag which beheld themselves in it and we cast many a look behind at blencathra and that noble brotherhood of mountains out of the midst of which we came  but to say the truth i was weary of fine scenery and it seemed to me that i had eaten a score of mountains and quaffed as many lakes all in the space of two or three daysand the natural consequence was a surfeit  there was scarcely a single place in all our tour where i should not have been glad to spend a month but by flitting so quickly from one point to another i lost all the more recondite beauties and had come away without retaining even the surface of much that i had seen i am slow to feelslow i suppose to comprehend and like the anaconda i need to lubricate any object a great deal before i can swallow it and actually make it my own  yet i shall always enjoy having made this journey and shall wonder the more at england which comprehends so much such a rich variety within its narrow bounds  if england were all the world it still would have been worth while for the creator to have made it and mankind would have had no cause to find fault with their abode except that there is not room enough for so many as might be happy here  we left the great inverted arch of the valley behind us looking back as long as we could at blencathra and skiddaw over its shoulder and the clouds were gathering over them at our last glimpse  passing by dummail raise which is a mound of stones over an old british king we entered westmoreland and soon had the vale of grasmere before us with the church where wordsworth lies and nab scaur and rydal water farther on at ambleside we took another car for newby bridge whither we drove along the eastern shore of windermere  the superb scenery through which we had been passing made what we now saw look tame although a week ago we should have thought it more than commonly interesting  hawkshead is the only village on our roada small whitewashed old town with a whitewashed old norman church low and with a low tower on the same pattern with others that we have seen hereabouts  it was between seven and eight oclock when we reached newby bridge and heard us voice greeting us and saw her head crowned with a wreath of flowers looking down at us out of the window of our parlor  and today july 23d i have written this most incomplete and unsatisfactory record of what we have done and seen since wednesday last i am pretty well convinced that all attempts at describing scenery especially mountain scenery are sheer nonsense  for one thing the point of view being changed the whole description which you made up from the previous point of view is immediately falsified  and when you have done your utmost such items as those setting forth the scene in a playa mountainous country in the distance a cascade tumbling over a precipice and in front a lake on one side an ivycovered cottage this dry detail brings the matter before ones minds eyes more effectually than all the art of wordpainting   july 27thwe are still at newby bridge and nothing has occurred of remarkable interest nor have we made any excursions beyond moderate walks  two days have been rainy and today there is more rain  we find such weather as tolerable here as it would probably be anywhere but it passes rather heavily with the childrenand for myself i should prefer sunshine  though mr whites books afford me some entertainment especially an odd volume of ben jonsons plays containing volpone the alchemist bartholomew fair and others  the alchemist is certainly a great play  we watch all arrivals and other events from our parlor windowa stagecoach driving up four times in the twentyfour hours with its forlorn outsiders all saturated with rain the steamer from the head of the lake landing a crowd of passengers who stroll up to the hotel drink a glass of ale lean over the parapet of the bridge gaze at the flat stones which pave the bottom of the liver and then hurry back to the steamer again cars phaetons horsemen all damped and disconsolate  there are a number of young men staying at the hotel some of whom go forth in all the rain fishing and come back at nightfall trudging heavily but with creels on their backs that do not seem very heavy  yesterday was fair and enlivened us a good deal  returning from a walk in the forenoon i found a troop of yeomanry cavalry in the stableyard of the hotel  they were the north lancashire regiment and were on their way to liverpool for the purpose of drill  not being old campaigners their uniforms and accoutrements were in so much the finer order all bright and looking spannew and they themselves were a body of handsome and stalwart young men and it was pleasant to look at their helmets and red jackets and carbines and steel scabbarded swords and gallant steedsall so martial in aspectand to know that they were only playsoldiers after all and were never likely to do nor suffer any warlike mischief  by and by their bugles sounded and they trotted away wheeling over the ivygrown stone bridge and disappearing behind the trees on the milnethorpe road  our host comes forth from the bar with a bill which he presents to an orderlysergeant  he the host then tells me that he himself once rode many years a trooper in this regiment and that all his comrades were larger men than himself  yet mr thomas white is a goodsized man and now at all events rather overweight for a dragoon  yesterday came one of those bands of music that seem to itinerate everywhere about the country  it consisted of a young woman who played the harp a bassviol player a fiddler a flutist and a bugler besides a little child of whom i suppose the woman was the mother  they sat down on a bench by the roadside opposite the house and played several tunes and by and by the waiter brought them a large pitcher of ale which they quaffed with apparent satisfaction though they seemed to be foreigners by their mustachios and sallow hue and would perhaps have preferred a vinous potation  one would like to follow these people through their vagrant life and see them in their social relations and overhear their talk with each other  all vagrants are interesting and there is a much greater variety of them here than in americapeople who cast themselves on fortune and take whatever she gives without a certainty of anything  i saw a travelling tinker yesterdaya man with a leather apron and a string of skewers hung at his girdle and a pack over his shoulders in which no doubt were his tools and materials of trade  it is remarkable what a natural interest everybody feels in fishing  an angler from the bridge immediately attracts a group to watch his luck it is the same with j fishing for minnows on the platform near which the steamer lands its passengers  by the by u caught a minnow last evening and immediately after a goodsized perchher first fish   july 30thwe left newby bridge all of us on saturday at twelve oclock and steamed up the lake to ambleside a pretty good day as to weather but with a little tendency to shower  there was nothing new on the lake and no new impressions as far as i can remember  at ambleside s and nurse went shopping after which we took a carriage for grasmere and established ourselves at browns hotel  i find that my impressions from our previous sight of all these scenes do not change on revision  they are very beautiful but if i must say it i am a little weary of them  we soon tire of things which we visit merely by way of spectacle and with which we have no real and permanent connection  in such cases we very quickly wish the spectacle to be taken away and another substituted at all events i do not care about seeing anything more of the english lakes for at least a year  perhaps a part of my weariness is owing to the hotellife which we lead at an english hotel the traveller feels as if everybody from the landlord downward united in a joint and individual purpose to fleece him because all the attendants who come in contact with him are to be separately considered  so after paying in the first instance a very heavy bill for what would seem to cover the whole indebtedness there remain divers dues still to be paid to no trifling amount to the landlords servantsdues not to be ascertained and which you never can know whether you have properly satisfied  you can know perhaps when you have less than satisfied them by the aspect of the waiter which i wish i could describe not disrespectful in the slightest degree but a look of profound surprise a gaze at the offered coin which he nevertheless pockets as if he either did not see it or did not know it or could not believe his eyesightall this however with the most quiet forbearance a christianlike nonrecognition of an unmerited wrong and insult and finally all in a moments space indeed he quits you and goes about his other business  if you have given him too much you are made sensible of your folly by the extra amount of his gratitude and the bows with which he salutes you from the doorstep  generally you cannot very decidedly say whether you have been right or wrong but in almost all cases you decidedly feel that you have been fleeced  then the living at the best of english hotels so far as my travels have brought me acquainted with them deserves but moderate praise and is especially lacking in variety  nothing but joints joints joints sometimes perhaps a meatpie which if you eat it weighs upon your conscience with the idea that you have eaten the scraps of other peoples dinners at the lake hotels the fare is lamb and mutton and groutthe latter not always fresh and soon tired of  we pay like nabobs and are expected to be content with plain mutton  we spent the day yesterday at grasmere in quiet walks about the hotel and at a little past six in the afternoon i took my departure in the stagecoach for windermere  the coach was greatly overburdened with outside passengersfifteen in all besides the four insiders and one of the fifteen formed the apex of an immense pile of luggage on the top it seems to me miraculous that we did not topple over the road being so hilly and uneven and the driver i suspect none the steadier for his visits to all the taprooms along the route from cockermouth  there was a tremendous vibration of the coach now and then and i saw that in case of our going over i should be flung headlong against the high stone fence that bordered most of the road  in view of this i determined to muffle my head in the folds of my thick shawl at the moment of overturn and as i could do no better for myself i awaited my fate with equanimity  as far as apprehension goes i had rather travel from maine to georgia by rail than from grasmere to windermere by stagecoach  at lowwood the landlady espied me from the window and sent out a large packet that had arrived by mail but as it was addressed to some person of the christian name of william i did not venture to open it  she said also that a gentleman had been there who very earnestly desired to see me and i have since had reason to suppose that this was allingham the poet  we arrived at windermere at half past seven and waited nearly an hour for the train to start  i took a ticket for lancaster and talked there about the war with a gentleman in the coffeeroom who took me for an englishman as most people do nowadays and i heard from himas you may from all his countrymenan expression of weariness and dissatisfaction with the whole business  these fickle islanders  how differently they talked a year ago  john bull sees now that he never was in a worse predicament in his life and yet it would not take much to make him roar as bellicosely as ever  i went to bed at eleven and slept unquietly on feathers  i had purposed to rise betimes and see the town of lancaster before breakfast  but here i reckoned without my host for in the first place i had no water for my ablutions and my boots were not brushed and so i could not get down stairs till the hour i named for my coffee and chops and secondly the breakfast was delayed half an hour though promised every minute  in fine i had but just time to take a hasty walk round lancaster castle and see what i could of the town on my waya not very remarkable town built of stone with taller houses than in the middle shires of england narrow streets up and down an eminence on which the castle is situated with the town immediately about it  the castle is a satisfactory edifice but so renovated that the walls look almost entirely modern with the exception of the fine old front with the statue of an armed warrior very likely john of gaunt himself in a niche over the norman arch of the entrance  close beside the castle stands an old church  the train left lancaster at half past nine and reached liverpool at twelve over as flat and uninteresting a country as i ever travelled  i have betaken myself to the rock ferry hotel where i am as comfortable as i could be anywhere but at home but it is rather comfortless to think of hone as three years off and three thousand miles away  with what a sense of utter weariness not fully realized till then we shall sink down on our own threshold when we reach it  the moral effect of being without a settled abode is very wearisome  our coachman from grasmere to windermere looked like a great beerbarrel oozy with his proper liquor  i suppose such solid soakers never get upset    the launch   august 2dmr  has urged me very much to go with his father and family to see the launch of a great ship which has been built for their house and afterwards to partake of a picnic so on tuesday morning i presented myself at the landingstage and met the party to take passage for chester  it was a showery morning and looked wofully like a rainy day but nothing better is to be expected in england and after all there is seldom such a day that you cannot glide about pretty securely between the drops of rain  this however did not turn out one of those tolerable days but grew darker and darker and worse and worse and was worst of all when we had passed about six miles beyond chester and were just on the borders of wales on the hither side of the river dee where the ship was to be launched  here the train stopped and absolutely deposited our whole party of excursionists under a heavy shower in the midst of a muddy potatofield whence we were to wade through mud and mire to the shipyard almost half a mile off  some kind christian i know not whom gave me half of his umbrella and half of his cloak and thereby i got to a shed near the ship without being entirely soaked through  the ship had been built on the banks of the dee at a spot where it is too narrow for her to be launched directly across and so she lay lengthwise of the river and was so arranged as to take the water parallel with the stream  she is for aught i know the largest ship in the world at any rate longer than the great britainan ironscrew steamerand looked immense and magnificent and was gorgeously dressed out in flags  had it been a pleasant day all chester and half wales would have been there to see the launch and in spite of the rain there were a good many people on the opposite shore as well as on our side and one or two booths and many of the characteristics of a fairthat is to say men and women getting intoxicated without any great noise and confusion  the ship was expected to go off at about twelve oclock and at that juncture all mr s friends assembled under the bows of the ship where we were a little sheltered from the rain by the projection of that part of the vessel over our heads  the bottle of portwine with which she was to be christened was suspended from the bows to the platform where we stood by a blue ribbon and the ceremony was to be performed by mrs  who i could see was very nervous in anticipation of the ceremony  mr  kept giving her instructions in a whisper and showing her how to throw the bottle and as the critical moment approached he took hold of it along with her  all this time we were waiting in momentary expectation of the ship going off everything being ready and only the touch of a spring as it were needed to make her slide into the water  but the chief manager kept delaying a little longer and a little longer though the pilot on board sent to tell him that it was time she was off  yes yes but i want as much water as i can get answered the manager and so he held on till i suppose the tide had raised the river dee to its very acme of height  at last the word was given the ship began slowly to move mrs  threw the bottle against the bow with a spasmodic effort that dashed it into a thousand pieces and diffused the fragrance of the old port all around where it lingered several minutes  i did not think that there could have been such a breathless moment in an affair of this kind  the ship moved majestically down toward the river and unless it were niagara i never saw anything grander and more impressive than the motion of this mighty mass as she departed from us  we on the platform and everybody along both shores of the dee took off our hats in the rain waved handkerchiefs cheered shoutedbeautiful  what a noble launch  never was so fair a sightand really it was so grand that calm majestic movement that i felt the tears come into my eyes the wooden pathway adown which she was gliding began to smoke with the friction when all at once when we expected to see her plunge into the dee she came to a full stop  mr  the father of my friend a gentleman with white hair a dark expressive face bright eyes and an oriental cast of features immediately took the alarm  a moment before his countenance had been kindled with triumph but now he turned pale as death and seemed to grow ten years older while i was looking at him well he might for his noble ship was stuck fast in the land of the dee and without deepening the bed of the river i do not see how her vast iron hulk is ever to be got out  this steamer was afterwards successfully floated off on the 29th of the same month  there was no help for it  a steamboat was hitched on to the stranded vessel but broke two or three cables without stirring her an inch  so after waiting long after we had given up all hope we went to the office of the shipyard and there took a lunch and still the rain was pouring pouring pouring and i never experienced a blacker affair in all my days  then we had to wait a great while for a train to take us back so that it was almost five oclock before we arrived at chester where i spent an hour in rambling about the old town under the rows and on the walls looking down on the treetops directly under my feet and through their thick branches at the canal which creeps at the base and at the cathedral walking under the dark intertwining arches of the cloisters and looking up at the great cathedral tower so wasted away externally by time and weather that it looks save for the difference of color between white snow and red freestone like a structure of snow half dissolved by several warm days  at the lunch i met with a graduate of cambridge england tutor of a grandson of percival with his pupil percival the assassinated minister i mean  i should not like this position of tutor to a young englishman it certainly has an ugly twang of upper servitude  i observed that the tutor gave his pupil the best seat in the railway carriage and in all respects provided for his comfort before thinking of his own and this not as a father does for his child out of love but from a sense of place and duty which i did not quite see how a gentleman could consent to feel  and yet this mr c was evidently a gentleman and a quiet intelligent agreeable and no doubt learned man  k being mentioned mr c observed that he had known him well at college having been his contemporary there  he did not like him howeverthought him a dangerous man as well as i could gather he thinks there is some radical defect in ks moral nature a lack of sincerity and furthermore he believes him to be a sensualist in his disposition in support of which view he said mr k had made drawings such as no pure man could have made or could allow himself to show or look at  this was the only fact which mr c adduced bearing on his opinion of k otherwise it seemed to be one of those early impressions which a collegian gets of his fellowstudents and which he never gets rid of whatever the character of the person may turn out to be in after years  i have judged several persons in this way and still judge them so though the world has cone to very different conclusions  which is rightthe world which has the mans whole mature life on its side or his early companion who has nothing for it but some idle passages of his youth  mr m remarked of newspaper reporters that they may be known at all celebrations and of any public occasion by the enormous quantity of luncheon they eat   august 12thmr b dined with us at the rock ferry hotel the day before yesterday  speaking of helvellyn and the death of charles cough about whom wordsworth and scott have both sung mr b mentioned a version of that story which rather detracts from the character of the faithful dog  but somehow it lowers ones opinion of human nature itself to be compelled so to lower ones standard of a dogs nature  i dont intend to believe the disparaging story but it reminds me of the story of the newzealander who was asked whether he loved a missionary who had been laboring for his soul and those of his countrymen  to be sure i loved him  why i ate a piece of him for my breakfast this morning  for the last week or two i have passed my time between the hotel and the consulate and a weary life it is and one that leaves little of profit behind it  i am sick to death of my officebrutal captains and brutal sailors continual complaints of mutual wrong which i have no power to set right and which indeed seem to have no right on either side calls of idleness or ceremony from my travelling countrymen who seldom know what they are in search of at the commencement of their tour and never have attained any desirable end at the close of it beggars cheats simpletons unfortunates so mixed up that it is impossible to distinguish one from another and so in selfdefence the consul distrusts them all      at the hotel yesterday there was a large company of factory people from preston who marched up from the pier with a band of military music playing before them  they spent the day in the gardens and ballroom of the hotel dancing and otherwise merrymaking but i saw little of them being at the consulate  towards evening it drizzled and the assemblage melted away gradually and when the band marched down to the pier there were few to follow although one man went dancing before the musicians flinging out his arms and footing it with great energy and gesticulation  some young women along the road likewise began to dance as the music approached  thackeray has a dread of servants insomuch that he hates to address them or to ask them for anything  his morbid sensibility in this regard has perhaps led him to study and muse upon them so that he may be presumed to have a more intimate knowledge of this class than any other man  carlyle dresses so badly and wears such a rough outside that the flunkies are rude to him at gentlemens doors  in the afternoon j and i took a walk towards tranmere hall and beyond as far as oxton  this part of the country being so near liverpool and birkenhead is all sprinkled over with what they call terraces bellevues and other pretty names for semidetached villas recluse cottage was one for a somewhat higher class  but the old whitewashed stone cottage is still frequent with its roof of slate or thatch which perhaps is green with weeds or grass  through its open door you see that it has a pavement of flagstones or perhaps of red freestone and hogs and donkeys are familiar with the threshold  the door always opens directly into the kitchen without any vestibule and glimpsing in you see that a cottagers life must be the very plainest and homeliest that ever was lived by men and women  yet the flowers about the door often indicate a native capacity for the beautiful but often there is only a pavement of round stones or of flagstones like those within  at one point where there was a little bay as it were in the hedge fence we saw something like a small tent or wigwaman arch of canvas three or four feet high and open in front under which sat a darkcomplexioned woman and some children  the woman was sewing and i took them for gypsies   august 17thyesterday afternoon j and i went to birkenhead park which i have already described     it so happened that there was a large school spending its holiday there a school of girls of the lower classes to the number of a hundred and fifty who disported themselves on the green under the direction of the schoolmistresses and of an old gentleman  it struck me as it always has to observe how the lower orders of this country indicate their birth and station by their aspect and features  in america there would be a good deal of grace and beauty among a hundred and fifty children and budding girls belonging to whatever rank of life  but here they had universally a most plebeian lookstubbed sturdy figures round coarse faces snubnosesthe most evident specimens of the brown bread of human nature  they looked wholesome and good enough and fit to sustain their rough share of life but it would have been impossible to make a lady out of any one of them climate no doubt has most to do with diffusing a slender elegance over american youngwomanhood but something perhaps is also due to the circumstance of classes not being kept apart there as they are here they interfuse amid the continual ups and downs of our social life and so in the lowest stations of life you may see the refining influence of gentle blood  at all events it is only necessary to look at such an assemblage of children as i saw yesterday to be convinced that birth and blood do produce certain characteristics  to be sure i have seen no similar evidence in england or elsewhere of old gentility refining and elevating the race  these girls were all dressed in black gowns with white aprons and neckerchiefs and white linen caps on their headsa very dowdyish attire and well suited to their figures  i saw only two of their gamesin one they stood in a circle while two of their number chased one another within and without the ring of girls which opened to let the fugitive pass but closed again to impede the passage of the pursuer the other was blindmansbuff on a new plan several of the girls sometimes as many as twenty being blinded at once and pursuing a single one who rang a handbell to indicate her whereabouts  this was very funny the bellgirl keeping just beyond their reach and drawing them after her in a huddled group so that they sometimes tumbled over one another and lay sprawling  i think i have read of this game in strutts english sports and pastimes  we walked from the park home to rock ferry a distance of three or four milesa part of which was made delightful by a footpath leading us through fields where the grass had just been mown and others where the wheat harvest was commenced  the path led us into the very midst of the rural labor that was going forward and the laborers rested a moment to look at us in fact they seemed to be more willing to rest than american laborers would have been  children were loitering along this path or sitting down beside it and we met one little maid passing from village to village intent on some errand  reaching tranmere i went into an alehouse nearly opposite the hall and called for a glass of ale  the doorstep before the house and the flagstone floor of the entry and taproom were chalked all over in corkscrew linesan adornment that gave an impression of care and neatness the chalked lines being evidently freshly made  it was a low oldfashioned room ornamented with a couple of seashells and an earthenware figure on the mantelpiece also with advertisements of allsops ale and other drinks and with a pasteboard handbill of the ancient order of foresters any member of which paying sixpence weekly is entitled to ten shillings per week and the attendance of a firstrate physician in sickness and twelve pounds to be paid to his friends in case of death  any member of this order when travelling is sure says the handbill to meet with a brother member to lend him a helping hand there being nearly three thousand districts of this order and more than a hundred and nine thousand members in great britain whence it has extended to australia america and other countries  looking up at the gateway of tranmere hall i discovered an inscription on the red freestone lintel and though much timeworn i succeeded in reading it  labor omnia vincit 1614  there were likewise some initials which i could not satisfactorily make out  the sense of this motto would rather befit the present agricultural occupants of the house than the idle gentlefolks who built and formerly inhabited it    smithells hall   august 25thon thursday i went by invitation to smithells hall in bolton le moors to dine and spend the night  the hall is two or three miles from the town of bolton where i arrived by railway from liverpool and which seems to be a pretty large town though the houses are generally modern or with modernized fronts of brick or stucco  it is a manufacturing town and the tall brick chimneys rise numerously in the neighborhood and are so near smithells hall that i suspect the atmosphere is somewhat impregnated with their breath  mr  can comfort himself with the rent which he receives from the factories erected upon his own grounds and i suppose the value of his estate has greatly increased by the growth of manufactories although unless he wish to sell it i do not see what good this can do him  smithells hall is one of the oldest residences of england and still retains very much the aspect that it must have had several centuries ago the house formerly stood around all four sides of a quadrangle enclosing a court and with an entrance through an archway  one side of this quadrangle was removed in the time of the present mr s father and the front is now formed by the remaining three sides  they look exceedingly ancient and venerable with their range of gables and lesser peaks  the house is probably timberframed throughout and is overlaid with plaster and its generally light line is painted with a row of trefoils in black producing a very quaint effect  the wing forming one side of the quadrangle is a chapel and has been so from time immemorial and mr  told me that he had a clergyman and even a bishop in his own diocese  the drawingroom is on the opposite side of the quadrangle and through an arched door in the central portion there is a passage to the rear of the house  it is impossible to describe such an old rambling edifice as this or to get any clear idea of its plan even by going over it without the aid of a map  mr  has added some portions and altered others but with due regard to harmony with the original structure and the great body of it is still mediaeval  the entrancehall opens right upon the quadrangular court and is a large low room with a settle of carved old oak and other old oaken furniturea centretable with periodicals and newspapers on itsome family pictures on the wallsand a large bright coalfire in the spacious grate  the fire is always kept up throughout summer and winter and it seemed to me an excellent plan and rich with cheerful effects insuring one comfortable place and that the most central in the house whatever may be the inclemency of the weather  it was a cloudy moist showery day when i arrived and this fire gave me the brightest and most hospitable smile and took away any shivery feeling by its mere presence  the servant showed me thence into a lowstudded diningroom where soon mrs  made her appearance and after some talk brought me into the billiardroom opening from the hall where mr  and a young gentleman were playing billiards and two ladies looking on  after the game was finished mr  took me round to see the house and grounds  the peculiarity of this house is what is called the bloody footstep in the time of bloody mary a protestant clergymangeorge marsh by name was examined before the then proprietor of the hall sir roger barton i think and committed to prison for his heretical opinions and was ultimately burned at the stake  as his guards were conducting him from the justiceroom through the stonepaved passage that leads from front to rear of smithells hall he stamped his foot upon one of the flagstones in earnest protestation against the wrong which he was undergoing  the foot as some say left a bloody mark in the stone others have it that the stone yielded like wax under his foot and that there has been a shallow cavity ever since  this miraculous footprint is still extant and mrs  showed it to me before her husband took me round the estate  it is almost at the threshold of the door opening from the rear of the house a stone two or three feet square set among similar ones that seem to have been worn by the tread of many generations  the footprint is a dark brown stain in the smooth gray surface of the flagstone and looking sidelong at it there is a shallow cavity perceptible which mrs  accounted for as having been worn by people setting their feet just on this place so as to tread the very spot where the martyr wrought the miracle  the mark is longer than any mortal foot as if caused by sliding along the stone rather than sinking into it and it might be supposed to have been made by a pointed shoe being blunt at the heel and decreasing towards the toe  the bloodstained version of the story is more consistent with the appearance of the mark than the imprint would be for if the martyrs blood oozed out through his shoe and stocking it might have made his foot slide along the stone and thus have lengthened the shape  of course it is all a humbuga darker vein cropping up through the gray flagstone but it is probably a fact and for aught i know may be found in foxs book of martyrs that george marsh underwent an examination in this house there is a full and pathetic account of the examination and martyrdom of george marsh in the eleventh section of foxs book of martyrs as i have just found june 9 1867  he went to smithells hall among other places to be questioned by mr bartoned and the tradition may have connected itself with the stone within a short time after the martyrdom or perhaps when the old persecuting knight departed this life and bloody mary was also dead people who had stood at a little distance from the hall door and had seen george marsh lift his hand and stamp his foot just at this spotperhaps they remembered this action and gesture and really believed that providence had thus made an indelible record of it on the stone although the very stone and the very mark might have lain there at the threshold hundreds of years before  but even if it had been always there the footprint might after the fact be looked upon as a prophecy from the time when the foundation of the old house was laid that a holy and persecuted man should one day set his foot here on the way that was to lead him to the stake  at any rate the legend is a good one  mrs  tells me that the miraculous stone was once taken up from the pavement and flung out of doors where it remained many years and in proof of this it is cracked quite across at one end  this is a pity and rather interferes with the authenticity if not of the stone itself yet of its position in the pavement  it is not far from the foot of the staircase leading up to sir roger bartons examinationroom whither we ascended after examining the footprint  this room now opens sideways on the chapel into which it looks down and which is spacious enough to accommodate a pretty large congregation  on one of the walls of the chapel there is a marble tablet to the memory of one of the present familymrs father i suppose he being the first of the name who possessed the estate  the present owners however seem to feel pretty much the same pride in the antiquity and legends of the house as if it had come down to them in an unbroken succession of their own forefathers  it has in reality passed several times from one family to another since the conquest  mr  led me through a spacious old room which was formerly panelled with carved oak but which is converted into a brewhouse up a pair of stairs into the garret of one of the gables in order to show me the ancient framework of the house  it is of oak and preposterously ponderousimmense beams and rafters which no modern walls could supporta gigantic old skeleton which architects say must have stood a thousand years and indeed it is impossible to ascertain the date of the original foundation though it is known to have been repaired and restored between five and six centuries ago  of course in the lapse of ages it must continually have been undergoing minor changes but without at all losing its identity  mr  says that this old oak wood though it looks as strong and as solid as ever has really lost its strength and that it would snap short off on application of any force  after this we took our walk through the grounds which are well wooded though the trees will bear no comparison with those which i have seen in the midland parts of england  it takes i suspect a much longer time for trees to attain a good size here than in america and these trees i think mr  told me were principally set out by himself  he is upwards of sixtya good specimen of the old english countrygentleman sensible loving his land and his trees and his dogs and his game doing a little justicebusiness and showing a fitness for his position so that you feel satisfied to have him keep it  he was formerly a member of parliament  i had met him before at dinner at mrs hs     he took pleasure in showing me his grounds through which he has laid out a walk winding up and down through dells and over hillocks and now and then crossing a rustic bridge so that you have an idea of quite an extensive domain  beneath the trees there is a thick growth of ferns serving as cover for the game  a little terrierdog who had hitherto kept us company all at once disappeared and soon afterwards we heard the squeak of some poor victim in the cover whereupon mr  set out with agility and ran to the rescueby and by the terrier came back with a very guilty look from the wood we passed into the open park whence we had a distant view of the house and returning thither we viewed it in other aspects and on all sides  one portion of it is occupied by mr s gardener and seems not to have been repaired at least as to its exterior for a great many yearsshowing the old wooden frame painted black with plaster in the interstices and broad windows extending across the whole breadth of the rooms with hundreds of little diamondshaped panes of glass  before dinner i was shown to my room which opens from an ancient gallery lined with oak and lighted by a row of windows along one side of the quadrangle  along this gallery are the doors of several sleepingchambers one of whichi think it is hereis called the dead mans chamber  it is supposed to have been the room where the corpses of persons connected with the household used to be laid out  my own room was called the beam chamber from am immense crossbeam that projects from the ceiling and seems to be an entire tree laid across and left roughhewn though at present it is whitewashed  the but of the tree for it diminishes from one end of the chamber to the other is nearly two feet square in its visible part  we dined at seven oclock in a room some thirtyfive or forty feet long and proportionably broad all panelled with the old carved oak which mr  took from the room which he had converted into a brewhouse  the oak is now of a very dark brown hue and being highly polished it produces a sombre but rich effect  it is supposed to be of the era of henry the seventh and when i examined it the next morning i found it very delicately and curiously wrought  there are carved profiles of persons in the costume of the times done with great skill also foliage intricate puzzles of intersecting lines sacred devices anagrams and among others the device of a bar across a tun indicating the name of barton  most of the carving however is less elaborate and intricate than these specimens being in a perpendicular style and on one pattern  before the wood grew so very dark the beauty of the work must have been much more easily seen than now as to particulars though i hardly think that the general effect could have been better at least the sombre richness that overspreads the entire square of the room is suitable to such an antique house  an elaborate gothic cornice runs round the whole apartment  the sideboard and other furniture are of gothic patterns and very likely of genuine antiquity but the fireplace is perhaps rather out of keeping being of white marble with the arms of this family sculptured on it  though hardly sunset when we sat down to dinner yet it being an overcast day and the oaken room so sombre we had candles burning on the table and long before dinner was over the candlelight was all the light we had  it is always pleasanter to dine by artificial light mrs s dinner was a good one and mr s wines were very good  i had mrs  on one side and another lady on the other side      after dinner there were two cardparties formed in the diningroom at one of which there was a game of vingtetun and at the other a game of whist at which mrs  and i lost several shillings to a mrs halton and mr gaskell     after finishing our games at cards mrs halton drove off in a ponychaise to her own house the other ladies retired and the gentlemen sat down to chat awhile over the hall fire occasionally sipping a glass of wineandwater and finally we all went off to our rooms  it was past twelve oclock when i composed myself to sleep and i could not have slept long when a tremendous clap of thunder woke me just in time to see a vivid flash of lightning  i saw no ghosts though mrs  tells me there is one which makes a disturbance unless religious services are regularly kept up in the chapel  in the morning before breakfast we had prayers read by mr  in the oak diningroom all the servants coming in and everybody kneeling down  i should like to know how much true religious feeling is indicated by this regular observance of religious rites in english families  in america if people kneel down to pray it is pretty certain that they feel a genuine interest in the matter and their daily life is supposed to be in accordance with their devotions  if an american is an infidel he knows it but an englishman is often so without suspecting itbeing kept from that knowledge by this formality of family prayer and his other regularities of external worship      there was a parrot in a corner of the diningroom and when prayers were over mrs  praised it very highly for having been so silent it being polls habit probably to break in upon the sacred exercises with unseemly interjections and remarks  while we were at breakfast poll began to whistle and talk very vociferously and in a tone and with expressions that surprised me till i learned that the bird is usually kept in the kitchen and servants hall and is only brought into the diningroom at prayertime and breakfast  thus its mouth is full of kitchen talk which flows out before the gentlefolks with the queerest effect  after breakfast i examined the carvings of the room  mr  has added to its decorations the coats of arms of all the successive possessors of the house with those of the families into which they married including the ratcliffes stanleys and others  from the diningroom i passed into the library which contains books enough to make a rainy day pass pleasantly  i remember nothing else that i need to record and as i sat by the hall fire talking with mr gaskell at about eleven oclock the butler brought me word that a fly which i had bespoken was ready to convey me to the railway  i took leave of mrs  her last request being that i would write a ghoststory for her houseand drove off    shrewsbury   september 5thyesterday we all of us set forth from rock ferry at half past twelve and reached shrewsbury between three and four oclock and took up our quarters at the lion hotel  we found shrewsbury situated on an eminence around which the severn winds making a peninsula of it quite densely covered by the town  the streets ascend and curve about and intersect each other with the customary irregularity of these old english towns so that it is quite impossible to go directly to any given point or for a stranger to find his way to a place which he wishes to reach though by what seems a singular good fortune the soughtfor place is always offering itself when least expected  on this account i never knew such pleasant walking as in old streets like those of shrewsbury  and there are passages opening under archways and winding up between high edifices very tempting to the explorer and generally leading to some court or some queer old range of buildings or piece of architecture which it would be the greatest pity to miss seeing  there was a delightful want of plan in the laying out of these ancient towns in fact they never were laid out at all nor were restrained by any plan whatever but grew naturally with streets as eccentric as the pathway of a young child toddling about the floor  the first curious thing we particularly noticed when we strolled out after dinner was the old markethouse which stands in the midst of an oblong square a gray edifice elevated on pillars and arches and with the statue of an armed knight richard plantagenet duke of york in a central niche in its front  the statue is older than the markethouse having been moved thither from one of the demolished towers of the city wall in 1795  the markethouse was erected in 1595  there are other curious sculptures and carvings and quirks of architecture about this building and the houses that stand about the square are many of them very striking specimens of what dwellinghouses used to be in elizabeths time and earlier  i have seen no such stately houses in that style as we found here in shrewsbury  there were no such fine ones in coventry stratford warwick chester nor anywhere else where we have been  their stately height and spaciousness seem to have been owing to the fact that shrewsbury was a sort of metropolis of the country round about and therefore the neighboring gentry had their townhouses there when london was several days journey off instead of a very few hours and besides it was once much the resort of kings and the centrepoint of great schemes of war and policy  one such house formerly belonging to a now extinct family that of ireland rises to the height of four stories and has a front consisting of what look like four projecting towers  there are ranges of embowered windows one above another to the full height of the house and these are surmounted by peaked gables  the people of those times certainly did not deny themselves light and while windowglass was an article of no very remote introduction it was probably a point of magnificence and wealthy display to have enough of it  one whole side of the room must often have been formed by the window  this ireland mansion as well as all the rest of the old houses in shrewsbury is a timber housethat is a skeleton of oak filled up with brick plaster or other material and with the beams of the timber marked out with black paint besides which in houses of any pretension there are generally trefoils and other gothiclooking ornaments likewise painted black  they have an indescribable charm for methe more i think because they are wooden but indeed i cannot tell why it is that i like them so well and am never tired of looking at them  a street was a development of human life in the days when these houses were built whereas a modern street is but the cold plan of an architect without individuality or character and without the human emotion which a man kneads into the walls which he builds on a scheme of his own  we strolled to a pleasant walk under a range of trees along the shore of the severn  it is called the quarry walk  the severn is a pretty river the largest i think unless it be such an estuary as the mersey that i have met with in england that is to say about a fair stonesthrow across  it is very gentle in its course and winds along between grassy and sedgy banks with a good growth of weeds in some part of its current it has one stately bridge called the english bridge of several arches and as we sauntered along the quarry walk we saw a ferry where the boat seemed to be navigated across by means of a rope stretched from bank to bank of the river  after leaving the quarry walk we passed an old tower of red freestone the only one remaining of those formerly standing at intervals along the whole course of the town wall and we also went along what little is now left of the wall itself  and thence through the irregular streets which gave no account of themselves we found our way i know not how back to our hotel  it is an uncheerful old hotel which takes upon itself to be in the best class of english country hotels and charges the best price very dark in the lower apartments pervaded with a musty odor but provided with a whiteneckclothed waiter who spares no ceremony in serving the joints of mutton  j and i afterwards walked forth again and went this time to the castle which stands exactly above the railway station  a path from its breadth quite a street leads up to the arched gateway but we found a board giving notice that these are private grounds and no strangers admitted so that we only passed through the gate a few steps and looked about us and retired on perceiving a man approaching us through the trees and shrubbery  a private individual it seems has burrowed in this old warlike den and turned the keep and any other available apartment into a modern dwelling and laid out his pleasuregrounds within the precincts of the castle wall which allows verge enough for the purpose  the ruins have been considerably repaired  this castle was built at various times the keep by edward i and other portions at an earlier period and it stands on the isthmus left by the severn in its wandering course about the town  the duke of cleveland now owns it  i do not know who occupies it  in the course of this walk we passed st marys churcha very old church indeed no matter how old but say eight hundred or a thousand years  it has a very tall spire and the spire is now undergoing repairs and seeing the door open i went into the porch but found no admission further  then walking around it through the churchyard we saw that all the venerable gothic windowsone of them grand in size were set with stained glass representing coats of arms and ancient armor and kingly robes and saints with glories about their heads and scriptural people but all of these as far as our actual perception was concerned quite colorless and with only a cold outline dimly filled up  yet had we been within the church and had the sunlight been streaming through what a warm rich gorgeous roseate golden life would these figures have showed  in the churchyard close upon the street so that its dust must be continually scattered over the spot i saw a heavy gray tombstone with a latin inscription purporting that bishop butler the author of the analogy in his lifetime had chosen this as a burialplace for himself and his family  there is a statue of him within the church  from the top of the spire a man above a hundred years ago attempted to descend by means of a rope to the other side of the severn but the rope broke and he fell in his midway flight and was killed  it was an undertaking worthy of sam patch  there is a record of the fact on the outside of the tower  i remember nothing more that we saw yesterday but before breakfast j and i sallied forth again and inspected the gateway and interior court of the council housea very interesting place both in itself and for the circumstances connected with it it having been the place where the councillors for the welsh marches used to reside during their annual meetings and charles the first also lived here for six weeks in 1612 james ii likewise held his court here in 1687  the house was originally built in 1501that is the council house itselfthe gateway and the house through which it passes being of as late date as 1620  this latter is a fine old house in the usual style of timber architecture with the timber lines marked out and quaint adornments in black paint and the pillars of the gateway which passes beneath the front chamber are of curiously carved oak which has probably stood the action of english atmosphere better than marble would have done  passing through this gateway we entered a court and saw some old buildings more or less modernized but without destroying their aged stateliness standing round three sides of it with arched entrances and bowwindows and windows in the roofs and peaked gables and all the delightful irregularity and variety that these houses have and which make them always so freshand with so much detail that every minute you see something heretofore unseen  it must have been no unfit residence for a king and his court when those three sides of the square all composing one great fantastic house were in their splendor  the square itself too must have been a busy and cheerful scene thronged with attendants guests horses etc  after breakfast we all walked out and crossing the english bridge looked at the severn over its parapet  the river is here broader than elsewhere and very shallow and has an island covered with bushes about midway across  just over the bridge we saw a church of red freestone and evidently very ancient  this is the church of the holy cross and is a portion of the abbey of st peter and st john which formerly covered ten acres of ground  we did not have time to go into the church but the windows and other points of architecture so far as we could discern them and knew how to admire them were exceedingly venerable and beautiful  on the other side of the street over a wide space there are other remains of the old abbey and the most interesting was a stone pulpit now standing in the open air seemingly in a garden but which originally stood in the refectory of the abbey and was the station whence one of the monks read to his brethren at their meals  the pulpit is much overgrown with ivy  we should have made further researches among these remains though they seem now to be in private grounds but a large mastiff came nut of his kennel and approaching us to the length of his iron chain began barking very fiercely  nor had we time to see half that we would gladly have seen and studied here and elsewhere about shrewsbury  it would have been very interesting to have visited hotspurs and falstaffs battlefield which is four miles from the town too distant certainly for falstaff to have measured the length of the fight by shrewsbury clock  there is now a church built there by henry iv and said to cover the bones of those slain in the battle  returning into the town we penetrated some narrow lanes where as the old story goes people might almost shake hands across from the top windows of the opposite houses impending towards each other  emerging into a wider street at a spot somewhat more elevated than other parts of the town we went into a shop to buy some royal shrewsbury cakes which we had seen advertised at several shop windows  they are a very rich cake with plenty of eggs sugar and butter and very little flour  a small public building of stone of modern date was close by and asking the shopwoman what it was she said it was the butter cross or market for butter eggs and poultry  it is a remarkable site for here in ancient times stood a stone cross where heralds used to make proclamation and where criminals of state used to be executed  david the last of the welsh princes was here cruelly put to death by edward i and many noblemen were beheaded on this spot after being taken prisoners in the battle of shrewsbury  i can only notice one other memorable place in shrewsbury and that is the raven inn where farquhar wrote his comedy of the recruiting officer in 1701  the window of the room in which he wrote is said to look into the inn yard and i went through the arched entrance to see if i could distinguish it  the hostlers were currying horses in the yard and so stared at me that i gave but the merest glance  the shrewsbury inns have not only the customary names of english innsas the lion the stagbut they have also the carved wooden figures of the object named whereas in all other towns the name alone remains  we left shrewsbury at half past ten and arrived in london at about four in the afternoon    london   september 7thon wednesday just before dusk j and i walked forth for the first time in london  our lodgings are in george street hanover square no 21 and st georges church where so many marriages in romance and in fashionable life have been celebrated is a short distance below our house in the same street  the edifice seems to be of white marble now much blackened with london smoke and has a grecian pillared portico  in the square just above us is a statue of william pitt  we went down bond street and part of regent street just estraying a little way from our temporary nest and taking good account of landmarks and corners so as to find our way readily back again  it is long since i have had such a childish feeling but all that i had heard and felt about the vastness of london made it seem like swimming in a boundless ocean to venture one step beyond the only spot i knew  my first actual impression of london was of stately and spacious streets and by no means so dusky and grimy as i had expectednot merely in the streets about this quarter of the town which is the aristocratic quarter but in all the streets through which we had passed from the railway station  if i had not first been so imbued with the smoke and dinginess of liverpool i should doubtless have seen a stronger contrast betwixt dusky london and the cheerful glare of our american cities there are no red bricks here all are of a dark hue and whatever of stone or stucco has been white soon clothes itself in mourning  yesterday forenoon i went out alone and plunged headlong into london and wandered about all day without any particular object in view but only to lose myself for the sake of finding myself unexpectedly among things that i had always read and dreamed about  the plan was perfectly successful for besides vague and unprofitable wanderings i saw in the course of the day hyde park regents park whitehall the two new houses of parliament charing cross st pauls the strand fleet street cheapside whitechapel leadenhall street the haymarket and a great many other places the names of which were classic in my memory  i think what interests me most here is the london of the writers of queen annes agewhatever pope the spectator de foe and down as late as johnson and goldsmith have mentioned  the monument for instance which is of no great height nor beauty compared with that on bunker hill charmed me prodigiously  st pauls appeared to me unspeakably grand and noble and the more so from the throng and bustle continually going on around its base without in the least disturbing the sublime repose of its great dome and indeed of all its massive height and breadth other edifices may crowd close to its foundation and people may tramp as they like about it but still the great cathedral is as quiet and serene as if it stood in the middle of salisbury plain  there cannot be anything else in its way so good in the world as just this effect of st pauls in the very heart and densest tumult of london  i do not know whether the church is built of marble or of whatever other white or nearly white material but in the time that it has been standing there it has grown black with the smoke of ages through which there are nevertheless gleams of white that make a most picturesque impression on the whole  it is much better than staring white the edifice would not be nearly so grand without this drapery of black  i did not find these streets of the old city so narrow and irregular as i expected  all the principal ones are sufficiently broad and there are few houses that look antique being i suppose generally modernfronted when not actually of modern substance  there is little or no show or pretension in this part of london it has a plain business airan air of homely actual life as of a metropolis of tradesmen who have been carrying on their traffic here in sober earnest for hundreds of years you observe on the signboards established ninety years in threadneedle street established in 1109denoting long pedigrees of silkmercers and hosiersde foes contemporaries still represented by their posterity who handle the hereditary yardstick on the same spot  i must not forget to say that i crossed the thames over a bridge which i think is near charing cross  afterwards i found my way to london bridge where there was a delightful density of throng  the thames is not so wide and majestic as i had imaginednothing like the mersey for example  as a picturesque object however flowing through the midst of a city it would lose by any increase of width  omnibuses are a most important aid to wanderers about london  i reached home well wearied about six oclock  in the course of the day i had seen one person whom i knewmr clarke to whom henry b introduced me when we went to see the great ship launched on the dee this i believe was in regent street  in that street too i saw a company of dragoons beautifully mounted and defensively armed in brass helmets and steel cuirasses polished to the utmost excess of splendor it was a pretty sight  at one of the public edifices on each side of the portal sat a mounted trooper similarly armed and with his carbine resting on his knee just as motionless as a statue  this too as a picturesque circumstance was very good and really made an impression on me with respect to the power and stability of the government though i could not help smiling at myself for it  but then the thought that for generations an armed warrior has always sat just there on his warsteed and with his weapon in his hand is pleasant to the imagination although it is questionable whether his carbine be loaded and no doubt if the authorities had any message to send they would choose some other messenger than this heavy dragoonthe electric wire for instance still if he and his horse were to be withdrawn from their post night or day for i suppose the sentinels are on duty all night it seems as if the monarchy would be subverted and the english constitution crumble into rubbish and in honest fact it will signify something like that when guard is relieved there for the last time   september 8thyesterday forenoon s the two eldest children and i went forth into london streets and proceeded down regent street and thence to st jamess park at the entrance of which is a statue of somebodyi forget whom  on the very spacious gravelwalks covering several acres in the rear of the horse guards some soldiers were going through their exercise and after looking at them awhile we strolled through the park alongside of a sheet of water in which various kinds of ducks geese and rare species of waterfowl were swimming  there was one swan of immense size which moved about among the lesser fowls like a stately fullrigged ship among gunboats  by and by we found ourselves near what we since have discovered to be buckingham palacea long building in the italian style but of no impressiveness and which one soon wearies of looking at  the queen having gone to scotland the day before the palace now looked deserted although there was a onehorse cab of shabby aspect standing at the principal front where doubtless the carriages of princes and the nobility draw up  there is a fountain playing before the palace and waterfowl love to swim under its perpetual showers  these ducks and geese are very tame and swim to the margin of the pond to be fed by visitors looking up at you with great intelligence  s asked a man in a sober suit of livery of whom we saw several about the park whose were some of the large mansions which we saw and he pointed out stafford house the residence of the duke of sutherland a very noble edifice much more beautiful than the palace though not so large also the house of the earl of ellesmere and residences of other noblemen  this range of mansions along the park from the spot whence we viewed them looks very much like beacon street in boston bordering on the common allowing for a considerable enlargement of scale in favor of the park residences  the park however has not the beautiful elms that overshadow boston common nor such a pleasant undulation of surface nor the fine offview of the country like that across charles river  i doubt whether london can show so delightful a spot as that common always excepting the superiority of english lawns which however is not so evident in the london parks there being less care bestowed on the grass than i should have expected  from this place we wandered into what i believe to be hyde park attracted by a gigantic figure on horseback which loomed up in the distance  the effect of this enormous steed and his rider is very grand seen in the misty atmosphere  i do not understand why we did not see st jamess palace which is situated i believe at the extremity of the same range of mansions of which stafford house is the opposite end  from the entrance of hyde park we seem to have gone along piccadilly and making two or three turns and getting bewildered i put s and the children into a cab and sent them home  continuing my wanderings i went astray among squares of large aristocraticlooking edifices all apparently new with no shops among them some yet unfinished and the whole seeming like a city built for a colony of gentlefolks who might be expected to emigrate thither in a body  it was a dreary business to wander there turning corner after corner and finding no way of getting into a less stately and more genial region  at last however i passed in front of the queens mews where sentinels were on guard and where a jollylooking man in a splendidly laced scarlet coat and whitetopped boots was lounging at the entrance  he looked like the prince of grooms or coachmen      the corner of hyde park was within a short distance and i took a hansom at the cabstand there and drove to the american despatch agency 26 henrietta street covent garden having some documents of state to be sent by todays steamer  the business of forwarding despatches to america and distributing them to the various legations and consulates in europe must be a pretty extensive one for mr miller has a large office and two clerks in attendance  from this point i went through covent garden market and got astray in the city so that i can give no clear account of my afternoons wanderings  i passed through holborn however and i think it was from that street that i passed through an archway which i almost invariably do when i see one and found myself in a very spacious gravelled square surrounded on the four sides by a continuous edifice of dark brick very plain and of cold and stern aspect  this was grays inn all tenanted by a multitude of lawyers  passing thence i saw furnivals inn over another archway but being on the opposite side of the street i did not go thither  in holborn still i went through another arched entrance over which was staples inn and here likewise seemed to be offices but in a court opening inwards from this there was a surrounding seclusion of quiet dwellinghouses with beautiful green shrubbery and grassplots in the court and a great many sunflowers in full bloom  the windows were open it was a lovely summer afternoon and i have a sense that bees were humming in the court though this may have been suggested by my fancy because the sound would have been so well suited to the scene  a boy was reading at one of the windows there was not a quieter spot in england than this and it was very strange to have drifted into it so suddenly out of the bustle and rumble of holborn and to lose all this repose as suddenly on passing through the arch of the outer court  in all the hundreds of years since london was built it has not been able to sweep its roaring tide over that little island of quiet  in holborn i saw the most antiquelooking houses that i have yet met with in london but none of very remarkable aspect  i think i must have been under a spell of enchantment today connecting me with st pauls for trying to get away from it by various avenues i still got bewildered and again and again saw its great dome and pinnacles before me  i observe that the smoke has chiefly settled on the lower part of the edifice leaving its loftier portions and its spires much less begrimed  it is very beautiful very rich  i did not think that anything but gothic architecture could so have interested me  the statues the niches the embroidery as it were of sculpture traced around it produced a delightful effect  in front of st pauls there is a statue of queen anne which looks rather more majestic i doubt not than that fat old dame ever did  st pauls churchyard had always been a place of immense interest in my imagination  it is merely the not very spacious street running round the base of the churchat least this street is included in the churchyard together with the enclosure immediately about the church sowed with tombstones  i meant to look for the childrens bookshop but forgot it or neglected it from not feeling so much interest in a thing near at hand as when it seemed unattainable  i watched a man tearing down the brick wall of a house that did not appear very old but it surprised me to see how crumbly the brickwork was one stroke of his pick often loosening several bricks in a row  it is my opinion that brick houses after a moderate term of years stand more by habit and courtesy than through any adhesive force of the old mortar  i recommenced my wanderings but i remember nothing else particularly claiming to be mentioned unless it be paternoster rowa little narrow darksome lane in which it being now dusk in that density of the city i could not very well see what signs were over the doors  in this street or thereabouts i got into an omnibus and being set down near regents circus reached home well wearied   september 9thyesterday having some tickets to the zoological gardens we went thither with the two eldest children  it was a most beautiful sunny day the very perfection of english weatherwhich is as much as to say the best weather in the world except perhaps some few days in an american october  these gardens are at the end of regents park farthest from london and they are very extensive though i think not quite worthy of londonnot so good as one would expect them to benot so fine and perfect a collection of beasts birds and fishes as one might fairly look for when the greatest metropolis of the world sets out to have such a collection at allmy idea was that here every living thing was provided for in the way best suited to its nature and habits and that the refinement of civilization had here restored a garden of eden where all the animal kingdom had regained a happy home  this is not quite the case though i believe the creatures are as comfortable as could he expected and there are certainly a good many strange beasts here  the hippopotamus is the chief treasure of the collectionan immense almost misshapen mass of flesh  at this moment i do not remember anything that interested me except a sick monkeya very large monkey and elderly he seemed to be  his keeper brought him some sweetened apple and water and some tea for the monkey had quite lost his appetite and refused all ordinary diet  he came however quite eagerly and smelt of the tea and apple the keeper exhorting him very tenderly to eat  but the poor monkey shook his head slowly and with the most pitiable expression at the same time extending his hand to take the keepers as if claiming his sympathy and friendship  by and by the keeper who is rather a surly fellow essayed harsher measures and insisted that the monkey should eat what had been brought for him and hereupon ensued somewhat of a struggle and the tea was overturned upon the straw of the bed  then the keeper scolded him and seizing him by one arm drew him out of his little bedroom into the larger cage upon which the wronged monkey began a loud dissonant reproachful chatter more expressive of a sense of injury than any words could be  observing the spectators in front of the cage he seemed to appeal to them and addressed his chatter thitherward and stretched out his long lean arm and black hand between the bars as if claiming the grasp of any one friend he might have in the whole world  he was placable however for when the keeper called him in a gentler tone he hobbled towards him with a very stiff and rusty movement and the scene closed with their affectionately hugging one another  but i fear the poor monkey will die in a future state of being i think it will be one of my inquiries in reference to the mysteries of the present state why monkeys were made the creator could not surely have meant to ridicule his own work  it might rather be fancied that satan had perpetrated monkeys with a malicious purpose of parodying the masterpiece of creation  the aquarium containing in some of its compartments specimens of the animal and vegetable life of the sea and in others those of the fresh water was richly worth inspecting but not nearly so perfect as it might be  now i think we have a right to claim in a metropolitan establishment of this kind in all its departments a degree of perfection that shall quite outdo the unpractised thought of any man on that particular subject  there were a good many welldressed people and children in the gardens saturday being a fashionable day for visiting them  one great amusement was feeding some bears with biscuits and cakes of which they seemed exceedingly fond  one of the three bears clambered to the top of a high pole whence he invited the spectators to hand him bits of cake on the end of a stick or to toss them into his mouth which he opened widely for that purpose  another apparently an elderly bear not having skill nor agility for these gymnastics sat on the ground on his hinder end groaning most pitifully  the third took what stray bits he could get without earning them by any antics  at four oclock there was some music from the band of the first lifeguards a great multitude of chairs being set on the greensward in the sunshine and shade for the accommodation of the auditors  here we had the usual exhibition of english beauty neither superior nor otherwise to what i have seen in other parts of england  before the music was over we walked slowly homeward along beside regents park which is very prettily laid out but lacks some last touch of richness and beauty though after all i do not well see what more could be done with grass trees and gravelwalks  the children especially j who had raced from one thing to another all day long grew tired so we put them into a cab and walked slowly through portland place where are a great many noble mansions yet no very admirable architecture none that possessed nor that ever can possess the indefinable charm of some of those poor old timber houses in shrewsbury  the art of domestic architecture is lost  we can rear stately and beautiful dwellings though we seldom do but they do not seem proper to the life of man in the same way that his shell is proper to the lobster nor indeed is the mansion of the nobleman proper to him in the same kind and degree that a hut is proper to a peasant  from portland place we passed into regent street and soon reached home   september 10thyesterday forenoon we walked out with the children intending for charing cross but missing our way as usual we went down a rather wide and stately street and saw before us an old brick edifice with a pretty extensive front over which rose a clocktowerthe whole dingy and looking both gloomy and mean  there was an arched entrance beneath the clocktower at which two guardsmen in their bearskin caps were stationed as sentinels and from this circumstance and our having some guess at the locality we concluded the old brick building to be st jamess palace  otherwise we might have taken it for a prison or for a hospital which in truth it was at first intended for  but certainly there are many paupers in england who live in edifices of far more architectural pretension externally than this principal palace of the english sovereigns  seeing other people go through the archway we also went meeting no impediment from the sentinels and found ourselves in a large paved court in the centre of which a banner was stuck down with a few soldiers standing near it  this flag was the banner of the regiment of guards on duty  the aspect of the interior court was as naked and dismal as the outside the brick being of that dark hue almost universal in england  on one side of the court there was a door which seemed to give admission to a chapel into which several persons went and probably we might have gone too had we liked  from this court we penetrated into at least two or three others for the palace is very extensive and all of it so far as i could see on the same patternlarge enclosed courts paved and quite bare of grass shrubbery or any beautiful thingdark stern brick walls without the slightest show of architectural beauty or even an ornament over the square commonplace windows looking down on those forlorn courts  a carriagedrive passes through it if i remember aright from the principal front emerging by one of the sides and i suppose that the carriages roll through the palace at the levees and drawingrooms  there was nothing to detain us here any long time so we went from court to court and came out through a sideopening  the edifice is battlemented all round and this with somewhat of fantastic in the shape of the clocktower is the only attempt at ornament in the whole  then we skirted along st jamess park passing marlborough housea red brick buildingand a very long range of stone edifices which whether they were public or private one house or twenty we knew not  we ascended the steps of the york column and soon reached charing cross and trafalgar square where there are more architectural monuments than in any other one place in london besides two fountains playing in large reservoirs of water and various edifices of note and interest  northumberland house now and for a long while the town residence of the percys stands on the strand sideover the entrance a lion very spiritedly sculptured flinging out his long tail  on another side of the square is morleys hotel exceedingly spacious and looking more american than anything else in the hotel line that i have seen here  the nelson monument with lord nelson in a cocked hat on its top is very grand in its effect  all about the square there were sundry loungers people looking at the basreliefs on nelsons column children paddling in the reservoirs of the fountains and it being a sunny day it was a cheerful and lightsome as well as an impressive scene  on second thoughts i do not know but that london should have a far better display of architecture and sculpture than this on its finest site and in its very centre for after all there is nothing of the very best but i missed nothing at the time  in the afternoon s and i set out to attend divine service in westminster abbey  on our way thither we passed through pall mall which is full of clubhouses and we were much struck with the beauty of the one lately erected for the carleton club  it is built of a buffcolored or yellowish stone with pillars or pilasters of polished aberdeen granite wonderfully rich and beautiful and there is a running border of sculptured figures all round the upper part of the building besides other ornament and embroidery wherever there was room or occasion for it  it being an oblong square the smooth and polished aspect in this union of two rich colors in itthis delicacy and minuteness of finish this lavish ornamentmade me think of a ladys jewelbox and if it could be reduced to the size of about a foot square or less it would make the very prettiest one that ever was seen  i question whether it have any right to be larger than a jewelbox but it is certainly a most beautiful edifice  we turned down whitehall at the head of which over the very spot where the regicides were executed stands the bronze equestrian statue of charles ithe statue that was buried under the earth during the whole of cromwells time and emerged after the restoration  we saw the admiralty and the horseguards and in front of the latter the two mounted sentinels one of whom was flirting and laughing with some girls  on the other side of the street stands the banquetinghouse built by inigo jones from a window of which king charles stepped forth wearing a kingly head which within a few minutes afterwards fell with a dead thump on the scaffold  it was nobly done and nobly suffered  how rich is history in the little space around this spot  i find that the day after i reached london i entirely passed by westminster abbey without knowing it partly because my eyes were attracted by the gaudier show of the new houses of parliament and partly because this part of the abbey has been so much repaired and renewed that it has not the marks of age  looking at its front i now found it very grand and venerable but it is useless to attempt a description these things are not to be translated into words they can be known only by seeing them and until seen it is well to shape out no idea of them impressions states of mind produced by noble spectacles of whatever kind are all that it seems worth while to attempt reproducing with the pen  after coming out of the abbey we looked at the two houses of parliament directly across the wayan immense structure and certainly most splendid built of a beautiful warmcolored stone  the building has a very elaborate finish and delighted me at first but by and by i began to be sensible of a weariness in the effect a lack of variety in the plan and ornament a deficiency of invention so that instead of being more and more interested the longer one looks as is the case with an old gothic edifice and continually reading deeper into it one finds that one has seen all in seeing a little piece and that the magnificent palace has nothing better to show one or to do for one  it is wonderful how the old weatherstained and smokeblackened abbey shames down this brandnewness not that the parliament houses are not fine objects to look at too  yesterday morning we walked to charing cross with u and j and there took a cab to the tower driving thither through the strand fleet street past st pauls and amid all the thickest throng of the city  i have not a very distinct idea of the tower but remember that our cab drove within an outer gate where we alighted at a ticketoffice the old royal fortress being now a regular showplace at sixpence a head including the sight of armory and crownjewels  we saw about the gate several warders or yeomen of the guard or beefeaters dressed in scarlet coats of antique fashion richly embroidered with golden crowns both on the breast and back and other royal devices and insignia so that they looked very much like the kings on a pack of cards or regular trumps at all events  i believe they are old soldiers promoted to this position for good conduct  one of them took charge of us and when a sufficient number of visitors had collected with us he led us to see what very small portion of the tower is shown  there is a great deal of ground within the outer precincts and it has streets and houses and inhabitants and a church within it and going up and down behind the warder without any freedom to get acquainted with the place by strolling about i know little more about it than when i went inonly recollecting a mean and disagreeable confusion of brick walls barracks paved courts with here and there a low bulky turret of rather antique aspect and in front of one of the edifices a range of curious old cannon lying on the ground some of them immensely large and long and beautifully wrought in brass  i observed by a plan however that the white tower containing the armory stands about in the centre of the fortress and that it is a square battlemented structure having a turret at each angle  we followed the warder into the white tower and there saw in the first place a long gallery of mounted knights and men at arms which has been so often described that when i wish to recall it to memory i shall turn to some other persons account of it  i was much struck however with the beautiful execution of a good many of the suits of armor and the exquisite detail with which they were engraved  the artists of those days attained very great skill in this kind of manufacture  the figures of the knights too in full array undoubtedly may have shown a combination of stateliness and grace which heretofore i have not believed innot seeing how it could be compatible with iron garments  but it is quite incomprehensible how in the time of the heaviest armor they could strike a blow or possess any freedom of movement except such as a turtle is capable of and in truth they are said not to have been able to rise up when overthrown  they probably stuck out their lances and rode straight at the enemy depending upon upsetting him by their mass and weight  in the row of knights is henry viii also charles brandon duke of suffolk who must have been an immensely bulky man also a splendid suit of armor gilded all over presented by the city of london to charles i also two or three suits of boys armor for the little princes of the house of stuart  they began to wear these burdens betimes in order that their manhood might be the more tolerant of them  we went through this gallery so hastily that it would have been about as well not to have seen it at all  then we went up a winding stair to another room containing armor and weapons and beautiful brass cannon that appeared to have been for ornament rather than use some of them being quite covered with embossed sculpture marvellously well wrought  in this room was john of gaunts suit indicating a man seven feet high and the armor seems to bear the marks of much wear but this may be owing to great scrubbing throughout the centuries since john of gaunt died  there too we saw the cloak in which wolfe fell on the plains of abrahama coarse faded threadbare lightcolored garment folded up under a glass case  many other things we might have seen worthy of being attended to had there been time to look at them  following into still another room we were told that this was sir walter raleighs apartment while confined in the tower so that it was within these walls that he wrote the history of the world  the room was formerly lighted by lancet windows and must have been very gloomy but if he had the whole length of it to himself it was a good space to walk and meditate in  on one side of the apartment is a low door giving admittance we were told to the cell where raleigh slept so we went in and found it destitute of any window and so dark that we could not estimate its small extent except by feeling about  at the threshold of this sleepingkennel there were one or two inscriptions scratched in the wall but not i believe by raleigh  in this apartment among a great many other curious things are shown the devilish instruments of torture which the spaniards were bringing to england in their armada and at the end of the room sits queen elizabeth on horseback in her high ruff and faded finery  very likely none of these clothes were ever on her actual person  here too we saw a headsmans blocknot that on which raleigh was beheaded which i would have given gold to see but the one which was used for the scotch lords kilmarnock lovat and others executed on account of the rebellion of 1745  it is a block of oak about two feet high with a large knot in it so that it would not easily be split by a blow of the axe hewn and smoothed in a very workmanlike way and with a hollow to accommodate the head and shoulders on each side  there were two or three very strong marks of the axe in the part over which the neck lay and several smaller cuts as if the first stroke nearly severed the head and then the chopping off was finished by smaller blows as we see a butcher cutting meat with his cleaver  a headsmans axe was likewise shown usits date unknown  in the white tower we were shown the regalia under a glass and within an iron cage  edward the confessors golden staff was very finely wrought and there were a great many pretty things but i have a suspicion i know not why that these are not the real jewelsat least that such inestimable ones as the kohinoor or however it is spelt are less freely exhibited  the warder then led us into a paved court which he said was the place of execution of all royal personages and others who from motives of fear or favor were beheaded privately  raleigh was among these and so was anne boleyn  we then followed to the beauchamp tower where many state prisoners of note were confined and where on the walls of one of the chambers there are several inscriptions and sculptures of various devices done by the prisonersand very skilfully done too though perhaps with no better instrument than an old nail  these poor wretches had time and leisure enough to spend upon their work  this chamber is lighted by small lancet windows pierced at equal intervals round the circle of the beauchamp tower and it contains a large square fireplace in which is now placed a small modern stove  we were hurried away before we could even glance at the inscriptions and we saw nothing else except the low obscure doorway in the bloody tower leading to the staircase under which were found the supposed bones of the little princes and lastly the round norman arch opening to the water passage called the traitors gate  finally we ate some cakes and buns in the refreshmentroom connected with the ticketoffice and then left the fortress  the ancient moat by the way has been drained within a few years and now forms a great hollow space with grassy banks round about the citadel  we now wished to see the thames and therefore threaded our way along thames street towards london bridge passing through a fishmarket which i suppose to be the actual billingsgate whence originated all the foul language in england  under london bridge there is a station for steamers running to greenwich and woolwich  we got on board one of these not very well knowing nor much caring whither it might take us and steamed down the river which is bordered with the shabbiest blackest ugliest meanest buildings it is the back side of the town and in truth the muddy tide of the thames deserves to see no better there was a great deal of shipping in the river and many steamers and it was much more crowded than the mersey where all the ships go into docks but the vessels were not so fine  by and by we reached greenwich and went ashore there proceeding up from the quay past beershops and eatinghouses in great numbers and variety  greenwich hospital is here a very prominent object and after passing along its extensive front facing towards the river we entered one of the principal gates as we found ourselves free to do  we now left the hospital and steamed back to london bridge whence we went up into the city and to finish the labors of the day ascended the monument  this seems to be still a favorite adventure with the cockneys for we heard one woman who went up with us saying that she had been thinking of going up all her life and another said that she had gone up thirty years ago  there is an iron railing or rather a cage round the top through which it would be impossible for people to force their way in order to precipitate themselves as six persons have heretofore done there was a mist over london so that we did not gain a very clear view except of the swarms of people running about like ants in the streets at the foot of the monument  descending i put s and the children into a cab and i myself wandered about the city  passing along fleet street i turned in through an archway which i rightly guessed to be the entrance to the temple  it is a very large space containing many large solemn and serious edifices of dark brick and no sooner do you pass under the arch than all the rumble and bustle of london dies away at once and it seems as if a person might live there in perfect quiet without suspecting that it was not always a sabbath  people appear to have their separate residences here but i do not understand what is the economy of their lives  quite in the deepest interior of this region there is a large garden bordering on the thames along which it has a gravelwalk and benches where it would be pleasant to sit  on one edge of the garden there is some scanty shrubbery and flowers of no great brilliancy and the greensward with which the garden is mostly covered is not particularly rich nor verdant  emerging from the temple i stopped at a tavern in the strand the waiter of which observed to me they say sebastopol is taken sir  it was only such an interesting event that could have induced an english waiter to make a remark to a stranger not called for in the way of business  the best view we had of the townin fact the only external view and the only time we really saw the white towerwas from the river as we steamed past it  here the high square battlemented white tower with the four turrets at its corners rises prominently above all other parts of the fortress   september 13thmr  the american minister called on me on tuesday and left his card an intimation that i ought sooner to have paid my respects to him so yesterday forenoon i set out to find his residence 56 harley street  it is a street out of cavendish square in a fashionable quarter although fashion is said to be ebbing away from it  the ambassador seems to intend some little state in his arrangements but no doubt the establishment compares shabbily enough with those of the legations of other great countries and with the houses of the english aristocracy  a servant not in livery or in a very unrecognizable one opened the door for me and gave my card to a sort of upper attendant who took it in to mr   he had three gentlemen with him so desired that i should be ushered into the office of the legation until he should be able to receive me  here i found a clerk or attache mr m who has been two or three years on this side of the water an intelligent person who seems to be in correspondence with the new york courier and enquirer  by and by came in another american to get a passport for the continent and soon the three gentlemen took leave of the ambassador and i was invited to his presence  the tall large figure of mr  has a certain air of state and dignity he carries his head in a very awkward way but still looks like a man of long and high authority and with his white hair is now quite venerable  there is certainly a lack of polish a kind of rusticity notwithstanding which you feel him to be a man of the world  i should think he might succeed very tolerably in english society being heavy and sensible cool kindly and goodhumored with a great deal of experience of life  we talked about various matters politics among the rest and he observed that if the president had taken the advice which he gave him in two long letters before his inauguration he would have had a perfectly quiet and successful term of office  the advice was to form a perfectly homogeneous cabinet of union men and to satisfy the extremes of the party by a fair distribution of minor offices whereas he formed his cabinet of extreme men on both sides and gave the minor offices to moderate ones  but the antislavery people surely had no representative in the cabinet  mr  further observed that he thought the president had a fair chance of renomination for that the south could not in honor desert him to which i replied that the south had been guilty of such things heretofore  mr  thinks that the next presidential term will be more important and critical both as to our foreign relations and internal affairs than any preceding onewhich i should judge likely enough to be the case although i heard the sane prophecy often made respecting the present term  the ambassador dined with us at rock park a year or two ago and i then felt and always feel as if he were a man of hearty feeling and simplicity and certainly it would be unjust to conclude otherwise merely from the fact very suspicious it is true of his having been a lifelong politician  after we had got through a little matter of business respecting a young american who has enlisted at liverpool the minister rang his bell and ordered another visitor to be admitted and so i took my leave  in the other room i found the secretary of legationa tall slender man of about forty with a small head and facegentlemanly enough sensible and well informed yet i should judge not quite up to his place  there was also a dr b from michigan present and i rather fancy the ambassador is quite as much bored with visitors as the consul at liverpool  before i left the office mr  came in with miss sarah clarke on his arm  she had come thither to get her passport vised and when her business was concluded we went out together  she was going farther towards the west end and i into the city so we soon parted and i lost myself among the streets and squares arriving at last at oxford street though even then i did not know whether my face were turned cityward or in the opposite direction  crossing regent street however i became sure of my whereabout and went on through holborn and sought hither and thither for grace church street in order to find the american consul general campbell for i needed his aid to get a bank postbill cashed  but i could not find the street go where i would so at last i went to no 65 cheapside and introduced myself to mr  whom i already knew by letter and by a good many of his poems which he has sent me and by two excellent watches which i bought of him  this establishment though it has the ordinary front of dingy brick common to buildings in the city looks like a timelong stand the old shop of a london tradesman with a large figure of a watch over the door a great many watches and yet no gorgeous show of them in the window a low dark front shop and a little room behind where there was a chair or two  mr  is a small slender young man quite unenglish in aspect with black curly hair a thin dark colorless visage very animated and of quick expression with a nervous temperament     he dismounted from a desk when my card was handed to him and turned to me with a vivid glad look of recognition  we talked in the first place about poetry and such matters about england and america and the nature and depth of their mutual dislike and of course the slavery question came up as it always does in one way or another  anon i produced my bank postbill and mr  kindly engaged to identify me at the bank being ready to swear to me he said on the strength of my resemblance to my engraved portrait  so we set out for the bank of england and arriving there were directed to the proper clerk after much inquiry but he told us that the bill was not yet due having been drawn at seven days and having two still to runwhich was the fact  as i was almost shillingless mr  now offered to cash it for me  he is very kind and good     arriving at his shop again he went out to procure the money and soon returned with it  at my departure he gave me a copy of a new poem of his entitled verdicts somewhat in the manner of lowells satire     mr  resides now at greenwich whither he hoped i would come and see him on my return to london  perhaps i will for i like him  it seems strange to see an englishman with so little physical ponderosity and obtuseness of nerve  after parting from him it being three oclock or thereabouts i resumed my wanderings about the city of which i never weary as long as i can put one foot before the other  seeing that the door of st pauls under one of the semicircular porches was partially open i went in and found that the afternoon service was about to be performed so i remained to hear it and to see what i could of the cathedral  what a total and admirable contrast between this and a gothic church the latter so dim and mysterious with its various aisles its intricacy of pointed arches its dark walls and columns and pavement and its painted glass windows bedimming even what daylight might otherwise get into its eternal evening  but this cathedral was full of light and light was proper to it  there were no painted windows no dim recesses but a wide and airy space beneath the dome and even through the long perspective of the nave there was no obscurity but one lofty and beautifully rounded arch succeeding to another as far as the eye could reach  the walls were white the pavement constructed of squares of gray and white marble  it is a most grand and stately edifice and its characteristic stems to be to continue forever fresh and new whereas such a church as westminster abbey must have been as venerable as it is now from the first day when it grew to be an edifice at all  how wonderful man is in his works  how glad i am that there can be two such admirable churches in their opposite styles as st pauls and westminster abbey  the organ was played while i was there and there was an anthem beautifully chanted by voices that came from afar off and remotely above as if out of a sunny sky  meanwhile i looked at such monuments as were near chiefly those erected to military or naval menpicton general ponsonby lord st vincent and others but against one of the pillars stands a statue of dr johnsona noble and thoughtful figure with a development of muscle befitting an athlete  i doubt whether sculptors do not err in point of taste by making all their statues models of physical perfection instead of expressing by them the individual character and habits of the man  the statue in the marketplace at lichfield has more of the homely truth of johnsons actual personality than this  st pauls as yet is by no means crowded with monuments there is indeed plenty of room for a mob of the illustrious yet to come  but it seems to me that the character of the edifice would be injured by allowing the monuments to be clustered together so closely as at westminster by incrusting the walls with them or letting the statues throng about the pedestals of columns  there must be no confusion in such a cathedral as this and i question whether the effect will ever be better than it is now when each monument has its distinct place and as your eye wanders around you are not distracted from noting each marble man in his niche against the wall or at the base of a marble pillar space distance light regularity are to be preserved even if the result should be a degree of nakedness  i saw mr appleton of the legation and dr brown on the floor of the cathedral  they were about to go over the whole edifice and had engaged a guide for that purpose but as i intend to go thither again with s i did not accompany them but went away the quicker that one of the gentlemen put on his hat and i was ashamed of being seen in company with a man who could wear his hat in a cathedral  not that he meant any irreverence but simply felt that he was in a great public buildingas big nearly as all out of doorsand so forgot that it was a consecrated place of worship  the sky is the dome of a greater cathedral than st pauls and built by a greater architect than sir christopher wren and yet we wear our hats unscrupulously beneath it  i remember no other event of importance except that i penetrated into a narrow lane or court either in the strand or fleet street where was a tavern calling itself the old thatched house and purporting to have been nell gwyns dairy  i met with a great many alleys and obscure archways in the course of the days wanderings   september 14thyesterday in the earlier part of the day it poured with rain and i did not go out till five oclock in the afternoon nor did i then meet with anything interesting  i walked through albemarle street for the purpose of looking at murrays shop but missed it entirely at my first inquisition  the street is one of hotels principally with only a few tradesmens shops and has a quiet aristocratic aspect  on my return down the other sidewalk i did discover the famous publishers locality but merely by the name mr murray engraved on a rather large brass plate such as doctors use on the door  there was no sign of a book nor of its being a place of trade in any way and i should have taken the house to be if not a private mansion then a lawyers office  at seven oclock s u and i went to dine with mr r s in portland place     mr ss house is a very fine one and he gave us a very quiet elegant and enjoyable dinner in much better taste and with less fuss than some others we have attended elsewhere  mr s is a friend of thackeray and speaking of the last number of the newcomesso touching that nobody can read it aloud without breaking downhe mentioned that thackeray himself had read it to james russell lowell and william story in a cidercellar  i read all the preceding numbers of the newcomes to my wife but happened not to have an opportunity to read this last and was glad of itknowing that my eyes would fill and my voice quiver  mr s likes thackeray and thinks him a good fellow  mr s has aor i dont know but i ought better to say thebeautiful fulllength picture of washington by stuart and i was proud to see that noblest face and figure here in england  the picture of a man beside whom considered physically any english nobleman whom i have seen would look like common clay  speaking of thackeray i cannot but wonder at his coolness in respect to his own pathos and compare it with my emotions when i read the last scene of the scarlet letter to my wife just after writing ittried to read it rather for my voice swelled and heaved as if i were tossed up and down on an ocean as it subsides after a storm  but i was in a very nervous state then having gone through a great diversity of emotion while writing it for many months  i think i have never overcome my own adamant in any other instance  tumblers handorganists puppetshowmen bagpipers and all such vagrant mirthmakers are very numerous in the streets of london  the other day passing through fleet street i saw a crowd filling up a narrow court and high above their heads a tumbler standing on his head on the top of a pole that reached as high as the third story of the neighboring houses  sliding down the pole head foremost he disappeared out of my sight  a multitude of punches go the mounds continually  two have passed through hanover street where we reside this morning  the first asked two shillings for his performance so we sent him away  the second demanded in the first place half a crown but finally consented to take a shilling and gave us the show at that price though much maimed in its proportions  besides the spectators in our windows he had a little crowd on the sidewalk to whom he went round for contributions but i did not observe that anybody gave him so much as a halfpenny  it is strange to see how many people are aiming at the small change in your pocket  in every square a beggarwoman meets you and turns back to follow your steps with her miserable murmur  at the streetcrossings there are old men or little girls with their brooms urchins propose to brush your boots and if you get into a cab a man runs to open the door for you and touches his hat for a fee as he closes it again   september 15thit was raining yesterday and i kept within doors till after four oclock when j and i took a walk into the city  seeing the entrance to clements inn we went through it and saw the garden with a kneeling bronze figure in it and when just in the midst of the inn i remembered that justice shallow was of old a student there  i do not well understand these inns of court or how they differ from other places  anybody seems to be free to reside in them and a residence does not seem to involve any obligation to study law or to have any connection therewith  clements inn consists of large brick houses accessible by narrow lanes and passages but by some peculiar privilege or enchantment enjoying a certain quiet and repose though in close vicinity to the noisiest part of the city  i got bewildered in the neighborhood of st pauls and try how i might to escape from it its huge dusky dome kept showing itself before me through one street and another  in my endeavors to escape it i at one time found myself in st johns street and was in hopes to have seen the old st johns gate so familiar for above a century on the cover of the gentlemans magazine but i suppose it is taken down for we went through the entire street i think and saw no trace of it  either afterwards or before this we came upon smithfield a large irregular square filled up with pens for cattle of which however there were none in the market at that time  i leaned upon a post at the western end of the square and told j how the martyrs had been burnt at smithfield in bloody marys days  again we drifted back to st pauls and at last in despair of ever getting out of this enchanted region i took a hansom cab to charing cross whence we easily made our way home    liverpool   september 16thi took the tenoclock train yesterday morning from the euston station and arrived at liverpool at about five passing through the valley of trent without touching at birmingham  english scenery on the tracks is the tamest of the tame hardly a noticeable hill breaking the ordinary gentle undulation of the landscape but still the verdure and finish of the fields and parks make it worth while to throw out a glance now and then as you rush by  few separate houses are seen as in america but sometimes a village with the square gray battlemented tower of its norman church and rows of thatched cottages reminding one of the clustered mudnests of swallows under the eaves of a barn here and there a lazy little river like the trent perhaps if you look sharply where the guidebook indicates the turrets of an old castle in the distance perhaps the great steeple and spires of a cathedral perhaps the tall chimney of a manufactory but on the whole the traveller comes to his journeys end unburdened with a single new idea i observe that the harvest is not all gathered in as yet and this rainy weather must look very gloomy to the farmer  i saw gleaners yesterday in the stubblefields  there were two gentlemen in the same railwaycarriage with me and we did not exchange half a dozen words the whole day  i am here established at mrs blodgetts boardinghouse which i find quite full insomuch that she had to send one of her seacaptains to sleep in another house in order to make room for me  it is exclusively american society four shipmasters and a doctor from pennsylvania who has been travelling a year on the continent and who seems to be a man of very active intelligence interested in everything and especially in agriculture     he asserted that we are fifty years ahead of england in agricultural science and that he could cultivate english soil to far better advantage than english farmers do and at vastly less expense their tendency to cling to old ideas which retards them in everything else keeps them behindhand in this matter too  really i do not know any other place in england where a man can be made so sensible that he lives in a progressive world as here in mrs blodgetts boardinghouse  the captains talk together about their voyages and how they manage with their unruly mates and crews and how freights are in america and the prospects of business and of equinoctial gales and the qualities of different ships and their commanders and how crews mates and masters have all deteriorated since their remembrance     but these men are alive and talk of real matters and of matters which they know  the shipmasters who come to mrs blodgetts are favorable specimens of their class being all respectable men in the employ of good houses and raised by their capacity to the command of firstrate ships  in my official intercourse with them i do not generally see their best side as they are seldom before me except as complainants or when summoned to answer to some complaint made by a seaman  but hearing their daily talk and listening to what is in their minds and their reminiscences of what they have gone through one becomes sensible that they are men of energy and ability fit to be trusted and retaining a hardy sense of honor and a loyalty to their own country the stronger because they have compared it with many others  most of them are gentlemen too to a certain extentsome more than others perhaps and none to a very exquisite point or if so it is none the better for them as sailors or as men   september 17thit is singular to feel a sense of my own country returning upon me with the intercourse of the people whom i find here      the doctor is much the most talkative of our company and sometimes bores me thereby though he seldom says anything that is not either instructive or amusing  he tells a curious story of prince albert and how he avails himself of american sharpshooting  during the doctors tour in scotland which he has just finished he became acquainted with one of the princes attaches who invited him very earnestly to join his royal highnesss party promising him a good gun and a keeper to load it for him two good dogs besides as many cigars as he could smoke and as much wine as he could drink on the condition that whatever game he shot should be the princes  the prince said the attache is very fond of having americans in his shootingparties on  account of their being such excellent shots and there was one with him last year who shot so admirably that his royal highness himself left off shooting in utter astonishment  the attache offered to introduce the doctor to the prince who would be certain to receive him very graciously      i think perhaps we talk of kings and queens more at our table than people do at other tables in england not of course that we like them better or admire them more but that they are curiosities  yet i would not say that the doctor may not be susceptible on the point of royal attentions for he told us with great complacency how emphatically on two or three occasions louis napoleon had returned his bow and the last time had turned and made some remark evidently about the doctor to the empress      i ought not to omit mentioning that he has been told in france that he personally resembles the emperor and i suspect he is trying to heighten the resemblance by training his mustache on the pattern of that which adorns the imperial upper lip  he is a genuine american character though modified by a good deal of travel a very intelligent man full of various ability with eyes all over him for any object of interesta little of the bore sometimesquick to appreciate character with a good deal of tact gentlemanly in his manners but yet lacking a deep and delicate refinement  not but that americans are as capable of this last quality as other people are but what with the circumstances amid which we grow up and the peculiar activity of our minds we certainly do often miss it  by the by he advanced a singular proposition the other evening namely that the english people do not so well understand comfort or attain it so perfectly in their domestic arrangements as we do  i thought he hardly supported this opinion so satisfactorily as some of his other new ideas  i saw in an american paper yesterday that an opera still unfinished had been written on the story of the scarlet letter and that several scenes of it had been performed successfully in new york  i should think it might possibly succeed as an opera though it would certainly fail as a play    london   september 24thon saturday at half past three oclock i left liverpool by the london and northwest railway for london  mrs blodgetts table had been thinned by several departures during the week     my mind had been considerably enlivened and my sense of american superiority renewed by intercourse with these people and there is no danger of ones intellect becoming a standing pool in such society i think better of american shipmasters too than i did from merely meeting them in my office  they keep up a continual discussion of professional matters and of all things having any reference to their profession the laws of insurance the rights of vessels in foreign ports the authority and customs of vessels of war with regard to merchantmen etcwith stories and casual anecdotes of their seaadventures gales shipwrecks icebergs and collisions of vessels and hairbreadth escapes  their talk runs very much on the sea and on the land as connected with the sea and their interest does not seem to extend very far beyond the wide field of their professional concerns  nothing remarkable occurred on the journey to london  the greater part of the way there were only two gentlemen in the same compartment with me and we occupied each our corner with little other conversation than in comparing watches at the various stations  i got out of the carriage only once at rugby i think and for the last seventy or eighty miles the train did not stop  there was a clear moon the latter part of the journey and the mist lay along the ground looking very much like a surface of water  we reached london at about ten and i found s expecting me  yesterday the children went with fanny to the zoological gardens and after sending them off s and i walked to piccadilly and there took a cab for kensington gardens  it was a delightful daythe best of all weather the real english good weathermore like an indian summer than anything else within my experience a mellow sunshine with great warmth in ita soft balmy air with a slight haze through it  if the sun made us a little too warm we had but to go into the shade to be immediately refreshed  the light of these days is very exquisite so gently bright without any glarea veiled glow  in short it is the kindliest mood of nature and almost enough to compensate for chill and dreary months  moreover there is more of such weather here than the english climate has ever had credit for  kensington gardens form an eminently beautiful piece of artificial woodland and park scenery  the old palace of kensington now inhabited by the duchess of inverness stands at one extremity an edifice of no great mark built of brick covering much ground and low in proportion to its extent  in front of it at a considerable distance there is a sheet of water and in all directions there are vistas of wide paths among noble trees standing in groves or scattered in clumps everything being laid out with free and generous spaces so that you can see long streams of sunshine among the trees and there is a pervading influence of quiet and remoteness  tree does not interfere with tree the art of man is seen conspiring with nature as if they had consulted together how to make a beautiful scene and had taken ages of quiet thought and tender care to accomplish it  we strolled slowly along these paths and sometimes deviated from them to walk beneath the trees many of the leaves of which lay beneath our feet yellow and brown and with a pleasant smell of vegetable decay  these were the leaves of chestnuttrees the other trees unless elms have yet hardly begun to shed their foliage although you can discern a sober change of line in the woodland masses and the trees individualize themselves by assuming each its own tint though in a very modest way  if they could have undergone the change of an american autumn it would have been like putting on a regal robe  autumn often puts one on in america but it is apt to be very ragged  there were a good many welldressed people scattered through the groundsyoung men and girls husbands with their wives and children nurserymaids and little babes playing about in the grass  anybody might have entered the gardens i suppose but only welldressed people were there not of the upper classes but shopkeepers clerks apprentices and respectability of that sort  it is pleasant to think that the people have the freedom and therefore the property of parks like this more beautiful and stately than a nobleman can keep to himself  the extent of kensington gardens when reckoned together with hyde park from which it is separated only by a fence of iron rods is very great comprising miles of greensward and woodland  the large artificial sheet of water called the serpentine river lies chiefly in hyde park but comes partly within the precincts of the gardens  it is entitled to honorable mention among the english lakes being larger than some that are worldcelebratedseveral miles long and perhaps a stonesthrow across in the widest part  it forms the paradise of a great many ducks of various breeds which are accustomed to be fed by visitors and come flying from afar touching the water with their wings and quacking loudly when bread or cake is thrown to them  i bought a bun of a little hunchbacked man who kept a refreshmentstall near the serpentine and bestowed it piedmeal on these ducks as we loitered along the bank  we left the park by another gate and walked homeward till we came to tyburnia and saw the iron memorial which marks where the gallows used to stand  thence we turned into park lane then into upper grosvenor street and reached hanover square sooner than we expected  in the evening i walked forth to charing cross and thence along the strand and fleet street where i made no new discoveries unless it were the mitre tavern  i mean to go into it some day  the streets were much thronged and there seemed to be a good many young peoplelovers it is to be hopedwho had spent the day together and were going innocently home  perhaps soperhaps not   september 25thyesterday forenoon j and i walked out with no very definite purpose but seeing a narrow passageway from the strand down to the river we went through it and gained access to a steamboat plying thence to london bridge  the fare was a halfpenny apiece and the boat almost too much crowded for standingroom  this part of the river presents the waterside of london in a rather pleasanter aspect than below london bridgethe temple with its garden somerset houseand generally a less tumbledown and neglected look about the buildings although after all the metropolis does not see a very stately face in its mirror  i saw alsatia betwixt the temple and blackfriars bridge its precincts looked very narrow and not particularly distinguishable at this day from the portions of the city on either side of it  at london bridge we got aboard of a woolwich steamer and went farther down the river passing the customhouse and the tower the only prominent objects rising out of the dreary range of shabbiness which stretches along close to the waters edge  from this remote part of london we walked towards the heart of the city and as we went matters seemed to civilize themselves by degrees and the streets grew crowded with cabs omnibuses drays and carts  we passed i think through whitechapel and reaching st pauls got into an omnibus and drove to regent street whence it was but a step or two home  in the afternoon at four oclock s and i went to call on the american ambassador and miss l  the lady was not at home but we went in to see mr  and were shown into a stately drawingroom the furniture of which was sufficiently splendid but rather the worse for wearbeing hired furniture no doubt  the ambassador shortly appeared looking venerable as usualor rather more so than usualbenign and very pale  his deportment towards ladies is highly agreeable and prepossessing and he paid very kind attention to s thereby quite confirming her previous good feeling towards him  she thinks that he is much changed since she saw him last at dinner at our housemore infirm more aged and with a singular depression in his manner  i too think that age has latterly come upon him with great rapidity  he said that miss l was going home on the 6th of october and that he himself had long purposed going but had received despatches which obliged him to put off his departure  the president he said had just written requesting him to remain till april but this he was determined not to do  i rather think that he does really wish to return and not for any ambitious views concerning the presidency but from an old mans natural desire to be at home and among his own people  s spoke to him about an order from the lord chamberlain for admission to view the two houses of parliament and the ambassador drew from his pocket a colored silk handkerchief and made a knot in it in order to remind himself to ask the lord chamberlain  the homeliness of this little incident has a sort of propriety and keeping with much of mr s manner but i would rather not have him do so before english people  he arranged to send a close carriage for us to come and see him socially this evening  after leaving his house we drove round hyde park and thence to portland place where we left cards for mrs russell sturgis thence into regents park thence home  u and j accompanied us throughout these drives but remained in the carriage during our call on mr   in the evening i strolled out and walked as far as st paulsnever getting enough of the bustle of london which may weary but can never satisfy me  by night london looks wild and dreamy and fills me with a sort of pleasant dread  it was a clear evening with a bright english moonthat is to say what we americans should call rather dim   september 26thyesterday at eleven i walked towards westminster abbey and as i drew near the abbey bells were clamorous for joy chiming merrily musically and obstreperouslythe most rejoicing sound that can be conceived and we ought to have a chime of bells in every american town and village were it only to keep alive the celebration of the fourth of july  i conjectured that there might have been another victory over the russians that perhaps the northern side of sebastopol had surrendered but soon i saw the riddle that these merry bells were proclaiming  there were a great many private carriages and a large concourse of loungers and spectators near the door of the church that stands close under the eaves of the abbey  gentlemen and ladies gayly dressed were issuing forth carriages driving away and others drawing up to the door in their turn and in short a marriage had just been celebrated in the church and this was the weddingparty  the last time i was there westminster was flinging out its great voice of joy for a national triumph now for the happy union of two lovers  what a mighty sympathizer is this old abbey  it is pleasant to recognize the mould and fashion of english features through the marble of many of the statues and busts in the abbey even though they may be clad in roman robes  i am inclined to think them in many cases faithful likenesses and it brings them nearer to the mind to see these original sculpturesyou see the man at but one remove as if you caught his image in a lookingglass  the bust of gay seemed to me very gooda thoughtful and humorous sweetness in the face  goldsmith has as good a position as any poet in the abbey his bust and tablet filling the pointed arch over a door that seems to lead towards the cloisters  no doubt he would have liked to be assured of so conspicuous a place  there is one monument to a native american charles wragg esq of south carolinathe only one i suspect in westminster abbey and he acquired this memorial by the most unamerican of qualities his loyalty to his king  he was one of the refugees leaving america in 1777 and being shipwrecked on his passage the monument was put up by his sister  it is a small tablet with a representation of mr wraggs shipwreck at the base  next to it is the large monument of sir cloudesley shovel which i think addison ridiculesthe admiral in a fullbottomed wig and roman dress but with a broad english face reclining with his head on his hand and looking at you with great placidity  i stood at either end of the nave and endeavored to take in the full beauty and majesty of the edifice but apparently was not in a proper state of mind for nothing came of it  it is singular how like an avenue of overarching trees are these lofty aisles of a cathedral  leaving the abbey about one oclock i walked into the city as far as grace church street and there called on the american consul general  who had been warmly introduced to me last year by a letter from the president  i like the general a kindly and honorable man of simple manners and large experience of life  afterwards i called on mr oakford an american connected in business with mr crosby from whom i wanted some information as to the sailing of steamers from southampton to lisbon  mr crosby was not in town      at eight oclock mr  sent his carriage according to previous arrangement to take us to spend the evening socially  miss l received us with proper cordiality and looked quite becominglymore sweet and simple in aspect than when i have seen her in full dress shortly the ambassador appeared and made himself highly agreeable not that he is a brilliant conversationist but his excellent sense and goodhumor and all that he has seen and been a part of are sufficient resources to draw upon  we talked of the queen whom he spoke of with high respect     of the late czar whom he knew intimately while minister to russiaand he quite confirms all that has been said about the awful beauty of his person  mr s characterization of him was quite favorable he thought better of his heart than most people and adduced his sports with a school of childrentwenty of whom perhaps he made to stand rigidly in a row like so many bricksthen giving one a push would laugh obstreperously to see the whole row tumble down  he would lie on his back and allow the little things to scramble over him his majesty admitted mr  to great closeness of intercourse and informed him of a conspiracy which was then on foot for the czars murder  on the evening when the assassination was to take place the czar did not refrain from going to the public place where it was to be perpetrated although indeed great precautions had been taken to frustrate the schemes of the conspirators  mr  said that in case the plot had succeeded all the foreigners including himself would likewise have been murdered the native russians having a bitter hatred against foreigners  he observed that he had been much attached to the czar and had never joined in the english abuse of him  his sympathies however are evidently rather english than russian in this war speaking of the present emperor he said that lord heytebury formerly english ambassador in russia lately told him that he complimented the czar nicholas on the good qualities of his son saying that he was acknowledged by all to be one of the most amiable youths in the world too amiable i fear for his position answered the czar  he has too much of his mother in him   september 27thyesterday much earlier than english people ever do such things general  made us a call on his way to the consulate and sat talking a stricken hour or thereabouts  scarcely had he gone when mrs oakford and her daughter came  after sitting a long while they took u to their house near st johns wood to spend the night  i had been writing my journal and official correspondence during such intervals as these calls left me and now concluding these businesses s j and i went out and took a cab for the terminus of the crystal palace railway whither we proceeded over waterloo bridge and reached the palace not far from three oclock  it was a beautifully bright day such as we have in wonderful succession this month  the crystal palace gleamed in the sunshine but i do not think a very impressive edifice can be built of glasslight and airy to be sure but still it will be no other than an overgrown conservatory  it is unlike anything else in england uncongenial with the english character without privacy destitute of mass weight and shadow unsusceptible of ivy lichens or any mellowness from age  the train of carriages stops within the domain of the palace where there is a long ascending corridor up into the edifice  there was a very pleasant odor of heliotrope diffused through the air and indeed the whole atmosphere of the crystal palace is sweet with various flowerscents and mild and balmy though sufficiently fresh and cool it would be a delightful climate for invalids to spend the winter in and if all england could be roofed over with glass it would be a great improvement on its present condition  the first thing we did before fairly getting into the palace was to sit down in a large antehall and get some bread and butter and a pint of basss pale ale together with a cup of coffee for s  this was the best refreshment we could find at that spot but farther within we found abundance of refreshmentrooms and john bull and his wife and family at fifty little round tables busily engaged with cold fowl cold beef ham tongue and bottles of ale and stout and halfpint decanters of sherry the english probably eat with more simple enjoyment than any other people not ravenously as we often do and not exquisitely and artificially like the french but deliberately and vigorously and with due absorption in the business so that nothing good is lost upon them     it is remarkable how large a feature the refreshmentrooms make in the arrangements of the crystal palace  the crystal palace is a gigantic toy for the english people to play with the design seems to be to reproduce all past ages by representing the features of their interior architecture costume religion domestic life and everything that can be expressed by paint and plaster and likewise to bring all climates and regions of the earth within these enchanted precincts with their inhabitants and animals in living semblance and their vegetable productions as far as possible alive and real  some part of the design is already accomplished to a wonderful degree  the indian the egyptian and especially the arabian courts are admirably executed  i never saw or conceived anything so gorgeous as the alhambra  there are byzantine and mediaeval representations too reproductions of ancient apartments decorations statues from tombs monuments religious and funerealthat gave me new ideas of what antiquity has been  it takes down ones overweening opinion of the present time to see how many kinds of beauty and magnificence have heretofore existed and are now quite passed away and forgotten and to find that we who suppose that in all matters of taste our age is the very flowerseason of the timethat we are poor and meagre as to many things in which they were rich  there is nothing gorgeous now  we live a very naked life  this was the only reflection i remember making as we passed from century to century through the succession of classic oriental and mediaeval courts adown the lapse of timeseeing all these ages in as brief a space as the wandering jew might glance along them in his memory  i suppose a pompeian house with its courts and interior apartments was as faithfully shown as it was possible to do it i doubt whether i ever should feel at home in such a house  in the pool of a fountain of which there are several beautiful ones within the palace besides larger ones in the garden before it we saw tropical plants growinglarge waterlilies of various colors some white like our concord pondlily only larger and more numerously leafed  there were great circular green leaves lying flat on the water with a circumference equal to that of a centretable  tropical trees too varieties of palm and others grew in immense pots or tubs but seemed not to enjoy themselves much  the atmosphere must after all be far too cool to bring out their native luxuriance and this difficulty can never be got over at a less expense than that of absolutely stewing the visitors and attendants  otherwise it would be very practicable to have all the vegetable world at least within these precincts  the palace is very large and our time was short it being desirable to get home early so after a stay of little more than two hours we took the rail back again and reached hanover square at about six  after tea i wandered forth with some thought of going to the theatre and passing the entrance of one in the strand i went in and found a farce in progress  it was one of the minor theatres very minor indeed but the pieces so far as i saw them were sufficiently laughable  there were some spanish dances too very graceful and pretty  between the plays a girl from the neighboring saloon came to the doors of the boxes offering lemonade and gingerbeer to the occupants  a person in my box took a glass of lemonade and shared it with a young lady by his side both sipping out of the same glass  the audience seemed rather heavynot briskly responsive to the efforts of the performers but goodnatured and willing to be pleased especially with some patriotic dances in which much waving and intermingling of the french and english flags was introduced  theatrical performances soon weary me of late years and i came away before the curtain rose on the concluding piece   september 28th8 and i walked to charing cross yesterday forenoon and there took a hansom cab to st pauls cathedral  it had been a thick foggy morning but had warmed and brightened into one of the balmiest and sunniest of noons  as we entered the cathedral the long bars of sunshine were falling from its upper windows through the great interior atmosphere and were made visible by the dust or mist floating about in it  it is a grand edifice and i liked it quite as much as on my first view of it although a sense of coldness and nakedness is felt when we compare it with gothic churches  it is more an external work than the gothic churches are and is not so made out of the dim awful mysterious grotesque intricate nature of man  but it is beautiful and grand  i love its remote distances and wide clear spaces its airy massiveness its noble arches its skylike dome which i think should be all over light with groundglass instead of being dark with only diminutive windows  we walked round looking at the monuments which are so arranged at the bases of columns and in niches as to coincide with the regularity of the cathedral and be each an additional ornament to the whole however defective individually as works of art  we thought that many of these monuments were striking and impressive though there was a pervading sameness of ideaa great many victorys and valors and britannias and a great expenditure of wreaths which must have cost victory a considerable sum at any florists whom she patronizes  a very great majority of the memorials are to naval and military men slain in bonapartes wars men in whom one feels little or no interest except picton abercrombie moore nelson of course and a few others really historic they having done nothing remarkable save having been shot nor shown any more brains than the cannonballs that killed them  all the statues have the dust of years upon then strewn thickly in the folds of their marble garments and on any limb stretched horizontally and on their noses so that the expression is much obscured  i think the nation might employ people to brush away the dust from the statues of its heroes  but on the whole it is very fine to look through the broad arches of the cathedral and see at the foot of some distant pillar a group of sculptured figures commemorating some man and deed that whether worth remembering or not the nation is so happy as to reverence  in westminster abbey the monuments are so crowded and so oddly patched together upon the walls that they are ornamental only in a mural point of view and moreover the quaint and grotesque taste of many of them might well make the spectator laughan effect not likely to be produced by the monuments in st pauls  but after all a man might read the walls of the abbey day after day with everfresh interest whereas the cold propriety of the cathedral would weary him in due time  we did not ascend to the galleries and other points of interest aloft nor go down into the vaults where nelsons sarcophagus is shown and many monuments of the old gothic cathedral which stood on this site before the great fire  they say that these lower regions are comfortably warm and dry but as we walked round in front within the iron railing of the churchyard we passed an open door giving access to the crypt and it breathed out a chill like death upon us  it is pleasant to stand in the centre of the cathedral and hear the noise of london loudest all round this spothow it is calmed into a sound as proper to be heard through the aisles as the tones of its own organ  if st pauls were to be burnt again having already been bunt and risen three or four times since the sixth century i wonder whether it would ever be rebuilt in the same spot  i doubt whether the city and the nation are so religious as to consecrate their midmost heart for the site of a church where land would be so valuable by the square inch  coming from the cathedral we went through paternoster row and saw ave mary lane all this locality appearing to have got its nomenclature from monkish personages  we now took a cab for the british museum but found this to be one of the days on which strangers are not admitted so we slowly walked into oxford street and then strolled homeward till coming to a sort of bazaar we went in and found a gallery of pictures this bazaar proved to be the pantheon and the first picture we saw in the gallery was haydons resurrection of lazarusa great height and breadth of canvas right before you as you ascend the stairs  the face of lazarus is very awful and not to be forgotten it is as true as if the painter had seen it or had been himself the resurrected man and felt it but the rest of the picture signified nothing and is vulgar and disagreeable besides  there are several other pictures by haydon in this collectionthe banishment of aristides nero with his harp and the conflagration of rome but the last is perfectly ridiculous and all of them are exceedingly unpleasant  i should be sorry to live in a house that contained one of them  the best thing of haydon was a hasty dash of a sketch for a small fulllength portrait of wordsworth sitting on the crag of a mountain  i doubt whether wordsworths likeness has ever been so poetically brought out  this gallery is altogether of modern painters and it seems to be a receptacle for pictures by artists who can obtain places nowhere elseat least i never heard of their names before  they were very uninteresting almost without exception and yet some of the pictures were done cleverly enough  there is very little talent in this world and what there is it seems to me is pretty well known and acknowledged  we dont often stumble upon geniuses in obscure corners  leaving the gallery we wandered through the rest of the bazaar which is devoted to the sale of ladies finery jewels perfumes childrens toys and all manner of small and pretty rubbish     in the evening i again sallied forth and lost myself for an hour or two at last recognizing my whereabouts in tottenham court road  in such quarters of london it seems to be the habit of people to take their suppers in the open air  you see old women at the corners with kettles of hot water for tea or coffee and as i passed a butchers open shop he was just taking out large quantities of boiled beef smoking hot  butchers stands are remarkable for their profuse expenditure of gas it belches forth from the pipes in great flaring jets of flame uncovered by any glass and broadly illuminating the neighborhood  i have not observed that london ever goes to bed   september 29thyesterday we walked to the british museum  a sentinel or two kept guard before the gateway of this extensive edifice in great russell street and there was a porter at the lodge and one or two policemen lounging about but entrance was free and we walked in without question  officials and policemen were likewise scattered about the great entrancehall none of whom however interfered with us so we took whatever way we chose and wandered about at will  it is a hopeless and to me generally a depressing business to go through an immense multifarious show like this glancing at a thousand things and conscious of some little titillation of mind from them but really taking in nothing and getting no good from anything  one need not go beyond the limits of the british museum to be profoundly accomplished in all branches of science art and literature only it would take a lifetime to exhaust it in any one department but to see it as we did and with no prospect of ever seeing it more at leisure only impressed me with the truth of the old apothegm life is short and art is long  the fact is the world is accumulating too many materials for knowledge  we do not recognize for rubbish what is really rubbish and under this head might be reckoned very many things one sees in the british museum and as each generation leaves its fragments and potsherds behind it such will finally be the desperate conclusion of the learned  we went first among some antique marblesbusts statues terminal gods with several of the roman emperors among them  we saw here the bust whence haydon took his ugly and ridiculous likeness of neroa foolish thing to do  julius caesar was there too looking more like a modern old man than any other bust in the series  perhaps there may be a universality in his face that gives it this independence of race and epoch  we glimpsed along among the old marbleselgin and others which are esteemed such treasures of artthe oddest fragments many of them smashed by their fall from high places or by being pounded to pieces by barbarians or gnawed away by time the surface roughened by being rained upon for thousands of years almost always a nose knocked off sometimes a headless form a great deficiency of feet and handspoor maimed veterans in this hospital of incurables  the beauty of the most perfect of them must be rather guessed at and seen by faith than with the bodily eye to look at the corroded faces and forms is like trying to see angels through mist and cloud  i suppose nine tenths of those who seem to be in raptures about these fragments do not really care about them neither do i  and if i were actually moved i should doubt whether it were by the statues or by my own fancy  we passed too through assyrian saloons and egyptian saloonsall full of monstrosities and horrible uglinesses especially the egyptian and all the innumerable relics that i saw of them in these saloons and among the mummies instead of bringing me closer to them removed me farther and farther there being no common ground of sympathy between them and us  their gigantic statues are certainly very curious  i saw a hand and arm up to the shoulder fifteen feet in length and made of some stone that seemed harder and heavier than granite not having lost its polish in all the rough usage that it has undergone  there was a fist on a still larger scale almost as big as a hogshead  hideous blubberlipped faces of giants and human shapes with beasts heads on them  the egyptian controverted nature in all things only using it as a groundwork to depict the unnatural upon  their mummifying process is a result of this tendency  we saw one very perfect mummya priestess with apparently only one more fold of linen betwixt us and her antique flesh and this fitting closely to her person from head to foot so that we could see the lineaments of her face and the shape of her limbs as perfectly as if quite bare  i judge that she may have been very beautiful in her daywhenever that was  one or two of the poor things toes her feet were wonderfully small and delicate protruded from the linen and perhaps not having been so perfectly embalmed the flesh had fallen away leaving only some little bones  i dont think this young woman has gained much by not turning to dust in the time of the pharaohs we also saw some bones of a king that had been taken out of a pyramid a very fragmentary skeleton  among the classic marbles i peeped into an urn that once contained the ashes of dead people and the bottom still had an ashy hue  i like this mode of disposing of dead bodies but it would be still better to burn them and scatter the ashes instead of hoarding them upto scatter them over wheatfields or flowerbeds  besides these antique halls we wandered through saloons of antediluvian animals some set up in skeletons others imprisoned in solid stone also specimens of still extant animals birds reptiles shells minerals the whole circle of human knowledge and guessworktill i wished that the whole past might be swept away and each generation compelled to bury and destroy whatever it had produced before being permitted to leave the stage  when we quit a house we are expected to make it clean for the next occupant why ought we not to leave a clean world for the next generation  we did not see the library of above half a million of volumes else i suppose i should have found full occasion to wish that burnt and buried likewise  in truth a greater part of it is as good as buried so far as any readers are concerned  leaving the museum we sauntered home  after a little rest i set out for st johns wood and arrived thither by dint of repeated inquiries  it is a pretty suburb inhabited by people of the middling class  u met me joyfully but seemed to have had a good time with mrs oakford and her daughter and being pressed to stay to tea i could not well help it  before tea i sat talking with mrs oakford and a friend of hers miss clinch about the americans and the english especially dwelling on the defects of the latteramong which we reckoned a wretched meanness in money transactions a lack of any embroidery of honor and liberality in their dealings so that they require close watching or they will be sure to take you at advantage  i hear this character of them from americans on all hands and my own experience confirms it as far as it goes not merely among tradespeople but among persons who call themselves gentlefolks  the cause no doubt or one cause lies in the fewer chances of getting money here the closer and sharper regulation of all the modes of life nothing being left to liberal and gentlemanly feelings except fees to servants  they are not gamblers in england as we to some extent are and getting their money painfully or living within an accurately known income they are disinclined to give up so much as a sixpence that they can possibly get  but the result is they are mean in petty things  by and by mr oakford came in well soaked with the heaviest shower that i ever knew in england which had been rattling on the roof of the little side room where we sat and had caught him on the outside of the omnibus at a little before eight oclock i came home with u in a cabthe gaslight glittering on the wet streets through which we drove though the sky was clear overhead   september 30thyesterday a little before twelve we took a cab and went to the two houses of parliamentthe most immense building methinks that ever was built and not yet finished though it has now been occupied for years  its exterior lies hugely along the ground and its great unfinished tower is still climbing towards the sky but the result unless it be the riverfront which i have not yet seen seems not very impressive  the interior is much more successful  nothing can be more magnificent and gravely gorgeous than the chamber of peersa large oblong hall panelled with oak elaborately carved to the height of perhaps twenty feet  then the balustrade of the gallery runs around the hall and above the gallery are six arched windows on each side richly painted with historic subjects  the roof is ornamented and gilded and everywhere throughout there is embellishment of color and carving on the broadest scale and at the same time most minute and elaborate statues of full size in niches aloft small heads of kings no bigger than a doll and the oak is carved in all parts of the panelling as faithfully as they used to do it in henry viis timeas faithfully and with as good workmanship but with nothing like the variety and invention which i saw in the diningroom of smithells hall  there the artist wrought with his heart and head but much of this work i suppose was done by machinery  be that as it may it is a most noble and splendid apartment and though so fine there is not a touch of finery it glistens and glows with even a sombre magnificence owing to the rich deep lines and the dim light bedimmed with rich colors by coming through the painted windows  in arched recesses that serve as frames at each end of the hall there are three pictures by modern artists from english history and though it was not possible to see them well as pictures they adorned and enriched the walls marvellously as architectural embellishments  the peers seats are four rows of long sofas on each side covered with red morocco comfortable seats enough but not adapted to any other than a decorously exact position  the woolsack is between these two divisions of sofas in the middle passage of the floora great square seat covered with scarlet and with a scarlet cushion set up perpendicularly for the chancellor to lean against  in front of the woolsack there is another still larger ottoman on which he might be at full lengthfor what purpose intended i know not  i should take the woolsack to be not a very comfortable seat though i suppose it was originally designed to be the most comfortable one that could be contrived in view of the chancellors much sitting  the throne is the first object you see on entering the hall being close to the door a chair of antique form with a high peaked back and a square canopy above the whole richly carved and quite covered with burnished gilding besides being adorned with rows of rock crystals which seemed to me of rather questionable taste  it is less elevated above the floor than one imagines it ought to be while we were looking at it i saw two americanswestern men i should judgeone of them with a true american slouch talking to the policeman in attendance and describing our senate chamber in contrast with the house of lords  the policeman smiled and ahed and seemed to make as courteous and liberal responses as he could  there was quite a mixed company of spectators and i think other americans present besides the above two and ourselves  the lord chamberlains tickets appear to be distributed with great impartiality  there were two or three women of the lower middle class with children or babies in arms one of whom lifted up its voice loudly in the house of peers  we next after long contemplating this rich hall proceeded through passages and corridors to a great central room very beautiful which seems to be used for purposes of refreshment and for electric telegraphs though i should not suppose this could be its primitive and ultimate design  thence we went into the house of commons which is larger than the chamber of peers and much less richly ornamented though it would have appeared splendid had it come first in order  the speakers chair if i remember rightly is loftier and statelier than the throne itself  both in this hall and in that of the lords we were at first surprised by the narrow limits within which the great ideas of the lords and commons of england are physically realized they would seem to require a vaster space  when we hear of members rising on opposite sides of the house we think of them as but dimly discernible to their opponents and uplifting their voices so as to be heard afar whereas they sit closely enough to feel each others spheres to note all expression of face and to give the debate the character of a conversation  in this view a debate seems a much more earnest and real thing than as we read it in a newspaper  think of the debaters meeting each others eyes their faces flushing their looks interpreting their words their speech growing into eloquence without losing the genuineness of talk  yet in fact the chamber of peers is ninety feet long and half as broad and high and the chamber of commons is still larger  thence we went to westminster hall through a gallery with statues on each sidebeautiful statues too i thought seven of them of which four were from the times of the civil warsclarendon falkland hampden selden somers mansfield and walpole  there is room for more in this corridor and there are niches for hundreds of their marble brotherhood throughout the edifice but i suppose future ages will have to fill the greater part of them  yet i cannot help imagining that this rich and noble edifice has more to do with the past than with the future that it is the glory of a declining empire and that the perfect bloom of this great stone flower growing out of the institutions of england forbodes that they have nearly lived out their life  it sums up all its beauty and magnificence are made out of ideas that are gone by  we entered westminster hall which is incorporated into this new edifice and forms an integral part of it through a lofty archway whence a double flight of broad steps descends to the stone pavement  after the elaborate ornament of the rooms we had just been viewing this venerable hall looks extremely simple and barea gray stone floor gray and naked stone walls but a roof sufficiently elaborate its vault being filled with carved beams and rafters of chestnut very much admired and wondered at for the design and arrangement  i think it would have pleased me more to have seen a clear vaulted roof instead of this intricacy of wooden points by which so much skylight space is lost  they make be it not irreverently said the vast and lofty apartment look like the ideal of an immense barn  but it is a noble space and all without the support of a single pillar  it is about eighty of my paces from the foot of the steps to the opposite end of the hall and twentyseven from side to side very high too though not quite proportionately to its other dimensions  i love it for its simplicity and antique nakedness and deem it worthy to have been the haunt and home of history through the six centuries since it was built  i wonder it does not occur to modern ingenuity to make a scenic representation in this very hall of the ancient trials for life or death pomps feasts coronations and every great historic incident in the lives of kings parliaments protectors and all illustrious men that have occurred here  the whole world cannot show another hall such as this so tapestried with recollections of whatever is most striking in human annals  westminster abbey being just across the street we went thither from the hall and sought out the cloisters which we had not yet visited  they are in excellent preservationbroad walks canopied with intermingled arches of gray stone on which some sort of lichen or other growth of ages which seems however to have little or nothing vegetable in it has grown  the pavement is entirely made of flat tombstones inscribed with halfeffaced names of the dead people beneath and the wall all round bears the marble tablets which give a fuller record of their virtues  i think it was from a meditation in these cloisters that addison wrote one of his most beautiful pieces in the spectator  it is a pity that this old fashion of a cloistered walk is not retained in our modern edifices it was so excellent for shelter and for shade during a thoughtful hourthis sombre corridor beneath an arched stone roof with the central space of richest grass on which the sun might shine or the shower fall while the monk or student paced through the prolonged archway of his meditations  as we came out from the cloisters and walked along by the churchyard of the abbey a woman came begging behind us very earnestly  a bit of bread she said and i will give you a thousand blessings  hunger is hard to bear  o kind gentleman and kind lady a penny for a bit of bread  it is a hard thing that gentlemen and ladies should see poor people wanting bread and make no difference whether they are good or bad  and so she followed us almost all round the abbey assailing our hearts in most plaintive terms but with no success for she did it far too well to be anything but an impostor and no doubt she had breakfasted better and was likely to have a better dinner than ourselves  and yet the natural man cries out against the philosophy that rejects beggars it is a thousand to one that they are impostors but yet we do ourselves a wrong by hardening our hearts against them  at last without turning round i told her that i should give her nothingwith some asperity doubtless for the effort to refuse creates a bitterer repulse than is necessary  she still followed us a little farther but at last gave it up with a deep groan  i could not have performed this act of heroism on my first arrival from america  whether the beggarwoman had invoked curses on us and heaven saw fit to grant some slight response i know not but it now began to rain on my wifes velvet so i put her and j into a cab and hastened to ensconce myself in westminster abbey while the shower should last poets corner has never seemed like a strange place to me it has been familiar from the very first at all events i cannot now recollect the previous conception of which the reality has taken the place  i seem always to have known that somewhat dim corner with the bare brown stonework of the old edifice aloft and a window shedding down its light on the marble busts and tablets yellow with time that cover the three walls of the nook up to a height of about twenty feet  priors is the largest and richest monument  it is observable that the bust and monument of congreve are in a distant part of the abbey  his duchess probably thought it a degradation to bring a gentleman among the beggarly poets  i walked round the aisles and paced the nave and came to the conclusion that westminster abbey both in itself and for the variety and interest of its monuments is a thousand times preferable to st pauls  there is as much difference as between a snowbank and a chimneycorner in their relation to the human heart  by the by the monuments and statues in the abbey seem all to be carefully dusted  the shower being over i walked down into the city where i called on mr b and left ss watch to be examined and put in order  he told me that he and his brother had lately been laying out and letting a piece of land at blackheath that had been left them by their father and that the groundrent would bring them in two thousand pounds per annum  with such an independent income i doubt whether any american would consent to be anything but a gentlemancertainly not an operative watchmaker  how sensible these englishmen are in some things  thence i went at a venture and lost myself of course  at one part of my walk i came upon st lukes hospital whence i returned to st pauls and thence along fleet street and the strand  contiguous to the latter is holywell streeta narrow lane filled up with little bookshops and bookstalls at some of which i saw sermons and other works of divinity old editions of classics and all such serious matters while at stalls and windows close beside them and possibly at the same stalls there were books with titlepages displayed indicating them to be of the most indecent kind   october 2dyesterday forenoon i went with j into the city to 67 grace church street to get a bank postnote cashed by mr oakford and afterwards to the offices of two lines of steamers in moorgate street and leadenhall street  the city was very much thronged  it is a marvel what sets so many people a going at all hours of the day  then it is to be considered that these are but a small portion of those who are doing the business of the city much the larger part being occupied in offices at desks in discussions of plans of enterprise out of sight of the public while these earnest hurriers are merely the froth in the pot  after seeing the steamofficials we went to london bridge which always swarms with more passengers than any of the streets  descending the steps that lead to the level of the thames we took passage in a boat bound up the river to chelsea of which there is one starting every ten minutes the voyage being of forty minutes duration  it began to sprinkle a little just as we started but after a slight showeriness lasting till we had passed westminster bridge the day grew rather pleasant  at westminster bridge we had a good view of the riverfront of the two houses of parliament which look very noble from this pointa long and massive extent with a delightful promenade for the legislative people exactly above the margin of the river  this is certainly a magnificent edifice and yet i doubt whether it is so impressive as it might and ought to have been made considering its immensity  it makes no more impression than you can well account to yourself for and you rather wonder that it does not make more  the reason must be that the architect has not builded better than he knew  he felt no power higher and wiser than himself making him its instrument  he reckoned upon and contrived all his effects with malice aforethought and therefore missed the crowning glorythat being a happiness which god out of his pure grace mixes up with only the simplehearted best efforts of men   october 3di again went into the city yesterday forenoon to settle about the passages to lisbon taking j with me  from hungerford bridge we took the steamer to london bridge that being an easy and speedy mode of accomplishing distances that take many footsteps through the crowded thoroughfares  after leaving the steameroffice we went back through the strand and crossing waterloo bridge walked a good way on to the surrey side of the river a coarse dingy disagreeable suburb with shops apparently for country produce for old clothes secondhand furniture for ironware and other things bulky and inelegant  how many scenes and sorts of life are comprehended within london  there was much in the aspect of these streets that reminded me of a busy country village in america on an immensely magnified scale  growing rather weary anon we got into an omnibus which took us as far as the surrey zoological gardens which j wished very much to see they proved to be a rather poor place of suburban amusement poor at least by daylight their chief attraction for the public consisting in outofdoor representations of battles and sieges  the storming of sebastopol as likewise at the cremorne gardens was advertised for the evening and we saw the scenery of sebastopol painted on a vast scale in the open air and really looking like miles and miles of hill and water with a space for the actual manoeuvring of ships on a sheet of real water in front of the scene on which some ducks were now swimming about in place of menofwar  the climate of england must often interfere with this sort of performance and i can conceive of nothing drearier for spectators or performers than a drizzly evening  convenient to this central spot of entertainment there were liquor and refreshment rooms with pies and cakes  the menagerie though the ostensible staple of the gardens is rather poor and scanty pretty well provided with lions and lionesses also one or two giraffes some camels a polar bearwho plunged into a pool of water for bits of cakeand two black bears who sat on their haunches or climbed poles besides a wilderness of monkeys some parrots and macaws an ostrich various ducks and other animal and ornithological trumpery some skins of snakes so well stuffed that i took them for living serpents till j discovered the deception and an aquarium with a good many common fishes swimming among seaweed  the garden is shaded with trees and set out with greensward and gravelwalks from which the people were sweeping the withered autumnal leaves which now fall every day  plaster statues stand here and there one of them without a head thus disclosing the hollowness of the trunk there were one or two little drizzly fountains with the water dripping over the rockwork of which the english are so fond and the buildings for the animals and other purposes had a flimsy pasteboard aspect of pretension  the garden was in its undress few visitors i suppose coming hither at this time of dayonly here and there a lady and children a young man and girl or a couple of citizens loitering about i take pains to remember these small items because they suggest the daylife or torpidity of what may look very brilliant at night  these corkedup fountains slovenly greensward cracked casts of statues pasteboard castles and duckpond bay of balaclava then shining out in magic splendor and the shabby attendants whom we saw sweeping and shovelling probably transformed into the heroes of sebastopol  j thought it a delightful place but i soon grew very weary and came away about four oclock and getting into a city omnibus we alighted on the hither side of blackfriars bridge  turning into fleet street i looked about for a place to dine at and chose the mitre tavern in memory of johnson and boswell  it stands behind a front of modern shops through which is an archway giving admittance into a narrow courtyard which i suppose was formerly open to fleet street the house is of dark brick and comparing it with other london edifices i should take it to have been at least refronted since johnsons time but within the low sombre coffeeroom which we entered might well enough have been of that era or earlier  it seems to be a good plain respectable inn and the waiter gave us each a plate of boiled beef and for dessert a damson tart which made up a comfortable dinner  after dinner we zigzagged homeward through cliffords link passage holborn drury lane the strand charing cross pall mall and regent street but i remember only an ancient brick gateway as particularly remarkable  i think it was the entrance to lincolns inn  we reached home at about six  there is a woman who has several times passed through this hanover street in which we live stopping occasionally to sing songs under the windows and last evening between nine and ten oclock she came and sang kathleen omoore richly and sweetly  her voice rose up out of the dim chill street and made our hearts throb in unison with it as we sat in our comfortable drawingroom  i never heard a voice that touched me more deeply  somebody told her to go away and she stopped like a nightingale suddenly shot but finding that s wished to know something about her fanny and one of the maids ran after her and brought her into the hall  it seems she was educated to sing at the opera and married an italian operasinger who is now dead lodging in a model lodginghouse at threepence a night and being a penny short tonight she tried this method in hope of getting this penny  she takes in plain sewing when she can get any and picks up a trifle about the street by means of her voice which she says was once sweet but has now been injured by the poorness of her living  she is a pale woman with black eyes fanny says and may have been pretty once but is not so now  it seems very strange that with such a gift of heaven so cultivated too as her voice is making even an unsusceptible heart vibrate like a harpstring she should not have had an engagement among the hundred theatres and singingrooms of london that she should throw away her melody in the streets for the mere chance of a penury when sounds not a hundredth part so sweet are worth from other lips purses of gold   october 5thit rained almost all day on wednesday so that i did not go out till late in the afternoon and then only took a stroll along oxford street and holborn and back through fleet street and the strand yesterday at a little after ten i went to the ambassadors to get my wifes passport for lisbon  while i was talking with the clerk mr  made his appearance in a dressinggown with a morning cheerfulness and alacrity in his manner  he was going to liverpool with his niece who returns to america by the steamer of saturday  she has had a good deal of success in society here being pretty enough to be remarked among english women and with cool selfpossessed frank and quiet manners which look very like the highest breeding  i next went to westminster abbey where i had long promised myself another quiet visit for i think i never could be weary of it and when i finally leave england it will be this spot which i shall feel most unwilling to quit forever  i found a party going through the seven chapels or whatever their number may be and again saw those stately and quaint old tombsladies and knights stretched out on marble slabs or beneath arches and canopies of stone let into the walls of the abbey reclining on their elbows in ruff and farthingale or riveted armor or in robes of state once painted in rich colors of which only a few patches of scarlet now remain bearded faces of noble knights whose noses in many cases had been smitten off and mary queen of scots had lost two fingers of her beautiful hands which she is clasping in prayer there must formerly have been very free access to these tombs for i observed that all the statues so far as i examined them were scratched with the initials of visitors some of the names being dated above a century ago  the old coronationchair too is quite covered over the back and seat with initials cut into it with pocketknives just as yankees would do it only it is not whittled away as would have been its fate in our hands  edward the confessors shrine which is chiefly of wood likewise abounds in these inscriptions although this was esteemed the holiest shrine in england so that pilgrims still come to kneel and kiss it  our guide a rubicund verger of cheerful demeanor said that this was true in a few instances  there is a beautiful statue in memory of horace walpoles mother and i took it to be really a likeness till the verger said that it was a copy of a statue which her son had admired in italy and so had transferred it to his mothers grave  there is something characteristic in this mode of filial duty and honor  in all these chapels full of the tombs and effigies of kings dukes archprelates and whatever is proud and pompous in mortality there is nothing that strikes me more than the colossal statue of plain mr watt sitting quietly in a chair in st pauls chapel and reading some papers  he dwarfs the warriors and statesmen and as to the kings we smile at them  telford is in another of the chapels  this visit to the chapels was much more satisfactory than my former one although i in vain strove to feel it adequately and to make myself sensible how rich and venerable was what i saw  this realization must come at its own time like the other happinesses of life  it is unaccountable that i could not now find the seat of sir george downings squire though i examined particularly every seat on that side of henry viis chapel where i before found it  i must try again       october 6thyesterday was not an eventful day  i took j with me to the city called on mr sturgis at the barings house and got his checks for a bank postnote  the house is at 8 bishopsgate street within  it has no sign of any kind but stands back from the street behind an irongrated fence  the firm appears to occupy the whole edifice which is spacious and fit for princely merchants  thence i went and paid for the passages to lisbon 32 pounds at the peninsular steam companys office and thence to call on general   i forgot to mention that first of all i went to mr bs whom i found kind and vivacious as usual  it now rained heavily and being still showery when we came to cheapside again we first stood under an archway a usual resort for passengers through london streets and then betook ourselves to sanctuary taking refuge in st pauls cathedral  the afternoon service was about to begin so after looking at a few of the monuments we sat down in the choir the richest and most ornamented part of the cathedral with screens or partitions of oak cunningly carved small whiterobed choristers were flitting noiselessly about making preparations for the service which by and by began  it is a beautiful idea that several times in the course of the day a man can slip out of the thickest throng and bustle of london into this religious atmosphere and hear the organ and the music of young pure voices but after all the rites are lifeless in our day  we found on emerging that we had escaped a very heavy shower and it still sprinkled and misted as we went homeward through holborn and oxford street    southampton   october 11thwe all left london on sunday morning between ten and eleven from the waterloo station and arrived in southampton about two without meeting with anything very remarkable on the way  we put up at chapples castle hotel which is one of the class styled commercial and though respectable not such a one as the nobility and gentry usually frequent  i saw little difference in the accommodation except that young women attended us instead of mena pleasant change  it was a showery day but j and i walked out to see the shore and the town and the docks and if possible the ship in which s was to sail the most noteworthy object was the remains of an old castle near the waterside the square gray weed grown weird keep of which shows some modern chimneypots above its battlements while remaining portions of the fortress are made to seem as one of the walls for coaldepots and perhaps for small dwellings  the english characteristically patch new things into old things in this manner materially legally constitutionally and morally  walking along the pier we observed some pieces of ordnance one of which was a large brass cannon of henry viiis time about twelve feet long and very finely made  the bay of southampton presents a pleasant prospect and i believe it is the great rendezvous of the yachtclub  old and young seafaring people were strolling about and lounging at corners just as they do on sunday afternoons in the minor seaports of america  from the shore we went up into the town which is handsome and of a cheerful aspect with streets generally wide and well paveda cleanly town not smokebegrimed  the houses if not modern are at least with few exceptions new fronted  we saw one relic of antiquitya fine mediaeval gateway across the principal street much more elevated than the gates of chester with battlements at the top and a spacious apartment over the great arch for the passage of carriages and the smaller one on each side for footpassengers  there were two statues in armor or antique costume on the hither side of the gateway and two old paintings on the other  this so far as i know is the only remnant of the old wall of southampton  on monday the morning was bright alternating with a little showeriness u j and i went into the town to do some shopping before the steamer should sail and a little after twelve we drove down to the dock the madeira is a pleasantlooking ship enough not very large but accommodating i believe about seventy passengers  we looked at my wifes little stateroom with its three berths for herself and the two children and then sat down in the saloon and afterwards on deck to spend the irksome and dreary hour or two before parting  many of the passengers seemed to be portuguese undersized dark mustachioed people smoking cigars  john bull was fairly represented too     u was cheerful and r seemed anxious to get off  poor fanny was altogether cast down and shed tears either from regret at leaving her native land or dread of seasickness or general despondency being a person of no spring of spirits  i waited till the captain came on board a middleaged or rather elderly man with a sensible expression but methought with a hard cold eye to whom i introduced my wife recommending her to his especial care as she was unattended by any gentleman and then we thought it best to cut short the parting scene so we bade one another farewell and leaving them on the deck of the vessel j and i returned to the hotel and after dining at the table dhote drove down to the railway  this is the first great parting that we have ever had  it was three oclock when we left southampton  in order to get to worcester where we were to spend the night we strode as it were from one line of railway to another two or three times and did not arrive at our journeys end till long after dark  at worcester we put ourselves into the hands of a cabman who drove us to the crown hotelone of the oldfashioned hotels with an entrance through an arched passage by which vehicles were admitted into the innyard which has also an exit i believe into another street  on one side of the arch was the coffeeroom where after looking at our sleepingchambers on the other side of the arch we had some cold pigeonpie for supper and for myself a pint of ale  it should be mentioned that in the morning before embarking s and the children on board the steamer i saw a fragment of a rainbow among the clouds and remembered the old adage bidding sailors take warning in the afternoon as j and i were railing from southampton we saw another fragmentary rainbow which by the same adage should be the sailors delight  the weather has rather tended to confirm the first omen but the seacaptains tell me that the steamer must have gone beyond the scope of these winds    worcester   october 14thin the morning of tuesday after breakfast in the coffeeroom j and i walked about to see the remarkables of worcester  it is not a particularly interesting city compared with other old english cities the general material of the houses being red brick and almost all modernized externally whatever may be the age of their original framework  we saw a large brick jail in castellated style with battlementsa very barren and drearylooking edifice likewise in the more central part of the town a guildhall with a handsome front ornamented with a statue of queen anne above the entrance and statues of charles i and charles ii on either side of the door with the motto floreat semper civitas fidelis  worcester seems to pride itself upon its loyalty  we entered the building and in the large interior hall saw some old armor hanging on the wall at one end corselets helmets greaves and a pair of breeches of chain mail  an inscription told us that these suits of armor had been left by charles i after the battle of worcester and presented to the city at a much later date by a gentleman of the neighborhood  on the stone floor of the hall under the armor were two brass cannon one of which had been taken from the french in a naval battle within the present century the other was a beautiful piece bearing i think the date of 1632 and manufactured in brussels for the count de burgh as a latin inscription testified  this likewise was a relic of the battle of worcester where it had been lost by charles  many gentlemenconnected with the city government i supposewere passing through the hall and looking through its interior doors we saw stately staircases and councilrooms panelled with oak or other dark wood  there seems to be a good deal of state in the government of these old towns  worcester cathedral would have impressed me much had i seen it earlier though its aspect is less venerable than that of chester or lichfield having been faithfully renewed and repaired and stonecutters and masons were even now at work on the exterior  at our first visit we found no entrance but coming again at ten oclock when the service was to begin we found the door open and the choristerboys in their white robes standing in the nave and aisles with elder people in the same garb and a few blackrobed ecclesiastics and an old verger  the interior of the cathedral has been covered with a lightcolored paint at some recent period  there is as i remember very little stained glass to enrich and bedim the light and the effect produced is a naked daylight aspect unlike what i have seen in any other gothic cathedral  the plan of the edifice too is simple a nave and side aisles with great clustered pillars from which spring the intersecting arches and somehow or other the venerable mystery which i have found in westminster abbey and elsewhere does not lurk in these arches and behind these pillars  the choir no doubt is richer and more beautiful but we did not enter it i remember two tombs with recumbent figures on there between the pillars that divide the nave from the side aisles and there were also mural monumentsone well executed to an officer slain in the peninsular war representing him falling from his horse another by a young widow to her husband with an inscription of passionate grief and a record of her purpose finally to sleep beside him  he died in 1803  i did not see on the monument any record of the consummation of her purpose and so perhaps she sleeps beside a second husband  there are more antique memorials than these two on the wall and i should have been interested to examine them but the service was now about to begin in the choir and at the faroff end of the nave the old verger waved his hand to banish us from the cathedral  at the same time he moved towards us probably to say that he would show it to us after service but having little time and being so moderately impressed with what i had already seen i took my departure and so disappointed the old man of his expected shilling or halfcrown  the tomb of king john is somewhere in this cathedral  we renewed our rambles through the town and passing the museum of the worcester natural history society i yielded to js wish to go in there are three days in the week i believe on which it is open to the public but this being one of the close days we were admitted on payment of a shilling  it seemed a very good and wellarranged collection in most departments of natural history and j who takes more interest in these matters than i do was much delighted  we were left to examine the hall and galleries quite at our leisure  besides the specimens of beasts birds shells fishes minerals fossils insects and all other natural things before the flood and since there was a stone bearing a roman inscription and various antiquities coins and medals and likewise portraits some of which were old and curious  leaving the museum we walked down to the stone bridge over the severn which is here the largest river i have seen in england except of course the mersey and the thames  a flight of steps leads from the bridge down to a walk along the riverside and this we followed till we reached the spot where an angler was catching chubs and dace under the walls of the bishops palace which here faces the river  it seems to be an old building but with modern repairs and improvements  the angler had pretty good success while we were looking at him drawing out two or three silvery fish and depositing them in his basket which was already more than half full  the severn is not a transparent stream and looks sluggish but has really movement enough to carry the anglers float along pretty fast  there were two vessels of considerable size that is as large as small schooners lying at the bridge  we now passed under an old stone archway through a lane that led us from the riverside up past the cathedral whence a gentleman and lady were just emerging and the verger was closing the door behind them  we returned to our hotel and ordered luncheonsome cold chicken cold ham and ale and after paying the bill about fifteen shillings to which i added five shillings for attendance we took our departure in a fly for the railway  the waiter a young woman chambermaid and boots all favored us with the most benign and deferential looks at parting whence it was easy to see that i had given them more than they had any claim to receive  nevertheless this english system of fees has its good side and i never travel without finding the advantage of it especially on railways where the officials are strictly forbidden to take fees and where in consequence a fee secures twice as much good service as anywhere else  be it recorded that i never knew an englishman to refuse a shillingor for that matter a halfpenny  from worcester we took tickets to wolverhampton and thence to birkenhead  it grew dark before we reached chester and began to rain and when we got to birkenhead it was a pitiless pelting storm under which on the deck of the steamboat we crossed the detestable mersey two years trial of which has made me detest it every day more and more it being the night of rejoicing for the taking of sebastopol and the visit of the duke of cambridge we found it very difficult to get a cab on the liverpool side but after much waiting in the rain and afterwards in one of the refreshmentrooms on the landing stage we took a hansom and drove off  the cloudy sky reflected the illuminations and we saw some gaslighted stars and other devices as we passed very pretty but much marred by the wind and rain  so we finally arrived at mrs blodgetts and made a good supper of ham and cold chicken like our luncheon after which wet as we were and drizzling as the weather was and though it was two hours beyond his bedtime i took j out to see the illuminations  i wonder what his mother would have said  but the boy must now begin to see life and to feel it  there was a crowd of people in the street such a crowd that we could hardly make a passage through them and so many cabs and omnibuses that it was difficult to cross the ways  some of the illuminations were very brilliant but there was a woful lack of variety and invention in the devices  the star of the garter which kept flashing out from the continual extinguishment of the wind and rainv and a in capital letters of lightwere repeated a hundred times as were loyal and patriotic mottoescrowns formed by colored lamps  in some instances a sensible tradesman had illuminated his own sign thereby at once advertising his loyalty and his business  innumerable flags were suspended before the houses and across the streets and the crowd plodded on silent heavy and without any demonstration of joy unless by the discharge of pistols close at ones ear  the rain to be sure was quite sufficient to damp any joyous ebullition of feeling but the next day when the rain had ceased and when the streets were still thronged with people there was the same heavy purposeless strolling from place to place with no more alacrity of spirit than while it rained  the english do not know how to rejoice and in their present circumstances to say the truth have not much to rejoice for  we soon came home but i believe it was nearly if not quite eleven  at mrs blodgetts mr archer surgeon to some prison or house of correction here in liverpool spoke of an attorney who many years ago committed forgery and being apprehended took a dose of prussic acid mr archer came with the stomachpump and asked the patient how much prussic acid he had taken  sir he replied attorneylike i decline answering that question  he recovered and afterwards arrived at great wealth in new south wales   november 14that dinner at mr brights a week or two ago mr robertson gladstone spoke of a magistrate of liverpool many years since sir john   of a morning sitting on the bench in the police court he would take five shillings out of his pocket and say here mr clerk so much for my fine  i was drunk last night  mr gladstone witnessed this personally   november 16thi went to the north hospital yesterday to take the deposition of a dying man as to his ill treatment by the second and third mates of the ship assyria on the voyage from new orleans  this hospital is a very gloomy place with its wide bleak entries and staircases which may be very good for summer weather but which are most congenial at this bleak november season  i found the physicians of the house laughing and talking very cheerfully with mr wilding who had preceded me  we went forthwith up two or three pairs of stairs to the ward where the sick man lay and where there were six or eight other beds in almost each of which was a patientnarrow beds shabbily furnished  the man whom i came to see was the only one who was not perfectly quiet neither was he very restless  the doctor informing him of my presence intimated that his disease might be lethal and that i was come to hear what he had to say as to the causes of his death  afterwards a testament was sought for in order to swear him and i administered the oath and made him kiss the book  he then in response to mr wildings questions told how he had been beaten and illtreated hanged and thwacked from the moment he came on board to which usage he ascribed his death  sometimes his senses seemed to sink away so that i almost thought him dead but by and by the questions would appear to reach him and bring him back and he went on with his evidence interspersing it however with dying groans and almost death rattles  in the midst of whatever he was saying he often recurred to a sum of four dollars and a half which he said he had put into the hands of the porter of the hospital and which he wanted to get back  several times he expressed his wish to return to america of which he was not a native and on the whole i do not think he had any real sense of his precarious condition notwithstanding that he assented to the doctors hint to that effect  he sank away so much at one time that they brought him wine in a tin cup with a spout to drink out of and he mustered strength to raise himself in his bed and drink then hemmed with rather a disappointed air as if it did not stimulate and refresh him as drink ought to do  when he had finished his evidence which mr wilding took down in writing from his mouth he marked his cross at the foot of the paper and we ceased to torment him with further question  his deposition will probably do no good so far as the punishment of the persons implicated is concerned for he appears to have come on board in a sickly state and never to have been well during the passage  on a pallet close by his bed lay another seaman of the same ship who had likewise been abused by the same men and bore more ostensible marks of ill usage than this man did about the head and face there is a most dreadful state of things aboard our ships  hell itself can be no worse than some of them and i do pray that some newenglander with the rage of reform in him may turn his thoughts this way  the first step towards better thingsthe best practicable step for the presentis to legalize flogging on shipboard thereby doing away with the miscellaneous assaults and batteries kickings fisticuffings ropesendings marlinespikings which the inferior officers continually perpetrate as the only mode of keeping up anything like discipline  as in many other instances philanthropy has overshot itself by the prohibition of flogging causing the captain to avoid the responsibility of solemn punishment and leave his mates to make devils of themselves by habitual and hardly avoidable ill treatment of the seamen  after i left the dying sailor his features seemed to contract and grow sharp  some young medical students stood about the bed watching death creep upon him and anticipating perhaps that in a day or two they would have the poor fellows body on the dissectingtable  dead patients i believe undergo this fate unless somebody chooses to pay their funeral expenses but the captain of the assyria who seems to be respectable and kindhearted though master of a floating hell tells me that he means to bury the man at his own cost  this morning there is a note from the surgeon of the hospital announcing his death and likewise the dangerous state of his shipmate whom i saw on the pallet beside him  seacaptains call a dresscoat a clawhammer   november 22di went on board the ship william lapscott lying in the river yesterday to take depositions in reference to a homicide committed in new york  i sat on a sofa in the cabin and mr wilding at a table with his writingmaterials before him and the crew were summoned one by onerough piraticallooking fellows contrasting strongly with the gewgaw cabin in which i received them  there is no such finery on land as in the cabin of one of these ships in the liverpool trade finished off with a complete panelling of rosewood mahogany and birdseye maple polished and varnished and gilded along the cornices and the edges of the panels  it is all a piece of elaborate cabinetwork and one does not altogether see why it should be given to the gales and the saltsea atmosphere to be tossed upon the waves and occupied by a rude shipmaster in his dreadnaught clothes when the fairest lady in the land has no such boudoir  a telltale compass hung beneath the skylight and a clock was fastened near it and ticked loudly  a stewardess with the aspect of a woman at home went in and out of the cabin about her domestic calls  through the cabin door it being a house on deck i could see the arrangement of the ship  the first sailor that i examined was a blackhaired powerful fellow in an oilskin jacket with a good face enough though he too might have been taken for a pirate  in the affray in which the homicide occurred he had received a cut across the forehead and another slantwise across his nose which had quite cut it in two on a level with the face and had thence gone downward to his lower jaw  but neither he nor any one else could give any testimony elucidating the matter into which i had come to inquire  a seaman had been stabbed just before the vessel left new york and had been sent on shore and died there  most of these men were in the affray and all of then were within a few yards of the spot where it occurred but those actually present all pleaded that they were so drunk that the whole thing was now like a dream with no distinct images and if any had been sober they took care to know nothing that could inculpate any individual  perhaps they spoke truth they certainly had a free and honestlike way of giving their evidence as if their only object was to tell all the truth they knew  but i rather think in the forecastle and during the nightwatches they have whispered to one another a great deal more than they told me and have come to a pretty accurate conclusion as to the man who gave the stab  while the examination proceeded there was a drawing of corks in a side closet and at its conclusion the captain asked us to stay to dinner but we excused ourselves and drank only a glass of wine  the captain apologized for not joining us inasmuch as he had drunk no wine for the last seventeen years  he appears to be a particularly good and trustworthy man and is the only shipmaster whom i have met with who says that a crew can best be governed by kindness  in the inner closet there was a cage containing two landbirds who had come aboard him tired almost to death three or four hundred miles from shore and he had fed them and been tender of them from a sense of what was due to hospitality  he means to give them to j   november 28thi have grown wofully aristocratic in my tastes i fear since coming to england at all events i am conscious of a certain disgust at going to dine in a house with a small entrancehall and a narrow staircase parlor with chintz curtains and all other arrangements on a similar scale  this is pitiable  however i really do not think i should mind these things were it not for the bustle the affectation the intensity of the mistress of the house  it is certain that a woman in england is either decidedly a lady or decidedly not a lady  there seems to be no respectable medium  bill of fare broiled soles half of a roast pig a haricot of mutton stewed oysters a tart pears figs with sherry and port wine both good and the port particularly so  i ate some pig and could hardly resist the ladys importunities to eat more though to my fancy it tasted of swillhad a flavor of the pigsty on the parlor table were some poor editions of popular books longfellows poems and others  the lady affects a literary taste and bothered me about my own productions  a beautiful subject for a romance or for a sermon would be the subsequent life of the young man whom jesus bade to sell all he had and give to the poor and he went away sorrowful and is not recorded to have done what he was bid   december 11ththis has been a foggy morning and forenoon snowing a little now and then and disagreeably cold  the sky is of an inexpressibly dreary dun color  it is so dark at times that i have to hold my book close to my eyes and then again it lightens up a little on the whole disgustingly gloomy and thus it has been for a long while past although the disagreeableness seems to be very near the earth and just above the steeples and housetops very probably there may be a bright sunshiny day  at about twelve there is a faint glow of sunlight like the gleaming reflection from a not highly polished copper kettle   december 26thon christmas eve and yesterday there were little branches of mistletoe hanging in several parts of the house in the kitchen the entries the parlor and the smokingroomsuspended from the gasfittings  the maids of the house did their utmost to entrap the gentlemen boarders old and young under the privileged places and there to kiss them after which they were expected to pay a shilling  it is very queer being customarily so respectful that they should assume this license now absolutely trying to pull the gentlemen into the kitchen by main force and kissing the harder and more abundantly the more they were resisted  a little rosychecked scotch lassat other times very modest was the most active in this business  i doubt whether any gentleman but myself escaped  i heard old mr s parleying with the maids last evening and pleading his age but he seems to have met with no mercy for there was a sound of prodigious smacking immediately afterwards  j was assaulted and fought most vigorously but was outrageously kissedreceiving some scratches moreover in the conflict  the mistletoe has white waxlooking berries and dull green leaves with a parasitical stem  early in the morning of christmas day long before daylight i heard music in the street and a womans voice powerful and melodious singing a christmas hymn  before bedtime i presume one half of england at a moderate calculation was the worse for liquor  the markethouses at this season show the national taste for heavy feedingcarcasses of prize oxen immensely fat and bulky fat sheep with their woolly heads and tails still on and stars and other devices ingeniously wrought on the quarters fat pigs adorned with flowers like corpses of virgins hares wildfowl geese ducks turkeys and green boughs and banners suspended about the stallsand a great deal of dirt and griminess on the stone floor of the markethouse and on the persons of the crowd  there are some englishmen whom i likeone or two for whom i might say i have an affection but still there is not the same union between us as if they were americans  a cold thin medium intervenes betwixt our most intimate approaches  it puts me in mind of alnaschar and his princess with the cold steel blade of his scimitar between them  perhaps if i were at home i might feel differently but in a foreign land i can never forget the distinction between english and american   january 1st 1856last night at mrs blodgetts we sat up till twelve oclock to open the front door and let the new year in  after the coming guest was fairly in the house the back door was to be opened to let the old year out but i was tired and did not wait for the latter ceremony  when the new year made its entrance there was a general shaking of hands and one of the shipmasters said that it was customary to kiss the ladies all round but to my great satisfaction we did not proceed to such extremity  there was singing in the streets and many voices of people passing and when twelve had struck all the bells of the town i believe rang out together  i went up stairs sad and lonely and stepping into js little room wished him a happy new year as he slept and many of them  to a cool observer a country does not show to best advantage during a time of war  all its selfconceit is doubly visible and indeed is sedulously kept uppermost by direct appeals to it  the country must be humbugged in order to keep its courage up  sentiment seems to me more abundant in middleaged ladies in england than in the united states  i dont know how it may be with young ladies  the shipmasters bear testimony to the singular delicacy of common sailors in their behavior in the presence of women and they say that this good trait is still strongly observable even in the present race of seamen greatly deteriorated as it is  on shipboard there is never an indecorous word or unseemly act said or done by sailors when a woman can be cognizant of it and their deportment in this respect differs greatly from that of landsmen of similar position in society  this is remarkable considering that a sailors female acquaintances are usually and exclusively of the worst kind and that his intercourse with them has no relation whatever to morality or decency  for this very reason i suppose he regards a modest woman as a creature divine and to be reverenced   january 16thi have suffered wofully from low spirits for some time past and this has not often been the case since i grew to be a man even in the least auspicious periods of my life  my desolate bachelor condition i suppose is the cause  really i have no pleasure in anything and i feel my tread to be heavier and my physical movement more sluggish than in happier times  a weight is always upon me  my appetite is not good  i sleep ill lying awake till late at night to think sad thoughts and to imagine sombre things and awaking before light with the same thoughts and fancies still in my mind  my heart sinks always as i ascend the stairs to my office from a dim augury of ill news from lisbon that i may perhaps hearof blacksealed letters or some such horrors  nothing gives me any joy  i have learned what the bitterness of exile is in these days and i never should have known it but for the absence of remote unfriended melancholy slowi can perfectly appreciate that line of goldsmith for it well expresses my own torpid unenterprising joyless state of mind and heart  i am like an uprooted plant wilted and drooping  life seems so purposeless as not to be worth the trouble of carrying it on any further  i was at a dinner the other evening at mr bs where the entertainment was almost entirely americannew york oysters raw stewed and fried soup of american partridges particularly good also terrapin soup rich but not to my taste american pork and beans baked in yankee style a noble american turkey weighing thirtyone pounds and at the other end of the table an american round of beef which the englishmen present allowed to be delicious and worth a guinea an ounce i forget the other american dishes if there were any moreo yes canvasback ducks coming on with the sweets in the usual english fashion  we ought to have had catawba wine but this was wanting although there was plenty of hock champagne sherry madeira port and claret  our host is a very jolly man and the dinner was a merrier and noisier one than any english dinner within my experience   february 8thi read today in the little officebible greasy with perjuries st lukes account of the agony the trial the crucifixion and the resurrection and how christ appeared to the two disciples on their way to emmaus and afterwards to a company of disciples  on both these latter occasions he expounded the scriptures to them and showed the application of the old prophecies to himself and it is to be supposed that he made them fully or at least sufficiently aware what his character waswhether god or man or both or something between together with all other essential points of doctrine  but none of this doctrine or of these expositions is recorded the mere facts being most simply stated and the conclusion to which he led them that whether god himself or the son of god or merely the son of man he was at all events the christ foretold in the jewish scriptures  this last therefore must have been the one essential point   february 18thon saturday there called on me an elderly robinsoncrusoe sort of man mr h shipwright i believe of boston who has lately been travelling in the east  about a year ago he was here after being shipwrecked on the dutch coast and i assisted him to get home again i have supplied him with five pounds and my credit for an outside garment  he is a spare man with closely cropped gray or rather white hair closecropped whiskers fringing round his chin and a closecropped white mustache with his under lip and a portion of his chin bare beneathsunburnt and weatherworn  he has been in syria and jerusalem through the desert and at sebastopol and says he means to get ticknor to publish his travels and the story of his whole adventurous life on his return home  a freespoken confiding hardy religious unpolished simple yet worldexperienced man very talkative and boring me with longer visits than i like  he has brought home among other curiosities a ladys arm as he calls it two thousand years olda piece of a mummy of course also some coins one of which a gold coin of vespasian he showed me and said he bought it of an arab of the desert the bedouins possess a good many of these coins handed down immemorially from father to son and never sell them unless compelled by want  he had likewise a hebrew manuscript of the book of ruth on a parchment roll which was put into his care to be given to lord haddo  he was at sebastopol during the siege and nearly got his head knocked off by a cannonball  his strangest statement is one in reference to lord raglan  he says that an english officer told him that his lordship shut himself up desiring not to be disturbed as he needed sleep  when fifteen hours had gone by his attendants thought it time to break open the door and lord raglan was found dead with a bottle of strychnine by the bedside  the affair so far as the circumstances indicated suicide was hushed up and his death represented as a natural one  the english officer seems to have been an unscrupulous fellow jesting thus with the fresh memory of his dead commander for it is impossible to believe a word of the story  even if lord raglan had wished for death he would hardly have taken strychnine when there were so many chances of being honorably shot  in woods narrative of the campaign it is stated that he died surrounded by the members of his staff after having been for some time ill  it appears however by the same statement that no serious apprehensions had been entertained until one afternoon he shut himself in desiring not to be disturbed till evening  after two or three hours he called lord burghershfrank frank and was found to be almost in a state of collapse and died that evening  mr hs story might very well have been a camp rumor  it seems to me that the british ministry in its notion of a lifepeerage shows an entire misunderstanding of what makes people desire the peerage  it is not for the immediate personal distinction but because it removes the peer and his consanguinity from the common rank of men and makes a separate order of them as if they should grow angelic  a lifepeer is but a mortal amid the angelic throng   february 28thi went yesterday with mrs  and another lady and mr m to the west derby workhouse      here comes in the visit to the west derby workhouse which was made the subject of a paper in our old home called outside glimpses of english poverty  as the purpose in publishing these passages from the private notebooks is to give to those who ask for a memoir of mr hawthorne every possible incident recorded by himself which shows his character and nature the editor thinks it proper to disclose the fact that mr hawthorne was himself the gentleman of that party who took up in his arms the little child so fearfully repulsive in its condition  and it seems better to quote his own words in reference to it than merely to say it was he  under date february 28 1856  after this we went to the ward where the children were kept and on entering this we saw in the first place two or three unlovely and unwholesome little imps who were lazily playing together  one of them a child about six years old but i know not whether girl or boy immediately took the strangest fancy for me  it was a wretched pale halftorpid little thing with a humor in its eyes which the governor said was the scurvy  i never saw till a few moments afterwards a child that i should feel less inclined to fondle  but this little sickly humoreaten fright prowled around me taking hold of my skirts following at my heels and at last held up its hands smiled in my face and standing directly before me insisted on my taking it up  not that it said a word for i rather think it was underwitted and could not talk but its face expressed such perfect confidence that it was going to be taken up and made much of that it was impossible not to do it  it was as if god had promised the child this favor on my behalf and that i must needs fulfil the contract  i held my undesirable burden a little while and after setting the child down it still followed me holding two of my fingers and playing with them just as if it were a child of my own  it was a foundling and out of all human kind it chose me to be its father  we went up stairs into another ward and on coming down again there was this same child waiting for me with a sickly smile round its defaced mouth and in its dim red eyes     i never should have forgiven myself if i had repelled its advancesed  after leaving the workhouse we drove to norris green and mrs  showed me round the grounds which are very good and nicely kept  o these english homes what delightful places they are  i wonder how many people live and die in the workhouse having no other home because other people have a great deal more home than enough     we had a very pleasant dinner and mr m and i walked back four miles and a half to liverpool where we arrived just before midnight  why did christ curse the figtree  it was not in the least to blame and it seems most unreasonable to have expected it to bear figs out of season  instead of withering it away it would have been as great a miracle and far more beautiful and one would think of more beneficent influence to have made it suddenly rich with ripe fruit  then to be sure it might have died joyfully having answered so good a purpose  i have been reminded of this miracle by the story of a man in heywood a town in lancashire who used such horribly profane language that a planetree in front of his cottage is said to have withered away from that hour  i can draw no moral from the incident of the figtree unless it be that all things perish from the instant when they cease to answer some divine purpose   march 6thyesterday i lunched on board captain russells ship the princeton  these daily lunches on shipboard might answer very well the purposes of a dinner being in fact noontide dinners with soup roast mutton muttonchops and a macaroni puddingbrandy port and sherry wines  there were three elderly englishmen at table with white heads which i think is oftener the predicament of elderly heads here than in america  one of these was a retired customhouse officer and the other two were connected with shipping in some way  there is a satisfaction in seeing englishmen eat and drink they do it so heartily and on the whole so wiselytrusting so entirely that there is no harm in good beef and mutton and a reasonable quantity of good liquor and these three hale old men who had acted on this wholesome faith for so long were proofs that it is well on earth to live like earthly creatures  in america what squeamishness what delicacy what stomachic apprehension would there not be among three stomachs of sixty or seventy years experience  i think this failure of american stomachs is partly owing to our ill usage of our digestive powers and partly to our want of faith in them  after lunch we all got into an omnibus and went to the mersey iron foundry to see the biggest piece of ordnance in the world which is almost finished  the overseer of the works received us and escorted us courteously throughout the establishment which is very extensive giving employment to a thousand men what with nightwork and daywork  the big gun is still on the axle or turningmachine by means of which it has been bored  it is made entirely of wrought and welded iron fifty tons of which were originally used and the gun in its present state bored out and smoothed away weighs nearly twentythree tons  it has as yet no trunnions and does not look much like a cannon but only a huge iron cylinder immensely solid and with a bore so large that a young man of nineteen shoved himself into it the whole length with a light in order to see whether it is duly smooth and regular  i suppose it will have a better effect as to the impression of size when it is finished polished mounted aid fully equipped after the fashion of ordinary cannon  it is to throw a ball of three hundred pounds weight five miles and woe be to whatever ship or battlement shall bear the brunt  after inspecting the gun we went through other portions of the establishment and saw iron in various stages of manufacture  i am not usually interested in manufacturing processes being quite unable to understand them at least in cottonmachinery and the like but here there were such exhibitions of mighty strength both of men and machines that i had a satisfaction in looking on  we saw lumps of iron intensely whitehot and in all but a melting state passed through rollers of various size and pressure and speedily converted into long bars which came curling and waving out of the rollers like great red ribbons or like fiery serpents wriggling out of tophet and finally being straightened out they were laid to cool in heaps  triphammers are very pleasant things to look at working so massively as they do and yet so accurately chewing up the hot iron as it were and fashioning it into shape with a sort of mighty and gigantic gentleness in their mode of action  what great things man has contrived and is continually performing  what a noble brute he is  also i found much delight in looking at the molten iron boiling and bubbling in the furnace and sometimes slopping over when stirred by the attendant  there were numberless fires on all sides blinding us with their intense glow and continually the pounding strokes of huge hammers some wielded by machinery and others by human arms  i had a respect for these stalwart workmen who seemed to be near kindred of the machines amid which they wroughtmighty men smiting stoutly and looking into the fierce eyes of the furnace fearlessly and handling the iron at a temperature which would have taken the skin off from ordinary fingers they looked strong indeed but pale for the hot atmosphere in which they live cannot but be deleterious and i suppose their very strength wears them quickly out  but i would rather live ten years as an ironsmith than fifty as a tailor  so much heat can be concentrated into a mass of iron that a lump a foot square heats all the atmosphere about it and burns the face at a considerable distance  as the triphammer strikes the lump it seems still more to intensify the heat by squeezing it together and the fluid iron oozes out like sap or juice  he was ready for the newest fashionsthis expression was used by mrs blodgett in reference to mr  on his first arrival in england and it is a very tender way of signifying that a person is rather poorly off as to apparel   march 15thmr  our new ambassador arrived on thursday afternoon by the atlantic and i called at the adelphi hotel after dinner to pay him my respects  i found him and his family at supper     they seem to be plain affable people     the ambassador is a venerable old gentleman with a full head of perfectly white hair looking not unlike an oldfashioned wig and this together with his collarless white neckcloth and his brown coat gave him precisely such an aspect as one would expect in a respectable person of prerevolutionary days  there was a formal simplicity too in his manners that might have belonged to the same era  he must have been a very handsome man in his youthful days and is now comely very erect moderately tall not overburdened with flesh of benign and agreeable address with a pleasant smile but his eyes which are not very large impressed me as sharp and cold  he did not at all stamp himself upon me as a man of much intellectual or characteristic vigor  i found no such matter in his conversation nor did i feel it in the indefinable way by which strength always makes itself acknowledged  b though somehow plain and uncouth yet vindicates himself as a large man of the world able experienced fit to handle difficult circumstances of life dignified too and able to hold his own in any society  mr  has a kind of venerable dignity but yet if a person could so little respect himself as to insult him i should say that there was no innate force in mr  to prevent it  it is very strange that he should have made so considerable a figure in public life filling offices that the strongest men would have thought worthy of their highest ambition  there must be something shrewd and sly under his apparent simplicity narrow cold selfish perhaps  i fancied these things in his eyes  he has risen in life by the lack of too powerful qualities and by a certain tact which enables him to take advantage of circumstances and opportunities and avail himself of his unobjectionableness just at the proper time  i suppose he must be pronounced a humbug yet almost or quite an innocent one  yet he is a queer representative to be sent from brawling and boisterous america at such a critical period  it will be funny if england sends him back again on hearing the news of s dismissal mr  gives me the impression of being a very amiable man in his own family  he has brought his son with him as secretary of legationa small young man with a little mustache  it will be a feeble embassy  i called again the next morning and introduced mrs  who i believe accompanied the ladies about town  this simplicity in mr s manner puzzles and teases me for in spite of it there was a sort of selfconsciousness as if he were being looked atas if he were having his portrait taken    london   march 22dyesterdayno day before yesterdayi left liverpool for london by rail from the lime street station  the journey was a dull and monotonous one as usual  three passengers were in the same carriage with me at starting but they dropped off and from rugby i was alone we reached london after ten oclock and i took a cab for st jamess place no  32 where i found mr b expecting me  he had secured a bedroom for me at this lodginghouse and i am to be free of his drawingroom during my stay  we breakfasted at nine and then walked down to his countingroom in old broad street in the city  it being a dim dingy morning london looked very dull the more so as it was good friday and therefore the streets were comparatively thin of people and vehicles and had on their sunday aspect  if it were not for the human life and bustle of london it would be a very stupid place with a heavy and drearymonotony of unpicturesque streets  we went up bolt court where dr johnson used to live and this was the only interesting site we saw  after spending some time in the countingroom while mr  read his letters we went to london bridge and took the steamer for waterloo bridge with partly an intent to go to richmond but the day was so damp and dusky that we concluded otherwise  so we came home visiting on our way the site of covent garden theatre lately burnt down  the exterior walls still remain perfect and look quite solid enough to admit of the interior being renewed but i believe it is determined to take them down  after a slight lunch and a glass of wine we walked out along piccadilly and to hyde park which already looks very green and where there were a good many people walking and driving and rosyfaced children at play  somehow or other the shine and charm are gone from london since my last visit and i did not very much admire nor feel much interested in anything  we returned and i for my part was much wearied in time for dinner at five  the evening was spent at home in various talk and i find mr  a very agreeable companion and a young man of thought and information with a selfrespecting character and i think him a safe person to live with  this st jamess place is in close vicinity to st jamess palace the gateway and not very splendid front of which we can see from the corner the clubhouses and the best life of the town are near at hand  addison before his marriage used to live in st jamess place and the house where mr rogers recently died is up the court not that this latter residence excites much interest in my mind  i remember nothing else very noteworthy in this first days experience except that on sir watkins williams wynns door not far from this house i saw a gold knocker which is said to be unscrewed every night lest it should be stolen  i dont know whether it be really gold for it did not look so bright as the generality of brass ones  i received a very good letter from j this morning  he was to go to mr brights at sandhays yesterday and remain till monday  after writing the above i walked along the strand fleet street ludgate hill and cheapside to wood streeta very narrow street insomuch that one has to press close against the wall to escape being grazed when a cart is passing  at no 77 i found the place of business of mr bennoch who came to see me at rock ferry with mr jerdan not long after my arrival in england  i found him in his office but he did not at first recognize me so much stouter have i grown during my residence in englanda new man as he says  mr bennoch is a kindly frank very good man and was bounteous in his plans for making my time pass pleasantly  we talked of  from whom he has just received a letter and who says he will fight for england in case of a war  i let bennoch know that i at least should take the other side  after arranging to go to greenwich fair and afterwards to dine with bennoch i left him and went to mr s office and afterwards strayed forth again and crossed london bridge  thence i rambled rather drearily along through several shabby and uninteresting streets on the other side of the thames and the dull streets in london are really the dullest and most disheartening in the world  by and by i found my way to southwark bridge and so crossed to upper thames street which was likewise very stupid though i believe clenmans paternal house in little dorrit stands thereabouts     next i got into ludgate hill near st pauls and being quite footweary i took a paddington omnibus and rode up into regent street whence i came home   march 24thyesterday being a clear day for england we determined upon an expedition to hampton court so walked out betimes towards the waterloo station but first crossed the thames by westminster bridge and went to lambeth palace  it stands immediately on the bank of the river not far above the bridge  we merely walked round it and saw only an old stone tower or two partially renewed with brick and a high connecting wall within which appeared gables and other portions of the palace all of an ancient plan and venerable aspect though evidently much patched up and restored in the course of the many ages since its foundation  there is likewise a church part of which looks old connected with the palace the streets surrounding it have many gabled houses and a general look of antiquity more than some other parts of london  we then walked to the waterloo station on the same side of the river and at twenty minutes past one took the rail for hampton court distant some twelve or fifteen miles  on arriving at the terminus we beheld hampton palace on the other side of the thamesan extensive structure with a front of red brick long and comparatively low with the great hall which wolsey built rising high above the rest  we crossed the river which is here but a narrow stream by a stone bridge  the entrance to the palace is about half a quarter of a mile from the railway through arched gates which give a long perspective into the several quadrangles these quadrangles one beyond another are paved with stone and surrounded by the brick walls of the palace the many windows of which look in upon them  soldiers were standing sentinel at the exterior gateways and at the various doors of the palace but they admitted everybody without question and without fee  policemen or other attendants were in most of the rooms but interfered with no one so that in this respect it was one of the pleasantest places to visit that i have found in england  a good many people of all classes were strolling through the apartments  we first went into wolseys great hall up a most spacious staircase the walls and ceiling of which were covered with an allegorical fresco by verrio wonderfully bright and well preserved and without caring about the design or execution i greatly liked the brilliancy of the colors the great hall is a most noble and beautiful room above a hundred feet long and sixty high and broad  most of the windows are of stained or painted glass with elaborate designs whether modern or ancient i know not but certainly brilliant in effect  the walls from the floor to perhaps half their height are covered with antique tapestry which though a good deal faded still retains color enough to be a very effective adornment and to give an idea of how rich a mode of decking a noble apartment this must have been  the subjects represented were from scripture and the figures seemed colossal  on looking closely at this tapestry you could see that it was thickly interwoven with threads of gold still glistening  the windows except one or two that are long do not descend below the top of this tapestry and are therefore twenty or thirty feet above the floor and this manner of lighting a great room seems to add much to the impressiveness of the enclosed space  the roof is very magnificent of carved oak intricately and elaborately arched and still as perfect to all appearance as when it was first made  there are banners so fresh in their hues and so untattered that i think they must be modern suspended along beneath the cornice of the hall and exhibiting wolseys arms and badges  on the whole this is a perfect sight in its way  next to the hall there is a withdrawingroom more than seventy feet long and twentyfive feet high  the walls of this apartment too are covered with ancient tapestry of allegorical design but more faded than that of the hall  there is also a stainedglass window and a marble statue of venus on a couch very lean and not very beautiful and some cartoons of carlo cignani which have left no impression on  my memory likewise a large model of a splendid palace of some east indian nabob  i am not sure after all that verrios frescoed grand staircase was not in another part of the palace for i remember that we went from it through an immensely long suite of apartments beginning with the guardchamber  all these rooms are wainscoted with oak which looks new being i believe of the date of king williams reign  over many of the doorways or around the panels there are carvings in wood by gibbons representing wreaths of flowers fruit and foliage the most perfectly beautiful that can be conceived and the wood being of a light hue limewood i believe it has a fine effect on the dark oak panelling the apartments open one beyond another in long long long succession rooms of state and kings and queens bedchambers and royal closets bigger than ordinary drawingrooms so that the whole suite must be half a mile or it may be a mile in extent  from the windows you get views of the palacegrounds broad and stately walks and groves of trees and lawns and fountains and the thames and adjacent country beyond  the walls of all these rooms are absolutely covered with pictures including works of all the great masters which would require long study before a new eye could enjoy them and seeing so many of them at once and having such a nothing of time to look at them all i did not even try to see any merit in them  vandykes picture of charles i on a white horse beneath an arched gateway made more impression on me than any other and as i recall it now it seems as if i could see the kings noble melancholy face and armed form remembered not in picture but in reality  all sir peter lelys lewd women and knellers too were in these rooms and the jolly old stupidity of george iii and his family many times repeated and pictures by titian rubens and other famous hands intermixed with many by west which provokingly drew the eye away from their betters  it seems to me that a picture of all other things should be by itself whereas people always congregate them in galleries  to endeavor really to see them so arranged is like trying to read a hundred poems at oncea most absurd attempt  of all these pictures i hardly recollect any so well as a ridiculous old travesty of the resurrection and last judgment where the dead people are represented as coming to life at the sound of the trumpetthe flesh reestablishing itself on the bones one man picking up his skull and putting it on his shouldersand all appearing greatly startled only half awake and at a loss what to do next  some devils are dragging away the damned by the heels and on sledges and above sits the redeemer and some angelic and sainted people looking complacently down upon the scene  we saw in one of the rooms the funeral canopy beneath which the duke of wellington lay in statevery gorgeous of black velvet embroidered with silver and adorned with escutcheons also the state bed of queen anne broad and of comfortable appearance though it was a queensthe materials of the curtains quilt and furniture red velvet still brilliant in hue also king williams bed and his queen marys with enormously tall posts and a good deal the worse for time and wear  the last apartment we entered was the gallery containing raphaels cartoons which i shall not pretend to admire nor to understand  i can conceive indeed that there is a great deal of expression in them and very probably they may in every respect deserve all their fame but on this point i can give no testimony  to my perception they were a series of very much faded pictures dimly seen for this part of the palace was now in shadow and representing figures neither graceful nor beautiful nor as far as i could discern particularly grand  but i came to them with a wearied mind and eye and also i had a previous distaste to them through the medium of engravings  but what a noble palace nobly enriched is this hampton court  the english government does well to keep it up and to admit the people freely into it for it is impossible for even a republican not to feel something like aweat least a profound respectfor all this state and for the institutions which are here represented the sovereigns whose moral magnificence demands such a residence and its permanence too enduring from age to age and each royal generation adding new splendors to those accumulated by their predecessors  if one views the matter in another way to be sure we may feel indignant that such doltheads rowdies and every way mean people as many of the english sovereigns have been should inhabit these stately halls contrasting its splendors with their littleness but on the whole i readily consented within myself to be impressed for a moment with the feeling that royalty has its glorious side  by no possibility can we ever have such a place in america  leaving hampton court at about four oclock we walked through bushy parka beautiful tract of ground well wooded with fine old trees green with moss all up their twisted trunksthrough several villages twickenham among the rest to richmond  before entering twickenham we passed a lathandplaster castellated edifice much timeworn and with the plaster peeling off from the laths which i fancied might be horace walpoles toycastle  not that it really could have been but it was like the image wretchedly mean and shabby which one forms of such a place in its decay  from hampton court to the star and garter on richmond hill is about six miles  after glancing cursorily at the prospect which is famous and doubtless very extensive and beautiful if the english mistiness would only let it be seen we took a good dinner in the large and handsome coffeeroom of the hotel and then wended our way to the railstation and reached home between eight and nine oclock  we must have walked not far from fifteen miles in the course of the day   march 25thyesterday at one oclock i called by appointment on mr bennoch and lunched with him and his partners and clerks  this lunch seems to be a legitimate continuation of the old london custom of the master living at the same table with his apprentices  the meal was a dinner for the latter class  the table was set in an upper room of the establishment and the dinner was a large joint of roast mutton to which ten people sat down including a german silkmerchant as a guest besides myself  mr bennoch was at the head of the table and one of his partners at the foot  for the apprentices there was porter to drink and for the partners and guests some sparkling moselle and we had a sufficient dinner with agreeable conversation  bennoch said that g g used to be very fond of these lunches while in england  after lunch mr bennoch took me round the establishment which is quite extensive occupying i think two or three adjacent houses and requiring more  he showed me innumerable packages of ribbons and other silk manufactures and all sorts of silks from the raw thread to the finest fabrics  he then offered to show me some of the curiosities of old london and took me first to barbersurgeons hall in monkwell street  it was at this place that the first anatomical studies were instituted in england  at the time of its foundation the barbers and surgeons were one company but the latter i believe are now the exclusive possessors of the hall  the edifice was built by inigo jones and the principal room is a fine one with finely carved woodwork on the ceiling and walls  there is a skylight in the roof letting down a sufficient radiance on the long table beneath where no doubt dead people have been dissected and where for many generations it has been the custom of the society to hold its stated feasts  in this room hangs the most valuable picture by holbein now in existence representing the company of barbersurgeons kneeling before henry viii and receiving their charter from his hands  the picture is about six feet square  the king is dressed in scarlet and quite fulfils ones idea of his aspect the barbersurgeons all portraits are an assemblage of gravelooking personages in dark costumes  the company has refused five thousand pounds for this unique picture and the keeper of the hall told me that sir robert peel had offered a thousand pounds for liberty to take out only one of the heads that of a person named pen he conditioning to have a perfect facsimile painted in  i did not see any merit in this head over the others  beside this great picture hung a most exquisite portrait by vandyke an elderly bearded man of noble and refined countenance in a rich grave dress  there are many other pictures of distinguished men of the company in long past times and of some of the kings and great people of england all darkened with age and producing a rich and sombre effect in this stately old hall  nothing is more curious in london than these ancient localities and customs of the city companieseach trade and profession having its own hall and its own institutions  the keeper next showed us the plate which is used at the banquets  i should like to be present at one of these feasts  i saw also an old vellum manuscript in blackletter which appeared to be a record of the proceedings of the company and at the end there were many pages ruled for further entries but none had been made in the volume for the last three or four hundred years  i think it was in the neighborhood of barbersurgeons hall which stands amid an intricacy of old streets where i should never have thought of going that i saw a row of ancient almshouses of elizabethan structure they looked wofully dilapidated  in front of one of them was an inscription setting forth that some worthy alderman had founded this establishment for the support of six poor men and these six or their successors are still supported but no larger number although the value of the property left for that purpose would now suffice for a much larger number  then mr bennoch took me to cripplegate and entering the door of a house which proved to be a sextons residence we passed by a side entrance into the churchporch of st giles of which the sextons house seems to be an indivisible contiguity  this is a very ancient church that escaped the great fire of london  the galleries are supported by arches the pillars of which are cased high upwards with oak but all this oaken work and the oaken pews are comparatively modern though so solid and dark that they agree well enough with the general effect of the church  proceeding to the high altar we found it surrounded with many very curious old monuments and memorials some in carved oak some in marble grim old worthies mostly in the costume of queen elizabeths time  here was the bust of speed the historian here was the monument of fox author of the book of martyrs  high up on the wall beside the altar there was a black wooden coffin and a lady sitting upright within it with her hands clasped in prayer it being her awakening moment at the resurrection  thence we passed down the centre aisle and about midway we stopped before a marble bust fixed against one of the pillars and this was the bust of milton  yes and miltons bones lay beneath our feet for he was buried under the pew over the door of which i was leaning  the bust i believe is the original of the one in westminster abbey  treading over the tombstones of the old citizens of london both in the aisles and the porch and within doors and without we went into the churchyard one side of which is fenced in by a portion of london wall very solid and still high though the accumulation of human dust has covered much of its base  this is the most considerable portion now remaining of the ancient wall of london  the sexton now asked us to go into the tower of the church that he might show us the oldest part of the structure and we did so and looking down from the organ gallery i saw a woman sitting alone in the church waiting for the rector whose ghostly consolation i suppose she needed  this old churchtower was formerly lighted by three large windowsone of them of very great size but the thrifty churchwardens of a generation or two ago had built them up with brick to the great disfigurement of the church  the sexton called my attention to the organpipe which is of sufficient size i believe to admit three men  from cripplegate we went to milton street as it is now called through which we walked for a very excellent reason for this is the veritable grub street where my literary kindred of former times used to congregate  it is still a shabbylooking street with oldfashioned houses and inhabited chiefly by people of the poorer classes though not by authors  next we went to old broad street and being joined by mr b we set off for london bridge turning out of our direct course to see london stone in watling street  this famous stone appears now to be built into the wall of st swithins church and is so encased that you can only see and touch the top of it through a circular hole there are one or two long cuts or indentations in the top which are said to have been made by jack cades sword when he struck it against the stone  if so his sword was of a redoubtable temper  judging by what i saw london stone was a rudely shaped and unhewn post  at the london bridge station we took the rail for greenwich and it being only about five miles off we were not long in reaching the town it was easter monday and during the first three days of easter from time immemorial a fair has been held at greenwich and this was what we had come to see  this fair is described in our old home in a loudon suburb  reaching mr bennochs house we found it a pretty and comfortable one and adorned with many works of art for he seems to be a patron of art and literature and a warmhearted man of active benevolence and vivid sympathies in many directions  his face shows this  i have never seen eyes of a warmer glow than his  on the walls of one room there were a good many sketches by haydon and several artists proofs of fine engravings presented by persons to whom he had been kind  in the drawingroom there was a marble bust of mrs  and one i think of himself and one of the queen which mr bennoch said was very good and it is unlike any other i have seen  it is intended as a gift from a number of subscribers to miss nightingale  likewise a crayon sketch of  looking rather morbid and unwholesome as the poor lady really is  also a small picture of mr bennoch in a military dress as an officer probably of cityhorse  by and by came in a young gentleman son of haydon the painter of high art and one or two ladies staying in the house and anon mrs   and so we went in to dinner  bennoch is an admirable host and warms his guests like a household fire by the influence of his kindly face and glowing eyes and by such hospitable demeanor as best suits this aspect  after the cloth was removed came in mr newton crosland a young man who once called on me in liverpoolthe husband of a literary lady formerly camilla toulmin the lady herself was coming to spend the evening  the husband and i presume the wife is a decided believer in spiritual manifestations  we talked of politics and spiritualism and literature and before we rose from table mr bennoch drank the health of the ladies and especially of mrs  in terms very kind towards her and me  i responded in her behalf as well as i could and left it to mr bowman as a bachelor to respond for the ladies generallywhich he did briefly toasting mrs b  we had heard the sound of the piano in the drawingroom for some time and now adjourning thither i had the pleasure to be introduced to mrs newton croslanda rather tall thin pale and ladylike person looking i thought of a sensitive character  she expressed in a low tone and quiet way great delight at seeing my distinguished self for she is a vast admirer of the scarlet letter and especially of the character of hester indeed i remember seeing a most favorable criticism of the book from her pen in one of the london magazines      at eleven oclock mrs crosland entered the tiniest ponycarriage and set forth for her own residence with a lad walking at the ponys head and carrying a lantern       march 26thyesterday was not a very eventful day  after writing in my journal i went out at twelve and visited for the first time the national gallery  it is of no use for me to criticise pictures or to try to describe them but i have an idea that i might acquire a taste with a little attention to the subject for i find i already begin to prefer some pictures to others  this is encouraging  of those that i saw yesterday i think i liked several by murillo best  there were a great many people in the gallery almost entirely of the middle with a few of the lower classes and i should think that the effect of the exhibition must at least tend towards refinement  nevertheless the only emotion that i saw displayed was in broad grins on the faces of a man and two women at sight of a small picture of venus with a satyr peeping at her with an expression of gross animal delight and merriment  without being aware of it this man and the two women were of that same satyr breed  if i lived in london i would endeavor to educate myself in this and other galleries of art but as the case stands it would be of no use  i saw two of turners landscapes but did not see so much beauty in them as in some of claudes  a view of the grand canal in venice by canaletto seemed to me wonderfulabsolutely perfecta better reality for i could see the water of the canal moving and dimpling and the palaces and buildings on each side were quite as good in their way  leaving the gallery i walked down into the city and passed through smithfield where i glanced at st bartholomews hospital     then i went into st pauls and walked all round the great cathedral looking i believe at every monument on the floor  there is certainly nothing very wonderful in any of them and i do wish it would not so generally happen that english warriors go into battle almost nude at least we must suppose so from their invariably receiving their deathwounds in that condition  i will not believe that a sculptor or a painter is a man of genius unless he can wake the nobleness of his subject illuminate and transfigure any given pattern of coat and breeches  nevertheless i never go into st pauls without being impressed anew with the grandeur of the edifice and the general effect of these same groups of statuary ranged in their niches and at the bases of the pillars as adornments of the cathedral  coming homeward i went into the enclosure of the temple and near the entrance saw dr johnsons staircase printed over a doorway so i not only looked in but went up the first flight of some broad wellworn stairs passing my hand over a heavy ancient broken balustrade on which no doubt johnsons hand had often rested  it was here that boswell used to visit him in their early acquaintance  before my lunch i had gone into bolt court where he died  this morning there have been letters from mr wilding enclosing an invitation to me to be one of the stewards of the anniversary dinner of the literary fund  no i thank you gentlemen   march 27thyesterday i went out at about twelve and visited the british museum an exceedingly tiresome affair  it quite crushes a person to see so much at once and i wandered from hall to hall with a weary and heavy heart wishing heaven forgive me that the elgin marbles and the frieze of the parthenon were all burnt into lime and that the granite egyptian statues were hewn and squared into buildingstones and that the mummies had all turned to dust two thousand years ago and in fine that all the material relics of so many successive ages had disappeared with the generations that produced them the present is burdened too much with the past  we have not time in our earthly existence to appreciate what is warm with life and immediately around us yet we heap up these old shells out of which human life has long emerged casting them off forever  i do not see how future ages are to stagger onward under all this dead weight with the additions that will be continually made to it  after leaving the museum i went to see bennoch and arrange with him our expedition of today and he read me a letter from topper very earnestly inviting me to come and spend a night or two with him  then i wandered about the city and was lost in the vicinity of holborn so that for a long while i was under a spell of bewilderment and kept returning in the strangest way to the same point in lincolns inn fields      mr bowman and i went to the princesss theatre in the evening  charles kean performed in louis xi very well indeeda thoughtful and highly skilled actormuch improved since i saw him many years ago in america    aldershott camp   april 1stafter my last date on thursday i visited the national gallery  at three oclock having packed a travellingbag i went to bennochs office and lunched with him and at about five we took the rail from the waterloo station for aldershott camp  at tamborough we were cordially received by lieutenant shaw of the north cork rifles and were escorted by him in a fly to his quarters  the camp is a large city composed of numberless wooden barracks arranged in regular streets on a wide bleak heath with an extensive and dreary prospect on all sides  lieutenant shaw assigned me one room in his hut and bennoch another and made us as comfortable as kind hospitality could but the huts are very small and the rooms have no size at all neither are they airtight and the sharp wind whistles in at the crevices and on the whole of all discomfortable places i am inclined to reckon aldershott camp the most so  i suppose the government has placed the camp on that windy heath and built such wretched huts for the very purpose of rendering life as little desirable as may be to the soldiers so that they should throw it away the more willingly  at seven oclock we dined at the regimental mess with the officers of the north cork  the messroom is by far the most endurable place to be found in camp  the hut is large and the messroom is capable of receiving between thirty and forty guests besides the officers of the regiment when a great dinnerparty is given  as i saw it the whole space was divided into a diningroom and two anterooms by red curtains drawn across and the second anteroom seems to be a general rendezvous for the officers where they meet at all times and talk or look over the newspapers and the armyregister which constitute the chief of their reading  the colonel and lieutenantcolonel of the regiment received bennoch and me with great cordiality as did all the other officers and we sat down to a splendid dinner  all the officers of the regiment are irishmen and all of them i believe men of fortune and they do what they can towards alleviating their hardships in camp by eating and drinking of the best that can be obtained of all good things  the table service and plate were as fine as those in any noblemans establishment the dishes numerous and admirably got up and the wines delectable and genuineas they had need to be for there is a great consumption of them  i liked these irish officers exceedinglynot that it would be possible to live long among them without finding existence a bore for they have no thought no intellectual movement no ideas that i was aware of beyond horses dogs drill garrisons fielddays whist wine cigars and all that kind of thing yet they were really gentlemen living on the best terms with one anothercourteous kind most hospitable with a rich irish humor softened down by social refinementsnot too refined either but a most happy sort of behavior as natural as that of children and with a safe freedom that made one feel entirely at my ease  i think well of the irish gentlemen for their sakes and i believe i might fairly attribute to lieutenantcolonel stowell next whom i sat a higher and finer cultivation than the above description indicates  indeed many of them may have been capable of much more intellectual intercourse than that of the messtable but i suppose it would not have been in keeping with their camp life nor suggested by it  several of the elder officers were men who had been long in the army and the colonela bluff hearty old soldier with a profile like an eagles head and beakwas a veteran of the peninsula and had a medal on his breast with clasps for three famous battles besides that of waterloo  the regimental band played during dinner and the lieutenantcolonel apologized to me for its not playing hail columbia the tune not coning within their musical accomplishments  it was no great matter however for i should not have distinguished it from any other tune but to do me what honor was possible in the way of national airs the band was ordered to play a series of negro melodies and i was entirely satisfied it is really funny that the woodnotes wild of those poor black slaves should have been played in a foreign laud as an honorable compliment to one of their white countrymen  after dinner we played whist and then had some broiled bones for supper and finally went home to our respective huts not much earlier than four oclock  but i dont wonder these gentlemen sit up as long as they can keep their eyes open for never was there anything so utterly comfortless as their campbeds  they are really worse than the bed of honor no wider no softer no warmer and affording not nearly so sound sleep indeed i got hardly any sleep at all and almost as soon as i did close my eyes the bugles sounded and the drums beat reveille and from that moment the camp was all astir so i pretty soon uprose and went to the messroom for my breakfast feeling wonderfully fresh and well considering what my night had been  long before this however this whole regiment and all the other regiments marched off to take part in a general review and bennoch and i followed as soon as we had eaten a few muttonchops  it was a bright sunshiny day but with a strong eastwind as piercing and pitiless as ever blew and this wide undulating plain of aldershott seemed just the place where the eastwind was at home  still it acted on the whole like an invigorating cordial and whereas in pleasanter circumstances i should have lain down and gone to sleep i now felt as if i could do without sleep for a month  in due time we found out the place of the north cork regiment in the general battlearray and were greeted as old comrades by the colonel and other officers  soon the soldiers who when we first reached them were strolling about or standing at ease were called into order and anon we saw a group of mounted officers riding along the lines and among them a gentleman in a civilians round hat and plain frock and trousers riding on a white horse  this group of riders turned the front of the regiment and then passed along the rear coming close to where we stood and as the plainly dressed gentleman rode by he bent towards me and i tried to raise my hat but did not succeed very well because the fierce wind had compelled me to jam it tightly upon my head  the duke of cambridge for this was he is a comelylooking gentlemanly man of bluff english face with a great deal of brown beard about it  though a pretty tall man he appears on  horseback broad and round in proportion to his height  i looked at him with a certain sort of interest and a feeling of kindness for one does feel kindly to whatever human being is anywise marked out from the rest unless it be by his disagreeable qualities  the troops from twelve to fifteen thousand now fell into marching order and went to attack a wood where we were to suppose the enemy to be stationed  the shamfight seemed to me rather clumsily managed and without any striking incident or result  the officers had prophesied the night before that general k commanding in the camp would make a muddle of it and probably he did  after the review the duke of cambridge with his attendant officers took their station and all the regiments marched in front of him saluting as they passed  as each colonel rode by and as the banner of each regiment was lowered the duke lifted his hat  the most splendid effect of this parade was the gleam of the sun upon the long line of bayonetsthe sheen of all that steel appearing like a wavering fringe of light upon the dark masses of troops below  it was very fine  but i was glad when all was done and i could go back to the messroom whither i carried an excellent appetite for luncheon  after this we walked about the camplooked at some model tents inspected the arrangements and modes of living in the huts of the privates and thus gained more and more adequate ideas of the vile uncomfortableness of a military life  finally i went to the anteroom and turned over the regimental literaturea peerage and baronetagean army and militia register a number of the sporting magazine and one of the united service while bennoch took another walk  before dinner we both tried to catch a little nap by way of compensation for last nights deficiencies but for my part the attempt was fruitless  the dinner was as splendid and as agreeable as that of the evening before and i believe it was nearly two oclock when bennoch and i bade farewell to our kind entertainers  for my part i fraternized with these military gentlemen in a way that augurs the very best things for the future peace of the two countries  they all expressed the warmest sympathies towards america and it was easy to judge from their conversation that there is no real friendliness on the part of the military towards the french  the old antipathy is just as strong as everstronger than ever perhaps on account of the comparatively more brilliant success of the french in this russian war  so with most christian sentiments of peace and brotherly love we returned to our hut and lay down each in his narrow bed  early in the morning the drums and bugles began the usual bedevilment and shortly after six i dressed and we had breakfast at the messroom shook hands with lieutenant shaw our more especial host and drove off to the railway station at ash  i know not whether i have mentioned that the villages neighboring to the camp have suffered terribly as regards morality from the vicinity of the soldiers  quiet old english towns that till within a little time ago had kept their antique simplicity and innocence have now no such thing as female virtue in them so far as the lower classes are concerned this is expressing the matter too strongly no doubt but there is too much truth in it nevertheless and one of the officers remarked that even ladies of respectability had grown much more free in manners and conversation than at first  i have heard observations similar to this from a novascotian in reference to the moral influence of soldiers when stationed in the provinces    wooton   wooton stands in a hollow near the summit of one of the long swells that here undulate over the face of the country  there is a good deal of wood behind it as should be the case with the residence of the author of the sylva but i believe few if any of these trees are known to have been planted by john evelyn or even to have been coeval with his time  the house is of brick partly ancient and consists of a front and two projecting wings with a porch and entrance in the centre  it has a desolate meagre aspect and needs something to give it life and stir and jollity  the present proprietor is of the old evelyn family and is now one of the two members of parliament for surrey but he is a very shy and retiring man unmarried sees little company and seems either not to know how to make himself comfortable or not to care about it  a servant told us that mr  had just gone out but tupper who is apparently on intimate terms with him thought it best that we should go into the house while he went in search of the master  so the servant ushered us through a hallwhere were many family pictures by lely and for aught i know by vandyke and by kneller and other famous paintersup a grand staircase and into the library the inner room of which contained the ponderous volumes which john evelyn used to read  nevertheless it was a room of most barren aspect without a carpet on the floor with pine bookcases with a common whitewashed ceiling with no luxurious studychairs and without a fire  there was an open folio on the table and a sheet of manuscript that appeared to have been recently written  i took down a book from the shelves a volume of annals connected with english history and tupper afterwards told us that this one single volume for its rarity was worth either two or three hundred pounds against one of the windows of this library there grows a magnoliatree with a very large stem and at least fifty years old  mrs tupper and i waited a good while and then bennoch and tupper came back without having found mr   tupper wished very much to show the prayerbook used by king charles at his execution and some curious old manuscript volumes but the servant said that his master always kept these treasures locked up and trusted the key to nobody  we therefore had to take our leave without seeing them and i have not often entered a house that one feels to be more forlorn than wootonalthough we did have a glimpse of a diningroom with a table laid for three or four guests and looking quite brilliant with plate and glass and snowy napery  there was a fire too in this one room  mr  is making extensive alterations in the house or has recently done so and this is perhaps one reason of its ungenial meagreness and lack of finish  before our departure from wooton tupper had asked me to leave my card for mr  but i had no mind to overstep any limit of formal courtesy in dealing with an englishman and therefore declined  tupper however on his own responsibility wrote his name bennochs and mine on a piece of paper and told the servant to show them to mr   we soon had experience of the good effect of this for we had scarcely got back before somebody drove up to tuppers door and one of the girls looking out exclaimed that there was mr  himself and another gentleman  he had set out the instant he heard of our call to bring the three precious volumes for me to see  this surely was most kind a kindness which i should never have dreamed of expecting from a shy retiring man like mr   so he and his friend were ushered into the diningroom and introduced mr  is a younglooking man dark with a mustache rather small and though he has the manners of a man who has seen the world it evidently requires an effort in him to speak to anybody and i could see his whole person slightly writhing itself as it were while he addressed me  this is strange in a man of his public position member for the county necessarily mixed up with life in many forms the possessor of sixteen thousand pounds a year and the representative of an ancient name  nevertheless i liked him and felt as if i could become intimately acquainted with him if circumstances were favorable but at a brief interview like this it was hopeless to break through two great reserves so i talked more with his companiona pleasant young man fresh from college i should imaginethan with mr  himself  the three books were really of very great interest  one was an octavo volume of manuscript in john evelyns own hand the beginning of his published diary written as distinctly as print in a small clear character  it can be read just as easily as any printed book  another was a church of england prayerbook which king charles used on the scaffold and which was stained with his sacred blood and underneath are two or three lines in john evelyns hand certifying this to be the very book  it is an octavo or small folio and seems to have been very little used scarcely opened except in one spot its leaves elsewhere retaining their original freshness and elasticity  it opens most readily at the commencement of the common service and there on the lefthand page is a discoloration of a yellowish or brownish hue about two thirds of an inch large which two hundred years ago and a little more was doubtless red  for on that page had fallen a drop of king charless blood  the other volume was large and contained a great many original letters written by the king during his troubles  i had not time to examine them with any minuteness and remember only one document which mr  pointed out and which had a strange pathos and pitifulness in it  it was a sort of duebill promising to pay a small sum for beer which had been supplied to his majesty so soon as god should enable him or the distracted circumstances of his kingdom make it possibleor some touching and helpless expression of that kind  prince hal seemed to consider it an unworthy matter that a great prince should think of that poor creature small beer at all but that a great prince should not be able to pay for it is far worse  mr  expressed his regret that i was not staying longer in this part of the country as he would gladly have seen me at wooten and he succeeded in saying something about my books and i hope i partly succeeded in showing him that i was very sensible of his kindness in letting me see those relics  i cannot say whether or no i expressed it sufficiently  it is better with such a man or indeed with any man to say too little than too much and in fact it would have been indecorous in me to take too much of his kindness to my own share bennoch being likewise in question  we had a cup of coffee and then took our leave tupper accompanying us part way down the village street and bidding us an affectionate farewell    battle abbey   bennoch and i recommenced our travels and changing from one railway to another reached tunbridge wells at nine or ten in the evening     the next day was spent at tunbridge wells which is famous for a chalybeate spring and is a wateringplace of note most healthily situated on a high breezy hill with many pleasant walks in the neighborhood     from tunbridge wells we transported ourselves to battlethe village in which is battle abbey  it is a large village with many antique houses and some new ones and in its principal street on one side with a wide green space before it you see the gray embattled outer wall and great square battlemented entrance tower with a turret at each corner of the ancient abbey  it is the perfect reality of a gothic battlement and gateway just as solid and massive as when it was first built though hoary and venerable with the many intervening centuries  there are only two days in the week on which visitors are allowed entrance and this was not one of them nevertheless bennoch was determined to get in and he wished me to send lady webster my card with his own but this i utterly refused for the honor of america and for my own honor because i will not do anything to increase the reputation we already have as a very forward people bennoch however called at a bookshop on the other side of the street near the gateway of the castle and making friends as he has a marvellous tact in doing with the bookseller the latter offered to take in his card to the housekeeper and see if lady webster would not relax her rule in our favor  meanwhile we went into the old church of battle which was built in norman times though subsequently to the abbey  as we entered the church door the bell rang for joy at the news of peace which had just been announced by the london papers  the church has been whitewashed in modern times and does not look so venerable as it ought with its arches and pillared aisles  in the chancel stands a marble tomb heavy rich and elaborate on the top of which lie the brokennosed statues of sir anthony browne and his lady who were the lord and lady of battle abbey in henry viiis time  the knight is in armor and the lady in stately garb and save for their broken noses they are in excellent preservation  the pavement of the chancel and aisles is all laid with tombstones and on two or three of these there were engraved brasses representing knights in armor and churchmen with inscriptions in latin  some of them are very old  on the walls too there are various monuments principally of dignitaries connected with the abbey  two hatchments in honor of persons recently dead were likewise suspended in the chancel  the best pew of the church is of course that of the webster family  it is curtained round carpeted furnished with chairs and footstools and more resembles a parlor than a pew especially as there is a fireplace in one of the pointed archways which i suppose has been bricked up in order to form it  on the opposite side of the aisle is the pew of some other magnate containing a stove  the rest of the parishioners have to keep themselves warm with the fervor of their own piety  i have forgotten what else was interesting except that we were shown a stone coffin recently dug up in which was hollowed a place for the head of the corpse  returning to the bookshop we found that lady webster had sent her compliments and would be very happy to have us see the abbey  how thoroughly kind these english people can be when they like and how often they like to be so  we lost no time in ringing the bell at the arched entrance under the great tower and were admitted by an old woman who lives i believe in the thickness of the wall  she told us her room used to be the prison of the abbey and under the great arch she pointed to a projecting beam where she said criminals used to be hanged  at two of the intersecting points of the arches which form the roof of the gateway were carved faces of stone said to represent king harold and william the conqueror  the exterior wall of which this tower is the gateway extends far along the village street and encloses a very large space within which stands the mansion quite secluded from unauthorized visitors or even from the sight of those without unless it be at very distant eyeshot  we rang at the principal door of the edifice it is under a deep arch in the norman style but of modern date and a footman let its in and then delivered us over to a respectable old lady in black  she was a frenchwoman by birth but had been very long in the service of the family and spoke english almost without an accent her french blood being indicated only by her thin and withered aspect and a greater gentility of manner than would have been seen in an englishwoman of similar station  she ushered us first into a grand and noble hall the arched and carved oaken roof of which ascended into the gable  it was nearly sixty feet long and its height equal to its lengthas stately a hall i should imagine as is anywhere to be found in a private mansion it was lighted at one end by a great window beneath which occupying the whole breadth of the hall hung a vast picture of the battle of hastings and whether a good picture or no it was a rich adornment of the hall  the walls were wainscoted high upward with oak they were almost covered with noble pictures of ancestry and of kings and great men and beautiful women there were trophies of armor hung aloft and two armed figures one in brass mail the other in bright steel stood on a raised dais underneath the great picture  at the end of the hall opposite the picture a third of the way up towards the roof was a gallery  all these things that i have enumerated were in perfect condition without rust untouched by decay or injury of any kind but yet they seemed to belong to a past age and were mellowed softened in their splendor a little dimmed with timetoned down into a venerable magnificence  of all domestic things that i have seen in england it satisfied me most  then the frenchwoman showed us into various rooms and offices most of which were contrived out of the old abbeycloisters and the vaulted cells and apartments in which the monks used to live  if any house be haunted i should suppose this might be  if any churchproperty bring a curse with it as people say i do not see how the owners of battle abbey can escape it taking possession of and dwelling in these holy precincts as they have done and laying their kitchen hearth with the stones of overthrown altars  the abbey was first granted i believe to sir anthony browne whom i saw asleep with his lady in the church  it was his first wife  i wish it had been his second for she was surreys geraldine  the posterity of sir anthony kept the place till 1719 and then sold it to the websters a family of baronets who are still the owners and occupants  the present proprietor is sir augustus webster whose mother is the lady that so kindly let us into the abbey  mr bennoch gave the nice old french lady half a crown and we next went round among the ruined portions of the abbey under the gardeners guidance  we saw two ivied towers insulated from all other ruins and an old refectory open to the sky and a vaulted crypt supported by pillars and we saw too the foundation and scanty remains of a chapel which had been long buried out of sight of man and only dug up within present memoryabout forty years ago  there had always been a tradition that this was the spot where harold had planted his standard and where his body was found after the battle and the discovery of the ruined chapel confirmed the tradition  i might have seen a great deal more had there been time and i have forgotten much of what i did see but it is an exceedingly interesting place  there is an avenue of old yewtrees which meet above like a cloistered arch and this is called the monks walk  i rather think they were ivy though growing unsupported  as we were retiring the gardener suddenly stopped as if he were alarmed and motioned to us to do the same saying i believe it is my lady  and so it wasa tall and stately lady in black trimming shrubs in the garden  she bowed to us very graciouslywe raised our hats and thus we met and parted without more ado  as we went through the arch of the entrance tower bennoch gave the old female warder a shilling and the gardener followed us to get half a crown    hastings   we took a fly and driver from the principal hotel of battle and drove off for hastings about seven miles distant  hastings is now a famous watering and seabathing place and seems to be well sheltered from the winds though open to the sea which here stretches off towards france we climbed a high and steep hill terraced round its base with streets of modern lodginghouses and crowned on its summit with the ruins of a castle the foundation of which was anterior to the conquest  this castle has no wall towards the sea the precipice being too high and sheer to admit of attack on that side  i have quite exhausted my descriptive faculty for the present so shall say nothing of this old castle which indeed the remains being somewhat scanty and scraggling is chiefly picturesque and interesting from its bold position on such a headlong hill  clambering down on another side from that of our ascent we entered the town of hastings which seems entirely modern and made up of lodginghouses shops hotels parades and all such makings up of wateringplaces generally  we took a delightful warm bath washing off all weariness and naughtiness and coming out new men  then we walked to st leonardsa part of hastings i believe but a mile or two from the castle and there called at the lodgings of two friends of bennoch  these were mr martin the author of bon gaultiers ballads and his wife the celebrated actress helen faucett  mr martin is a barrister a gentleman whose face and manners suited me at once a simple refined sincere not too demonstrative person  his wife too i liked a tall dark fine and ladylike woman with the simplest manners that give no trouble at all and so must be perfect  with these two persons i felt myself almost in a moment on friendly terms and in true accord and so i talked i think more than i have at any time since coming to london  we took a pleasant lunch at their house and then they walked with us to the railway station and there they took leave of bennoch affectionately and of me hardly less so for in truth we had grown to be almost friends in this very little while  and as we rattled away i said to bennoch earnestly what good people they areand bennoch smiled as if he had known perfectly well that i should think and say so  and thus we rushed onward to london and i reached st jamess place between nine and ten oclock after a very interesting tour the record of which i wish i could have kept as we went along writing each days history before another days adventures began   end of vol i       passages from the english notebooks  of  nathaniel hawthorne   vol ii     passages from hawthornes english notebooks    londonmiltonclub dinner   april 4th 1856on tuesday i went to no 14 ludgate hill to dine with bennoch at the milton club a club recently founded for dissenters nonconformists and people whose ideas religious or political are not precisely in train with the establishment in church and state  i was shown into a large readingroom well provided with periodicals and newspapers and found two or three persons there but bennoch had not yet arrived  in a few moments a tall gentleman with white hair came ina fine and intelligentlooking man whom i guessed to be one of those who were to meet me  he walked about glancing at the periodicals and soon entered mr tupper and without seeing me exchanged warm greetings with the whitehaired gentleman  i suppose began mr tupper you have come to meet  now conscious that my name was going to be spoken and not knowing but the excellent mr tupper might say something which he would not quite like me to overhear i advanced at once with outstretched hand and saluted him  he expressed great joy at the recognition and immediately introduced me to mr hall  the diningroom was pretty large and lofty and there were sixteen guests at table most of them authors or people connected with the press so that the party represented a great deal of the working intellect of london at this present day and momentthe men whose plays whose songs whose articles are just now in vogue  mr tom taylor was one of the very few whose writings i had known anything about  he is a tall slender dark young man not englishlooking and wearing colored spectacles so that i should readily have taken him for an american literary man  i did not have much opportunity of talking with him nor with anybody else except dr  who seemed a shrewd sensible man with a certain slight acerbity of thought  mr herbert ingram recently elected member of parliament was likewise present and sat on bennochs left  it was a very good dinner with an abundance of wine which bennoch sent round faster than was for the next days comfort of his guests  it is singular that i should thus far have quite forgotten w h whose books i know better than those of any other person there  he is a whiteheaded stout firmlooking and rather wrinkledfaced old gentleman whose temper i should imagine was not the very sweetest in the world  there is all abruptness a kind of subacidity if not bitterness in his address he seemed not to be in short so genial as i should have anticipated from his books  as soon as the cloth was removed bennoch without rising from his chair made a speech in honor of his eminent and distinguished guest which illustrious person happened to be sitting in the selfsame chair that i myself occupied  i have no recollection of what he said nor of what i said in reply but i remember that both of us were cheered and applauded much more than the occasion deserved  then followed about fifty other speeches for every single individual at table was called up as tupper said toasted and roasted and for my part i was done entirely brown to continue ts figure  everybody said something kind not a word or idea of which can i find in my memory  certainly if i never get any more praise in my life i have had enough of it for once  i made another little bit of a speech too in response to something that was said in reference to the present difficulties between england and america and ended as a proof that i deemed war impossible with drinking success to the british army and calling on lieutenant shaw of the aldershott camp to reply  i am afraid i must have said something very wrong for the applause was vociferous and i could hear the gentlemen whispering about the table good good yes he is a fine fellowand other such illearned praises and i took shame to myself and held my tongue publicly the rest of the evening  but in such cases something must be allowed to the excitement of the moment and to the effect of kindness and goodwill so broadly and warmly displayed and even a sincere man must not be held to speak as if he were under oath  we separated in a blessed state of contentment with one another at about eleven and lest i should starve before morning i went with mr d to take supper at his house in park lane  mr d is a pale young gentleman of american aspect being a westindian by birth  he is one of the principal writers of editorials for the times  we were accompanied in the carriage by another gentleman mr m who is connected with the management of the same paper  he wrote the letters from scutari which drew so much attention to the state of the hospitals mr d is the husband of the former miss  the actress and when we reached his house we found that she had just come home from the theatre and was taking off her stagedress  anon she came down to the drawingrooma seemingly good simple and intelligent lady not at all pretty and i should think older than her husband  she was very kind to me and told me that she had read one of my booksthe house of the seven gablesthirteen years ago which i thought remarkable because i did not write it till eight or nine years afterwards  the principal talk during supper which consisted of welshrabbit and biscuits with champagne and sodawater was about the times and the two contributors expressed vast admiration of mr  who has the chief editorial management of the paper  it is odd to find how little we outsiders know of men who really exercise a vast influence on affairs for this mr  is certainly of far more importance in the world than a minister of state  he writes nothing himself but the character of the times seems to depend upon his intuitive unerring judgment and if ever he is absent from his post even for a day or two they say that the paper immediately shows it  in reply to my questions they appeared to acknowledge that he was a man of expediency but of a very high expediency and that he gave the public the very best principles which it was capable of receiving  perhaps it may be so the timess articles are certainly not written in so high a moral vein as might be wished but what they lack in height they gain in breadth  every sensible man in england finds his own best commonsense there and in effect i think its influence is wholesome  apropos of public speaking dr  said that sir lytton bulwer asked him i think the anecdote was personal to himself whether he felt his heart beat when he was going to speak  yes  does your voice frighten you  yes  do all your ideas forsake you  yes  do you wish the floor to open and swallow you  yes  why then youll make an orator  dr   told of canning too how once before rising to speak in the house of commons he bade his friend feel his pulse which was throbbing terrifically  i know i shall make one of my best speeches said canning because im in such an awful funk  president pierce who has a great deal of oratorical power is subject to a similar horror and reluctance    reformclub dinner   april 5thon thursday at eight oclock i went to the reform club to dine with dr   the waiter admitted me into a great basement hall with a tessellated or mosaic or somehow figured floor of stone and lighted from a dome of lofty height  in a few minutes dr  appeared and showed me about the edifice which is very noble and of a substantial magnificence that was most satisfactory to beholdno woodwork imitating better materials but pillars and balustrades of marble and everything what it purports to be  the readingroom is very large and luxuriously comfortable and contains an admirable library there are rooms and conveniences for every possible purpose and whatever material for enjoyment a bachelor may need or ought to have he can surely find it here and on such reasonable terms that a small income will do as much for him as a far greater one on any other system  in a colonnade on the first floor surrounding the great basement hall there are portraits of distinguished reformers and black niches for others yet to come  joseph hume i believe is destined to fill one of these blanks but i remarked that the larger part of the portraits already hung up are of men of high rankthe duke of sussex for instance lord durham lord grey and indeed i remember no commoner in one room i saw on the wall the facsimile so common in the united states of our declaration of independence  descending again to the basement hall an elderly gentleman came in and was warmly welcomed by dr   he was a very short man but with breadth enough and a back excessively bentbowed almost to deformity very gray hair and a face and expression of remarkable briskness and intelligence  his profile came out pretty boldly and his eyes had the prominence that indicates i believe volubility of speech nor did he fail to talk from the instant of his appearance and in the tone of his voice and in his glance and in the whole man there was something racya flavor of the humorist  his step was that of an aged man and he put his stick down very decidedly at every footfall though as he afterwards told me that he was only fiftytwo he need not yet have been infirm  but perhaps he has had the gout his feet however are by no means swollen but unusually small  dr  introduced him as mr douglas jerrold and we went into the coffeeroom to dine  the coffeeroom occupies one whole side of the edifice and is provided with a great many tables calculated for three or four persons to dine at and we sat down at one of these and dr  ordered some mulligatawny soup and a bottle of white french wine  the waiters in the coffeeroom are very numerous and most of them dressed in the livery of the club comprising plush breeches and whitesilk stockings for these english reformers do not seem to include republican simplicity of manners in their system  neither perhaps is it anywise essential  after the soup we had turbot and by and by a bottle of chateau margaux very delectable and then some lambs feet delicately done and some cutlets of i know not what peculiar type and finally a ptarmigan which is of the same race of birds as the grouse but feeds high up towards the summits of the scotch mountains  then some cheese and a bottle of chambertin  it was a very pleasant dinner and my companions were both very agreeable men both taking a shrewd satirical yet not illnatured view of life and people and as for mr douglas jerrold he often reminded me of e c in the richer veins of the latter both by his face and expression and by a tincture of something at once wise and humorously absurd in what he said  but i think he has a kinder more genial wholesomer nature than e and under a very thin crust of outward acerbity i grew sensible of a very warm heart and even of much simplicity of character in this man born in london and accustomed always to london life  i wish i had any faculty whatever of remembering what people say but though i appreciate anything good at the moment it never stays in my memory nor do i think in fact that anything definite rounded pointed separable and transferable from the general lump of conversation was said by anybody  i recollect that they laughed at mr  and at his shedding a tear into a scottish river on occasion of some literary festival     they spoke approvingly of bulwer as valuing his literary position and holding himself one of the brotherhood of authors and not so approvingly of charles dickens who born a plebeian aspires to aristocratic society  but i said that it was easy to condescend and that bulwer knew he could not put off his rank and that he would have all the advantages of it in spite of his authorship we talked about the position of men of letters in england and they said that the aristocracy hated and despised and feared them and i asked why it was that literary men having really so much power in their hands were content to live unrecognized in the state  douglas jerrold talked of thackeray and his success in america and said that he himself purposed going and had been invited thither to lecture i asked him whether it was pleasant to a writer of plays to see them performed and he said it was intolerable the presentation of the authors idea being so imperfect and dr  observed that it was excruciating to hear one of his own songs sung  jerrold spoke of the duke of devonshire with great warmth as a true honest simple most kindhearted man from whom he himself had received great courtesies and kindnesses not as i understood in the way of patronage or essential favors and i heaven forgive me queried within myself whether this english reforming author would have been quite so sensible of the dukes excellence if his grace had not been a duke  but indeed a nobleman who is at the same time a true and wholehearted man feeling his brotherhood with men does really deserve some credit for it  in the course of the evening jerrold spoke with high appreciation of emerson and of longfellow whose hiawatha he considered a wonderful performance and of lowell whose fable for critics he especially admired  i mentioned thoreau and proposed to send his works to dr  who being connected with the illustrated news and otherwise a writer might be inclined to draw attention to then  douglas jerrold asked why he should not have them too  i hesitated a little but as he pressed me and would have an answer i said that i did not feel quite so sure of his kindly judgment on thoreaus books and it so chanced that i used the word acrid for lack of a better in endeavoring to express my idea of jerrolds way of looking at men and books  it was not quite what i meant but in fact he often is acrid and has written pages and volumes of acridity though no doubt with an honest purpose and from a manly disgust at the cant and humbug of the world  jerrold said no more and i went on talking with dr  but in a minute or two i became aware that something had gone wrong and looking at douglas jerrold there was an expression of pain and emotion on his face  by this time a second bottle of burgundy had been opened clos vougeot the best the club could produce and far richer than the chambertin and that warm and potent wine may have had something to do with the depth and vivacity of mr jerrolds feelings  but he was indeed greatly hurt by that little word acrid  he knew he said that the world considered him a sour bitter illnatured man but that such a man as i should have the sane opinion was almost more than he could bear  as he spoke he threw out his arms sank back in his seat and i was really a little apprehensive of his actual dissolution into tears  hereupon i spoke as was good need and though as usual i have forgotten everything i said i am quite sure it was to the purpose and went to this good fellows heart as it came warmly from my own  i do remember saying that i felt him to be as genial as the glass of burgundy which i held in my hand and i think that touched the very right spot for he smiled and said he was afraid the burgundy was better than he but yet he was comforted  dr  said that he likewise had a reputation for bitterness and i assured him if i might venture to join myself to the brotherhood of two such men that i was considered a very illnatured person by many people in my own country  douglas jerrold said he was glad of it  we were now in sweetest harmony and jerrold spoke more than it would become me to repeat in praise of my own books which he said he admired and he found the man more admirable than his books  i hope so certainly  we now went to the haymarket theatre where douglas jerrold is on the free list and after seeing a ballet by some spanish dancers we separated and betook ourselves to our several homes  i like douglas jerrold very much   april 8thon saturday evening at ten oclock i went to a supperparty at mr ds and there met five or six peoplemr faed a young and distinguished artist dr eliotson a dark sombre taciturn powerfullooking man with coalblack hair and a beard as black fringing round his face mr charles reade author of christie johnstone and other novels and many playsa tall man more than thirty fairhaired and of agreeable talk and demeanor  on april 6th i went to the waterloo station and there meeting bennoch and dr  took the rail for woking where we found mr halls carriage waiting to convey us to addlestone about five miles off  on arriving we found that mr and mrs hall had not yet returned from church  their place is an exceedingly pretty one and arranged in very good taste  the house is not large but is filled in every room with fine engravings statuettes ingenious prettinesses or beautifulnesses in the way of flowerstands cabinets and things that seem to have bloomed naturally out of the characters of its occupants  there is a conservatory connected with the drawingroom and enriched with lovely plants one of which has a certain interest as being the plant on which coleridges eyes were fixed when he died  this conservatory is likewise beautified with several very fine casts of statues by modern sculptors among which was the greek slave of powers which my english friends criticised as being too thin and meagre but i defended it as in accordance with american ideas of feminine beauty  from the conservatory we passed into the garden but did not minutely examine it knowing that mr hall would wish to lead us through it in person  so in the mean time we took a walk in the neighborhood over stiles and along bypaths for two or three miles till we reached the old village of chertsey  in one of its streets stands an ancient house gabled and with the second story projecting over the first and bearing an inscription to the purport that the poet cowley had once resided and i think died there thence we passed on till we reached a bridge over the thames which at this point about twentyfive miles from london is a narrow river but looks clean and pure and unconscious what abominations the city sewers will pour into it anon  we were caught in two or three showers in the course of our walk but got back to firfield without being very much wetted  our host and hostess had by this time returned from church and mrs hall came frankly and heartily to the door to greet us scolding us kindly for having got wet     i liked her simple easy gentle quiet manners and i liked her husband too  he has a wide and quick sympathy and expresses it freely     the world is the better for him  the shower being now over we went out upon the beautiful lawn before his house where there were a good many trees of various kinds many of which have been set out by persons of great or small distinction and are labelled with their names  thomas moores name was appended to one maria edgeworths to another likewise fredrika bremers jenny linds also grace greenwoods and i know not whose besides  this is really a pleasant method of enriching ones grounds with memorials of friends nor is there any harm in making a shrubbery of celebrities  three holes were already dug and three new trees lay ready to be planted and for me there was a sumach to planta tree i never liked but mr hall said that they had tried to dig up a hawthorn but found it clung too fast to the soil  so since better might not be and telling mr hall that i supposed i should have a right to hang myself on this tree whenever i chose i seized a spade and speedily shovelled in a great deal of dirt and there stands my sumach an object of interest to posterity  bennoch also and dr  set out their trees and indeed it was in some sense a joint affair for the rest of the party held up each tree while its godfather shovelled in the earth but after all the gardener had more to do with it than we  after this important business was over mr hall led us about his rounds which are very nicely planned and ordered and all this he has bought and built and laid out from the profits of his own and his wifes literary exertions  we dined early and had a very pleasant dinner and after the cloth was removed mr hall was graciously pleased to drink my health following it with a long tribute to my genius  i answered briefly and one half of my short speech was in all probability very foolish      after the ladies there were three one being a girl of seventeen with rich auburn hair the adopted daughter of the halls had retired dr  having been toasted himself proposed mrs halls health  i did not have a great deal of conversation with mrs hall but enough to make me think her a genuine and good woman unspoilt by a literary career and retaining more sentiment than even most girls keep beyond seventeen  she told me that it had been the dream of her life to see longfellow and myself     her dream is half accomplished now and as they say longfellow is coming over this summer the remainder may soon be rounded out  on taking leave our kind hosts presented me with some beautiful flowers and with three volumes of a work by themselves on ireland and dr  was favored also with some flowers and a plant in a pot and bennoch too had his hands full     and we went on our way rejoicing  here follows an account of the lord mayors dinner taken mostly for our old home but i think i will copy this more exact description of the lady mentioned in civic banquetsed      my eyes were mostly drawn to a young lady who sat nearly opposite me across the table  she was i suppose dark and yet not dark but rather seemed to be of pure white marble yet not white but the purest and finest complexion without a shade of color in it yet anything but sallow or sickly  her hair was a wonderful deep ravenblack black as night black as death not ravenblack for that has a shiny gloss and hers had not but it was hair never to be painted nor describedwonderful hair jewish hair  her nose had a beautiful outline though i could see that it was jewish too and that and all her features were so fine that sculpture seemed a despicable art beside her and certainly my pen is good for nothing  if any likeness could be given however it must be by sculpture not painting  she was slender and youthful and yet had a stately and cold though soft and womanly grace and looking at her i saw what were the wives of the old patriarchs in their maiden or earlymarried dayswhat judith was for womanly as she looked i doubt not she could have slain a man in a just causewhat bathsheba was only she seemed to have no sin in her perhaps what eve was though one could hardly think her weak enough to eat the apple     whether owing to distinctness of race my sense that she was a jewess or whatever else i felt a sort of repugnance simultaneously with my perception that she was an admirable creature    the house of commons   at ten oclock the next day after the lord mayors dinner i went to lunch with bennoch and afterwards accompanied him to one of the government offices in downing street  he went thither not on official business but on a matter connected with a monument to miss mitford in which mr harness a clergyman and some sort of a government clerk is interested  i gathered from this conversation that there is no great enthusiasm about the monumental affair among the british public  it surprised me to hear allusions indicating that miss mitford was not the invariably amiable person that her writings would suggest but the whole drift of what they said tended nevertheless towards the idea that she was an excellent and generous person loved most by those who knew her best  from downing street we crossed over and entered westminster hall and passed through it and up the flight of steps at its farthest end and along the avenue of statues into the vestibule of the house of commons it was now somewhat past five and we stood at the inner entrance of the house to see the members pass in bennoch pointing out to me the distinguished ones  i was not much impressed with the appearance of the members generally they seemed to me rather shabbier than english gentlemen usually and i saw or fancied in many of them a certain selfimportance as they passed into the interior betokening them to be very full of their dignity  some of them looked more americanmore like american politiciansthan most englishmen do  there was now and then a grayheaded country gentleman the very type of stupidity and two or three city members came up and spoke to bennoch and showed themselves quite as dull in their aldermanic way as the country squires     bennoch pointed out lord john russell a small very short elderly gentleman in a brown coat and so large a hatnot large of brim but large like a peckmeasurethat i saw really no face beneath it  by and by came a rather tall slender person in a black frockcoat buttoned up and black pantaloons taking long steps but i thought rather feebly or listlessly  his shoulders were round or else he had a habitual stoop in them  he had a prominent nose a thin face and a sallow very sallow complexion     and had i seen him in america i should have taken him for a hardworked editor of a newspaper weary and worn with nightlabor and want of exerciseaged before his time  it was disraeli and i never saw any other englishman look in the least like him though in america his appearance would not attract notice as being unusual  i do not remember any other noteworthy person whom we saw enter in fact the house had already been some time in session and most of the members were in their places  we were to dine at the refectory of the house with the new member for boston and meanwhile bennoch obtained admittance for us into the speakers gallery where we had a view of the members and could hear what was going on  a mr muntz was speaking on the income tax and he was followed by sir george cornewall lewis and others but it was all very uninteresting without the slightest animation or attempt at oratorywhich indeed would have been quite out of place  we saw lord palmerston but at too great a distance to distinguish anything but a gray head  the house had daylight in it when we entered and for some time afterwards but by and by the roof which i had taken to be a solid and opaque ceiling suddenly brightened and showed itself to be transparent a vast expanse of tinted and figured glass through which came down a great mild radiance on the members below  the character of the debate however did not grow more luminous or vivacious so we went down into the vestibule and there waited for mr  who soon came and led us into the refectory  it was very much like the coffeeroom of a club  the strict rule forbids the entrance of any but members of parliament but it seems to be winked at although there is another room opening beyond this where the law of seclusion is strictly enforced  the dinner was good not remarkably so but good enougha soup some turbot or salmon cutlets and i know not what else and claret sherry and port for as mr  said he did not wish to be stingy mr  is a selfmade man and a strong instance of the difference between the englishman and the american when selfmade and without early education  he is no more a gentleman now than when he began life not a whit more refined either outwardly or inwardly while the american would have been after the same experience not distinguishable outwardly and perhaps as refined within as nine tenths of the gentlemen born in the house of commons  and besides an american comes naturally to any distinctions to which success in life may bring him he takes them as if they were his proper inheritance and in no wise to be wondered at mr  on the other hand took evidently a childish delight in his position and felt a childish wonder in having arrived at it nor did it seem real to him after all      we again saw disraeli who has risen from the people by modes perhaps somewhat like those of mr   he came and stood near our table looking at the bill of fare and then sat down on the opposite side of the room with another gentleman and ate his dinner  the story of his marriage does him much credit and indeed i am inclined to like disraeli as a man who has made his own place good among a hostile aristocracy and leads instead of following them  from the house of commons we went to albert smiths exhibition or lecture of the ascent of mont blanc to which bennoch had orders  it was very amusing and in some degree instructive  we remained in the saloon at the conclusion of the lecture and when the audience had dispersed mr albert smith made his appearance      nothing of moment happened the next day at least not till two oclock when i went with mr bowman to birchs eatinghouse it is not birchs now but this was the name of the original founder who became an alderman and has long been dead for a basin of turtlesoup  it was very rich very good better than we had at the lord mayors and the best i ever ate  in the evening mr j b davis formerly our secretary of legation called to take us to dine at mr s in camden town  mr  calls his residence vermont house but it hardly has a claim to any separate title being one of the centre houses of a block  i forget whether i mentioned his calling on me  he is a vermonter a graduate of yale college who has been here several years and has established a sort of book brokerage buying libraries for those who want them and rare works and editions for american collectors  his business naturally brings him into relations with literary people and he is himself a kindly and pleasant man  on our arrival we found mr d and one of his sisters already there and soon came a mr peabody who if i mistake not is one of the salem peabodys and has some connection with the present eminent london mr peabody  at any rate he is a very sensible wellinstructed and widely and long travelled man  mr tom taylor was also expected but owing to some accident or mistake he did not come for above an hour all which time our host waited     but mr tom taylor a wit a satirist and a famous diner out is too formidable and too valuable a personage to be treated cavalierly  in the interim mr  showed us some rare old books which he has in his private collection a blackletter edition of chaucer and other specimens of the early english printers and i was impressed as i have often been with the idea that we have made few if any improvements in the art of printing though we have greatly facilitated the modes of it he showed us drydens translation of virgil with dr johnsons autograph in it and a large collection of bibles of all dateschurch bibles family bibles of the common translation and older ones  he says he has written or is writing a history of the bible as a printed work i presume  many of these bibles had no doubt been in actual and daily use from generation to generation but they were now all splendidly bound and were likewise very clean and smoothin fact every leaf had been cleansed by a delicate process a part of which consisted in soaking the whole book in a tub of water during several days  mr  is likewise rich in manuscripts having a spanish document with the signature of the son of columbus a whole little volume in franklins handwriting being the first specimen of it and the original manuscripts of many of the songs of burns  among these i saw auld lang syne and bruces address to his army  we amused ourselves with these matters as long as we could but at last as there was to be a party in the evening dinner could no longer be put off so we took our seats at table and immediately afterwards mr taylor made his appearance with his wife and another lady  mr taylor is reckoned a brilliant conversationist but i suppose he requires somebody to draw him out and assist him for i could hear nothing that i thought very remarkable on this occasion  he is not a kind of man whom i can talk with or greatly help to talk so though i sat next to him nothing came of it  he told me some stories of his life in the templelittle funny incidents that he afterwards wrought into his dramas in short a sensible activeminded clearly perceptive man with a humorous way of showing up men and matters     i wish i could know exactly what the english style good conversation  probably it is something like plumpuddingas heavy but seldom so rich  after dinner mr tom taylor and mr d with their respective ladies took their leave but when we returned to the drawingroom we found it thronged with a good many people  mr s c hall was there with his wife whom i was glad to see again for this was the third time of meeting her and in this whirl of new acquaintances i felt quite as if she were an old friend  mr william howitt was also there and introduced me to his wifea very natural kind and pleasant lady and she presented me to one or two daughters  mr marston the dramatist was also introduced to me and mr helps a thin scholarly cold sort of a man  dr mackay and his wife were there too and a certain mr jones a sculptora jolly large elderly person with a twinkle in his eye also a mr godwin who impressed me as quite a superior person gentlemanly cultivated a man of sensibility but it is quite impossible to take a clear imprint from any one character where so many are stamped upon ones notice at once  this mr godwin as we were discussing thackeray said that he is most beautifully tender and devoted to his wife whenever she can be sensible of his attentions  he says that thackeray in his real self is a sweet sad man  i grew weary of so many people especially of the ladies who were rather superfluous in their oblations quite stifling me indeed with the incense that they burnt under my nose  so far as i could judge they had all been invited there to see me  it is ungracious even hoggish not to be gratified with the interest they expressed in me but then it is really a bore and one does not know what to do or say  i felt like the hippopotamus or to use a more modest illustrationlike some strange insect imprisoned under a tumbler with a dozen eyes watching whatever i did  by and by mr jones the sculptor relieved me by standing up against the mantelpiece and telling an irish story not to two or three auditors but to the whole drawingroom all attentive as to a set exhibition  it was very funny  the next day after this i went with mr bowman to call on our minister and found that he and four of the ladies of his family with his son had gone to the queens drawingroom  we lunched at the wellington and spent an hour or more in looking out of the window of that establishment at the carriages with their pompous coachmen and footmen driving to and from the palace of st james and at the horse guards with their bright cuirasses stationed along the street     then i took the rail for liverpool     while i was still at breakfast at the waterloo j came in ruddycheeked smiling very glad to see me and looking i thought a good deal taller than when i left him  and so ended my london excursion which has certainly been rich in incident and character though my account of it be but meagre    scotlandglasgow   may 10thlast friday may 2d i took the rail with mr bowman from the lime street station for glasgow  there was nothing of much interest along the road except that when we got beyond penrith we saw snow on the tops of some of the hills  twilight came on as we were entering scotland and i have only a recollection of bleak and bare hills and villages dimly seen until nearing glasgow we saw the red blaze of furnacelights at frequent ironfounderies  we put up at the queens hotel where we arrived about ten oclock a better hotel than i have anywhere found in englandnew well arranged and with brisk attendance  in the morning i rambled largely about glasgow and found it to be chiefly a modernbuilt city with streets mostly wide and regular and handsome houses and public edifices of a dark gray stone  in front of our hotel in an enclosed green space stands a tall column surmounted by a statue of sir walter scotta good statue i should think as conveying the air and personal aspect of the man  there is a bronze equestrian statue of the queen in one of the streets and one or two more equestrian or other statues of eminent persons  i passed through the trongate and the gallowgate and visited the saltmarket and saw the steeple of the tolbooth all of which scott has made interesting and i went through the gate of the university and penetrated into its enclosed courts round which the college edifices are built  they are not gothic but of the age i suppose of james iwith oddlooking conicalroofed towers and here and there the bust of a benefactor in niches round the courts and heavy stone staircases ascending from the pavement outside the buildings all of dark gray granite cold hard and venerable  the university stands in high street in a dense part of the town and a very old and shabby part too  i think the poorer classes of glasgow excel even those in liverpool in the bad eminence of filth uncombed and unwashed children drunkenness disorderly deportment evil smell and all that makes city poverty disgusting  in my opinion however they are a betterlooking people than the english and this is true of all classes more intelligent of aspect with more regular features  i looked for the high cheekbones which have been attributed as a characteristic feature to the scotch but could not find them  what most distinguishes them front the english is the regularity of the nose which is straight or sometimes a little curved inward whereas the english nose has no law whatever but disports itself in all manner of irregularity  i very soon learned to recognize the scotch face and when not too scotch it is a handsome one  in another part of the high street up a pretty steep slope and on one side of a public green near an edifice which i think is a medical college stands st mungos cathedral  it is hardly of cathedral dimensions though a large and fine old church  the price of a ticket of admittance is twopence so small that it might be as well to make the entrance free  the interior is in excellent repair with the nave and side aisles and clustered pillars and intersecting arches that belong to all these old churches and a few monuments along the walls  i was going away without seeing any more than this but the verger a friendly old gentleman with a hearty scotch way of speaking told me that the crypts were what chiefly interested strangers and so he guided me down into the foundationstory of the church where there is an intricacy and entanglement of immensely massive and heavy arches supporting the structure above  the view through these arches among the great shafts of the columns was very striking  in the central part is a monument a recumbent figure if i remember rightly but it is not known whom it commemorates  there is also a monument to a scotch prelate which seems to have been purposely defaced probably in covenant times  these intricate arches were the locality of one of the scenes in rob roy when rob gives frank osbaldistone some message or warning and then escapes from him into the obscurity behind  in one corner is st mungos well secured with a wooden cover but i should not care to drink water that comes from among so many old graves  after viewing the cathedral i got back to the hotel just in time to go from thence to the steamer wharf and take passage up the clyde  there was nothing very interesting in this little voyage  we passed many small iron steamers and some large ones and green fields along the rivershores villas villages and all such suburban objects neither am i quite sure of the name of the place we landed at though i think it was bowling  here we took the railway for balloch and the only place or thing i remember during this transit was a huge bluff or crag rising abruptly from a riverside and looking in connection with its vicinity to the highlands just such a site as would be taken for the foundation of a castle  on inquiry it turned out that this abrupt and doubleheaded hill for it has two summits with a cleft between is the site of dumbarton castle for ages one of the strongest fortresses in scotland and still kept up as a garrisoned place  at the distance and point of view at which we passed it the castle made no show  arriving at balloch we found it a small village with no marked features and a hotel where we got some lunch and then we took a stroll over the bridge across the levers while waiting for the steamer to take us up loch lomond  it was a beautiful afternoon warm and sunny and after walking about a mile we had a fine view of loch lomond and of the mountains around and beyond itben lomond among the rest  it is vain at a weeks distance to try to remember the shapes of mountains so i shall attempt no description of them and content myself with saying that they did not quite come up to my anticipations  in due time we returned to our hotel and found in the coffeeroom a tall whitehaired venerable gentleman and a pleasantlooking young lady his daughter they had been eating lunch and the young lady helped her father on with his outside garment and his comforter and gave him his stick just as any other daughter might doall of which i mention because he was a nobleman and moreover had engaged all the posthorses at the inn so that we could not continue our travels by land along the side of loch lomond as we had first intended  at four oclock the railway train arrived again with a very moderate number of passengers who and we among them immediately embarked on board a neat little steamer which was waiting for us  the day was bright and cloudless but there was a strong cold breeze blowing down the lake so that it was impossible without vast discomfort to stand in the bow of the steamer and look at the scenery i looked at it indeed along the sides as we passed and on our track behind and no doubt it was very fine but from all the experience i have had i do not think scenery can be well seen from the water  at any rate the shores of loch lomond have faded completely out of my memory nor can i conceive that they really were very striking  at a years interval i can recollect the cluster of hills around the head of lake windermere at twenty years interval i remember the shores of lake champlain but of the shores of this scottish lake i remember nothing except some oddly shaped rocks called the cobbler and his daughter on a mountaintop just before we landed  but indeed we had very imperfect glimpses of the hills along the latter part of the course because the wind had grown so very cold that we took shelter below and merely peeped at loch lomonds sublimities from the cabinwindows  the whole voyage up loch lomond is i think about thirtytwo miles but we landed at a place called tarbet much short of the ultimate point there is here a large hotel but we passed it and walked onward a mile or two to arroquhar a secluded glen among the hills where is a new hotel built in the old manorhouse style and occupying the site of what was once a castle of the chief of the macfarlanes  over the portal is a stone taken from the former house bearing the date 1697  there is a little lake near the house and the hills shut in the whole visible scene so closely that there appears no outlet nor communication with the external world but in reality this little lake is connected with loch long and loch long is an arm of the sea so that there is water communication between arroquhar and glasgow  we found this a very beautiful place and being quite sheltered from all winds that blew we strolled about late into the prolonged twilight and admired the outlines of the surrounding hills and fancied resemblances to various objects in the shapes of the crags against the evening sky  the sun had not set till nearly if not quite eight oclock and before the daylight had quite gone the northern lights streamed out and i do not think that there was much darkness over the glen of arroquhar that night  at all events before the darkness came we withdrew into the coffeeroom  we had excellent beds and sleepingrooms in this new hotel and i remember nothing more till morning when we were astir betimes and had some chops for breakfast  then our host mr macregor who is also the host of our hotel at glasgow and has many of the characteristics of an american landlord claiming to be a gentleman and the equal of his guests took us in a drosky and drove us to the shore of loch lomond at a point about four miles from arroquhar  the lake is here a mile and a half wide and it was our object to cross to inversnaid on the opposite shore so first we waved a handkerchief and then kindled some straw on the beach in order to attract the notice of the ferryman at inversnaid it was half an hour before our signals and shoutings resulted in the putting off of a boat with two oarsmen who made the transit pretty speedily and thus we got across loch lomond  at inversnaid there is a small hotel and over the rock on which it stands a little waterfall tumbles into the lakea very little one though i believe it is reckoned among the other picturesque features of the scene  we were now in rob roys country and at the distance of a mile or so along the shore of the lake is rob roys cave where he and his followers are supposed to have made their abode in troublous times while lunch was getting ready we again took the boat and went thither landing beneath a precipitous though not very lofty crag we clambered up a rude pathway and came to the mouth of the cave which is nothing but a fissure or fissures among some great rocks that have tumbled confusedly together  there is hardly anywhere space enough for half a dozen persons to crowd themselves together nor room to stand upright on the whole it is no cave at all but only a crevice and in the deepest and darkest part you can look up and see the sky  it may have sheltered rob roy for a night and might partially shelter any christian during a shower  returning to the hotel we started in a drosky i do not know whether this is the right name of the vehicle or whether it has a right name but it is a carriage in which four persons sit back to back two before and two behind for aberfoyle  the mountainside ascends very steeply from the inn door and not to damp the horses courage in the outset we went up on foot  the guidebook says that the prospect from the summit of the ascent is very fine but i really believe we forgot to turn round and look at it  all through our drive however we had mountain views in plenty especially of great ben lomond with his snowcovered head round which since our entrance into the highlands we had been making a circuit  nothing can possibly be drearier than the mountains at this season bare barren and bleak with black patches of withered heath variegating the dead brown of the herbage on their sides and as regards trees the hills are perfectly naked  there were no frightful precipices no boldly picturesque features along our road but high weary slopes showing miles and miles of heavy solitude with here and there a highland hut built of stone and thatched and in one place an old gray ruinous fortress a station of the english troops after the rebellion of 1715 and once or twice a village of hills the inhabitants of which old and young ran to their doors to stare at us  for several miles after we left inversnaid the mountainstream which makes the waterfall brawled along the roadside  all the hills are sheeppastures and i never saw such wild rough raggedlooking creatures as the sheep with their black faces and tattered wool  the little lambs were very numerous poor things coming so early in the season into this inclement region and it was laughable to see how invariably when startled by our approach they scampered to their mothers and immediately began to suck  it would seem as if they sought a draught from the maternal udder wherewith to fortify and encourage their poor little hearts but i suppose their instinct merely drove them close to their dams and being there they took advantage of their opportunity  these sheep must lead a hard life during the winter for they are never fed nor sheltered  the day was sunless and very uncomfortably cold and we were not sorry to walk whenever the steepness of the road gave us cause  i do not remember what oclock it was but not far into the afternoon when we reached the baillie nicoljarvie inn at aberfoyle a scene which is much more interesting in the pages of rob roy than we found it in reality here we got into a sort of cart and set out over another hillpath as dreary as or drearier than the last for the trosachs  on our way we saw ben venue and a good many other famous bens and two or three lochs and when we reached the trosachs we should probably have been very much enraptured if our eyes had not already been weary with other mountain shapes  but in truth i doubt if anybody ever does really see a mountain who goes for the set and sole purpose of seeing it  nature will not let herself be seen in such cases  you must patiently bide her time and by and by at some unforeseen moment she will quietly and suddenly unveil herself and for a brief space allow you to look right into the heart of her mystery  but if you call out to her peremptorily nature unveil yourself this very moment she only draws her veil the closer and you may look with all your eyes and imagine that you see all that she can show and yet see nothing  thus i saw a wild and confused assemblage of heights crags precipices which they call the trosachs but i saw them calmly and coldly and was glad when the drosky was ready to take us on to callender  the hotel at the trosachs by the by is a very splendid one in the form of an old feudal castle with towers and turrets  all among these wild hills there is set preparation for enraptured visitants and it seems strange that the savage features do not subside of their own accord and that there should still be cold winds and snow on the top of ben lomond and rocks and heather and ragged sheep now that there are so many avenues by which the commonplace world is sluiced in among the highlands  i think that this fashion of the picturesque will pass away  we drove along the shore of lake vennachar and onward to callender which i believe is either the first point in the lowlands or the last in the highlands  it is a large village on the river teith  we stopped here to dine and were some time in getting any warmth into our benumbed bodies for as i said before it was a very cold day  looking from the window of the hotel i saw a young man in highland dress with bare thighs marching through the village street towards the lowlands with a martial and elastic step as if he were going forth to conquer and occupy the world  i suppose he was a soldier who had been absent on leave returning to the garrison at stirling  i pitied his poor thighs though he certainly did not look uncomfortable  after dinner as dusk was coming on and we had still a long drive before us eighteen miles i believe we took a close carriage and two horses and set off for stirling  the twilight was too obscure to show many things along the road and by the time we drove into stirling we could but dimly see the houses in the long street in which stood our hotel there was a good fire in the coffeeroom which looked like a drawingroom in a large oldfashioned mansion and was hung round with engravings of the portraits of the county members and a master of foxhounds and other pictures  we made ourselves comfortable with some tea and retired early  in the morning we were stirring betimes and found stirling to be a pretty large town of rather ancient aspect with many gray stone houses the gables of which are notched on either side like a flight of stairs the town stands on the slope of a hill at the summit of which crowning a long ascent up which the paved street reaches all the way to its gate is stirling castle  of course we went thither and found free entrance although the castle is garrisoned by five or six hundred men among whom are barelegged highlanders i must say that this costume is very fine and becoming though their thighs did look blue and frostbitten and also some soldiers of other scotch regiments with tartan trousers  almost immediately on passing the gate we found an old artilleryman who undertook to show us round the castle  only a small portion of it seems to be of great antiquity  the principal edifice within the castle wall is a palace that was either built or renewed by james vi and it is ornamented with strange old statues one of which is his own  the old scottish parliament house is also here  the most ancient part of the castle is the tower where one of the earls of douglas was stabbed by a king and afterwards thrown out of the window  in reading this story one imagines a lofty turret and the dead man tumbling headlong from a great height but in reality the window is not more than fifteen or twenty feet from the garden into which he fell  this part of the castle was burned last autumn but is now under repair and the wall of the tower is still stanch and strong  we went up into the chamber where the murder took place and looked through the historic window  then we mounted the castle wall where it broods over a precipice of many hundred feet perpendicular looking down upon a level plain below and forth upon a landscape every foot of which is richly studded with historic events  there is a small peephole in the wall which queen mary is said to have been in the habit of looking through  it is a most splendid view in the distance the blue highlands with a variety of mountain outlines that i could have studied unweariably and in another direction beginning almost at the foot of the castle hill were the links of forth where over a plain of miles in extent the river meandered and circled about and returned upon itself again and again and again as if knotted into a silver chain which it was difficult to imagine to be all one stream  the history of scotland might be read from this castle wall as on a book of mighty page for here within the compass of a few miles we see the field where wallace won the battle of stirling and likewise the battlefield of bannockburn and that of falkirk and sheriffmuir and i know not how many besides  around the castle hill there is a walk with seats for old and infirm persons at points sheltered from the wind  we followed it downward and i think we passed over the site where the games used to be held and where this morning some of the soldiers of the garrison were going through their exercises  i ought to have mentioned that passing through the inner gateway of the castle we saw the round tower and glanced into the dungeon where the roderic dhu of scotts poem was left to die  it is one of the two round towers between which the portcullis rose and fell    edinburghthe palace of holyrood   at eleven oclock we took the rail for edinburgh and i remember nothing more except that the cultivation and verdure of the country were very agreeable after our experience of highland barrenness and desolation until we found the train passing close at the base of the rugged crag of edinburgh castle  we established ourselves at queens hotel in princes street and then went out to view the city  the monument to sir walter scotta rather fantastic and not very impressive affair i thought stands almost directly in front of a hotel  we went along princes street and thence by what turns i know not to the palace of holyrood which stands on a low and sheltered site and is a venerable edifice arthurs seat rises behind ita high hill with a plain between  as we drew near the palace mr bowman who has been here before pointed out the windows of queen marys apartments in a circular tower on the left of the gateway  on entering the enclosed quadrangle we bought tickets for sixpence each admitting us to all parts of the palace that are shown to visitors and first we went into a noble hall or gallery a long and stately room hung with pictures of ancient scottish kings and though the pictures were none of them authentic they at least answer an excellent purpose in the way of upholstery  it was here that the young pretender gave the ball which makes one of the scenes in waverley  thence we passed into the old historic rooms of the palacedarnleys and queen marys apartments which everybody has seen and described they are very dreary and shabbylooking rooms with bare floors and here and there a piece of tapestry faded into a neutral tint and carved and ornamented ceilings looking shabbier than plain whitewash  we saw queen marys old bedstead low with four tall postsand her lookingglass which she brought with her from france and which has often reflected the beauty that set everybody madand some needlework and other womanly matters of hers and we went into the little closet where she was having such a cosey supperparty with two or three friends when the conspirators broke in and stabbed rizzio before her face  we saw too the bloodstain at the threshold of the door in the next room opening upon the stairs  the body of rizzio was flung down here and the attendant told us that it lay in that spot all night  the bloodstain covers a large spacemuch larger than i supposedand it gives the impression that there must have been a great pool and sop of blood on all the spot covered by rizzios body staining the floor deeply enough never to be washed out  it is now of a dark brown hue and i do not see why it may not be the genuine veritable stain  the floor thereabouts appears not to have been scrubbed much for i touched it with my finger and found it slightly rough but it is strange that the many footsteps should not have smoothed it in three hundred years  one of the articles shown us in queen marys apartments was the breastplate supposed to have been worn by lord ruthven at the murder a heavy plate of iron and doubtless a very uncomfortable waistcoat    holyrood abbey   from the palace we passed into the contiguous ruin of holyrood abbey which is roofless although the front and some broken columns along the nave and fragments of architecture here and there afford hints of a magnificent gothic church in bygone times  it deserved to be magnificent for here have been stately ceremonials marriages of kings coronations investitures before the high altar which has now been overthrown or crumbled away and the floorso far as there is any floor consists of tombstones of the old scottish nobility  there are likewise monuments bearing the names of illustrious scotch families and inscriptions in the scotch dialect on the walls  in one of the front towersthe only remaining one indeedwe saw the marble tomb of a nobleman lord belhaven who is represented reclining on the topwith a bruised nose of course  except in westminster abbey i do not remember ever to have seen an old monumental statue with the nose entire  in all political or religious outbreaks the mobs first impulse is to hit the illustrious dead on their noses  at the other end of the abbey near the high altar is the vault where the old scottish kings used to be buried but looking in through the window i saw only a vacant spaceno skull nor bone nor the least fragment of a coffin  in fact i believe the royal dead were turned out of their last home on occasion of the revolutionary movements at the accession of william iii    high street and the grassmarket   quitting the abbey and the palace we turned into the canongate and passed thence into high street which i think is a continuation of the canongate and being now in the old town of edinburgh we saw those immensely tall houses seven stories high where the people live in tiers all the way from earth to middle air  they were not so quaint and strange looking as i expected but there were some houses of very antique individuality and among them that of john knox which looks still in good repair  one thing did not in the least fall short of my expectationsthe evil odor for which edinburgh has an immemorial renownnor the dirt of the inhabitants old and young  the town to say the truth when you are in the midst of it has a very sordid grimy shabby upswept unwashen aspect grievously at variance with all poetic and romantic associations  from the high street we turned aside into the grassmarket the scene of the porteous mob and we found in the pavement a cross on the site where the execution of porteous is supposed to have taken place    the castle   returning thence to the high street we followed it up to the castle which is nearer the town and of more easy access from it than i had supposed  there is a large court or parade before the castle gate with a parapet on the abrupt side of the hill looking towards arthurs seat and salisbury crags mud overhanging a portion of the old town  as we leaned over this parapet my nose was conscious of the bad odor of edinburgh although the streets whence it must have come were hundreds of feet below  i have had some experience of this ugly smell in the poor streets of liverpool but i think i never perceived it before crossing the atlantic  it is the odor of an old system of life the scent of the pine forests is still too recent with us for it to be known in america  the castle of edinburgh is free as appears to be the case with all garrisoned places in great britain to the entrance of any peaceable person  so we went in and found a large space enclosed within the walls and dwellings for officers and accommodation for soldiers who were being drilled or loitering about and as the hill still ascends within the external wall of the castle we climbed to the summit and there found an old soldier whom we engaged to be our guide  he showed us mons meg a great old cannon broken at the breech but still aimed threateningly from the highest ramparts and then he admitted us into an old chapel said to have been built by a queen of scotland the sister of harold king of england and occupying the very highest part of the hill it is the smallest place of worship i ever saw but of venerable architecture and of very solid construction  the old soldier had not much more to show us but he pointed out the window whence one of the kings of scotland is said when a baby to have been lowered down the whole height of the castle to the bottom of the precipice on which it standsa distance of seven hundred feet  after the soldier had shown us to the extent of his jurisdiction we went into a suite of rooms in one of which i saw a portrait of queen mary which gave me for the first time an idea that she was really a very beautiful woman  in this picture she is wonderfully soa tender womanly grace which was none the less tender and graceful for being equally imbued with queenly dignity and spirit  it was too lovely a head to be cut off  i should be glad to know the authenticity of this picture  i do not know that we did anything else worthy of note before leaving edinburgh  there is matter enough in and about the town to interest the visitor for a very long time but when the visit is calculated on such brevity as ours was we get weary of the place before even these few hours come to an end  thus for my part i was not sorry when in the course of the afternoon we took the rail for melrose where we duly arrived and put up at the george inn    melrose   melrose is a village of rather antique aspect situated on the slope and at the bottom of the eildon hills which from this point of view appear like one hill with a double summit  the village as i said has an old look though many of the houses have at least been refronted at some recent date but others are as ancient i suppose as the days when the abbey was in its splendora rustic and peasantlike antiquity however lowroofed and strawthatched  there is an aged cross of stone in the centre of the town  our first object of course was to see the abbey which stands just on the outskirts of the village and is attainable only by applying at a neighboring house the inhabitant of which probably supports himself and most comfortably too as a showman of the ruin  he unlocked the wooden gate and admitted us into what is left of the abbey comprising only the ruins of the church although the refectory the dormitories and the other parts of the establishment formerly covered the space now occupied by a dozen village houses  melrose abbey is a very satisfactory ruin all carpeted along its nave and transepts with green grass and there are some wellgrown trees within the walls  we saw the window now empty through which the tints of the painted glass fell on the tombstone of michael scott and the tombstone itself broken in three pieces but with a cross engraven along its whole length  it must have been the monument of an old monk or abbot rather than a wizard  there too is still the marble stone on which the monk and warrior sat them down and which is supposed to mark the restingplace of alexander of scotland  there are remains both without and within the abbey of most curious and wonderfully minute old sculpturefoliage in places where it is almost impossible to see them and where the sculptor could not have supposed that they would be seen but which yet are finished faithfully to the very veins of each leaf in stone and there is a continual variety of this accurate toil  on the exterior of the edifice there is equal minuteness of finish and a great many niches for statues all of which i believe are now gone although there are carved faces at some points and angles  the graveyard around the abbey is still the only one which the village has and is crowded with gravestones among which i read the inscription of one erected by sir walter scott to the memory of thomas pardy one of his servants  some sable birdseither rooks or jackdaws were flitting about the ruins inside and out  mr bowman and i talked about revisiting melrose by moonlight but luckily there was to be no moon that evening  i do not myself think that daylight and sunshine make a ruin less effective than twilight or moonshine  in reference to scotts description i think he deplorably diminishes the impressiveness of the scene by saying that the alternate buttresses seen by moonlight look as if made of ebon and ivory  it suggests a small and very pretty piece of cabinetwork not these gray rough walls which time has gnawed upon for a thousand years without eating them away  leaving the abbey we took a path or a road which led us to the river tweed perhaps a quarter of a mile off and we crossed it by a footbridgea pretty wide stream a dimpling breadth of transparent water flowing between low banks with a margin of pebbles  we then returned to our inn and had tea and passed a quiet evening by the fireside  this is a good unpretentious inn and its visitors book indicates that it affords general satisfaction to those who come here  in the morning we breakfasted on broiled salmon taken no doubt in the neighboring tweed  there was a very coarselooking man at table with us who informed us that he owned the best horse anywhere round the eildon hills and could make the best cast for a salmon and catch a bigger fish than anybodywith other selflaudation of the same kind  the waiter afterwards told us that he was the son of an admiral in the neighborhood and soon his horse being brought to the door we saw him mount and ride away  he sat on horseback with ease and grace though i rather suspect early as it was that he was already in his cups  the scotch seem to me to get drunk at very unseasonable hours  i have seen more drunken people here than during all my residence in england and generally early in the day  their liquor so far as i have observed makes them goodnatured and sociable imparting a perhaps needed geniality to their cold natures  after breakfast we took a drosky or whatever these foreandaftseated vehicles are called and set out for    dryburgh abbey   three miles distant  it was a cold though rather bright morning with a most shrewd and bitter wind which blew directly in my face as i sat beside the driver  an english wind is bad enough but methinks a scotch one is rather worse at any rate i was half frozen and wished dryburgh abbey in tophet where it would have been warmer work to go and see it some of the border hills were striking especially the cowden knowe which ascends into a prominent and lofty peak  such villages as we passed did not greatly differ from english villages  by and by we came to the banks of the tweed at a point where there is a ferry  a carriage was on the riverbank the driver waiting beside it for the people who came in it had already been ferried across to see the abbey  the ferryman here is a young girl and stepping into the boat she shoved off and so skilfully took advantage of the eddies of the stream which is here deep and rapid that we were soon on the other side  she was by no means an uncomely maiden with pleasant scotch features and a quiet intelligence of aspect gleaming into a smile when spoken to much tanned with all kinds of weather and though slender yet so agile and muscular that it was no shame for a man to let himself be rowed by her  from the ferry we had a walk of half a mile more or less to a cottage where we found another young girl whose business it is to show the abbey  she was of another mould than the ferrymaidena queer shy plaintive sort of a bodyand answered all our questions in a low wailing tone  passing through an appleorchard we were not long in reaching the abbey the ruins of which are much more extensive and more picturesque than those of melrose being overrun with bushes and shrubbery and twined about with ivy and all such vegetation as belongs naturally to old walls  there are the remains of the refectory and other domestic parts of the abbey as well as the church and all in delightful state of decaynot so far gone but that we had bits of its former grandeur in the columns and broken arches and in some portions of the edifice that still retain a roof  in the chapterhouse we saw a marble statue of newton wofully maltreated by damps and weather and though it had no sort of business there it fitted into the ruins picturesquely enough  there is another statue equally unauthorized both having been placed here by a former earl of buchan who seems to have been a little astray in his wits  on one side of the church within an arched recess are the monuments of sir walter scott and his familythree ponderous tombstones of aberdeen granite polished but already dimmed and dulled by the weather  the whole floor of the recess is covered by these monuments that of sir walter being the middle one with lady or as the inscription calls her dame scott beyond him next to the church wall and some one of his sons or daughters on the hither side  the effect of his being buried here is to make the whole of dryburgh abbey his monument  there is another arched recess twin to the scott burialplace and contiguous to it in which are buried a pringle family it being their ancient place of sepulture  the spectator almost inevitably feels as if they were intruders although their rights here are of far older date than those of scott  dryburgh abbey must be a most beautiful spot of a summer afternoon and it was beautiful even on this not very genial morning especially when the sun blinked out upon the ivy and upon the shrubberied paths that wound about the ruins  i think i recollect the birds chirruping in this neighborhood of it  after viewing it sufficientlysufficiently for this one timewe went back to the ferry and being set across by the same undine we drove back to melrose  no longer riding against the wind i found it not nearly so cold as before  i now noticed that the eildon hills seen from this direction rise from one base into three distinct summits ranged in a line  according to the lay of the last minstrel they were cleft into this shape by the magic of michael scott reaching melrose     without alighting we set off for    abbotsford   three miles off  the neighborhood of melrose leading to abbotsford has many handsome residences of modern build and very recent datesuburban villas each with its little lawn and garden ground such as we see in the vicinity of liverpool  i noticed too one castellated house of no great size but old and looking as if its tower were built not for show but for actual defence in the old border warfare  we were not long in reaching abbotsford  the house which is more compact and of considerably less extent than i anticipated stands in full view from the road and at only a short distance from it lower down towards the river  its aspect disappointed me but so does everything it is but a villa after all no castle nor even a large manorhouse and very unsatisfactory when you consider it in that light  indeed it impressed me not as a real house intended for the home of human beingsa house to die in or to be born inbut as a plaything something in the same category as horace walpoles strawberry hill  the present owner seems to have found it insufficient for the actual purposes of life for he is adding a wing which promises to be as extensive as the original structure  we rang at the front door the family being now absent and were speedily admitted by a middleaged or somewhat elderly manthe butler i suppose or some upper servantwho at once acceded to our request to be permitted to see the house  we stepped from the porch immediately into the entrancehall and having the great hall of battle abbey in my memory and the ideal of a baronial hall in my mind i was quite taken aback at the smallness and narrowness and lowness of this which however is a very fine one on its own little scale  in truth it is not much more than a vestibule  the ceiling is carved and every inch of the walls is covered with claymores targets and other weapons and armor or oldtime curiosities tastefully arranged many of which no doubt have a history attached to themor had in sir walters own mind  our attendant was a very intelligent person and pointed out much that was interesting but in such a multitudinous variety it was almost impossible to fix the eye upon any one thing  probably the apartment looked smaller than it really was on account of being so wainscoted and festooned with curiosities  i remember nothing particularly unless it be the coalgrate in the fireplace which was one formerly used by archbishop sharpe the prelate whom balfour of burley murdered  either in this room or the next one there was a glass case containing the suit of clothes last worn by scotta short green coat somewhat worn with silvered buttons a pair of gray tartan trousers and a white hat  it was in the hall that we saw these things for there too i recollect were a good many walkingsticks that had been used by scott and the hatchet with which he was in the habit of lopping branches from his trees as he walked among them  from the hall we passed into the studya small room lined with the books which sir walter no doubt was most frequently accustomed to refer to and our guide pointed out some volumes of the moniteur which he used while writing the history of napoleon  probably these were the driest and dullest volumes in his whole library  about midheight of the walls of the study there is a gallery with a short flight of steps for the convenience of getting at the upper books  a studytable occupied the centre of the room and at one end of the table stands an easychair covered with morocco and with ample space to fling ones self back  the servant told me that i might sit down in this chair for that sir walter sat there while writing his romances and perhaps quoth the man smiling you may catch some inspiration  what a bitter word this would have been if he had known me to be a romancewriter  no i never shall be inspired to write romances i answered as if such an idea had never occurred to me  i sat down however  this study quite satisfied me being planned on principles of commonsense and made to work in and without any fantastic adaptation of old forms to modern uses  next to the study is the library an apartment of respectable size and containing as many books as it can hold all protected by wirework  i did not observe what or whose works were here but the attendant showed us one whole compartment full of volumes having reference to ghosts witchcraft and the supernatural generally  it is remarkable that scott should have felt interested in such subjects being such a worldly and earthly man as he was but then indeed almost all forms of popular superstition do clothe the ethereal with earthly attributes and so make it grossly perceptible  the library like the study suited me wellmerely the fashion of the apartment i meanand i doubt not it contains as many curious volumes as are anywhere to be met with within a similar space  the drawingroom adjoins it and here we saw a beautiful ebony cabinet which was presented to sir walter by george iv and some pictures of much interestone of scott himself at thirtyfive rather portly with a heavy face but shrewd eyes which seem to observe you closely  there is a fulllength of his eldest son an officer of dragoons leaning on his charger and a portrait of lady scotta brunette with black hair and eyes very pretty warm vivacious and unenglish in her aspect  i am not quite sure whether i saw all these pictures in the drawingroom or some of them in the diningroom but the one that struck me mostand very much indeedwas the head of mary queen of scots literally the head cut off and lying on a dish  it is said to have been painted by an italian or french artist two days after her death  the hair curls or flows all about it the face is of a deathlike hue but has an expression of quiet after much pain and troublevery beautiful very sweet and sad and it affected me strongly with the horror and strangeness of such a head being severed from its body  methinks i should not like to have it always in the room with me  i thought of the lovely picture of mary that i had seen at edinburgh castle and reflected what a symbol it would behow expressive of a human being having her destiny in her own handsif that beautiful young queen were painted as carrying this dish containing her own woful head and perhaps casting a curious and pitiful glance down upon it as if it were not her own  also in the drawingroom there was a plaster cast of sir walters face taken after death the only one in existence as our guide assured us it is not often that one sees a homelier set of features than this no elevation no dignity whether bestowed by nature or thrown over them by age or death sunken cheeks the bridge of the nose depressed and the end turned up the mouth puckered and no chin whatever or hardly any the expression was not calm and happy but rather as if he were in a perturbed slumber perhaps nothing short of nightmare  i wonder that the family allow this cast to be shownthe last record that there is of scotts personal reality and conveying such a wretched and unworthy idea of it  adjoining the drawingroom is the diningroom in one corner of which between two windows scott died  it was now a quarter of a century since his death but it seemed to me that we spoke with a sort of hush in our voices as if he were still dying here or had but just departed  i remember nothing else in this room  the next one is the armory which is the smallest of all that we had passed through but its walls gleam with the steel blades of swords and the barrels of pistols matchlocks firelocks and all manner of deadly weapons whether european or oriental for there are many trophies here of east indian warfare  i saw rob roys gun rifled and of very large bore and a beautiful pistol formerly claverhouses and the sword of montrose given him by king charles the silver hilt of which i grasped  there was also a superb claymore in an elaborately wrought silver sheath made for sir walter scott and presented to him by the highland society for his services in marshalling the clans when george iv came to scotland  there were a thousand other things which i knew must be most curious yet did not ask nor care about them because so many curiosities drive one crazy and fret ones heart to death  on the whole there is no simple and great impression left by abbotsford and i felt angry and dissatisfied with myself for not feeling something which i did not and could not feel  but it is just like going to a museum if you look into particulars and one learns from it too that scott could not have been really a wise man nor an earnest one nor one that grasped the truth of life he did but play and the play grew very sad toward its close  in a certain way however i understand his romances the better for having seen his house and his house the better for having read his romances  they throw light on one another  we had now gone through all the showrooms and the next door admitted us again into the entrancehall where we recorded our names in the visitors book  it contains more names of americans i should judge from casting my eyes back over last years record than of all other people in the world including great britain  bidding farewell to abbotsford i cannot but confess a sentiment of remorse for having visited the dwellingplaceas just before i visited the grave of the mighty minstrel and romancer with so cold a heart and in so critical a moodhis dwellingplace and his grave whom i had so admired and loved and who had done so much for my happiness when i was young  but i and the world generally now look at him from a different point of view and besides these visits to the actual haunts of famous people though long dead have the effect of making us sensible in some degree of their human imperfections as if we actually saw them alive i felt this effect to a certain extent even with respect to shakespeare when i visited stratfordonavon  as for scott i still cherish him in a warm place and i do not know that i have any pleasanter anticipation as regards books than that of reading all his novels over again after we get back to the wayside  this mr hawthorne did aloud to his family the year following his return to americaed  it was now one or two oclock and time for us to take the rail across the borders  many a mile behind us as we rushed onward we could see the threefold eildon hill and probably every pant of the engine carried us over some spot of ground which scott has made fertile with poetry for scotlandcold cloudy barren little bit of earth that it isowes all the interest that the world feels in it to him  few men have done so much for their country as he  however having no guidebook we were none the wiser for what we saw out of the window of the railcarriage but now and then a castle appeared on a commanding height visible for miles round and seemingly in good repairnow in some low and sheltered spot the gray walls of an abbey now on a little eminence the ruin of a border fortress and near it the modern residence of the laird with its trim lawn and shrubbery  we were not long in coming to   berwick   a town which seems to belong both to england and scotland or perhaps is a kingdom by itself for it stands on both sides of the boundary river the tweed where it empties into the german ocean  from the railway bridge we had a good view over the town which looks ancient with red roofs on all the gabled houses and it being a sunny afternoon though bleak and chill the seaview was very fine  the tweed is here broad and looks deep flowing far beneath the bridge between high banks  this is all that i can say of berwick pronounced berrick for though we spent above an hour at the station waiting for the train we were so long in getting our dinner that we had not time for anything else  i remember however some gray walls that looked like the last remains of an old castle near the railway station  we next took the train for    newcastle   the way to which for a considerable distance lies within sight of the sea and in close vicinity to the shore we saw holy isle on which are the ruins of an abbey  norham castle must be somewhere in this neighborhood on the english shore of the tweed  it was pretty late in the afternoonalmost nightfallwhen we reached newcastle over the roofs of which as over those of berwick we had a view from the railway and like berwick it was a congregation of mostly red roofs but unlike berwick the atmosphere over which was clear and transparent there came a gush of smoke from every chimney which made it the dimmest and smokiest place i ever saw  this is partly owing to the iron founderies and furnaces but each domestic chimney too was smoking on its own accountcoal being so plentiful there no doubt that the fire is always kept freshly heaped with it reason or none  out of this smokecloud rose tall steeples and it was discernible that the town stretched widely over an uneven surface on the banks of the tyne which is navigable up hither ten miles from the sea for pretty large vessels  we established ourselves at the station hotel and then walked out to see something of the town but i remember only a few streets of duskiness and dinginess with a glimpse of the turrets of a castle to which we could not find our way  so as it was getting twilightish and very cold we went back to the hotel which is a very good one better than any one i have seen in the south of england and almost or quite as good as those of scotland  the coffeeroom is a spacious and handsome apartment adorned with a fulllength portrait of wellington and other pictures and in the whole establishment there was a wellordered alacrity and liberal provision for the comfort of guests that one seldom sees in english inns  there are a good many american guests in newcastle and through all the north  an old newcastle gentleman and his friend came into the smokingroom and drank three glasses of hot whiskeytoddy apiece and were still going on to drink more when we left them  these respectable persons probably went away drunk that night yet thought none the worse of themselves or of one another for it  it is like returning to times twenty years gone by for a newenglander to witness such simplicity of manners  the next morning may 8th i rose and breakfasted early and took the rail soon after eight oclock leaving mr bowman behind for he had business in newcastle and would not follow till some hours afterwards there is no use in trying to make a narrative of anything that one sees along an english railway  all i remember of this tract of country is that one of the stations at which we stopped for an instant is called washington and this is no doubt the old family place where the de wessyngtons afterwards the washingtons were first settled in england before reaching york first one old lady and then another quaker lady got into the carriage along with me and they seemed to be going to york on occasion of some fair or celebration  this was all the company i had and their advent the only incident  it was about eleven oclock when i beheld york cathedral rising huge above the old city which stands on the river ouse separated by it from the railway station but communicating by a ferry or two and a bridge  i wandered forth and found my way over the latter into the ancient and irregular streets of    york   crooked narrow or of unequal width puzzling and many of them bearing the name of the particular gate in the old walls of the city to which they lead  there were no such fine ancient stately houses as some of those in shrewsbury were nor such an aspect of antiquity as in chester but still york is a quaint old place and what looks most modern is probably only something old hiding itself behind a new front as elsewhere in england  i found my way by a sort of instinct as directly as possible to    york minster   it stands in the midst of a small open spaceor a space that looks small in comparison with the vast bulk of the cathedral  i was not so much impressed by its exterior as i have usually been by gothic buildings because it is rectangular in its general outline and in its towers and seems to lack the complexity and mysterious plan which perplexes and wonderstrikes me in most cathedrals  doubtless however if i had known better how to admire it i should have found it wholly admirable  at all events it has a satisfactory hugeness  seeking my way in i at first intruded upon the registry of deeds which occupies a building patched up against the mighty side of the cathedral and hardly discernible so small the one and so large the other  i finally hit upon the right door and i felt no disappointment in my first glance around at the immensity of enclosed spacei see now in my minds eye a dim length of nave a breadth in the transepts like a great plain and such an airy height beneath the central tower that a worshipper could certainly get a good way towards heaven without rising above it  i only wish that the screen or whatever they call it between the choir and nave could be thrown down so as to give us leave to take in the whole vastitude at once  i never could understand why after building a great church they choose to sunder it in halves by this midpartition  but let me be thankful for what i got and especially for the height and massiveness of the clustered pillars that support the arches on which rests the central tower  i remember at furness abbey i saw two tall pillars supporting a broken arch and thought it the most majestic fragment of architecture that could possibly be  but these pillars have a nobler height and these arches a greater sweep  what nonsense to try to write about a cathedral  there is a great cold bareness and bleakness about the interior for there are very few monuments and those seem chiefly to be of ecclesiastical people  i saw no armed knights asleep on the tops of their tombs but there was a curious representation of a skeleton at full length under the tableslab of one of the monuments  the walls are of a grayish hue not so agreeable as the rich dark tint of the inside of westminster abbey but a great many of the windows are still filled with ancient painted glass the very small squares and pieces of which are composed into splendid designs of saints and angels and scenes from scripture  there were a few watery blinks of sunshine out of doors and whenever these came through the old painted windows some of the more vivid colors were faintly thrown upon the pavement of the cathedralvery faintly it is true for in the first place the sunshine was not brilliant and painted glass too fades in the course of the ages perhaps like all mans other works  there were two or three windows of modern manufacture and far more magnificent as to brightness of color and material beauty than the ancient ones but yet they looked vulgar glaring and impertinent in comparison because such revivals or imitations of a longdisused art cannot have the good faith and earnestness of the originals  indeed in the very coloring i felt the same difference as between hearts blood and a scarlet dye  it is a pity however that the old windows cannot be washed both inside and out for now they have the dust of centuries upon them  the screen or curtain between the nave and choir has eleven carved figures at full length which appeared to represent kings some of them wearing crowns and bearing sceptres or swords  they were in wood and wrought by some gothic hand  these carvings and the painted windows and the few monuments are all the details that the mind can catch hold of in the immensity of this cathedral and i must say that it was a dreary place on that cold cloudy day  i doubt whether a cathedral is a sort of edifice suited to the english climate  the first buildings of the kind were probably erected by people who had bright and constant sunshine and who desired a shadowy awfulnesslike that of a forest with its arched woodpathsinto which to retire in their religious moments  in america on a hot summers day how delightful its cool and solemn depths would be  the painted windows too were evidently contrived in the first instance by persons who saw how effective they would prove when a vivid sun shone through them  but in england the interior of a cathedral nine days out of ten is a vast sullenness and as chill as death and the tomb  at any rate it was so today and so thought one of the old vergers who kept walking as briskly as he could along the width of the transepts  there were several of these old men when i first came in but they went off all but this one before i departed  none of them said a word to me nor i to them and admission to the minster seems to be entirely free  after emerging from this great gloom i wandered to and fro about york and contrived to go astray within no very wide space  if its history be authentic it is an exceedingly old city having been founded about a thousand years before the christian era  there used to be a palace of the roman emperors here and the emperor severus died here as did some of his successors and constantine the great was born here  i know not what if any relics of those earlier times there may be but york is still partly surrounded with a wall and has several gates which the city authorities take pains to keep in repair  i grow weary in my endeavor to find my way back to the railway and inquired it of one of the good people of yorka respectable courteous gentlemanly person and he told me to walk along the walls  then he went on a considerable distance but seemed to repent of not doing more for me so he waited till i came up and walking along by my side pointed out the castle now the jail and the place of execution and directed me to the principal gateway of the city and instructed me how to reach the ferry the path along the wall leads in one place through a room over the arch of a gatewaya low thickwalled stone apartment where doubtless the gatekeeper used to lodge and to parley with those who desired entrance  i found my way to the ferry over the ouse according to this kind yorkists instructions  the ferryman told me that the fee for crossing was a halfpenny which seemed so ridiculously small that i offered him more but this unparalleled englishman declined taking anything beyond his rightful halfpenny  this seems so wonderful to me that i can hardly trust my own memory  reaching the station i got some dinner and at four oclock just as i was starting came mr bowman my very agreeable and sensible travelling companion  our journeying together was ended here for he was to keep on to london and i to return to liverpool  so we parted and i took the rail westward across england through a very beautiful and in some degree picturesque tract of country diversified with hills through the valleys and vistas of which goes the railroad with dells diverging from it on either hand and streams and arched bridges and old villages and a hundred pleasant english sights  after passing rochdale however the dreary monotony of lancashire succeeded this variety  between nine and ten oclock i reached the tithebarn station in liverpool  ever since until now may 17th i have employed my leisure moments in scribbling off the journal of my tour but it has greatly lost by not having been written daily as the scenes and occurrences were fresh  the most picturesque points can be seized in no other way and the hues of the affair fade as quickly as those of a dying dolphin or as according to audubon the plumage of a dead bird  one thing that struck me as much as anything else in the highlands i had forgotten to put down  in our walk at balloch along the road within view of loch lomond and the neighboring hills it was a brilliant sunshiny afternoon and i never saw any atmosphere so beautiful as that among the mountains  it was a clear transparent ethereal blue as distinct as a vapor and yet by no means vaporous but a pure crystalline medium  i have witnessed nothing like this among the berkshire hills nor elsewhere  york is full of old churches some of them very antique in appearance the stones weatherworn their edges rounded by time blackened and with all the tokens of sturdy and agelong decay and in some of them i noticed windows quite full of old painted glass a dreary kind of minute patchwork all of one dark and dusty hue when seen from the outside yet had i seen them from the interior of the church there doubtless would have been rich and varied apparitions of saints with their glories round their heads and brightwinged angels and perhaps even the almighty father himself so far as conceivable and representable by human powers  it requires light from heaven to make them visible  if the church were merely illuminated from the insidethat is by what light a man can get from his own understandingthe pictures would be invisible or wear at best but a miserable aspect    liverpool   may 24thday before yesterday i had a call at the consulate from one of the potentates of the eartha woollyhaired negro rather thin and spare between forty and fifty years of age plainly dressed at the first glimpse of whom i could readily have mistaken him for some ships steward seeking to enter a complaint of his captain  however this was president roberts of liberia introduced by a note from mrs osullivan whom he has recently met in madeira  i was rather favorably impressed with him for his deportment was very simple and without any of the flourish and embroidery which a negro might be likely to assume on finding himself elevated from slavery to power  he is rather shy reserved at least and undemonstrative yet not harshly soin fine with manners that offer no prominent points for notice or criticism although i felt or thought i felt that his color was continually before his mind and that he walks cautiously among men as conscious that every new introduction is a new experiment  he is not in the slightest degree an interesting man so far as i discovered in a very brief interview apart from his position and history his face is not striking nor so agreeable as if it were jet black but there may be miles and miles of depth in him which i know nothing of  our conversation was of the most unimportant character for he had called merely to deliver the note and sat only a few minutes during which he merely responded to my observations and originated no remarks  intelligence discretion tact these are probably his traits not force of character and independence  the same day i took the rail from the little street station for    manchester   to meet bennoch who had asked me thither to dine with him  i had never visited manchester before though now so long resident within twenty miles of it neither is it particularly worth visiting unless for the sake of its factories which i did not go to see  it is a dingy and heavy town with very much the aspect of liverpool being like the latter built almost entirely within the present century  i stopped at the albion hotel and as bennoch was out i walked forth to view the city and made only such observations as are recorded above  opposite the hotel stands the infirmarya very large edifice which when erected was on the outskirts or perhaps in the rural suburbs of the town but it is now almost in its centre  in the enclosed space before it stands the statue of peel and sits a statue of dr dalton the celebrated chemist who was a native of manchester  returning to the hotel i sat down in the room where we were to dine and in due time bennoch made his appearance with the same glow and friendly warmth in his face that i had left burning there when we parted in london  if this man has not a heart then no man ever had  i like him inexpressibly for his heart and for his intellect and for his flesh and blood and if he has faults i do not know them nor care to know them nor value him the less if i did know them  he went to his room to dress and in the mean time a middleaged dark man of pleasant aspect with black hair black eyebrows and bright dark eyes came in limping a little but not much  he seemed not quite a man of the world a little shy in manner yet he addressed me kindly and sociably  i guessed him to be mr charles swain the poet whom mr bennoch had invited to dinner soon came another guest whom mr swain introduced to me as mr  editor of the manchester examiner  then came bennoch who made us all regularly acquainted or took for granted that we were so and lastly appeared a mr w a merchant in manchester and a very intelligent man and the party was then complete  mr swain the poet is not a man of fluent conversation he said indeed very little but gave me the impression of amiability and simplicity of character with much feeling  mr w is a very sensible man  he has spent two or three years in america and seems to have formed juster conclusions about us than most of his countrymen do  he is the only englishman i think whom i have met who fairly acknowledges that the english do cherish doubt jealousy suspicion in short an unfriendly feeling towards the americans  it is wonderful how every american whatever class of the english he mingles with is conscious of this feeling and how no englishman except this sole mr w will confess it  he expressed some very good ideas too about the english and american press and the reasons why the times may fairly be taken as the exponent of british feeling towards us while the new york herald immense as its circulation is can be considered in no similar degree or kind the american exponent  we sat late at table and after the other guests had retired bennoch and i had some very friendly talk and he proposed that on my wifes return we should take up our residence in his house at blackheath while mrs bennoch and himself were absent for two months on a trip to germany  if his wife and mine ratify the idea we will do so  the next morning we went out to see the exchange and whatever was noticeable about the town  time being brief i did not visit the cathedral which i believe is a thousand years old  there are many handsome shops in manchester and we went into one establishment devoted to pictures engravings and decorative art generally which is most perfect and extensive  the firm if i remember is that of the messrs agnew and though originating here they have now a house in london here i saw some interesting objects purchased by them at the recent sale of the rogers collection among other things a slight pencil and watercolor sketch by raphael  an unfinished affair done in a moment as this must have been seems to bring us closer to the hand that did it than the most elaborately painted picture can  were i to see the transfiguration raphael would still be at the distance of centuries seeing this little sketch i had him very near me  i know not why perhaps it might be fancied that he had only laid down the pencil for an instant and would take it up again in a moment more  i likewise saw a copy of a handsome illustrated edition of childe harold presented by old john murray to mr rogers with an inscription on the flyleaf purporting that it was a token of gratitude from the publisher because when everybody else thought him imprudent in giving four hundred guineas for the poem mr rogers told him it would turn out the best bargain he ever made  there was a new picture by millais the distinguished preraphaelite artist representing a melancholy parting between two lovers  the ladys face had a great deal of sad and ominous expression but an old brick wall overrun with foliage was so exquisitely and elaborately wrought that it was hardly possible to look at the personages of the picture every separate leaf of the climbing and clustering shrubbery was painfully made out and the wall was reality itself with the weatherstains and the moss and the crumbling lime between the bricks it is not well to be so perfect in the inanimate unless the artist can likewise make man and woman as lifelike and to as great a depth too as the creator does  bennoch left town for some place in yorkshire and i for liverpool  i asked him to come and dine with me at the adelphi meaning to ask two or three people to meet him but he had other engagements and could not spare a day at present though he promises to come before long  dining at mr rathbones one evening last week may 21st it was mentioned that    borrow   author of the bible in spain is supposed to be of gypsy descent by the mothers side  hereupon mr martineau mentioned that he had been a schoolfellow of borrow and though he had never heard of his gypsy blood he thought it probable from borrows traits of character  he said that borrow had once run away from school and carried with him a party of other boys meaning to lead a wandering life  if an englishman were individually acquainted with all our twentyfive millions of americans and liked every one of them and believed that each man of those millions was a christian honest upright and kind he would doubt despise and hate them in the aggregate however he might love and honor the individuals  captain  and his wife oakum they spent all evening at mrs bs  the captain is a marblehead man by birth not far from sixty years old very talkative and anecdotic in regard to his adventures funny goodhumored and full of various nautical experience  oakum it is a nickname which he gives his wife is an inconceivably tall woman taller than hesix feet at least and with a wellproportioned largeness in all respects but looks kind and good gentle smilingand almost any other woman might sit like a baby on her lap  she does not look at all awful and belligerent like the massive english women one often sees  you at once feel her to be a benevolent giantess and apprehend no harm from her  she is a lady and perfectly well mannered but with a sort of naturalness and simplicity that becomes her for any the slightest affectation would be so magnified in her vast personality that it would be absolutely the height of the ridiculous  this wedded pair have no children and oakum has so long accompanied her husband on his voyages that i suppose by this time she could command a ship as well as he  they sat till pretty late diffusing cheerfulness all about them and then come oakum cried the captain we must hoist sail and up rose oakum to the ceiling and moved towerlike to the door looking down with a benignant smile on the poor little pygmy women about her  six feet did i say  why she must he seven eight nine and whatever be her size she is as good as she is big   june 11thmonday night 9th just as i was retiring i received a telegraphic message announcing my wifes arrival at    southampton   so the next day i arranged the consular business for an absence of ten days and set forth with j and reached birmingham between eight and nine evening  we put up at the queens hotel a very large establishment contiguous to the railway  next morning we left birmingham and made our first stage to leamington where we had to wait nearly an hour which we spent in wandering through some of the streets that had been familiar to us last year  leamington is certainly a beautiful town new bright clean and as unlike as possible to the business towns of england  however the sun was burning hot and i could almost have fancied myself in america  from leamington we took tickets for oxford where we were obliged to make another stop of two hours and these we employed to what advantage we could driving up into town and straying hither and thither till js weariness weighed upon me and i adjourned with him to a hotel  oxford is an ugly old town of crooked and irregular streets gabled houses mostly plastered of a buff or yellow hue some new fronts and as for the buildings of the university they seem to be scattered at random without any reference to one another  i passed through an old gateway of christ church and looked at its enclosed square and that is in truth pretty much all i then saw of the university of oxford  from christ church we rambled along a street that led us to a bridge across the isis and we saw many rowboats lying in the riverthe lightest craft imaginable unless it were an indian canoe  the isis is but a narrow stream and with a sluggish current  i believe the students of oxford are famous for their skill in rowing  to me as well as to j the hot streets were terribly oppressive so we went into the roebuck hotel where we found a cool and pleasant coffeeroom  the entrance to this hotel is through an arch opening from high street and giving admission into a paved court the buildings all around being part of the establishmentold edifices with pointed gables and oldfashioned projecting windows but all in fine repair and wearing a most quiet retired and comfortable aspect  the court was set all round with flowers growing in pots or large pedestalled vases on one side was the coffeeroom and all the other public apartments and the other side seemed to be taken up by the sleepingchambers and parlors of the guests  this arrangement of an inn i presume is very ancient and it resembles what i have seen in the hospitals free schools and other charitable establishments in the old english towns and indeed all large houses were arranged on somewhat the same principle  by and by two or three young men came in in wideawake hats and loose blouselike summerish garments and from their talk i found them to be students of the university although their topics of conversation were almost entirely horses and boats  one of them sat down to cold beef and a tankard of ale the other two drank a tankard of ale together and went away without paying for itrather to the waiters discontent  students are very much alike all the world over and i suppose in all time but i doubt whether many of my fellows at college would have gone off without paying for their beer  we reached southampton between seven and eight oclock  i cannot write today   june 15ththe first day after we reached southampton was sunny and pleasant but we made little use of the fine weather except that s and i walked once along the high street and j and i took a little ramble about town in the afternoon  the next day there was a high and disagreeable wind and i did not once stir out of the house  the third day too i kept entirely within doors it being a storm of wind and rain  the castle hotel stands within fifty yards of the waterside so that this gusty day showed itself to the utmost advantagethe vessels pitching and tossing at their moorings the waves breaking white out of a tumultuous gray surface the opposite shore glooming mistily at the distance of a mile or two and on the hither side boatmen and seafaring people scudding about the pier in waterproof clothes and in the street before the hotel door a cabman or two standing drearily beside his horse  but we were sunny within doors  yesterday it was breezy sunny shadowy showery and we ordered a cab to take us to clifton villa to call on mrs  a friend of bs who called on us the day after our arrival  just as we were ready to start mrs  again called and accompanied us back to her house it is in shirley about two miles from southampton pier and is a pleasant suburban villa with a pretty ornamented lawn and shrubbery about it  mrs  is an instructress of young ladies and at bs suggestion she is willing to receive us for two or three weeks during the vacation until we are ready to go to london  she seems to be a pleasant and sensible woman and tomorrow we shall decide whether to go there  there was nothing very remarkable in this drive and indeed my stay hereabouts thus far has been very barren of sights and incidents externally interesting though the inner life has been rich  southampton is a very pretty town and has not the dinginess to which i have been accustomed in many english towns  the high street reminds me very much of american streets in its general effect the houses being mostly stuccoed white or light and cheerful in aspect though doubtless they are centuries old at heart  the old gateway which i presume i have mentioned in describing my former visit to southampton stands across high street about in the centre of the town and is almost the only token of antiquity that presents itself to the eye   june 17thyesterday morning june 16th s mrs  and i took the rail for salisbury where we duly arrived without any accident or anything noticeable except the usual verdure and richness of an english summer landscape  from the railway station we walked up into salisbury with the tall spire four hundred feet high of the cathedral before our eyes  salisbury is an antique city but with streets more regular than i have seen in most old towns and the houses have a more picturesque aspect than those of oxford for instance where almost all are meanlooking alikethough i could hardly judge of oxford on that hot weary day  through one or more of the streets there runs a swift clear little stream which being close to the pavement and bordered with stone may be called i suppose a kennel though possessing the transparent purity of a rustic rivulet  it is a brook in city garb  we passed under the pointed arch of a gateway which stands in one of the principal streets and soon came in front of    the cathedral   i do not remember any cathedral with so fine a site as this rising up out of the centre of a beautiful green extensive enough to show its full proportions relieved and insulated from all other patchwork and impertinence of rusty edifices  it is of gray stone and looks as perfect as when just finished and with the perfection too that could not have come in less than six centuries of venerableness with a view to which these edifices seem to have been built  a new cathedral would lack the last touch to its beauty and grandeur  it needs to be mellowed and ripened like some pictures although i suppose this awfulness of antiquity was supplied in the minds of the generation that built cathedrals by the sanctity which they attributed to them  salisbury cathedral is far more beautiful than that of york the exterior of which was really disagreeable to my eye but this mighty spire and these multitudinous gray pinnacles and towers ascend towards heaven with a kind of natural beauty not as if man had contrived them  they might be fancied to have grown up just as the spires of a tuft of grass do at the same time that they have a law of propriety and regularity among themselves  the tall spire is of such admirable proportion that it does not seem gigantic and indeed the effect of the whole edifice is of beauty rather than weight and massiveness  perhaps the bright balmy sunshine in which we saw it contributed to give it a tender glory and to soften a little its majesty  when we went in we heard the organ the forenoon service being near conclusion  if i had never seen the interior of york cathedral i should have been quite satisfied no doubt with the spaciousness of this nave and these side aisles and the height of their arches and the girth of these pillars but with that recollection in my mind they fell a little short of grandeur  the interior is seen to disadvantage and in a way the builder never meant it to be seen because there is little or no painted glass nor any such mystery as it makes but only a colorless common daylight revealing everything without remorse  there is a general light hue moreover like that of whitewash over the whole of the roof and walls of the interior pillars monuments and all whereas originally every pillar was polished and the ceiling was ornamented in brilliant colors and the light came manyhued through the windows on all this elaborate beauty in lieu of which there is nothing now but space  between the pillars that separate the nave from the side aisles there are ancient tombs most of which have recumbent statues on them  one of these is longsword earl of salisbury son of fair rosamond in chain mail and there are many other warriors and bishops and one crosslegged crusader and on one tombstone a recumbent skeleton which i have likewise seen in two or three other cathedrals  the pavement of the aisles and nave is laid in great part with flat tombstones the inscriptions on which are half obliterated and on the walls especially in the transepts there are tablets among which i saw one to the poet bowles who was a canon of this cathedral  the ecclesiastical dignitaries bury themselves and monument themselves to the exclusion of almost everybody else in these latter times though still as of old the warrior has his place  a young officer slain in the indian wars was memorialized by a tablet and may be remembered by it six hundred years hence as we now remember the old knights and crusaders  it deserves to be mentioned that i saw one or two noses still unbroken among these recumbent figures  most of the antique statues on close examination proved to be almost entirely covered with names and initials scratched over the once polished surface  the cathedral and its relics must have been far less carefully watched at some former period than now  between the nave and the choir as usual there is a screen that half destroys the majesty of the building by abridging the spectator of the long vista which he might otherwise have of the whole interior at a glance  we peeped through the barrier and saw some elaborate monuments in the chancel beyond but the doors of the screen are kept locked so that the vergers may raise a revenue by showing strangers through the richest part of the cathedral  by and by one of these vergers came through the screen with a gentleman and lady whom he was taking round and we joined ourselves to the party  he showed us into the cloisters which had long been neglected and ruinous until the time of bishop dennison the last prelate who has been but a few years dead  this bishop has repaired and restored the cloisters in faithful adherence to the original plan and they now form a most delightful walk about a pleasant and verdant enclosure in the centre of which sleeps good bishop dennison with a wife on either side of him all three beneath broad flat stones  most cloisters are darksome and grim but these have a broad paved walk beneath the vista of arches and are light airy and cheerful and from one corner you can get the best possible view of the whole height and beautiful proportion of the cathedral spire  one side of this cloistered walk seems to be the length of the nave of the cathedral  there is a square of four such sides and of places for meditation grave yet not too sombre it seemed to me one of the best while we stayed there a jackdaw was walking to and fro across the grassy enclosure and haunting around the good bishops grave  he was clad in black and looked like a feathered ecclesiastic but i know not whether it were bishop dennisons ghost or that of some old monk  on one side of the cloisters and contiguous to the main body of the cathedral stands the chapterhouse  bishop dennison had it much at heart to repair this part of the holy edifice and if i mistake not did begin the work for it had been long ruinous and in cromwells time his dragoons stationed their horses there  little progress however had been made in the repairs when the bishop died and it was decided to restore the building in his honor and by way of monument to him  the repairs are now nearly completed and the interior of this chapterhouse gave me the first idea anywise adequate of the splendor of these gothic church edifices  the roof is sustained by one great central pillar of polished marblesmall pillars clustered about a great central column which rises to the ceiling and there gushes out with various beauty that overflows all the walls as if the fluid idea had sprung out of that fountain and grown solid in what we see  the pavement is elaborately ornamented the ceiling is to be brilliantly gilded and painted as it was of yore and the tracery and sculptures around the walls are to be faithfully renewed from what remains of the original patterns  after viewing the chapterhouse the vergeran elderly man of grave benign manner clad in black and talking of the cathedral and the monuments as if he loved themled us again into the nave of the cathedral and thence within the screen of the choir  the screen is as poor as possiblemere barren woodwork without the least attempt at beauty  in the chancel there are some meagre patches of old glass and some of modern date not very well worth looking at  we saw several interesting monuments in this part of the cathedralone belonging to the ducal family of somerset and erected in the reign of james i it is of marble and extremely splendid and elaborate with kneeling figures and all manner of magnificencemore than i have seen in any monument except that of mary of scotland in westminster abbey  the more ancient tombs are also very numerous and among them that of the bishop who founded the cathedral  within the screen against the wall is erected a monument by chantrey to the earl of malmesbury a fulllength statue of the earl in a halfrecumbent position holding an open volume and looking upwarda noble worka calm wise thoughtful firm and not unbenignant face  beholding its expression it really was impossible not to have faith in the high character of the individual thus represented and i have seldom felt this effect from any monumental bust or statue though i presume it is always aimed at  i am weary of trying to describe cathedrals  it is utterly useless there is no possibility of giving the general effect or any shadow of it and it is miserable to put down a few items of tombstones and a bit of glass from a painted window as if the gloom and glory of the edifice were thus to be reproduced  cathedrals are almost the only things if even those that have quite filled out my ideal here in this old world and cathedrals often make me miserable from my inadequacy to take them wholly in and above all i despise myself when i sit down to describe them  we now walked around the close which is surrounded by some of the quaintest and comfortablest ecclesiastical residences that can be imagined  these are the dwellinghouses of the dean and the canons and whatever other high officers compose the bishops staff and there was one large brick mansion old but not so ancient as the rest which we took to be the bishops palace  i never beheld anythingi must say again so cosey so indicative of domestic comfort for whole centuries togetherhouses so fit to live in or to die in and where it would be so pleasant to lead a young wife beneath the antique portal and dwell with her till husband and wife were patriarchalas these delectable old houses  they belong naturally to the cathedral and have a necessary relation to it and its sanctity is somehow thrown over them all so that they do not quite belong to this world though they look full to overflowing of whatever earthly things are good for man  these are places however in which mankind makes no progress the rushing tumult of human life here subsides into a deep quiet pool with perhaps a gentle circular eddy but no onward movement  the same identical thought i suppose goes round in a slow whirl from one generation to another as i have seen a withered leaf do in the vortex of a brook  in the front of the cathedral there is a most stately and beautiful tree which flings its verdure upward to a very lofty height but far above it rises the tall spire dwarfing the great tree by comparison  when the cathedral had sufficiently oppressed us with its beauty we returned to sublunary matters and went wandering about salisbury in search of a luncheon which we finally took in a confectioners shop then we inquired hither and thither at various liverystables for a conveyance to stonehenge and at last took a fly from the lamb hotel the drive was over a turnpike for the first seven miles over a bare ridgy country showing little to interest us  we passed a party of seven or eight men in a coarse uniform dress resembling that worn by convicts and apparently under the guardianship of a stout authoritative yet rather kindlylooking man with a cane  our driver said that they were lunatics from a neighboring asylum out for a walk  seven miles from salisbury we turned aside from the turnpike and drove two miles across salisbury plain which is an apparently boundless extent of unenclosed land treeless and houseless  it is not exactly a plain but a green sea of long and gentle swells and subsidences affording views of miles upon miles to a very far horizon  we passed large flocks of sheep with the shepherds watching them but the dogs seemed to take most of the care of the flocks upon their own shoulders and would scamper to turn the sheep when they inclined to stray whither they should not and then arose a thousandfold bleating not unpleasant to the ear for it did not apparently indicate any fear or discomfort on the part of the flock  the sheep and lambs are all blackfaced and have a very funny expression  as we drove over the plain my seat was beside the driver i saw at a distance a cluster of large gray stones mostly standing upright and some of them slightly inclined towards each other very irregular and so far off forming no very picturesque or noteworthy spectacle  of course i knew at once that this was    stonehenge   and also knew that the reality was going to dwindle wofully within my ideal as almost everything else does  when we reached the spot we found a picnicparty just finishing their dinner on one of the overthrown stones of the druidical temple and within the sacred circle an artist was painting a wretched daub of the scene and an old shepherd the very shepherd of salisbury plain sat erect in the centre of the ruin  there never was a ruder thing than stonehenge made by mortal hands  it is so very rude that it seems as if nature and man had worked upon it with one consent and so it is all the stranger and more impressive from its rudeness  the spectator wonders to see art and contrivance and a regular and even somewhat intricate plan beneath all the uncouth simplicity of this arrangement of rough stones and certainly whatever was the intellectual and scientific advancement of the people who built stonehenge no succeeding architects will ever have a right to triumph over them for nobodys work in after times is likely to endure till it becomes a mystery as to who built it and how and for what purpose apart from the moral considerations suggested by it stonehenge is not very well worth seeing  materially it is one of the poorest of spectacles and when complete it must have been even less picturesque than nowa few huge rough stones very imperfectly squared standing on end and each group of two supporting a third large stone on their tops other stones of the same pattern overthrown and tumbled one upon another and the whole comprised within a circuit of about a hundred feet diameter the short sheepcropped grass of salisbury plain growing among all these uncouth bowlders  i am not sure that a misty lowering day would not have better suited stonehenge as the dreary midpoint of the great desolate trackless plain not literally trackless however for the london and exeter road passes within fifty yards of the ruins and another road intersects it  after we had been there about an hour there came a horseman within the druids circleevidently a clerical personage by his white neckcloth though his loose gray riding pantaloons were not quite in keeping  he looked at us rather earnestly and at last addressed mrs  and announced himself as mr hinchmana clergyman whom she had been trying to find in salisbury in order to avail herself of him as a cicerone and he had now ridden hither to meet us  he told us that the artist whom we found here could give us more information than anybody about stonehenge for it seems he has spent a great many years here painting and selling his poor sketches to visitors and also selling a book which his father wrote about the remains  this man showed indeed a pretty accurate acquaintance with these old stones and pointed out what is thought to be the altarstone and told us of some relation between this stone and two other stones and the rising of the sun at midsummer which might indicate that stonehenge was a temple of solar worship  he pointed out too to how little depth the stones were planted in the earth insomuch that i have no doubt the american frosts would overthrow stonehenge in a single winter and it is wonderful that it should have stood so long even in england  i have forgotten what else he said but i bought one of his books and find it a very unsatisfactory performance being chiefly taken up with an attempt to prove these remains to be an antediluvian work constructed i think the author says under the superintendence of father adam himself  before our departure we were requested to write our names in the album which the artist keeps for the purpose and he pointed out expresident fillmores autograph and those of one or two other americans who have been here within a short time  it is a very curious life that this artist leads in this great solitude and haunting stonehenge like the ghost of a druid but he is a brisk little man and very communicative on his one subject  mr hinchman rode with us over the plain and pointed out salisbury spire visible close to stonehenge  under his guidance we returned by a different road from that which brought us thitherand a much more delightful one  i think i never saw such continued sylvan beauty as this road showed us passing through a good deal of woodland sceneryfine old trees standing each within its own space and thus having full liberty to outspread itself and wax strong and broad for ages instead of being crowded and thus stifled and emaciated as human beings are here and foresttrees are in america  hedges too and the rich rich verdure of england and villages full of picturesque old houses thatched and ivied or perhaps overrun with rosesand a stately mansion in the elizabethan style and a quiet stream gliding onward without a ripple from its own motion but rippled by a large fish darting across it and over all this scene a gentle friendly sunshine not ardent enough to crisp a single leaf or blade of grass  nor must the village church be forgotten with its square battlemented tower dating back to the epoch of the normans  we called at a house where one of mrs s pupils was residing with her aunta thatched house of two stories high built in what was originally a sandpit but which in the course of a good many years has been transformed into the most delightful and homelike little nook almost that can be found in england a thatched cottage suggests a very rude dwelling indeed but this had a pleasant parlor and drawingroom and chambers with latticewindows opening close beneath the thatched roof and the thatch itself gives an air to the place as if it were a birds nest or some such simple and natural habitation  the occupants are an elderly clergyman retired from professional duty and his sister and having nothing else to do and sufficient means they employ themselves in beautifying this sweet little retreat planting new shrubbery laying out new walks around it and helping nature to add continually another charm and nature is certainly a more genial playfellow in england than in my own country  she is always ready to lend her aid to any beautifying purpose  leaving these good people who were very hospitable giving tea and offering wine we reached salisbury in time to take the train for southampton   june 18thyesterday we left the castle hotel after paying a bill of twenty pounds for a little more than a weeks board  in america we could not very well have lived so simply but we might have lived luxuriously for half the money  this castle hotel was once an old roman castle the landlord says and the circular sweep of the tower is still seen towards the street although being painted white and built up with modern additions it would not be taken for an ancient structure  there is a dungeon beneath it in which the landlord keeps his wine  j and i quitting the hotel walked towards shinley along the waterside leaving the rest of the family to follow in a fly  there are many traces along the shore of the fortifications by which southampton was formerly defended towards the water and very probably their foundations may be as ancient as roman times  our hotel was no doubt connected with this chain of defences which seems to have consisted of a succession of round towers with a wall extending from one to another we saw two or three of these towers still standing and likely to stand though ivygrown and ruinous at the summit and intermixed and even amalgamated with pothouses and mean dwellings and often through an antique arch there was a narrow doorway giving access to the house of some sailor or laborer or artisan and his wife gossiping at it with her neighbor or his children playing about it  after getting beyond the precincts of southampton our walk was not very interesting except to j who kept running down to the verge of the water looking for shells and seainsects   june 29thyesterday 28th i left liverpool from the lime street station an exceedingly hot day for england insomuch that the rail carriages were really uncomfortable  i have now passed over the london and northwestern railway so often that the northern part of it is very wearisome especially as it has few features of interest even to a new observer  at staffordno at wolverhamptonwe diverged to a track which i have passed over only once before  we stopped an hour and a quarter at wolverhampton and i walked up into the town which is large and oldold at least in its plan or lack of planthe streets being irregular and straggling over an uneven surface  like many of the english towns it reminds me of boston though dingier  the sun was so hot that i actually sought the shady sides of the streets and this of itself is one long step towards establishing a resemblance between an english town and an american one  english railway carriages seem to me more tiresome than any other and i suppose it is owing to the greater motion arising from their more elastic springs  a slow train too like that which i was now in is more tiresome than a quick one at least to the spirits whatever it may be to the body  we loitered along through afternoon and evening stopping at every little station and nowhere getting to the top of our speed till at last in the late dusk we reached    gloucester   and i put up at the wellington hotel which is but a little way from the station  i took tea and a slice or two of ham in the coffeeroom and had a little talk with two people there one of whom on learning that i was an american said but i suppose you have now been in england some time  he meant finding me not absolutely a savage that i must have been caught a good while ago      the next morning i went into the city the hotel being on its outskirts and rambled along in search of the cathedral  some churchbells were chiming and clashing for a wedding or other festal occasion and i followed the sound supposing that it might proceed from the cathedral but this was not the case  it was not till i had got to a bridge over the severn quite out of the town that i saw again its tower and knew how to shape my course towards it  i did not see much that was strange or interesting in gloucester  it is old with a good many of those antique elizabethan houses with two or three peaked gables on a line together several old churches which always cluster about a cathedral like chickens round a hen a hospital for decayed tradesmen another for bluecoat boys a great many butchers shops scattered in all parts of the town open in front with a counter or dresser on which to display the meat just in the old fashion of shakespeares house  it is a large town and has a good deal of liveliness and bustle in a provincial way  in short judging by the sheep cattle and horses and the people of agricultural aspect that i saw about the streets i should think it must have been marketday  i looked here and there for the old bell inn because unless i misremember fielding brings tom jones to this inn while he and partridge were travelling together  it is still extant for on my arrival the night before a runner from it had asked me to go thither but i forgot its celebrity at the moment  i saw nothing of it in my rambles about gloucester but at last i found    the cathedral   though i found no point from which a good view of the exterior can be seen  it has a very beautiful and rich outside however and a lofty tower very large and ponderous but so finished off and adorned with pinnacles and all manner of architectural deviceswherewith these old builders knew how to alleviate their massive structuresthat it seems to sit lightly in the air  the porch was open and some workmen were trundling barrows into the nave so i followed and found two young women sitting just within the porch one of whom offered to show me round the cathedral  there was a great dust in the nave arising from the operations of the workmen  they had been laying a new pavement and scraping away the plaster which had heretofore been laid over the pillars and walls  the pillars come out from the process as good as newgreat round massive columns not clustered like those of most cathedrals they are twentyone feet in circumference and support semicircular arches  i think there are seven of these columns on each side of the nave which did not impress me as very spacious and the dust and racket of the workpeople quite destroyed the effect which should have been produced by the aisles and arches so that i hardly stopped to glance at this part though i saw some mural monuments and recumbent statues along the walls  the choir is separated from the nave by the usual screen and now by a sailcloth or something of that kind drawn across in order to keep out the dust while the repairs are going on  when the young woman conducted me hither i was at once struck by the magnificent eastern window the largest in england which fills or looks vast enough to fill all that end of the cathedrala most splendid window full of old painted glass which looked as bright as sunshine though the sun was not really shining through it  the roof of the choir is of oak and very fine and as much as ninety feet high  there are chapels opening from the choir and within them the monuments of the eminent people who built them and of benefactors or prelates or of those otherwise illustrious in their day my recollection of what i saw here is very dim and confused more so than i anticipated  i remember somewhere within the choir the tomb of edward ii with his effigy upon the top of it in a long robe with a crown on his head and a ball and sceptre in his hand likewise a statue of robert son of the conqueror carved in irish oak and painted  he lolls in an easy posture on his tomb with one leg crossed lightly over the other to denote that he was a crusader  there are several monuments of mitred abbots who formerly presided over the cathedral  a cavalier and his wife with the dress of the period elaborately represented lie side by side in excellent preservation and it is remarkable that though their noses are very prominent they have come down from the past without any wear and tear  the date of the cavaliers death is 1637 and i think his statue could not have been sculptured until after the restoration else he and his dame would hardly have come through cromwells time unscathed here as in all the other churches in england cromwell is said to have stabled his horses and broken the windows and belabored the old monuments  there is one large and beautiful chapel styled the ladys chapel which is indeed a church by itself being ninety feet long and comprising everything that appertains to a place of worship  here too there are monuments and on the floor are many old bricks and tiles with inscriptions on them or gothic devices and flat tombstones with coats of arms sculptured on them as indeed there are everywhere else except in the nave where the new pavement has obliterated them  after viewing the choir and the chapels the young woman led me down into the crypts below where the dead persons who are commemorated in the upper regions were buried  the low ponderous pillars and arches of these crypts are supposed to be older than the upper portions of the building  they are about as perfect i suppose as when new but very damp dreary and darksome and the arches intersect one another so intricately that if the girl had deserted me i might easily have got lost there  these are chapels where masses used to be said for the souls of the deceased and my guide said that a great many skulls and bones had been dug up here no doubt a vast population has been deposited in the course of a thousand years  i saw two white skulls in a niche grinning as skulls always do though it is impossible to see the joke  these crypts or crypts like these are doubtless what congreve calls the aisles and monumental caves of death in that passage which dr johnson admired so much  they are very singularsomething like a dark shadow or dismal repetition of the upper church below ground  ascending from the crypts we went next to the cloisters which are in a very perfect state and form an unbroken square about the green grassplot enclosed within  here also it is said cromwell stabled his horses but if so they were remarkably quiet beasts for tombstones which form the pavement are not broken nor cracked nor bear any hoofmarks  all around the cloisters too the stone tracery that shuts them in like a closed curtain carefully drawn remains as it was in the days of the monks insomuch that it is not easy to get a glimpse of the green enclosure  probably there used to be painted glass in the larger apertures of this stonework otherwise it is perfect  these cloisters are very different from the free open and airy ones of salisbury but they are more in accordance with our notions of monkish habits and even at this day if i were a canon of gloucester i would put that dim ambulatory to a good use  the library is adjacent to the cloisters and i saw some rows of folios and quartos  i have nothing else to record about the cathedral though if i were to stay there a month i suppose it might then begin to be understood  it is wicked to look at these solemn old churches in a hurry  by the by it was not built in a hurry but in full three hundred years having been begun in 1188 and only finished in 1498 not a great many years before papistry began to go out of vogue in england  from gloucester i took the rail for basingstoke before noon  the first part of the journey was through an uncommonly beautiful tract of country hilly but not wild a tender and graceful picturesquenessfine single trees and clumps of trees and sometimes wide woods scattered over the landscape and filling the nooks of the hills with luxuriant foliage old villages scattered frequently along our track looking very peaceful with the peace of past ages lingering about them and a rich rural verdure of antique cultivation everywhere  old countryseatsspecimens of the old english hall or manorhouseappeared on the hillsides with parkscenery surrounding the mansions and the gray churches rose in the midst of all the little towns  the beauty of english scenery makes me desperate it is so impossible to describe it or in any way to record its impression and such a pity to leave it undescribed and moreover i always feel that i do not get from it a hundredth or a millionth part of the enjoyment that there really is in it hurrying past it thus  i was really glad when we rumbled into a tunnel piercing for a long distance through a hill and emerging on the other side we found ourselves in a comparatively level and uninteresting tract of country which lasted till we reached southampton  english scenery to be appreciated and to be reproduced with pen and pencil requires to be dwelt upon long and to be wrought out with the nicest touches  a coarse and hasty brush is not the instrument for such work   july 6thmonday june 30th was a warm and beautiful day and my wife and i took a cab from southampton and drove to    netley abbey   about three or four miles  the remains of the abbey stand in a sheltered place but within view of southampton water and it is a most picturesque and perfect ruin all ivygrown of course and with great trees where the pillars of the nave used to stand and also in the refectory and the cloister court and so much soil on the summit of the broken walls that weeds flourish abundantly there and grass too and there was a wild rosebush in full bloom as much as thirty or forty feet from the ground s and i ascended a winding stair leading up within a round tower the steps much footworn and reaching the top we came forth at the height where a gallery had formerly run round the church in the thickness of the wall  the upper portions of the edifice were now chiefly thrown down but i followed a footpath on the top of the remaining wall quite to the western entrance of the church  since the time when the abbey was taken from the monks it has been private property and the possessor in henry viiis days or subsequently built a residence for himself within its precincts out of the old materials  this has now entirely disappeared all but some unsightly old masonry patched into the original walls  large portions of the ruin have been removed likewise to be used as buildingmaterials elsewhere and this is the abbey mentioned i think by dr watts concerning which a mr william taylor had a dream while he was contemplating pulling it down  he dreamed that a part of it fell upon his head and sure enough a piece of the wall did come down and crush him  in the nave i saw a large mass of conglomerated stone that had fallen from the wall between the nave and cloisters and thought that perhaps this was the very mass that killed poor mr taylor  the ruins are extensive and very interesting but i have put off describing them too long and cannot make a distinct picture of them now moreover except to a spectator skilled in architecture all ruined abbeys are pretty much alike  as we came away we noticed some women making baskets at the entrance and one of them urged us to buy some of her handiwork for that she was the gypsy of netley abbey and had lived among the ruins these thirty years  so i bought one for a shilling  she was a woman with a prominent nose and weathertanned but not very picturesque or striking    to blackheath   on the 6th july we left the villa with our enormous luggage and took our departure from southampton by the noon train  the main street of southampton though it looks pretty fresh and bright must be really antique there being a great many projecting windows in the oldtime style and these make the vista of the street very picturesque  i have no doubt that i missed seeing many things more interesting than the few that i saw  our journey to london was without any remarkable incident and at the waterloo station we found one of mr bennochs clerks under whose guidance we took two cabs for the east kent station at london bridge and there railed to blackheath where we arrived in the afternoon  on thursday i went into london by one of the morning trains and wandered about all dayvisiting the exhibition of the royal academy and westminster abbey and st pauls the two latter of which i have already written about in former journals  on friday s j and i walked over the heath and through the park to greenwich and spent some hours in the hospital  the painted hall struck me much more than at my first view of it it is very beautiful indeed and the effect of its frescoed ceiling most rich and magnificent the assemblage of glowing hues producing a general result of splendor      in the evening i went with mr and mrs  to a conversazione at mrs newton croslands who lives on blackheath     i met with one person who interested memr bailey the author of festus and i was surprised to find myself already acquainted with him  it is the same mr bailey whom i met a few months ago when i first dined at mr sa dark handsome rather picturesquelooking man with a gray beard and dark hair a little dimmed with gray  he is of quiet and very agreeable deportment and i liked him and believed in him     there is sadness glooming out of him but no unkindness nor asperity  mrs croslands conversazione was enriched with a supper and terminated with a dance in which mr  joined with heart and soul but mrs  went to sleep in her chair and i would gladly have followed her example if i could have found a chair to sit upon  in the course of the evening i had some talk with a pale nervous young lady who has been a noted spiritual medium  yesterday i went into town by the steamboat from greenwich to london bridge with a nephew of mr s and calling at his place of business he procured us an order from his winemerchants by means of which we were admitted into    the winevaults of the london docks   we there found parties with an acquaintance who was going with two french gentlemen into the vaults  it is a good deal like going down into a mine each visitor being provided with a lamp at the end of a stick and following the guide along dismal passages running beneath the streets and extending away interminablyroughly arched overhead with stone from which depend festoons of a sort of black fungus caused by the exhalations of the wine  nothing was ever uglier than this fungus it is strange that the most ethereal effervescence of rich wine can produce nothing better  the first series of vaults which we entered were filled with portwine and occupied a space variously estimated at from eleven to sixteen acreswhich i suppose would hold more portwine than ever was made  at any rate the pipes and butts were so thickly piled that in some places we could hardly squeeze past them  we drank from two or three vintages but i was not impressed with any especial excellence in the wine  we were not the only visitors for far in the depths of the vault we passed a gentleman and two young ladies wandering about like the ghosts of defunct winebibhers in a tophet specially prepared for then  people employed here sometimes go astray and their lamps being extinguished they remain long in this everlasting gloom  we went likewise to the vaults of sherrywine which have the same characteristics as those just described but are less extensive  it is no guaranty for the excellence or even for the purity of the wine that it is kept in these cellars under the lock and key of the government for the merchants are allowed to mix different vintages according to their own pleasure and to adulterate it as they like  very little of the wine probably comes out as it goes in or is exactly what it pretends to be  i went back to mr s office and we drove together to make some calls jointly and separately  i went alone to mrs heywoods afterwards with mr  to the american ministers whom we found at home and i requested of him on the part of the americans at liverpool to tell me the facts about the american gentleman being refused admittance to the levee  the ambassador did not seem to me to make his point good for having withdrawn with the rejected guest   july 9th our weddingdaywe were invited yesterday evening to mrs s c halls where jenny lind was to sing so we left blackheath at about eight oclock in a brougham and reached ashley place as the dusk was gathering after nine  the halls reside in a handsome suite of apartments arranged on the new system of flats each story constituting a separate tenement and the various families having an entrancehall in common  the plan is borrowed from the continent and seems rather alien to the traditionary habits of the english though no doubt a good degree of seclusion is compatible with it  mr hall received us with the greatest cordiality before we entered the drawingroom  mrs hall too greeted us with most kindly warmth  jenny lind had not yet arrived but i found dr mackay there and i was introduced to miss catherine sinclair who is a literary lady though none of her works happen to be known to me  soon the servant announced madam goldschmidt and this famous lady made her appearance looking quite different from what i expected  mrs hall established her in the inner drawingroom where was a piano and a harp and shortly after our hostess came to me and said that madam goldschmidt wished to be introduced to me  there was a gentle peremptoriness in the summons that made it something like being commanded into the presence of a princess a great favor no doubt but yet a little humbling to the recipient  however i acquiesced with due gratitude and was presented accordingly  she made room for me on the sofa and i sat down and began to talk  jenny lind is rather tallquite tall for a womancertainly no beauty but with sense and selfreliance in her aspect and manners  she was suffering under a severe cold and seemed worn down besides so probably i saw her under disadvantages  her conversation is quite simple and i should have great faith in her sincerity and there is about her the manner of a person who knows the world and has conquered it  she said something or other about the scarlet letter and on my part i paid her such compliments as a man could pay who had never heard her sing     her conversational voice is an agreeable one rather deep and not particularly smooth  she talked about america and of our unwholesome modes of life as to eating and exercise and of the illhealth especially of our women but i opposed this view as far as i could with any truth insinuating my opinion that we are about as healthy as other people and affirming for a certainty that we live longer  in good faith so far as i have any knowledge of the matter the women of england are as generally out of health as those of america always something has gone wrong with them and as for jenny lind she looks wan and worn enough to be an american herself  this charge of illhealth is almost universally brought forward against us nowadaysand taking the whole country together i do not believe the statistics will bear it out  the rooms which were respectably filled when we arrived were now getting quite full  i saw mr stevens the american man of libraries and had some talk with him and durham the sculptor and mr and mrs hall introduced me to various people some of whom were of notefor instance sir emerson tennent a man of the world of some parliamentary distinction wearing a star mr samuel lover a most goodnatured pleasant irishman with a shining and twinkling visage miss jewsbury whom i found very conversable  she is known in literature but not to me  we talked about emerson whom she seems to have been well acquainted with while he was in england and she mentioned that miss martineau had given him a lock of hair it was not her own hair but a mummys  after our return mrs  told us that miss jewsbury had written among other things three histories and as she asked me to introduce her to s and means to cultivate our acquaintance it would be well to know something of them  we were told that she is now employed in some literary undertaking of lady morgans who at the age of ninety is still circulating in society and is as brisk in faculties as ever  i should like to see her ladyship that is i should not be sorry to see her for distinguished people are so much on a par with others socially that it would be foolish to be overjoyed at seeing anybody whomsoever  leaving out the illustrious jenny lind i suspect that i was myself the greatest lion of the evening for a good many persons sought the felicity of knowing me and had little or nothing to say when that honor and happiness was conferred on them  it is surely very wrong and illmannered in people to ask for an introduction unless they are prepared to make talk it throws too great an expense and trouble on the wretched lion who is compelled on the spur of the moment to convert a conversable substance out of thin air perhaps for the twentieth time that evening  i am sure i did not sayand i think i did not hear said one rememberable word in the course of this visit though nevertheless it was a rather agreeable one  in due season ices and jellies were handed about and some ladies and gentlemenprofessional perhapswere kind enough to sing songs and play on the piano and harp while persons in remote corners went on with whatever conversation they had in hand then came supper but there were so many people to go into the supperroom that we could not all crowd thither together and coming late i got nothing but some spongecake and a glass of champagne neither of which i care for  after supper mr lover sang some irish songs his own in music and words with rich humorous effect to which the comicality of his face contributed almost as much as his voice and words  the lord mayor looked in for a little while and though a hardfeatured jew enough was the most picturesque person there   july 10thmrs heywood had invited me to dinner last evening     her house is very finely situated overlooking hyde park and not a great way from where tyburn tree used to stand  when i arrived there were no guests but mr and mrs d but by and by came mr monckton milnes and lady the bishop of lichfield mr tom taylor mr ewart m p sir somebody somerville mr and mrs musgrave and others  mr milnes whom i had not seen for more than a year greeted me very cordially and so did mr taylor  i took mrs musgrave in to dinner  she is an irish lady and mrs heywood had recommended her to me as being very conversable but i had a good deal more talk with mrs m with whom i was already acquainted than with her  mrs m is of noble blood and therefore not snobbishquite unaffected gentle sweet and easy to get on with reminding me of the bestmannered american women  but how can anything characteristic be said or done among a dozen people sitting at table in full dress  speaking of full dress the bishop wore smallclothes and silk stockings and entered the drawingroom with a threecornered hat which he kept flattened out under his arm  he asked the briefest blessing possible and sitting at the ultra end of the table i heard nothing further from him till he officiated as briefly before the cloth was withdrawn  mrs m talked about tennyson with whom her husband was at the university and whom he continues to know intimately  she says that he considers maud his best poem  he now lives in the isle of wight spending all the year round there and has recently bought the place on which he resides  she was of opinion that he would have been gratified by my calling on him which i had wished to do while we were at southampton but this is a liberty which i should hardly venture upon with a shy man like tennysonmore especially as he might perhaps suspect me of doing it on the score of my own literary character  but i should like much to see him  mr tom taylor during dinner made some fun for the benefit of the ladies on either side of him  i liked him very well this evening  when the ladies had not long withdrawn and after the wine had once gone round i asked mr heywood to make my apologies to mrs heywood and took leave all london lying betwixt me and the london bridge station where i was to take the rail homeward  at the station i found mr bennoch who had been dining with the lord mayor to meet sir william williams and we railed to greenwich and reached home by midnight  mr and mrs bennoch have set out on their continental journey todayleaving us for a little space in possession of what will be more like a home than anything that we shall hereafter find in england  this afternoon i had taken up the fourth volume of jerdans autobiographywretched twaddle though it records such constant and apparently intimate intercourse with distinguished peopleand was reading it between asleep and awake on the sofa when mr jerdan himself was announced  i saw him in company with mr bennoch nearly three years ago at rock park and wondered then what there was in so uncouth an individual to get him so freely into polished society  he now looks rougher than evertimeworn but not reverend a thatch of gray hair on his head an imperfect set of false teeth a careless apparel checked trousers and a stick for he had walked a mile or two from his own dwelling  i suspectand long practice at the consulate has made me keensighted that mr jerdan contemplated some benefit from my purse and to the extent of a sovereign or so i would not mind contributing to his comfort  he spoke of a secret purpose of mr  and himself to obtain me a degree or diploma in some literary institutionwhat one i know not and did not ask but the honor cannot be a high one if this poor old fellow can do aught towards it  i am afraid he is a very disreputable senior but certainly not the less to be pitied on that account and there was something very touching in his stiff and infirm movement as he resumed his stick and took leave waving me a courteous farewell and turning upon me a smile grim with age as he went down the steps  in that gesture and smile i fancied some trace of the polished man of society such as he may have once been though time and hard weather have roughened him as they have the once polished marble pillars which i saw so rude in aspect at netley abbey  speaking of dickens last evening mr  mentioned his domestic tasteshow he preferred home enjoyments to all others and did not willingly go much into society  mrs  too the other day told us of his taking on himself all possible trouble as regards his domestic affairs     there is a great variety of testimony various and varied as to the character of dickens  i must see him before i finally leave england   july 13thon friday morning 11th at nine oclock i took the rail into town to breakfast with mr milnes  as he had named a little after ten as the hour i could not immediately proceed to his house and so walked moderately over london bridge and into the city meaning to take a cab from charing cross or thereabouts  passing through some street or other contiguous to cheapside i saw in a courtyard the entrance to the guildhall and stepped in to look at it  it is a spacious hall about one hundred and fifty feet long and perhaps half as broad paved with flagstones which look worn and some of them cracked across the roof is very lofty and was once vaulted but has been shaped anew in modern times  there is a vast window partly filled with painted glass extending quite along each end of the hall and a row of arched windows on either side throwing their light from far above downward upon the pavement  this fashion of high windows not reaching within twenty or thirty feet of the floor serves to give great effect to the large enclosed space of an antique hall  against the walls are several marble monuments one to the earl of chatham a statue of white marble with various allegorical contrivances fronting an obelisk or pyramid of dark marble and another to his son william pitt of somewhat similar design and of equal size each of them occupying the whole space i believe between pavement and ceiling  there is likewise a statue of beckford a famous lord mayorthe most famous except whittington and that one who killed wat tyler and like those two his fame is perhaps somewhat mythological though he lived and bustled within less than a century  he is said to have made a bold speech to the king but this i will not believe of any englishmanat least of any plebeian englishmanuntil i hear it  but there stands his statue in the guildhall in the act of making his speech as if the monstrous attempt had petrified him  lord nelson too has a monument and so i think has some other modern worthy  at one end of the hall under one of the great painted windows stand three or four old statues of mediaeval kings whose identities i forget and in the two corners of the opposite end are two gigantic absurdities of painted wood with grotesque visages whom i quickly recognized as gog and magog  they stand each on a pillar and seem to be about fifteen feet high and look like enormous playthings for the children of giants and it is strange to see them in this solemn old hall among the memorials of dead heroes and statesmen  there is an annual banquet in the guildhall given by the lord mayor and sheriffs and i believe it is the very acme of civic feasting  after viewing the hall as it still lacked something of ten i continued my walk through that entanglement of city streets and quickly found myself getting beyond my reckoning  i cannot tell whither i went but i passed through a very dirty region and i remember a long narrow evilodored street cluttered up with stalls in which were vegetables and little bits of meat for sale and there was a frowzy multitude of buyers and sellers  still i blundered on and was getting out of the density of the city into broader streets but still shabby ones when looking at my watch i found it to be past ten and no cabstand within sight  it was a quarter past when i finally got into one and the driver told me that it would take half an hour to go from thence to upper brook street so that i was likely to exceed the license implied in mr milness invitation  whether i was quite beyond rule i cannot say but it did not lack more than ten minutes of eleven when i was ushered up stairs and i found all the company assembled  however it is of little consequence except that if i had come early i should have been introduced to many of the guests whom now i could only know across the table  mrs milnes greeted me very kindly and mr milnes came towards me with an elderly gentleman in a blue coat and gray pantaloonswith a long rather thin homely visage exceedingly shaggy eyebrows though no great weight of brow and thin gray hair and introduced me to the marquis of lansdowne  the marquis had his right hand wrapped up in a blacksilk handkerchief so he gave me his left and from some awkwardness in meeting it when i expected the right i gave him only three of my fingersa thing i never did before to any person and it is droll that i should have done it to a marquis  he addressed me with great simplicity and natural kindness complimenting me on my works and speaking about the society of liverpool in former days  lord lansdowne was the friend of moore and has about him the aroma communicated by the memories of many illustrious people with whom he has associated  mr ticknor the historian of spanish literature now greeted me  mr milnes introduced me to mrs browning and assigned her to me to conduct into the breakfastroom  she is a small delicate woman with ringlets of dark hair a pleasant intelligent and sensitive face and a low agreeable voice  she looks youthful and comely and is very gentle and ladylike  and so we proceeded to the breakfastroom which is hung round with pictures and in the middle of it stood a large round table worthy to have been king arthurs and here we seated ourselves without any question of precedence or ceremony  on one side of me was an elderly lady with a very fine countenance and in the course of breakfast i discovered her to be the mother of florence nightingale  one of her daughters not florence was likewise present  mrs milnes mrs browning mrs nightingale and her daughter were the only ladies at table and i think there were as many as eight or ten gentlemen whose namesas i came so latei was left to find out for myself or to leave unknown  it was a pleasant and sociable meal and thanks to my cold beef and coffee at home i had no occasion to trouble myself much about the fare so i just ate some delicate chicken and a very small cutlet and a slice of dry toast and thereupon surceased from my labors  mrs browning and i talked a good deal during breakfast for she is of that quickly appreciative and responsive order of women with whom i can talk more freely than with any man and she has besides her own originality wherewith to help on conversation though i should say not of a loquacious tendency  she introduced the subject of spiritualism which she says interests her very much indeed she seems to be a believer mr browning she told me utterly rejects the subject and will not believe even in the outward manifestations of which there is such overwhelming evidence  we also talked of miss bacon and i developed something of that ladys theory respecting shakespeare greatly to the horror of mrs browning and that of her next neighbora nobleman whose name i did not hear  on the whole i like her the better for loving the man shakespeare with a personal love  we talked too of margaret fuller who spent her last night in italy with the brownings and of william story with whom they have been intimate and who mrs browning says is much stirred about spiritualism  really i cannot help wondering that so fine a spirit as hers should not reject the matter till at least it is forced upon her  i like her very much  mrs nightingale had been talking at first with lord lansdowne who sat next her but by and by she turned to nee and began to speak of london smoke   then there being a discussion about lord byron on the other side of the table she spoke to me about lady byron whom she knows intimately characterizing her as a most excellent and exemplary person highprincipled unselfish and now devoting herself to the care of her two grandchildrentheir mother byrons daughter being dead  lady byron she says writes beautiful verses  somehow or other all this praise and more of the same kind gave me an idea of an intolerably irreproachable person and i asked mrs nightingale if lady byron were warmhearted  with some hesitation or mental reservationat all events not quite outspokenlyshe answered that she was  i was too much engaged with these personal talks to attend much to what was going on elsewhere but all through breakfast i had been more and more impressed by the aspect of one of the guests sitting next to milnes  he was a man of large presencea portly personage grayhaired but scarcely as yet aged and his face had a remarkable intelligence not vivid nor sparkling but conjoined with great quietudeand if it gleamed or brightened at one time more than another it was like the sheen over a broad surface of sea  there was a somewhat careless selfpossession large and broad enough to be called dignity and the more i looked at him the more i knew that he was a distinguished person and wondered who  he might have been a minister of state only there is not one of them who has any right to such a face and presence at lasti do not know how the conviction camebut i became aware that it was macaulay and began to see some slight resemblance to his portraits  but i have never seen any that is not wretchedly unworthy of the original  as soon as i knew him i began to listen to his conversation but he did not talk a great deal contrary to his usual custom for i am told he is apt to engross all the talk to himself probably he may have been restrained by the presence of ticknor and mr palfrey who were among his auditors and interlocutors and as the conversation seemed to turn much on american subjects he could not well have assumed to talk them down  i am glad to have seen hima face fit for a scholar a man of the world a cultivated intelligence  after we left the table and went into the library mr browning introduced himself to mea younger man than i expected to see handsome with brown hair  he is very simple and agreeable in manner gently impulsive talking as if his heart were uppermost  he spoke of his pleasure in meeting me and his appreciation of my books andwhich has not often happened to mementioned that the blithedale romance was the one he admired most  i wonder why  i hope i showed as much pleasure at his praise as he did at mine for i was glad to see how pleasantly it moved him  after this i talked with ticknor and miles and with mr palfrey to whom i had been introduced very long ago by george hillard and had never seen him since  we looked at some autographs of which mr milnes has two or three large volumes  i recollect a leaf from swifts journal to stella a letter from addison one from chatterton in a most neat and legible hand and a characteristic sentence or two and signature of oliver cromwell written in a religious book  there were many curious volumes in the library but i had not time to look at them  i liked greatly the manners of almost allyes as far as i observed all the people at this breakfast and it was doubtless owing to their being all people either of high rank or remarkable intellect or both an englishman can hardly be a gentleman unless he enjoy one or other of these advantages and perhaps the surest way to give him good manners is to make a lord of him or rather of his grandfather or greatgrandfather in the third generation scarcely sooner he will be polished into simplicity and elegance and his deportment will be all the better for the homely material out of which it is wrought and refined  the marquis of lansdowne for instance would have been a very commonplace man in the common ranks of life but it has done him good to be a nobleman  not that his tact is quite perfect  in going up to breakfast he made me precede him in returning to the library he did the same although i drew back till he impelled me up the first stair with gentle persistence  by insisting upon it he showed his sense of condescension much more than if when he saw me unwilling to take precedence he had passed forward as if the point were not worth either asserting or yielding  heaven knows it was in no humility that i would have trodden behind him  but he is a kind old man and i am willing to believe of the english aristocracy generally that they are kind and of beautiful deportment for certainly there never can have been mortals in a position more advantageous for becoming so  i hope there will come a time when we shall be so and i already know a few americans whose noble and delicate manners may compare well with any i have seen  i left the house with mr palfrey  he has cone to england to make some researches in the state paper office for the purposes of a work which he has in hand  he mentioned to me a letter which he had seen written from new england in the time of charles ii and referring to the order sent by the minister of that day for the appearance of governor bellingham and my ancestor on this side of the water  the signature of this letter is an anagram of my ancestors name  the letter itself is a very bold and able one controverting the propriety of the measure above indicated and mr palfrey feels certain that it was written by my aforesaid ancestor  i mentioned my wish to ascertain the place in england whence the family emigrated and mr palfrey took me to the record office and introduced me to mr joseph huntera venerable and courteous gentleman of antiquarian pursuits  the office was odorous of musty parchments hundreds of years old  mr hunter received me with great kindness and gave me various old records and rolls of parchment in which to seek for my family name but i was perplexed with the crabbed characters and soon grew weary and gave up the quest  he says that it is very seldom that an american family springing from the early settlers can be satisfactorily traced back to their english ancestry   july 16thmonday morning i took the rail from blackheath to london  it is a very pleasant place blackheath and far more rural than one would expect within five or six miles of londona great many trees making quite a mass of foliage in the distance green enclosures pretty villas with their nicely kept lawns and gardens with grassplots and flower borders and village streets set along the sidewalks with ornamental trees and the houses standing a little back and separated one from anotherall this within what is called the park which has its gateways and the sort of semiprivacy with which i first became acquainted at rock park  from the london bridge station i took a cab for paddington and then had to wait above two hours before a train started for birkenhead  meanwhile i walked a little about the neighborhood which is very dull and uninteresting made up of crescents and terraces and rows of houses that have no individuality and secondrate shopsin short the outskirts of the vast city when it begins to have a kind of village character but no rurality or sylvan aspect as at blackheath  my journey when at last we started was quite unmarked by incident and extremely tedious it being a slow train which plods on without haste and without rest  at about ten oclock we reached birkenhead and there crossed the familiar and detestable mersey which as usual had a cloudy sky brooding over it mrs blodgett received me most hospitably but was impelled by an overflow of guests to put me into a little back room looking into the court and formerly occupied by my predecessor general armstrong     she expressed a hope that i might not see his ghostnor have i as yet  speaking of ghosts mr h a b told me a singular story today of an apparition that haunts the times office in printinghouse square  a mr w is the engineer of the establishment and has his residence in the edifice which is built i believe on the site of merchant taylors schoolan old house that was no longer occupied for its original purpose and being supposed haunted was left untenanted  the fatherinlaw of mr w an old seacaptain came on a visit to him and his wife and was put into their guestchamber where he passed the night  the next morning assigning no very satisfactory reason he cut his visit short and went away  shortly afterwards a young lady came to visit the ws but she too went away the next morninggoing first to make a call as she said to a friend and sending thence for her trunks  mrs w wrote to this young lady asking an explanation the young lady replied and gave a singular account of an apparition how she was awakened in the night by a bright light shining through the window which was parallel to the bed then if i remember rightly her curtains were withdrawn and a shape looked in upon hera womans shape she called it but it was a skeleton with lambent flames playing about its bones and in and out among the ribs  other persons have since slept in this chamber and some have seen the shape others not  mr w has slept there himself without seeing anything  he has had investigations by scientific people apparently under the idea that the phenomenon might have been caused by some of the timess workpeople playing tricks on the magiclantern principle but nothing satisfactory has thus far been elucidated  mr b had this story from mrs gaskell     supposing it a ghost nothing else is so remarkable as its choosing to haunt the precincts of the times newspaper   july 29thon saturday 26th i took the rail from the lime street station for london via the trent valley and reached blackheath in the evening      sunday morning my wife and i with j railed into london and drove to the essex street chapel where mr channing was to preach  the chapel is the same where priestley and belsham used to preachone of the plainest houses of worship i was ever in as simple and undecorated as the faith there inculcated  they retain however all the form and ceremonial of the english established church though so modified as to meet the doctrinal views of the unitarians  there may be good sense in this inasmuch as it greatly lessens the ministerial labor to have a stated form of prayer instead of a necessity for extempore outpourings but it must be i should think excessively tedious to the congregation especially as having made alterations in these prayers they cannot attach much idea of sanctity to them  here follows a long record of mr hawthornes visit to miss bacon condensed in our old hone in the paper called recollections of a gifted woman   august 2don wednesday 30th july we went to marlborough house to see the vernon gallery of pictures  they are the works almost entirely of english artists of the last and present century and comprise many famous paintings and i must acknowledge that i had more enjoyment of them than of those portions of the national gallery which i had before seen including specimens of the grand old masters  my comprehension has not reached their height  i think nothing pleased me more than a picture by sir david wilkiethe parish beadle with a vagrant boy and a monkey in custody it is exceedingly good and true throughout and especially the monkeys face is a wonderful production of genius condensing within itself the whole moral and pathos of the picture  marlborough house was the residence of the great duke and is to be that of the prince of wales when another place is found for the pictures  it adjoins st jamess palace  in its present state it is not a very splendid mansion the rooms being small though handsomely shaped with vaulted ceilings and carved whitemarble fireplaces  i left s here after an hour or two and walked forth into the hot and busy city with j     i called at routledges bookshop in hopes to make an arrangement with him about miss bacons business  but routledge himself is making a journey in the north and neither of the partners was there so that i shall have to go thither some other day  then we stepped into st pauls cathedral to cool ourselves and it was delightful so to escape from the sunny sultry turmoil of fleet street and ludgate and find ourselves at once in this remote solemn shadowy seclusion marblecool  o that we had cathedrals in america were it only for the sensuous luxury  we strolled round the cathedral and i delighted j much by pointing out the monuments of three british generals who were slain in america in the last warthe naughty and bloodthirsty little man  we then went to guildhall where i thought j would like to see gog and magog but he had never heard of those illustrious personages and took no interest in them     but truly i am grateful to the piety of former times for raising this vast cool canopy of marble st pauls in the midst of the feverish city  i wandered quite round it and saw in a remote corner a monument to the officers of the coldstream guards slain in the crimea  it was a mural tablet with the names of the officers on an escutcheon and two privates of the guards in marble basrelief were mourning over them  over the tablet hung two silken banners new and glossy with the battles in which the regiment has been engaged inscribed on themnot merely crimean but peninsular battles  these banners will bang there till they drop away in tatters  after thus refreshing myself in the cathedral i went again to routledges in farrington street and saw one of the firm  he expressed great pleasure at seeing me as indeed he might having published and sold without any profit on my part uncounted thousands of my books  i introduced the subject of miss bacons work and he expressed the utmost willingness to do everything in his power towards bringing it before the world but thought that his firmit being their business to publish for the largest circle of readerswas not the most eligible for the publication of such a book  very likely this may be so  at all events however i am to send him the manuscript and he will at least give me his advice and assistance in finding a publisher  he was good enough to express great regret that i had no work of my own to give him for publication and truly i regret it too since being a resident in england i could now have all the publishing privileges of a native author  he presented me with a copy of an illustrated edition of longfellows poems and i took my leave  thence i went to the picture gallery at the british institution where there are three rooms full of paintings by the first masters the property of private persons  every one of them no doubt was worth studying for a long long time and i suppose i may have given on an average a minute to each  what an absurdity it would seem to pretend to read two or three hundred poems of all degrees between an epic and a ballad in an hour or two  and a picture is a poem only requiring the greater study to be felt and comprehended because the spectator must necessarily do much for himself towards that end  i saw many beautiful thingsamong them some landscapes by claude which to the eye were like the flavor of a rich ripe melon to the palate   august 7thyesterday we took the rail for london it being a fine sunny day though not so very warm as many of the preceding days have been     we went along piccadilly as far as the egyptian hall  it is quite remarkable how comparatively quiet the town has become now that the season is over  one can see the difference in all the region west of temple bar and indeed either the hot weather or some other cause seems to have operated in assuaging the turmoil in the city itself  i never saw london bridge so little thronged as yesterday  at the egyptian hall or in the same edifice there is a gallery of pictures the property of lord ward who allows the public to see them five days of the week without any trouble or restrictiona great kindness on his lordships part it must be owned  it is a very valuable collection i presume containing specimens of many famous old masters some of the early and hard pictures by raphael and his master and fellowpupilsvery curious and nowise beautiful a perfect sunny glimpse of venice by canaletto and saints and scriptural allegorical and mythological people by titian guido correggio and many more names than i can remember  there is likewise a dead magdalen by canova and a venus by the same very pretty and with a vivid light of joyous expression in her face     also powerss greek slave in which i see little beauty or merit and two or three other statues  we then drove to ashley place to call on mrs s c hall whom we found at home  in fact wednesday is her receptionday although as now everybody is out of town we were the only callers  she is an agreeable and kindly woman  she told us that her husband and herself propose going to america next year and i heartily wish they may meet with a warm and friendly reception  i have been seldom more assured of the existence of a heart than in her also a good deal of sentiment  she had been visiting bessie the widow of moore at sloperton and gave s a rose from his cottage  such things are very true and unaffected in her  the only wonder is that she has not lost such girlish freshness of feeling as prompts them  we did not see mr hall he having gone to the crystal palace  taking our leave we returned along victoria streeta new street penetrating through what was recently one of the worst parts of the town and now bordered with large blocks of buildings in a dreary halffinished state and left so for want of fundstill we came to westminster abbey  we went in and spent an hour there wandering all round the nave and aisles admiring the grand old edifice itself but finding more to smile at than to admire in the monuments     the interior view of the abbey is better than can be described the heart aches as one gazes at it for lack of power and breadth enough to take its beauty and grandeur in  the effect was heightened by the sun shining through the painted window in the western end and by the bright sunshine that came through the open portal and lay on the pavementthat space so bright the rest of the vast floor so solemn and sombre  at the western end in a corner from which spectators are barred out there is a statue of wordsworth which i do not recollect seeing at any former visit  its only companion in the same nook is popes friend secretary craggs  downing street that famous official precinct took its name from sir george downing who was proprietor or lessee of property there  he was a native of my own old native town and his descendants still reside therecollateral descendants i supposeand follow the drygoods business drapers   august 10thi journeyed to liverpool via chester     one sees a variety of climate temperature and season in a ride of two hundred miles north and south through england  near london for instance the grain was reaped and stood in sheaves in the stubblefields over which girls and children might be seen gleaning farther north the golden or greenishgolden crops were waving in the wind  in one part of our way the atmosphere was hot and dry at another point it had been cooled and refreshed by a heavy thundershower the pools of which still lay along our track  it seems to me that local varieties of weather are more common in this island and within narrower precincts than in america     i never saw england of such a dusky and dusty green beforealmost sunbrowned indeed  sometimes the green hedges formed a marked framework to a broad sheet of golden grainfield  as we drew near oxford just before reaching the station i had a good view of its domes towers and spiresbetter i think than when j and i rambled through the town a month or two ago  mr frank scott haydon of the record office london writes me that he has found a henry atte hawthorne on a roll which he is transcribing of the first edward iii  he belonged to the parish of aldremeston in the hundred of blakenhurste worcester county   august 21styesterday at twelve oclock i took the steamer for runcorn from the pierhead  in the streets i had noticed that it was a breezy day but on the river there was a very stiff breeze from the northeast right ahead blowing directly in our face the whole way and truly this river mersey is never without a breeze and generally in the direction of its coursean eviltempered unkindly blustering wind that you cannot meet without being exasperated by it  as it came straight against us it was impossible to find a shelter anywhere on deck except it were behind the stovepipe and besides the day was overcast and threatening rain  i have undergone very miserable hours on the mersey where in the space of two years i voyaged thousands of milesand this trip to runcorn reminded me of them though it was less disagreeable after more than a twelvemonths respite  we had a good many passengers on board most of whom were of the second class and congregated on the forward deck more women than men i think and some of them with their husbands and children  several produced lunch and bottles and refreshed themselves very soon after we started  by and by the wind became so disagreeable that i went below and sat in the cabin only occasionally looking out to get a peep at the shores of the river which i had never before seen above eastham  however they are not worth looking at level and monotonous without trees or beauty of any kindhere and there a village and a modern church on the low ridge behind perhaps a windmill which the gusty day had set busily to work  the river continues very wideno river indeed but an estuaryduring almost the whole distance to runcorn and nearly at the end of our voyage we approached some abrupt and prominent hills which many a time i have seen on my passages to rock ferry looking blue and dim and serving for prophets of the weather for when they can be distinctly seen adown the river it is a token of coming rain  we met many vessels and passed many which were beating up against the wind and which keeled over so that their decks must have dippedschooners and vessels that come from the bridgewater canal  we shipped a sea ourselves which gave the foredeck passengers a wetting  before reaching runcorn we stopped to land some passengers at another little port where there was a pier and a lighthouse and a church within a few yards of the riversidea good many of the rivercraft too in dock forming quite a crowd of masts  about ten minutes further steaming brought us to runcorn where were two or three tall manufacturing chimneys with a pennant of black smoke from each two vessels of considerable size on the stocks a church or two and a meagre uninteresting shabby brickbuilt town rising from the edge of the river with irregular streetsnot villagelike but paved and looking like a dwarfed stunted city  i wandered through it till i came to a tall highpedestalled windmill on the outer verge the vans of which were going briskly round  thence retracing my steps i stopped at a poor hotel and took lunch and finding that i was in time to take the steamer back i hurried on board and we set sail or steam before three  i have heard of an old castle at runcorn but could discover nothing of it  it was well that i returned so promptly for we had hardly left the pier before it began to rain and there was a heavy downfall throughout the voyage homeward  runcorn is fourteen miles from liverpool and is the farthest point to which a steamer runs  i had intended to come home by raila circuitous routebut the advice of the landlady of the hotel and the aspect of the weather and a feeling of general discouragement prevented me  an incident in s c halls ireland of a stone cross buried in cromwells time to prevent its destruction by his soldiers  it was forgotten and became a mere doubtful tradition but one old man had been told by his father and he by his father etc that it was buried near a certain spot and at last two hundred years after the cross was buried the vicar of the parish dug in that spot and found it  in my english romance an american might bring the tradition from over the sea and so discover the cross which had been altogether forgotten   august 24thday before yesterday i took the rail for southporta cool generally overcast day with glimmers of faint sunshine  the ride is through a most uninteresting tract of country at first glimpses of the river with the thousands of masts in the docks the dismal outskirts of a great town still spreading onward with beginnings of streets and insulated brick buildings and blocks farther on a wide monotony of level plain and here and there a village and a church almost always a windmill in sight there being plenty of breeze to turn its vans on this windy coast  the railway skirts along the sea the whole distance but is shut out from the sight of it by the low sandhills which seem to have been heaped up by the waves  there are one or two lighthouses on the shore  i have not seen a drearier landscape even in lancashire  reaching southport at three i rambled about with a view to discover whether it be a suitable residence for my family during september  it is a large village or rather more than a village which seems to be almost entirely made up of lodginghouses and at any rate has been built up by the influx of summer visitorsa sandy soil level and laid out with wellpaved streets the principal of which are enlivened with bazaars markets shops hotels of various degrees and a showy vivacity of aspect  there are a great many donkeycarriageslarge vehicles drawn by a pair of donkeys bathchairs with invalid ladies refreshmentrooms in great numbersa place where everybody seems to be a transitory guest nobody at home  the main street leads directly down to the seashore along which there is an elevated embankment with a promenade on the top and seats and the toll of a penny  the shore itself the tide being then low stretched out interminably seaward a wide waste of glistering sands and on the dry border people were riding on donkeys with the drivers whipping behind and children were digging with their little wooden spades and there were donkeycarriages far out on the sandsa pleasant and breezy drive  a whole city of bathingmachines was stationed near the shore and i saw others in the seaward distance the seaair was refreshing and exhilarating and if s needs a seaside residence i should think this might do as well as any other  i saw a large brick edifice enclosed within a wall and with somewhat the look of an almshouse or hospital and it proved to be an infirmary charitably established for the reception of poor invalids who need seaair and cannot afford to pay for it  two or three of such persons were sitting under its windows  i do not think that the visitors of southport are generally of a very opulent class but of the middle rank from manchester and other parts of this northern region  the lodginghouses however are of sufficiently handsome style and arrangement    oxford   mr hawthorne extracted from his recorded oxford experiences his excursion to blenheim but left his observations of the town itself untouchedand these i now transcribeed   august 31st    yesterday we took the rail for london and drove across the city to the paddington station where we met bennoch and set out with him for oxford  i do not quite understand the matter but it appears that we were expected guests of mr spiers a very hospitable gentleman and exmayor of oxford and a friend of bennoch and of the halls  mr s c hall met us at the oxford station and under his guidance we drove to a quiet comfortable house in st giles street where rooms had been taken for us  durham the sculptor is likewise of the party  after establishing ourselves at these lodgings we walked forth to take a preliminary glimpse of the city and mr hall being familiar with the localities served admirably as a guide  if i remember aright i spoke very slightingly of the exterior aspect of oxford as i saw it with j during an hour or twos stay here on my way to southampton to meet s on her return from lisbon  i am bound to say that my impressions are now very different and that i find oxford exceedingly picturesque and rich in beauty and grandeur and in antique stateliness i do not remember very particularly what we sawtimeworn fronts of famous colleges and halls of learning everywhere about the streets and arched entrances passing through which we saw bits of sculpture from monkish handsthe most grotesque and ludicrous faces as if the slightest whim of these old carvers took shape in stone the material being so soft and manageable by them an ancient stone pulpit in the quadrangle of maudlin college magdalen one of only three now extant in england a splendidno not splendid but dimly magnificentchapel belonging to the same college with painted windows of rare beauty not brilliant with diversified hues but of a sombre tint  in this chapel there is an alabaster monumenta recumbent figure of the founders father as large as lifewhich though several centuries old is as well preserved as if fresh from the chisel  in the high street which i suppose is the noblest old street in england mr hall pointed out the crown inn where shakespeare used to spend the night and was most hospitably welcomed by the pretty hostess the mother of sir william davenant on his passage between stratford and london  it is a threestory house with other houses contiguousan old timber mansion though now plastered and painted of a yellowish line the groundfloor is occupied as a shoeshop but the rest of the house is still kept as a tavern      it is not now term time and oxford loses one of its most characteristic features by the absence of the gownsmen but still there is a good deal of liveliness in the streets  we walked as far as a bridge beyond maudlin college and then drove homeward  at six we went to dine with the hospitable exmayor across the wide treebordered street for his house is nearly opposite our lodgings  he is an intelligent and gentlemanly person and was mayor two years ago and has done a great deal to make peace between the university and the town heretofore bitterly inimical  his house is adorned with pictures and drawings and he has an especial taste for art     the dinnertable was decorated with pieces of plate vases and other things which were presented to him as tokens of public or friendly regard and approbation of his action in the mayoralty  after dinner too he produced a large silver snuffbox which had been given him on the same account in fact the inscription affirmed that it was one of five pieces of plate so presented  the vases are really splendidone of them two feet high and richly ornamented  it will hold five or six bottles of wine and he said that it had been filled and i believe sent round as a lovingcup at some of his entertainments  he cordially enjoys these things and his genuine benevolence produces all this excellent hospitality     but bennoch proposed a walk and we set forth  we rambled pretty extensively about the streets sometimes seeing the shapes of old edifices dimly and doubtfully it being an overcast night or catching a partial view of a gray wall or a pillar or a gothic archway by lamplight     the clock had some time ago struck eleven when we were passing under a long extent of antique wall and towers which were those of baliol college  mr d led us into the middle of the street and showed us a cross which was paved into it on a level with the rest of the road  this was the spot where latimer and ridley and another bishop were martyred in bloody marys time  there is a memorial to them in another street but this where i set my foot at nearly midnight was the very spot where their flesh burned to ashes and their bones whitened  it has been a most beautiful morning and i have seen few pleasanter scenes than this street in which we lodge with its spacious breadth its two rows of fine old trees with sidewalks as wide as the whole width of some streets and on the opposite side the row of houses some of them ancient with picturesque gables partially disclosed through the intervening foliage     from our window we have a slantwise glimpse to the right of the walls of st johns college and the general aspect of st giles  it is of an antiquity not to shame those mediaeval halls  our own lodgings are in a house that seems to be very old with panelled walls and beams across the ceilings latticewindows in the chambers and a musty odor such as old houses inevitably have  nevertheless everything is extremely neat clean and comfortable and in term time our apartments are occupied by a mr stebbing whose father is known in literature by some critical writings and who is a graduate and an admirable scholar  there is a bookcase of five shelves containing his books mostly standard works and indicating a safe and solid taste  after lunch today we that is mrs hall her adopted daughter s and i with the exmayor set forth in an open barouche to see the remarkables of oxford while the rest of the guests went on foot  we first drew up at new college a strange name for such an old place but it was new some time since the conquest and went through its quiet and sunny quadrangles and into its sunny and shadowy gardens  i am in despair about the architecture and old edifices of these oxford colleges it is so impossible to express them in words  they are themselvesas the architect left them and as time has modified and improved themthe expression of an idea which does not admit of being otherwise expressed or translated into anything else  those old battlemented walls around the quadrangles many gables the windows with stone pavilions so very antique yet some of them adorned with fresh flowers in potsa very sweet contrast the ivy mantling the gray stone and the infinite repose both in sunshine and shadowit is as if half a dozen bygone centuries had set up their rest here and as if nothing of the present time ever passed through the deeply recessed archway that shuts in the college from the street  not but what people have very free admittance and many parties of young men and girls and children came into the gardens while we were there  these gardens of new college are indescribably beautifulnot gardens in an american sense but lawns of the richest green and softest velvet grass shadowed over by ancient trees that have lived a quiet life here for centuries and have been nursed and tended with such care and so sheltered from rude winds that certainly they must have been the happiest of all trees  such a sweet quiet sacred stately seclusion so agelong as this has been and i hope will continue to becannot exist anywhere else  one side of the garden wall is formed by the ancient wall of the city which cromwells artillery battered and which still retains its pristine height and strength  at intervals there are round towers that formed the bastions that is to say on the exterior they are round towers but within in the garden of the college they are semicircular recesses with iron gardenseats arranged round them  the loopholes through which the archers and musketeers used to shoot still pierce through deep recesses in the wall which is here about six feet thick  i wish i could put into one sentence the whole impression of this garden but it could not be done in many pages  we looked also at the outside of the wall and mr parker deeply skilled in the antiquities of the spot showed us a weed growinghere in little sprigs there in large and heavy festoonshanging plentifully downward from a shallow root  it is called the oxford plant being found only here and not easily if at all introduced anywhere else  it bears a small and pretty blue flower not altogether unlike the forgetmenot and we took some of it away with us for a memorial  we went into the chapel of new college which is in such fresh condition that i think it must be modern and yet this cannot be since there are old brasses inlaid into tombstones in the pavement representing mediaeval ecclesiastics and college dignitaries and busts against the walls in antique garb and old painted windows unmistakable in their antiquity but there is likewise a window lamentable to look at which was painted by sir joshua reynolds and exhibits strikingly the difference between the work of a man who performed it merely as a matter of taste and business and what was done religiously and with the whole heart at least it shows that the artists and public of the last age had no sympathy with gothic art  in the chancel of this church there are more painted windows which i take to be modern too though they are in much better taste and have an infinitely better effect than sir joshuas at any rate with the sunshine through them they looked very beautiful and tinted the high altar and the pavement with brilliant lines  the sacristan opened a tall and narrow little recess in the wall of the chancel and showed it entirely filled with the crosier of william of wickham  it appears to be made of silver gilt and is a most rich and elaborate relic at least six feet high  modern art cannot or does not equal the chasing and carving of this splendid crosier which is enriched with figures of saints and apostles and various gothic devicesvery minute but all executed as faithfully as if the artists salvation had depended upon every notch he made in the silver      leaving new college bennoch and i under mr parkers guidance walked round christ church meadows part of our way lying along the banks of the cherwell which unites with the isis to form the thames i believe  the cherwell is a narrow and remarkably sluggish stream but is deep in spots and capriciously soso that a person may easily step from kneedeep to fifteen feet in depth  a gentleman present used a queer expression in reference to the drowning of two college men he said it was an awkward affair  i think this is equal to longfellows story of the frenchman who avowed himself very much displeased at the news of his fathers death  at the confluence of the cherwell and isis we saw a good many boats belonging to the students of the various colleges some of them being very large and handsome barges capable of accommodating a numerous party with room on board for dancing and merrymaking  some of them are calculated to be drawn by horses in the manner of canalboats others are propellable by oars  it is practicable to perform the voyage between oxford and londona distance of about one hundred and thirty milesin three days  the students of oxford are famous boatmen there is a constant rivalship on this score among the different colleges and annually i believe there is a match between oxford and cambridge  the cambridge men beat the oxonians in this years trial  on our return into the city we passed through christ church which as regards the number of students is the most considerable college of the university  it has a stately dome but my memory is confused with battlements towers and gables and gothic staircases and cloisters  if there had been nothing else in oxford but this one establishment my anticipations would not have been disappointed  the bell was tolling for worship in the chapel and mr parker told us that dr pusey is a canon or in some sort of dignity in christ church and would soon probably make his appearance in the quadrangle on his way to chapel so we walked to and fro waiting an opportunity to see him  a gouty old dignitary in a white surplice came hobbling along from one extremity of the court and by and by from the opposite corner appeared dr pusey also in a white surplice and with a lady by his side  we met him and i stared pretty fixedly at him as i well might for he looked on the ground as if conscious that he would be stared at  he is a man past middle life of sufficient breadth and massiveness with a pale intellectual manly face  he was talking with the lady and smiled but not jollily  mr parker who knows him says that he is a man of kind and gentle affections  the lady was his niece  thence we went through high street and broad street and passing by baliol collegea most satisfactory pile and range of old towered and gabled edificeswe came to the cross on the pavement which is supposed to mark the spot where the bishops were martyred  but mr parker told us the mortifying fact that he had ascertained that this could not possibly have been the genuine spot of martyrdom which must have taken place at a point within view but considerably too far off to be moistened by any tears that may be shed here  it is too bad  we concluded the rambles of the day by visiting the gardens of st johns college and i desire if possible to say even more in admiration of them than of those of new collegesuch beautiful lawns with tall ancient trees and heavy clouds of foliage and sunny glimpses through archways of leafy branches where today we could see parties of girls making cheerful contrast with the sombre walls and solemn shade  the world surely has not another place like oxford it is a despair to see such a place and ever to leave it for it would take a lifetime and more than one to comprehend and enjoy it satisfactorily  at dinner today the golden vases were all ranged on the table the largest and central one containing a most magnificent bouquet of dahlias and other brighthued flowers  on tuesday our first visit was to christ church where we saw the large and stately hall above a hundred feet long by forty wide and fifty to the top of its carved oaken roof which is ornamented with festoons as it were and pendants of solid timber  the walls are panelled with oak perhaps halfway upward and above are the rows of arched windows on each side but near the upper end two great windows come nearly to the floor  there is a dais where the great men of the college and the distinguished guests sit at table and the tables of the students are arranged along the length of the hall  all around looking down upon those who sit at meat are the portraits of a multitude of illustrious personages who were members of the learned fraternity in times past not a portrait being admitted there unless it he a king and i remember only henry viii save those who were actually students on the foundation receiving the eleemosynary aid of the college  most of them were divines but there are likewise many statesmen eminent during the last three hundred years and among many earlier ones the marquis of wellesley and canning  it is an excellent idea for their own glory and as examples to the rising generations to have this multitude of men who have done good and great things before the eyes of those who ought to do as well as they in their own time  archbishops prime ministers poets deep scholarsbut doubtless an outward success has generally been their claim to this position and christ church may have forgotten a better man than the best of them  it is not i think the tendency of english life nor of the education of their colleges to lead young men to high moral excellence but to aim at illustrating themselves in the sight of mankind  thence we went into the kitchen which is arranged very much as it was three centuries ago with two immense fireplaces  there was likewise a gridiron which without any exaggeration was large enough to have served for the martyrdom of st lawrence  the college dinners are good but plain and cost the students one shilling and eleven pence each being rather cheaper than a similar one could be had at an inn  there is no provision for breakfast or supper in commons but they can have these meals sent to their rooms from the buttery at a charge proportioned to the dishes they order  there seems to be no necessity for a great expenditure on the part of oxford students  from the kitchen we went to the chapel which is the cathedral of oxford and well worth seeing if there had not been so many other things to see it is now under repair and there was a great heap of old woodwork and panelling lying in one of the aisles which had been stripped away from some of the ancient pillars leaving them as good as new  there is a shrine of a saint with a wooden canopy over it and some painted glass old and new and a statue of cyril jackson with a face of shrewdness and insight and busts as mural monuments  our next visit was to    merton college   which though not one of the great colleges is as old as any of them and looks exceedingly venerable  we were here received by a friend of mr spiers in his academic cap but without his gown which is not worn except in term time  he is a very civil gentleman and showed us some antique points of architecturesuch as a norman archway with a passage over it through which the queen of charles i used to go to chapel and an edifice of the thirteenth century with a stone roof which is considered to be very curious  how ancient is the aspect of these college quadrangles so gnawed by time as they are so crumbly so blackened and so gray where they are not blackso quaintly shaped too with here a line of battlement and there a row of gables and here a turret with probably a winding stair inside and latticewindows with stone mullions and little panes of glass set in lead and the cloisters with a long arcade looking upon the green or pebbled enclosure  the quality of the stone has a great deal to do with the apparent antiquity  it is a stone found in the neighborhood of oxford and very soon begins to crumble and decay superficially when exposed to the weather so that twenty years do the work of a hundred so far as appearances go  if you strike one of the old walls with a stick a portion of it comes powdering down  the effect of this decay is very picturesque and is especially striking i think on edifices of classic architecture such as some of the oxford colleges are greatly enriching the grecian columns which look so cold when the outlines are hard and distinct  the oxford people however are tired of this crumbly stone and when repairs are necessary they use a more durable material which does not well assort with the antiquity into which it is intruded  mr e showed us the library of merton college  it occupies two sides of an old building and has a very delightful fragrance of ancient books  the halls containing it are vaulted and roofed with oak not carved and ornamented but laid flat so that they look very like a grand and spacious old garret  all along there is a row of alcoves on each side with rude benches and readingdesks in the simplest style and nobody knows how old  the books look as old as the building  the more valuable were formerly chained to the bookcases and a few of them have not yet broken their chains  it was a good emblem of the dark and monkish ages when learning was imprisoned in their cloisters and chained in their libraries in the days when the schoolmaster had not yet gone abroad  mr e showed us a very old copy of the bible and a vellum manuscript most beautifully written in blackletter and illuminated of the works of duns scotus who was a scholar of merton college  he then showed us the chapel a large part of which has been renewed and ornamented with pictured windows and other ecclesiastical splendor and paved with encaustic tiles according to the puseyite taste of the day for merton has adopted the puseyite doctrines and is one of their chief strongholds in oxford  if they do no other good they at least do much for the preservation and characteristic restoration of the old english churches but perhaps even here there is as much antiquity spoiled as retained  in the portion of the chapel not yet restored we saw the rude old pavement inlaid with gravestones in some of which were brasses with the figures of the college dignitaries whose dust slumbered beneath and i think it was here that i saw the tombstone of anthonyawood the gossiping biographer of the learned men of oxford  from the chapel we went into the college gardens which are very pleasant and possess the advantage of looking out on the broad verdure of christ church meadows and the river beyond  we loitered here awhile and then went to mr s rooms to which the entrance is by a fine old staircase  they had a very comfortable aspecta wainscoted parlor and bedroom as nice and cosey as a bachelor could desire with a good collection of theological books and on a peg hung his gown with a red border about it denoting him to be a proproctor  he was kind enough to order a lunch consisting of bread and cheese college ale and a certain liquor called archdeacon     we ate and drank     and bidding farewell to good mr e we pursued our way to the    ratcliffe library   this is a very handsome edifice of a circular shape the lower story consisting altogether of arches open on all sides as if to admit anybody to the learning here stored up  i always see great beauty and lightsomeness in these classic and grecian edifices though they seem cold and intellectual and not to have had their mortar moistened with human lifeblood nor to have the mystery of human life in them as gothic structures do  the library is in a large and beautiful room in the story above the basement and as far as i saw consisted chiefly or altogether of scientific works  i saw sillimans journal on one of the desks being the only trace of american science or american learning or ability in any department which i discovered in the university of oxford  after seeing the library we went to the top of the building where we had an excellent view of oxford and the surrounding country then we went to the convocation hall and afterwards to the theatre where s sat down in the chancellors chair which is very broad and ponderously wrought of oak  i remember little here except the amphitheatre of benches and the roof which seems to be supported by golden ropes and on the wall opposite the door some fulllength portraits among which one of that ridiculous coxcomb george iv was the most prominent  these kings thrust themselves impertinently forward by bust statue and picture on all occasions and it is not wise in them to show their shallow foreheads among men of mind    the bodleian library   mr spiers tried to get us admittance to the bodleian library but this is just the moment when it is closed for the purpose of being cleaned so we missed seeing the principal halls of this library and were only admitted into what was called the picture gallery  this however satisfied all my desires so far as the backs of books are concerned for they extend through a gallery running round three sides of a quadrangle making an aggregate length of more than four hundred feeta solid array of bookcases full of books within a protection of open ironwork  up and down the gallery there are models of classic temples and about midway in its extent stands a brass statue of earl pembroke who was chancellor of the university in james is time not in scholarly garb however but in plate and mail looking indeed like a thunderbolt of war i rapped him with my knuckles and he seemed to be solid metal though i should imagine hollow at heart  a thing which interested me very much was the lantern of guy fawkes  it was once tinned no doubt but is now nothing but rusty iron partly broken  as this is called the picture gallery i must not forget the pictures which are ranged in long succession over the bookcases and include almost all englishmen whom the world has ever heard of whether in statesmanship or literature i saw a canvas on which had once been a lovely and unique portrait of mary of scotland but it was consigned to a picturecleaner to be cleansed and discovering that it was painted over another picture he had the curiosity to clean poor mary quite away thus revealing a wishywashy womans face which now hangs in the gallery  i am so tired of seeing notable things that i almost wish that whatever else is remarkable in oxford could he obliterated in some similar manner  from the bodleian we went to    the taylor institute   which was likewise closed but the woman who had it in charge had formerly been a servant of mr spiers and he so overpersuaded her that she finally smiled and admitted us  it would truly have been a pity to miss it for here on the basement floor are the original models of chantreys busts and statues great and small and in the rooms above are a far richer treasurea large collection of original drawings by raphael and michael angelo  these are far better for my purpose than their finished picturesthat is to say they bring me much closer to the hands that drew them and the minds that imagined them  it is like looking into their brains and seeing the first conception before it took shape outwardly i have somewhere else said about the same thing of such sketches  i noticed one of raphaels drawings representing the effect of eloquence it was a man speaking in the centre of a group between whose ears and the orators mouth connecting lines were drawn  raphaels idea must have been to compose his picture in such a way that their auricular organs should not fail to be in a proper relation with the eloquent voice and though this relation would not have been individually traceable in the finished picture yet the general effectthat of deep and entranced attentionwould have been produced  in another room there are some copies of raphaels cartoons and some queer mediaeval pictures as stiff and ugly as can well be conceived yet successful in telling their own story  we looked a little while at these and then thank heaven went home and dressed for dinner  i can write no more today  indeed what a mockery it is to write at all  here follows the drive to cumnor place stanton harcourt nuneham courtney godstowe etcalready published in our old homeed   september 9ththe morning after our excursion on the thames was as bright and beautiful as many preceding ones had been  after breakfast s and i walked a little about the town and bought thomas a kempis in both french and english for u     mr de la motte the photographer had breakfasted with us and mr spiers wished him to take a photograph of our whole party  so in the first place before the rest were assembled he made an experimental group of such as were there and i did not like my own aspect very much  afterwards when we were all come he arranged us under a tree in the gardenmr and mrs spiers with their eldest son mr and mrs hall and fanny mr addison my wife and meand stained the glass with our figures and faces in the twinkling of an eye not ss face however for she turned it away and left only a portion of her bonnet and dressand mrs hall too refused to countenance the proceeding  but all the rest of us were caught to the life and i was really a little startled at recognizing myself so apart from myself and done so quickly too  this was the last important incident of our visit to oxford except that mr spiers was again most hospitable at lunch  never did anybody attend more faithfully to the comfort of his friends than does this good gentleman  but he has shown himself most kind in every possible way and i shall always feel truly grateful  no better way of showing our sense of his hospitality and all the trouble he has taken for us and our memory of him has occurred to us than to present him with a set of my tales and romances so by the next steamer i shall write to ticknor and fields to send them elegantly bound and s will emblazon his coat of arms in each volume  he accompanied us and mr and mrs hall to the railway station and we left oxford at two oclock  it had been a very pleasant visit and all the persons whom we met were kind and agreeable and disposed to look at one another in a sunny aspect  i saw a good deal of mr hall  he is a thoroughly genuine man of kind heart and true affections a gentleman of taste and refinement and full of humor  on the saturday after our return to blackheath we went to    hampton court   about which as i have already recorded a visit to it i need say little here  but i was again impressed with the stately grandeur of wolseys great hall with its great window at each end and one side window descending almost to the floor and a row of windows on each side high towards the roof and throwing down their manycolored light on the stone pavement and on the gobelin tapestry which must have been gorgeously rich when the walls were first clothed with it  i fancied then that no modern architect could produce so fine a room but oddly enough in the great entrancehall of the euston station yesterday i could not see how this last fell very much short of wolseys hall in grandeur  we were quite wearied in passing through the endless suites of rooms in hampton court and gazing at the thousands of pictures it is too much for one dayalmost enough for one life in such measure as life can be bestowed on pictures  it would have refreshed us had we spent half the time in wandering about the grounds which as we glimpsed at them from the windows of the palace seemed very beautiful though laid out with an antique formality of straight lines and broad gravelled paths  before the central window there is a beautiful sheet of water and a fountain upshooting itself and plashing into it with a continuous and pleasant sound  how beautifully the royal robe of a monarchy is embroidered palaces pictures parks  they do enrich life and kings and aristocracies cannot keep these things to themselves they merely take care of them for others  even a king with all the glory that can be shed around him is but the liveried and bedizened footman of his people and the toy of their delight  i am very glad that i came to this country while the english are still playing with such a toy  yesterday j and i left blackheath and reached liverpool last night the rest of my family will follow in a few days and so finishes our residence in bennochs house where i for my part have spent some of the happiest hours that i have known since we left our american home it is a strange vagabond gypsy sort of lifethis that we are leading and i know not whether we shall finally be spoiled for any other or shall enjoy our quiet wayside as we never did before when once we reach it again  the evening set in misty and obscure and it was dark almost when j and i arrived at the landing stage on our return  i was struck with the picturesque effect of the high tower and tall spire of st nicholas rising upward with dim outline into the duskiness while midway of its height the dialplates of an illuminated clock blazed out like two great eyes of a giant   september 13thon saturday my wife with all her train arrived at mrs bs and on tuesdayvagabonds as we arewe again struck our tent and set out for    southport   i do not know what sort of character it will form in the childrenthis unsettled shifting vagrant life with no central home to turn to except what we carry in ourselves  it was a windy day and judging by the look of the trees on the way to southport it must be almost always windy and with the blast in one prevailing direction for invariably their branches and the whole contour and attitude of the tree turn from seaward with a strangely forlorn aspect  reaching southport we took an omnibus and under the drivers guidance came to our tall stone house fronting on the sands and styled brunswick terrace      the english system of lodginghouses has its good points but it is nevertheless a contrivance for bearing the domestic cares of home about with you whithersoever you go and immediately you have to set about producing your own bread and cheese  however fanny took most of this trouble off our hands though there was inevitably the stiffness and discomfort of a new housekeeping on the first day of our arrival besides that it was cool and the wind whistled and grumbled and eddied into the chinks of the house  meanwhile in all my experience of southport i have never yet seen the sea but only an interminable breadth of sands looking pooly or plashy in some places and barred across with drier reaches of sand but no expanse of water  it must be miles and miles at low water to the veritable seashore  we are about twenty miles north of liverpool on the border of the irish sea and ireland and i suppose the isle of man intervene betwixt us and the ocean not much to our benefit for the air of the english coast under ocean influences is said to be milder than when it comes across the landmilder therefore above or below ireland because then the gulf stream ameliorates it  betimes the forenoon after our arrival i had to take the rail to liverpool but returned a little after five in the midst of a rain still low water and interminable sands still a dreary howling blast we had a cheerful fireside however and should have had a pleasant evening only that the wind on the sea made us excessively drowsy  this morning we awoke to hear the wind still blustering and blowing up clouds with fitful little showers and soon blowing them away again and letting the brightest of sunshine fall over the plashy waste of sand  we have already walked forth on the shore with j and r who pick up shells and dig wells in the sand with their little wooden spades but soon we saw a rainbow on the western sky and then a shower came spattering down upon us in good earnest  we first took refuge under the bridge that stretches between the two portions of the promenade but as there was a chill draught there we made the best of our way home  the sun has now again come out brightly though the wind is still tumbling a great many clouds about the sky   eveninglater i walked out with u and looking seaward we saw the foam and spray of the advancing tide tossed about on the verge of the horizona long line like the crests and gleaming helmets of an army  in about half an hour we found almost the whole waste of sand covered with water and white waves breaking out all over it but the bottom being so nearly level and the water so shallow there was little of the spirit and exultation of the sea in a strong breeze  of the long line of bathingmachines one after another was hitched to a horse and trundled forth into the water where at a long distance from shore the bathers found themselves hardly middle deep   september 19ththe wind grumbled and made itself miserable all last night and this morning it is still howling as illnaturedly as ever and roaring and rumbling in the chimneys  the tide is far out but from an upper window i fancied at intervals that i could see the plash of the surfwave on the distant limit of the sand perhaps however it was only a gleam on the sky  constantly there have been sharp spatters of rain hissing and rattling against the windows while a little before or after or perhaps simultaneously a rainbow somewhat watery of texture paints itself on the western clouds  gray sullen clouds hang about the sky or sometimes cover it with a uniform dulness at other times the portions towards the sun gleam almost lightsomely now there may be an airy glimpse of clear blue sky in a fissure of the clouds now the very brightest of sunshine comes out all of a sudden and gladdens everything the breadth of sands has a various aspect according as there are pools or moisture enough to glisten or a drier tract and where the light gleams along a yellow ridge or bar it is like sunshine itself certainly the temper of the day shifts but the smiles come far the seldomest and its frowns and angry tears are most reliable  by seven oclock pedestrians began to walk along the promenade close buttoned against the blast later a single bathingmachine got under way by means of a horse and travelled forth seaward but within what distance it finds the invisible margin i cannot sayat all events it looks like a dreary journey  just now i saw a seagull wheeling on the blast close in towards the promenade   september 21styesterday morning was bright sunny and windy and cool and exhilarating  i went to liverpool at eleven and returning at five found the weather still bright and cool  the temperature methinks must soon diminish the population of southport which judging from appearances must be mainly made up of temporary visitors  there is a newspaper the southport visitor published weekly and containing a register of all the visitants in the various hotels and lodginghouses it covers more than two sides of the paper to the amount of some hundreds  the guests come chiefly from liverpool manchester and the neighboring countrytowns and belong to the middle classes  it is not a fashionable wateringplace  only one noblemans name and those of two or three baronets now adorn the list  the people whom we see loitering along the beach and the promenade have at best a welltodo tradesmanlike air  i do not find that there are any public amusements nothing but strolling on the sands donkeyriding or drives in donkeycarts and solitary visitors must find it a dreary place  yet one or two of the streets are brisk and lively and being well thronged have a holiday aspect  there are no carriages in town save donkeycarts some of which are drawn by three donkeys abreast and are large enough to hold a whole family  these conveyances will take you far out on the sands through wet and dry  the beach is haunted by the flying dutchman a sort of boat on wheels schoonerrigged with sails and which sometimes makes pretty good speed with a fair wind  this morning we have been walking with j and r out over the ribbed sea sands a good distance from shore  throughout the week the tides will be so low as not to cover the shallow basin of this bay if a bay it be  the weather was sullen with now and then a faint gleam of sunshine lazily tracing our shadows on the sand the wind rather quieter than on preceding days     in the sunshine the sands seem to be frequented by great numbers of gulls who begin to find the northern climate too wintry  you see their white wings in the sunlight but they become almost or quite invisible in the shade  we shall soon have an opportunity of seeing how a wateringplace looks when the season is quite over for we have concluded to remain here till december and everybody else will take flight in a week or two  a short time ago in the evening in a street of liverpool i saw a decent man of the lower orders taken much aback by being roughly brushed against by a rowdy fellow  he looked after him and exclaimed indignantly is that a yankee  it shows the kind of character we have here   october 7thon saturday evening i gave a dinner to bennoch at the adelphi hotel  the chief point or characteristic of english customs was that mr radley our landlord himself attended at table and officiated as chief waiter  he has a fortune of 100000 poundshalf a million of dollarsand is an elderly man of good address and appearance  in america such a man would very probably be in congress at any rate he would never conceive the possibility of changing plates or passing round the table with hock and champagne  some of his hock was a most rich and imperial wine such as can hardly be had on the rhine itself  there were eight gentlemen besides bennoch  a donkey the other day stubbornly refusing to come out of a boat which had brought him across the mersey at last after many kicks had been applied and other persecutions of that kind a man stepped forward addressing him affectionately come along brotherand the donkey obeyed at once   october 26thon thursday instead of taking the rail for liverpool i set out about eleven for a long walk  it was an overcast morning such as in new england would have boded rain but english clouds are not nearly so portentous as american in that respect  accordingly the sun soon began to peep through crevices and i had not gone more than a mile or two when it shone a little too warmly for comfort yet not more than i liked  it was very much like our pleasant october days at home indeed the climates of the two countries more nearly coincide during the present month than at any other season of the year  the air was almost perfectly still but once in a while it stirred and breathed coolly in my face it is very delightful this latent freshness in a warm atmosphere  the country about southport has as few charms as it is possible for any region to have  in the close neighborhood of the shore it is nothing but sandhillocks covered with coarse grass and this is the original nature of the whole site on which the town stands although it is now paved and has been covered with soil enough to make gardens and to nourish here and there a few trees  a little farther inland the surface seems to have been marshy but has been drained by ditches across the fields and along the roadside and the fields are embanked on all sides with parapets of earth which appear as if intended to keep out inundations  in fact holland itself cannot be more completely on a level with the sea  the only dwellings are the old whitewashed stone cottages with thatched roofs on the brown straw of which grow various weeds and mosses brightening it with green patches and sprouting along the ridgepolethe homeliest hovels that ever mortals lived in and which they share with pigs and cows at one end  hens too run in and out of the door  one or two of these hovels bore signs licensed to sell beer ale and tobacco and generally there were an old woman and some children visible  in all cases there was a ditch full of water close at hand stagnant and often quite covered with a growth of waterweedsvery unwholesome one would think in the neighborhood of a dwelling and in truth the children and grown people did look pale  in the fields along the roadside men and women were harvesting their carrots and other rootcrops especially digging potatoesthe pleasantest of all farm labor in my opinion there being such a continual interest in opening the treasures of each hill  as i went on the country began to get almost imperceptibly less flat and there was some little appearance of trees  i had determined to go to ormskirk but soon got out of the way and came to a little hamlet that looked antique and picturesque with its small houses of stone and brick built with the one material and repaired with the other perhaps ages afterward here i inquired my way of a woman who told me in broad lancashire dialect that i main go back and turn to my left till i came to a fingerpost and so i did and found another little hamlet the principal object in which was a publichouse with a large sign representing a dance round a maypole  it was now about one oclock so i entered and being ushered into what i suppose they called the coffeeroom i asked for some cold neat and ale  there was a jolly round rather comely woman for a hostess with a free hospitable yet rather careless manner  the coffeeroom smelt rather disagreeably of bad tobaccosmoke and was shabbily furnished with an old sofa and flagbottomed chairs and adorned with a print of old billy a horse famous for a longevity of about sixty years and also with colored engravings of oldfashioned huntingscenes conspicuous with scarlet coats  there was a very small bust of milton on the mantelpiece  by and by the remains of an immense round of beef three quarters cut away were put on the table then some smokinghot potatoes and finally the hostess told me that their own dinner was just ready and so she had brought me in some hot chops thinking i might prefer them to the cold meat  i did prefer them and they were stewed or fried chops instead of broiled and were very savory  there was household bread too and rich cheese and a pint of ale home brewed not very mighty but good to quench thirst and by way of condiment some pickled cabbage so instead of a lunch i made quite a comfortable dinner  moreover there was a cold pudding on the table and i called for a clean plate and helped myself to some of it  it was of rice and was strewn over rather than intermixed with some kinds of berries the nature of which i could not exactly make out  i then set forth again  it was still sunny and warm and i walked more slowly than before dinner in fact i did little more than lounge along sitting down at last on the stone parapet of a bridge  the country grew more pleasant more sylvan and though still of a level character not so drearily flat  soon appeared the first symptom that i had seen of a gentlemans residencea lodge at a park gate then a long stretch of wall with a green lawn and afterwards an extent of wooded land then another gateway with a neat lodge on each side of it and lastly another extent of wood  the hall or mansionhouse however was nowhere apparent being doubtless secluded deep and far within its grounds  i inquired of a boy who was the owner of the estate and he answered mr scarisbrick and no doubt it is a family of local eminence  along the roadan old inn some aged stone houses built for merely respectable occupants a canal with two canalboats heaped up with a cargo of potatoes two little girls who were watching lest some cows should go astray and had their two little chairs by the roadside and their dolls and other playthings and so followed the footsteps of the cows all day long  i met two boys coming from ormskirk mounted on donkeys with empty panniers on which they had carried vegetables to market  finally between two and three oclock i saw the great tower of ormskirk church with its spire not rising out of the tower but sprouting up close beside it and entering the town i directed my steps first to this old church    ormskirk church   it stands on a gentle eminence sufficient to give it a good site and has a pavement of flat gravestones in front  it is doubtless as regards its foundation a very ancient church but has not exactly a venerable aspect being in too good repair and much restored in various parts not ivygrown either though green with moss here and there  the tower is square and immensely massive and might have supported a very lofty spire so that it is the more strange that what spire it has should be so oddly stuck beside it springing out of the church wall  i should have liked well enough to enter the church as it is the burialplace of the earls of derby and perhaps may contain some interesting monuments but as it was all shut up and even the iron gates of the churchyard closed and locked i merely looked at the outside  from the church a street leads to the marketplace in which i found a throng of men and women it being marketday wares of various kinds tin earthen and cloth set out on the pavements droves of pigs ducks and fowls baskets of eggs and a man selling quack medicines recommending his nostrums as well as he could  the aspect of the crowd was very englishportly and ruddy women yeomen with smallclothes and broadbrimmed hats all very quiet and heavy and goodhumored  their dialect was so provincial that i could not readily understand more than here and there a word  but after all there were few traits that could be made a note of  i soon grew weary of the scene and so i went to the railway station and waited there nearly an hour for the train to take me to southport ormskirk is famous for its gingerbread which women sell to the railway passengers at a sixpence for a rouleau of a dozen little cakes   november 30tha week ago last monday herman melville came to see me at the consulate looking much as he used to do and with his characteristic gravity and reserve of manner     we soon found ourselves on pretty much our former terms of sociability and confidence     he is thus far on his way to constantinople  i do not wonder that he found it necessary to take an airing through the world after so many years of toilsome penlabor following upon so wild and adventurous a youth as his was  i invited him to come and stay with us at southport as long as he might remain in this vicinity and accordingly he did come the next day     on wednesday we took a pretty long walk together and sat down in a hollow among the sandhills sheltering ourselves from the high cool wind  melville as he always does began to reason of providence and futurity and of everything else that lies beyond human ken     he has a very high and noble nature and is better worth immortality than the most of us     on saturday we went to chester together  i love to take every opportunity of going to chester it being the one only place within easy reach of liverpool which possesses any old english interest  we went to    the cathedral   its gray nave impressed me more than at any former visit  passing into the cloisters an attendant took possession of us and showed us about  within the choir there is a profusion of very rich oaken carving both on the screen that separates it from the nave and on the seats and walls very curious and most elaborate and lavished one would say most wastefully where nobody would think of looking for itwhere indeed amid the dimness of the cathedral the exquisite detail of the elaboration could not possibly be seen  our guide lighted some of the gasburners of which there are many hundreds to help us see them but it required close scrutiny even then  it must have been out of the question when the whole means of illumination were only a few smoky torches or candles  there was a row of niches where the monks used to stand for four hours together in the performance of some of their services and to relieve them a little they were allowed partially to sit on a projection of the seats which were turned up in the niche for that purpose but if they grew drowsy so as to fail to balance themselves the seat was so contrived as to slip down thus bringing the monk to the floor  these projections on the seats are each and all of them carved with curious devices no two alike  the guide showed us one representing apparently the first quarrel of a newmarried couple wrought with wonderful expression  indeed the artist never failed to bring out his idea in the most striking manneras for instance satan under the guise of a lion devouring a sinner bodily and again in the figure of a dragon with a man halfway down his gullet the legs hanging out  the carver may not have seen anything grotesque in this nor intended it at all by way of joke but certainly there would appear to be a grim mirthfulness in some of the designs  one does not see why such fantasies should be strewn about the holy interior of a cathedral unless it were intended to contain everything that belongs to the heart of man both upward and downward  in a side aisle of the choir we saw a tomb said to be that of the emperor henry iv of germany though on very indistinct authority  this is an oblong tomb carved and on one side painted with bright colors and gilded  during a very long period it was built and plastered into the wall and the exterior side was whitewashed but on being removed the inner side was found to have been ornamented with gold and color in the manner in which we now see it  if this were customary with tombs it must have added vastly to the gorgeous magnificence to which the painted windows and polished pillars and ornamented ceilings contributed so much in fact a cathedral in its fresh estate seems to have been like a pavilion of the sunset all purple and gold whereas now it more resembles deepest and grayest twilight  afterwards we were shown into the ancient refectory now used as the city grammarschool and furnished with the usual desks and seats for the boys  in one corner of this large room was the sort of pulpit or elevated seat with a broken staircase of stone ascending to it where one of the monks used to read to his brethren while sitting at their meals  the desks were cut and carved with the scholars knives just as they used to be in the schoolrooms where i was a scholar  thence we passed into the chapterhouse but before that we went through a small room in which melville opened a cupboard and discovered a dozen or two of winebottles but our guide told us that they were now empty and never were meant for jollity having held only sacramental wine  in the chapterhouse we saw the library some of the volumes of which were antique folios  there were two dusty and tattered banners hanging on the wall and the attendant promised to make us laugh by something that he would tell us about them  the joke was that these two banners had been in the battle of bunker hill and our countrymen he said always smiled on hearing this  he had discovered us to be americans by the notice we took of a mural tablet in the choir to the memory of a lieutenantgovernor clarke of new york who died in chester before the revolution  from the chapterhouse he ushered us back into the nave ever and anon pointing out some portion of the edifice more ancient than the rest and when i asked him how he knew this he said that he had learnt it from the archaeologists who could read off such things like a book  this guide was a lively quickwitted man who did his business less by rote and more with a vivacious interest than any guide i ever met  after leaving the cathedral we sought out the yacht inn near the watergate  this was for a long period of time the principal inn of chester and was the house at which swift once put up on his way to holyhead and where he invited the clergy to come and sup with him  we sat down in a small snuggery conversing with the landlord  the chester people according to my experience are very affable and fond of talking with strangers about the antiquities and picturesque characteristics of their town  it partly lives the landlord told us by its visitors and many people spend the summer here on account of the antiquities and the good air  he showed us a broad balustraded staircase leading into a large comfortable oldfashioned parlor with windows looking on the street and on the custom house that stood opposite  this was the room where swift expected to receive the clergy of chester and on one of the windowpanes were two acrid lines written with the diamond of his ring satirizing those venerable gentlemen in revenge for their refusing his invitation  the first line begins rather indistinctly but the writing grows fully legible as it proceeds  the yacht tavern is a very old house in the gabled style  the timbers and framework are still perfectly sound  in the same street is the bishops house so called as having been the residence of a prelate long ago which is covered with curious sculpture representing scriptural scenes  and in the same neighborhood is the county court accessible by an archway through which we penetrated and found ourselves in a passage very ancient and dusky overlooked from the upper story by a gallery to which an antique staircase ascended with balustrades and square landingplaces  a printer saw us here and asked us into his printingoffice and talked very affably indeed he could have hardly been more civil if he had known that both melville and i have given a good deal of employment to the brethren of his craft   december 15than old gentleman has recently paid me a good many visitsa kentucky man who has been a good deal in england and europe generally without losing the freshness and unconventionality of his earlier life  he was a boatman and afterwards captain of a steamer on the ohio and mississippi but has gained property and is now the owner of mines of coal and iron which he is endeavoring to dispose of here in england  a plain respectable welltodolooking personage of more than seventy years very free of conversation and beginning to talk with everybody as a matter of course tall stalwart a dark face with white curly hair and keen eyes and an expression shrewd yet kindly and benign  he fought through the whole war of 1812 beginning with general harrison at the battle of tippecanoe which he described to me  he says that at the beginning of the battle and for a considerable time he heard tecumsehs voice loudly giving orders  there was a man named wheatley in the american camp a strange incommunicative persona volunteer making war entirely on his own book and seeking revenge for some relatives of his who had been killed by the indians  in the midst of the battle this wheatley ran at a slow trot past r my informant trailing his rifle and making towards the point where tecumsehs voice was heard  the fight drifted around and r along with it and by and by he reached a spot where wheatley lay dead with his head on tecumsehs breast  tecumseh had been shot with a rifle but before expiring appeared to have shot wheatley with a pistol which he still held in his hand  r affirms that tecumseh was flayed by the kentucky men on the spot and his skin converted into razorstraps  i have left out the most striking point of the narrative after all as r told it viz that soon after wheatley passed him he suddenly ceased to hear tecumsehs voice ringing through the forest as he gave his orders  he was at the battle of new orleans and gave me the story of it from beginning to end but i remember only a few particulars in which he was personally concerned  he confesses that his hair bristled uprightevery hair in his headwhen he heard the shouts of the british soldiers before advancing to the attack  his uncomfortable sensations lasted till he began to fire after which he felt no more of them  it was in the dusk of the morning or a little before sunrise when the assault was made and the fight lasted about two hours and a half during which r fired twentyfour times and said he i saw my object distinctly each time and i was a good rifleshot  he was raising his rifle to fire the twentyfifth time when an american officer general carroll pressed it down and bade him fire no more  enough is enough quoth the general  for there needed no more slaughter the british being in utter rout and confusion  in this retreat many of the enemy would drop down among the dead then rise run a considerable distance and drop again thus confusing the riflemens aim  one fellow had thus got about four hundred and fifty yards from the american line and thinking himself secure he made a derisive gesture  ill have a shot at him anyhow cried a rifleman so he fired and the poor devil dropped  r himself with one of his twentyfour shots hit a british officer who fell forward on his face about thirty paces from our line and as the enemy were then retreating they advanced and were repelled two or three times he ran out and turned him over on his back  the officer was a man about thirtyeight tall and finelooking his eyes were wide open clear and bright and were fixed full on r with a somewhat stern glance but there was the sweetest and happiest smile over his face that could be conceived  he seemed to be deadat least r thinks that he did not really see him fixedly as he appeared to gaze  the officer held his sword in his hand and r tried in vain to wrest it from him until suddenly the clutch relaxed  r still keeps the sword hung up over his mantelpiece  i asked him how the dead mans aspect affected him  he replied that he felt nothing at the time but that ever since in all trouble in uneasy sleep and whenever he is out of tune or waking early or lying awake at night he sees this officers face with the clear bright eyes and the pleasant smile just as distinctly as if he were bending over him  his wound was in the breast exactly on the spot that r had aimed at and bled profusely  the enemy advanced in such masses he says that it was impossible not to hit them unless by purposely firing over their heads  after the battle r leaped over the rampart and took a prisoner who was standing unarmed in the midst of the slain having probably dropped down during the heat of the action to avoid the hailstorm of rifleshots  as he led him in the prisoner paused and pointed to an officer who was lying dead beside his dead horse with his foot still in the stirrup  there lies our general said he  the horse had been killed by a grapeshot and pakenham himself apparently by a sixpounder ball which had first struck the earth covering him from head to foot with mud and clay and had then entered his side and gone upward through his breast  his face was all besmirched with the moist earth  r took the slain generals foot out of the stirrup and then went to report his death  much more he told me being an exceedingly talkative old man and seldom i suppose finding so good a listener as myself  i like the mana goodtempered upright bold and free old fellow of a rough breeding but sufficiently smoothed by society to be of pleasant intercourse  he is as dogmatic as possible having formed his own opinions often on very disputable grounds and hardened in them taking queer views of matters and things and giving shrewd and not ridiculous reasons for them but with a keen strong sense at the bottom of his character  a little while ago i met an englishman in a railway carriage who suggests himself as a kind of contrast to this warlike and vicissitudinous backwoodsman  he was about the same age as r but had spent apparently his whole life in liverpool and has long occupied the post of inspector of nuisancesa rather puffy and consequential man gracious however and affable even to casual strangers like myself  the great contrast betwixt him and the american lies in the narrower circuit of his ideas the latter talking about matters of history of his own country and the worldglancing over the whole field of politics propounding opinions and theories of his own and showing evidence that his mind had operated for better or worse on almost all conceivable matters while the englishman was odorous of his office strongly flavored with that and otherwise most insipid  he began his talk by telling me of a dead body which he had lately discovered in a house in liverpool where it had been kept about a fortnight by the relatives partly from want of funds for the burial and partly in expectation of the arrival of some friends from glasgow  there was a plate of glass in the coffinlid through which the inspector of nuisances as he told me had looked and seen the dead mans face in an ugly state of decay which he minutely described  however his conversation was not altogether of this quality for he spoke about larks and how abundant they are just now and what a good pie they make only they must be skinned else they will have a bitter taste  we have since had a larkpie ourselves and i believe it was very good in itself only the recollection of the nuisancemans talk was not a very agreeable flavor  a very racy and peculiarly english character might be made out of a man like this having his lifeconcern wholly with the disagreeables of a great city  he seemed to be a good and kindly person too but earthyeven as if his frame had been moulded of clay impregnated with the draining of slaughterhouses   december 21ston thursday evening i dined for the first time with the new mayor at the town hall  i wish to preserve all the characteristic traits of such banquets because being peculiar to england these municipal feasts may do well to picture in a novel  there was a big old silver tobaccobox nearly or quite as large round as an ordinary plate out of which the dignitaries of liverpool used to fill their pipes while sitting in council or after their dinners  the date 1690 was on the lid  it is now used as a snuffbox and wends its way from guest to guest round the table  we had turtle and among other good things american canvasback ducks     these dinners are certainly a good institution and likely to be promotive of good feeling the mayor giving them often and inviting in their turn all the respectable and eminent citizens of whatever political bias  about fifty gentlemen were present that evening  i had the post of honor at the mayors right hand and france turkey and austria were toasted before the republic for as the mayor whispered me he must first get his allies out of the way  the turkish consul and the austrian both made better english speeches than any englishman during the evening for it is inconceivable what shapeless and ragged utterances englishmen are content to put forth without attempting anything like a wholeness but inserting a patch here and a patch there and finally getting out what they wish to say indeed but in most disorganized guise     i can conceive of very high enjoyment in making a speech one is in such a curious sympathy with his audience feeling instantly how every sentence affects them and wonderfully excited and encouraged by the sense that it has gone to the right spot  then too the imminent emergency when a man is overboard and must sink or swim sharpens concentrates and invigorates the mind and causes matters of thought and sentiment to assume shape and expression though perhaps it seemed hopeless to express them just before you rose to speak  yet i question much whether public speaking tends to elevate the orator intellectually or morally the effort of course being to say what is immediately received by the audience and to produce an effect on the instant  i dont quite see how an honest man can be a good and successful orator but i shall hardly undertake to decide the question on my merely postprandial experience  the mayor toasted his guests by their professionsthe merchants for instance the bankers the solicitorsand while one of the number responded his brethren also stood up each in his place thus giving their assent to what he said  i think the very worst orator was a major of artillery who spoke in a meek little nervous voice and seemed a good deal more discomposed than probably he would have been in the face of the enemy  the first toast was the ladies to which an old bachelor responded   december 31stthus far we have come through the winter on this bleak and blasty shore of the irish sea where perhaps the drowned body of miltons friend lycidas might have been washed ashore more than two centuries ago  this would not be very likely however so wide a tract of sands never deeply covered by the tide intervening betwixt us and the sea  but it is an excessively windy place especially here on the promenade always a whistle and a howlalways an eddying gust through the corridors and chambersoften a patter of hail or rain or snow against the windows and in the long evenings the sounds outside are very much as if we were on shipboard in midocean with the waves dashing against the vessels sides  i go to town almost daily starting at about eleven and reaching southport again at a little past live by which time it is quite dark and continues so till nearly eight in the morning  christmas time has been marked by few characteristics  for a week or two previous to christmas day the newspapers contained rich details respecting marketstalls and butchers shopswhat magnificent carcasses of prize oxen and sheep they displayed      the christmas waits came to us on christmas eve and on the day itself in the shape of little parties of boys or girls singing wretched doggerel rhymes and going away well pleased with the guerdon of a penny or two  last evening came two or three older choristers at pretty near bedtime and sang some carols at our door  they were psalm tunes however  everybody with whom we have had to do in any manner of service expects a christmasbox but in most cases a shilling is quite a satisfactory amount  we have had holly and mistletoe stuck up on the gasfixtures and elsewhere about the house  on the mantelpiece in the coroners court the other day i saw corked and labelled phials which it may be presumed contained samples of poisons that have brought some poor wretches to their deaths either by murder or suicide  this court might be wrought into a very good and pregnant description with its grimy gloom illuminated by a conical skylight constructed to throw daylight down on corpses its greasy testament covered over with millions of perjured kisses the coroner himself whose life is fed on all kinds of unnatural death its subordinate officials who go about scenting murder and might be supposed to have caught the scent in their own garments its stupid brutish juries settling round corpses like flies its criminals whose guilt is brought face to face with them here in closer contact than at the subsequent trial  o p the famous mormonite called on me a little while agoa short blackhaired darkcomplexioned man a shrewd intelligent but unrefined countenance excessively unprepossessing an uncouth gait and deportment the aspect of a person in comfortable circumstances and decently behaved but of a vulgar nature and destitute of early culture i think i should have taken him for a shoemaker accustomed to reflect in a rude strong evildisposed way on matters of this world and the next as he sat on his bench  he said he had been residing in liverpool about six months and his business with me was to ask for a letter of introduction that should gain him admittance to the british museum he intending a visit to london  he offered to refer me to respectable people for his character but i advised him to apply to mr dallas as the proper person for his purpose   march 1st 1857on the night of last wednesday week our house was broken into by robbers  they entered by the back window of the breakfastroom which is the childrens schoolroom breaking or cutting a pane of glass so as to undo the fastening  i have a dim idea of having heard a noise through my sleep but if so it did not more than slightly disturb me  u heard it she being at watch with r and j having a cold was also wakeful and thought the noise was of servants moving about below  neither did the idea of robbers occur to u  j however hearing u at her mothers door asking for medicine for r called out for medicine for his cold and the thieves probably thought we were bestirring ourselves and so took flight  in the morning the servants found the hall door and the breakfastroom window open some silver cups and some other trifles of plate were gone from the sideboard and there were tokens that the whole lower part of the house had been ransacked but the thieves had evidently gone off in a hurry leaving some articles which they would have taken had they been more at leisure  we gave information to the police and an inspector and constable soon came to make investigations taking a list of the missing articles and informing themselves as to all particulars that could be known  i did not much expect ever to hear any more of the stolen property but on sunday a constable came to request my presence at the policeoffice to identify the lost things  the thieves had been caught in liverpool and some of the property found upon them and some of it at a pawnbrokers where they had pledged it  the policeoffice is a small dark room in the basement story of the town hall of southport and over the mantelpiece hanging one upon another there are innumerable advertisements of robberies in houses and on the highwaymurders too and garrotings and offences of all sorts not only in this district but wide away and forwarded from other policestations  bring thus aggregated together one realizes that there are a great many more offences than the public generally takes note of  most of these advertisements were in pen and ink with minute lists of the articles stolen but the more important were in print and there too i saw the printed advertisement of our own robbery not for public circulation but to be handed about privately among policeofficers and pawnbrokers  a rogue has a very poor chance in england the police being so numerous and their system so well organized  in a corner of the policeoffice stood a contrivance for precisely measuring the heights of prisoners and i took occasion to measure j and found him four feet seven inches and a half high  a set of rules for the selfgovernment of policeofficers was nailed on the door between twenty and thirty in number and composing a system of constabulary ethics  the rules would be good for men in almost any walk of life and i rather think the policeofficers conform to them with tolerable strictness  they appear to be subordinated to one another on the military plan  the ordinary constable does not sit down in the presence of his inspector and this latter seems to be half a gentleman at least such is the bearing of our southport inspector who wears a handsome uniform of green and silver and salutes the principal inhabitants when meeting them in the street with an air of something like equality  then again there is a superintendent who certainly claims the rank of a gentleman and has perhaps been an officer in the army  the superintendent of this district was present on this occasion  the thieves were brought down from liverpool on tuesday and examined in the town hall  i had been notified to be present but as a matter of courtesy the policeofficers refrained from calling me as a witness the evidence of the servants being sufficient to identify the property  the thieves were two young men not much over twentyjames and john macdonald terribly shabby dirty jailbird like yet intelligent of aspect and one of them handsome  the police knew them already and they seemed not much abashed by their position  there were half a dozen magistrates on the benchidle old gentlemen of southport and the vicinity who lounged into the court more as a matter of amusement than anything else and lounged out again at their own pleasure for these magisterial duties are a part of the pastime of the country gentlemen of england  they wore their hats on the bench  there were one or two of them more active than their fellows but the real duty was done by the clerk of the court  the seats within the bar were occupied by the witnesses and around the great table sat some of the more respectable people of southport and without the bar were the commonalty in great numbers for this is said to be the first burglary that has occurred here within the memory of man and so it has caused a great stir  there seems to be a strong case against the prisoners  a boy attached to the railway testified to having seen them at birchdale on wednesday afternoon and directed them on their way to southport peter pickup recognized them as having applied to him for lodgings in the course of that evening a pawnbroker swore to one of them as having offered my topcoat for sale or pledge in liverpool and my boots were found on the feet of one of themall this in addition to other circumstances of pregnant suspicion  so they were committed for trial at the liverpool assizes to be holden some time in the present month  i rather wished them to escape   february 27thcoming along the promenade a little before sunset i saw the mountains of the welsh coast shadowed very distinctly against the horizon  mr channing told me that he had seen these mountains once or twice during his stay at southport but though constantly looking for them they have never before greeted my eyes in all the months that we have spent here  it is said that the isle of man is likewise discernible occasionally but as the distance must be between sixty and seventy miles i should doubt it  how misty is england  i have spent four years in a gray gloom  and yet it suits me pretty well    to york   april 10that skipton  my wife j and i left southport today for a short tour to york and its neighborhood  the weather has been exceedingly disagreeable for weeks past but yesterday and today have been pleasant and we take advantage of the first glimpses of springlike weather  we came by preston along a road that grew rather more interesting as we proceeded to this place which is about sixty miles from southport and where we arrived between five and six oclock  first of all we got some tea and then as it was a pleasant sunset we set forth from our oldfashioned inn to take a walk  skipton is an ancient town and has an ancient though wellrepaired aspect the houses being built of gray stone but in no picturesque shapes the streets well paved the site irregular and rising gradually towards skipton castle which overlooks the town as an old lordly castle ought to overlook the feudal village which it protects  the castle was built shortly after the conquest by robert de romeli and was afterwards the property and residence of the famous cliffords  we met an honest man as we approached the gateway who kindly encouraged us to apply for admittance notwithstanding it was good friday telling us how to find the housekeeper who would probably show us over the castle  so we passed through the gate between two embattled towers and in the castle court we met a flock of young damsels who had been rambling about the precincts  they likewise directed us in our search for the housekeeper and s being bolder than i in such assaults on feudal castles led the way down a dark archway and up an exterior stairway and knocking at a door immediately brought the housekeeper to a parley  she proved to be a nowise awful personage but a homely neat kindly intelligent and middleaged body  she seemed to be all alone in this great old castle and at once consented to show us aboutbeing no doubt glad to see any christian visitors  the castle is now the property of sir r tufton but the present family do not make it their permanent residence and have only occasionally visited it  indeed it could not well be made an eligible or comfortable residence according to modern ideas the rooms occupying the several stories of large round towers and looking gloomy and sombre if not drearynot the less so for what has been done to modernize them for instance modern paperhangings and in some of the rooms marble fireplaces  they need a great deal more light and higher ceilings and i rather imagine that the warm rich effect of glowing tapestry is essential to keep ones spirit cheerful in these ancient rooms  modern paperhangings are too superficial and wishywashy for the purpose  tapestry it is true there is now completely covering the walls of several of the rooms but all faded into ghastliness nor could some of it have been otherwise than ghastly even in its newness for it represented persons suffering various kinds of torture with crowds of monks and nuns looking on  in another room there was the story of solomon and the queen of sheba and other subjects not to be readily distinguished in the twilight that was gathering in these antique chambers  we saw too some very old portraits of the cliffords and the thanets in black frames and the pictures themselves sadly faded and neglected  the famous countess anne of pembroke dorset and montgomery was represented on one of the leaves of a pair of folding doors and one of her husbands i believe on the other leaf  there was the picture of a little idiot lordling who had choked himself to death and a portrait of oliver cromwell who battered this old castle together with almost every other english or welsh castle that i ever saw or heard of  the housekeeper pointed out the grove of trees where his cannon were planted during the siege  there was but little furniture in the rooms amongst other articles an antique chair in which mary queen of scots is said to have rested  the housekeeper next took us into the part of the castle which has never been modernized since it was repaired after the siege of cromwell  this is a dismal series of cellars above ground with immensely thick walls letting in but scanty light and dim staircases of stone and a large hall with a vast fireplace where every particle of heat must needs have gone up chimneya chill and heartbreaking place enough  quite in the midst of this part of the castle is the courtyarda space of some thirty or forty feet in length and breadth open to the sky but shut completely in on every side by the buildings of the castle and paved over with flat stones  out of this pavement however grows a yewtree ascending to the tops of the towers and completely filling with its branches and foliage the whole open space between them  some small birdsquite a flock of themwere twittering and fluttering among the upper branches  we went upward through two or three stories of dismal roomsamong others through the ancient guardroomtill we came out on the roof of one of the towers and had a very fine view of an amphitheatre of ridgy hills which shut in and seclude the castle and the town  the upper foliage was within our reach close to the parapet of the tower so we gathered a few twigs as memorials  the housekeeper told us that the yewtree is supposed to be eight hundred years old and comparing it with other yews that i have seen i should judge that it must measure its antiquity by centuries at all events  it still seems to be in its prime  along the base of the castle on the opposite side to the entrance flows a stream sending up a pleasant murmur from among the trees  the housekeeper said it was not a stream but only a wash whatever that may be and i conjecture that it creates the motivepower of some factorylooking edifices which we saw on our first arrival at skipton  we now took our leave of the housekeeper and came homeward to our inn where i have written the foregoing pages by a bright fire but i think i write better descriptions after letting the subject lie in my mind a day or two  it is too new to be properly dealt with immediately after coming from the scene  the castle is not at all crumbly but in excellent repair though so venerable  there are rooks cawing about the shapeless patches of their nests in the tops of the trees  in the castle wall as well as in the round towers of the gateway there seem to be little tenements perhaps inhabited by the servants and dependants of the family  they looked in very good order with tokens of present domesticity about them  the whole of this old castle indeed was as neat as a new small dwelling in spite of an inevitable musty odor of antiquity   april 11ththis morning we took a carriage and two horses and set out for    bolton priory   a distance of about six miles  the morning was cool with breezy clouds intermingled with sunshine and on the whole as good as are nine tenths of english mornings  j sat beside the driver and s and i in the carriage all closed but one window  as we drove through skipton the little town had a livelier aspect than yesterday when it wore its good fridays solemnity but now its marketplace was thronged principally with butchers displaying their meat under little movable penthouses and their customers  the english people really like to think and talk of butchers meat and gaze at it with delight and they crowd through the avenues of the markethouses and stand enraptured round a dead ox  we passed along by the castle wall and noticed the escutcheon of the cliffords or the thanets carved in stone over the portal with the motto desormais the application of which i do not well see these ancestral devices usually referring more to the past than to the future  there is a large old church just at the extremity of the village and just below the castle on the slope of the hill  the gray wall of the castle extends along the road a considerable distance in good repair with here and there a buttress and the semicircular bulge of a tower  the scenery along the road was not particularly strikinglong slopes descending from ridges a generally hard outline of country with not many trees and those as yet destitute of foliage  it needs to be softened with a good deal of wood  there were stone farmhouses looking ancient and able to last till twice as old  instead of the hedges so universal in other parts of england there were stone fences of good height and painful construction made of small stones which i suppose have been picked up out of the fields through hundreds of years  they reminded me of old massachusetts though very unlike our rude stone walls which nevertheless last longer than anything else we build another new england feature was the little brooks which here and there flowed across our road rippling over the pebbles clear and bright  i fancied too an intelligence and keenness in some of the yorkshire physiognomies akin to those characteristics in my countrymens faces  we passed an ancient manygabled inn large low and comfortable bearing the name of the devonshire house as does our own hotel for the duke of devonshire is a great proprietor in these parts  a mile or so beyond we came to a gateway broken through what i believe was an old wall of the priory grounds and here we alighted leaving our driver to take the carriage to the inn  passing through this hole in the wall we saw the ruins of the priory at the bottom of the beautiful valley about a quarter of a mile off and well as the monks knew how to choose the sites of their establishments i think they never chose a better site than thisin the green lap of protecting hills beside a stream and with peace and fertility looking down upon it on every side  the view down the valley is very fine and for my part i am glad that some peaceable and comfortloving people possessed these precincts for many hundred years when nobody else knew how to appreciate peace and comfort  the old gateway tower beneath which was formerly the arched entrance into the domain of the priory is now the central part of a huntingseat of the duke of devonshire and the edifice is completed by a wing of recent date on each side  a few hundred yards from this huntingbox are the remains of the priory consisting of the nave of the old church which is still in good repair and used as the worshippingplace of the neighborhood being a perpetual curacy of the parish of skipton and the old ruined choir roofless with broken arches ivygrown but not so rich and rare a ruin as either melrose netley or furness  its situation makes its charm  it stands near the river wharfea broad and rapid stream which hurries along between high banks with a sound which the monks must have found congenial to their slumberous moods  it is a good river for trout too and i saw two or three anglers with their rods and baskets passing through the ruins towards its shore  it was in this river wharfe that the boy of egremont was drowned at the strid a mile or two higher up the stream  in the first place we rambled round the exterior of the ruins but as i have said they are rather bare and meagre in comparison with other abbeys and i am not sure that the especial care and neatness with which they are preserved does not lessen their effect on the beholder neglect wildness crumbling walls the climbing and conquering ivy masses of stone lying where they fell trees of old date growing where the pillars of the aisles used to standthese are the best points of ruined abbeys  but everything here is kept with such trimness that it gives you the idea of a petrifaction  decay is no longer triumphant the duke of devonshire has got the better of it  the grounds around the church and the ruins are still used for burial and there are several flat tombstones and altar tombs with crosiers engraved or carved upon them which at first i took to be the memorials of bishops or abbots and wondered that the sculpture should still be so distinct  on one however i read the date 1850 and the name of a layman for the tombstones were all modern the humid english atmosphere giving them their mossy look of antiquity and the crosier had been assumed only as a pretty device  close beside the ruins there is a large old stone farmhouse which must have been built on the site of a part of the priorythe cells dormitories refectory and other portions pertaining to the monks daily life i suppose and built no doubt with the sacred stones  i should imagine it would be a haunted house swarming with cowled spectres  we wished to see the interior of the church and procured a guide from this farmhousethe sexton probablya grayhaired ruddy cheery and intelligent man of familiar though respectful address  the entrance of the church was undergoing improvement under the last of the abbots when the reformation occurred and it has ever remained in an unfinished state till now it is mossy with age and has a beautiful tuft of wallflowers growing on a ledge over the gothic arch of the doorway  the body of the church is of much anterior date though the oaken roof is supposed to have been renewed in henry viiis time  this as i said before was the nave of the old abbey church and has a onesided and unbalanced aspect there being only a single aisle with its row of sturdy pillars  the pavement is covered with pews of old oak very homely and unornamental on the side opposite the aisle there are two or three windows of modern stained glass somewhat gaudy and impertinent there are likewise some hatchments and escutcheons over the altar and elsewhere  on the whole it is not an impressive interior but at any rate it had the true musty odor which i never conceived of till i came to englandthe odor of dead mens decay garnered up and shut in and kept from generation to generation not disgusting nor sickening because it is so old and of the past  on one side of the altar there was a small square chapelor what had once been a chapel separated from the chancel by a partition about a mans height if i remember aright  our guide led us into it and observed that some years ago the pavement had been taken up in this spot for burial purposes but it was found that it had already been used in that way and that the corpses had been buried upright  inquiring further i found that it was the clapham family and another that was called morley that were so buried and then it occurred to me that this was the vault wordsworth refers to in one of his poemsthe burialplace of the claphams and mauleverers whose skeletons for aught i know were even then standing upright under our feet  it is but a narrow place perhaps a square of ten feet  we saw little or nothing else that was memorable unless it were the signature of queen adelaide in a visitors book  on our way back to skipton it rained and hailed but the sun again shone out before we arrived  we took the train for leeds at half past ten and arrived there in the afternoon passing the ruined abbey of kirkstall on our way  the ruins looked more interesting than those of bolton though not so delightfully situated and now in the close vicinity of manufactories and only two or three miles from leeds  we took a dish of soup and spent a miserable hour in and about the railway station of leeds whence we departed at four and reached    york   in an hour or two  we put up at the black swan and before tea went out on the cool bright edge of evening to get a glimpse of the cathedral which impressed me more grandly than when i first saw it nearly a year ago  indeed almost any object gains upon me at the second sight  i have spent the evening in writing up my journalan act of real virtue  after walking round the cathedral we went up a narrow and crooked street very old and shabby but with an antique house projecting as much as a yard over the pavement on one sidea timber house it seemed to be plastered over and stained yellow or buff  there was no external door affording entrance into this edifice but about midway of its front we came to a low gothic stone archway passing right through the house and as it looked much timeworn and was sculptured with untraceable devices we went through  there was an exceedingly antique battered and shattered pair of oaken leaves which used doubtless to shut up the passage in former times and keep it secure but for the last centuries probably there has been free ingress and egress  indeed the portal arch may never have been closed since the reformation  within we found a quadrangle of which the house upon the street formed one side the others being composed of ancient houses with gables in a row all looking upon the paved quadrangle through quaint windows of various fashion  an elderly neat pleasantlooking woman now came in beneath the arch and as she had a look of being acquainted here we asked her what the place was and she told us that in the old popish times the prebends of the cathedral used to live here to keep them from doing mischief in the town  the establishment she said was now called the college and was let in rooms and small tenements to poor people  on consulting the york guide i find that her account was pretty correct the house having been founded in henry vis time and called st williams college the statue of the patron saint being sculptured over the arch  it was intended for the residence of the parsons and priests of the cathedral who had formerly caused troubles and scandals by living in the town  we returned to the front of the cathedral on our way homeward and an old man stopped us to inquire if we had ever seen the fiddler of york  we answered in the negative and said that we had not time to see him now but the old gentleman pointed up to the highest pinnacle of the southern front where stood the fiddler of york one of those gothic quaintnesses which blotch the grandeur and solemnity of this and other cathedrals   april 12ththis morning was bleak and most ungenial a chilly sunshine a piercing wind a prevalence of watery cloudapril weather without the tenderness that ought to be half revealed in it  this is    easter sunday   and service at the cathedral commenced at half past ten so we set out betimes and found admittance into the vast nave and thence into the choir  an attendant ushered s and j to a seat at a distance from me and then gave me a place in one of the stalls where the monks used to sit or kneel while chanting the services  i think these stalls are now appropriated to the prebends  they are of carved oaken wood much less elaborate and wonderfully wrought than those of chester cathedral where all was done with head and heart each a separate device instead of cut by machinery like this  the whole effect of this carved work however lining the choir with its light tracery and pinnacles is very fine  the whole choir from the roof downward except the old stones of the outer walls is of modern renovation it being but a few years since this part of the cathedral was destroyed by fire  the arches and pillars and lofty roof however have been well restored and there was a vast east window full of painted glass which if it be modern is wonderfully chaste and gothiclike  all the other windows have painted glass which does not flare and glare as if newly painted but the light whitewashed aspect of the general interior of the choir has a cold and dreary effect  there is an enormous organ all clad in rich oaken carving of similar pattern to that of the stalls  it was communion day and near the high altar within a screen i saw the glistening of the gold vessels wherewith the services were to be performed  the choir was respectably filled with a pretty numerous congregation among whom i saw some officers in full dress with their swords by their sides and one old whitebearded warrior who sat near me seemed very devout at his religious exercises  in front of me and on the corresponding benches on the other side of the choir sat two rows of whiterobed choristers twenty in all and these with some women performed the vocal part of the music  it is not good to see musicians for they are sometimes coarse and vulgar people and so the auditor loses faith in any fine and spiritual tones that they may breathe forth  the services of easter sunday comprehend more than the ordinary quantity of singing and chanting at all events nearly an hour and a half were thus employed with some intermixture of prayers and reading of scriptures and being almost congealed with cold i thought it would never come to an end  the spirit of my puritan ancestors was mighty within me and i did not wonder at their being out of patience with all this mummery which seemed to me worse than papistry because it was a corruption of it  at last a canon gave out the text and preached a sermon about twenty minutes longthe coldest driest most superficial rubbish for this gorgeous setting of the magnificent cathedral the elaborate music and the rich ceremonies seem inevitably to take the life out of the sermon which to be anything must be all  the puritans showed their strength of mind and heart by preferring a sermon an hour and a half long into which the preacher put his whole soul and lopping away all these externals into which religious life had first leafed and flowered and then petrified  after the service while waiting for my wife in the nave i was accosted by a young gentleman who seemed to be an american and whom i have certainly seen before but whose name i could not recollect  this he said was his first visit to york and he was evidently inclined to join me in viewing the curiosities of the place but not knowing his name i could not introduce him to my wife and so made a parting salute  after dinner we set forth and took a promenade along the wall and a ramble through some of the crooked streets noting the old juttingstoried houses story above story and the old churches gnawed like a bone by the tooth of time till we came suddenly to the black swan before we expected it     i rather fancy that i must have observed most of the external peculiarities at my former visit and therefore need not make another record of them in this journal  in the course of our walk we saw a procession of about fifty charityschool boys in flat caps each with bands under his chin and a green collar to his coat all looking unjoyous and as if they had no home nor parents love  they turned into a gateway which closed behind them and as the adjoining edifice seemed to be a public institutionat least not privatewe asked what it was and found it to be a hospital or residence for old maiden ladies founded by a gentlewoman of york i know not whether she herself is of the sisterhood  it must be a very singular institution and worthy of intimate study if it were possible to make ones way within the portal  after writing the above j and i went out for another ramble before tea and taking a new course we came to a grated iron fence and gateway through which we could see the ruins of st marys abbey  they are very extensive and situated quite in the midst of the city and the wall and then a tower of the abbey seem to border more than one of the streets  our walk was interesting as it brought us unexpectedly upon several relics of antiquitya loopholed and battlemented gateway and at various points fragments of the old gothic stonework built in among more recent edifices which themselves were old grimness intermixed with quaintness and grotesqueness old fragments of religious or warlike architecture mingled with queer domestic structuresthe general effect sombre sordid and grimy but yet with a fascination that makes us fain to linger about such scenes and come to them again  we passed round the cathedral and saw jackdaws fluttering round the pinnacles while the bells chimed the quarters and little children played on the steps under the grand arch of the entrance  it is very stately very beautiful this minster and doubtless would be very satisfactory could i only know it long and well enoughso rich as its front is even with almost all the niches empty of their statues not stern in its effect which i suppose must be owing to the elaborate detail with which its great surface is wrought all over like the chasing of a ladys jewelbox and yet so grand  there is a dwellinghouse on one side gray with antiquity which has apparently grown out of it like an excrescence and though a goodsized edifice yet the cathedral is so large that its vastness is not in the least deformed by it  if it be a dwellinghouse i suppose it is inhabited by the person who takes care of the cathedral  this morning while listening to the tedious chanting and lukewarm sermon i depreciated the whole affair cathedral and all but now i do more justice at least to the latter and am only sorry that its noble echoes must follow at every syllable and rereverberate at the commas and semicolons such poor discourses as the canons  but after all it was the puritans who made the sermon of such importance in religious worship as we newenglanders now consider it and we are absurd in considering this magnificent church and all those embroidered ceremonies only in reference to it  before going back to the hotel i went again up the narrow and twisted passage of college street to take another glance at st williams college  i underestimated the projection of the front over the street it is considerably more than three feet and is about eight or nine feet above the pavement  the little statue of st william is an altorelievo over the arched entrance and has an escutcheon of arms on each side all much defaced  in the interior of the quadrangle the houses have not gables nor peaked fronts but have peaked windows on the redtiled roofs the doorway opposite the entrancearch is rather stately and on one side is a large projecting window which is said to belong to the room where the printingpress of charles i was established in the days of the parliament    the minster   monday april 13ththis morning was chill and worse it was showery so that our purposes to see york were much thwarted  at about ten oclock however we took a cab and drove to the cathedral where we arrived while service was going on in the choir and ropes were put up as barriers between us and the nave so that we were limited to the south transept and a part of one of the aisles of the choir  it was dismally cold  we crept cheerlessly about within our narrow precincts narrow that is to say in proportion to the vast length and breadth of the cathedral gazing up into the hollow height of the central tower and looking at a monumental brass fastened against one of the pillars representing a beruffed lady of the tudor times and at the canopied tomb of archbishop de grey who ruled over the diocese in the thirteenth century  then we went into the side aisle of the choir where there were one or two modern monuments and i was appalled to find that a sermon was being preached by the ecclesiastic of the day nor were there any signs of an imminent termination  i am not aware that there was much pith in the discourse but there was certainly a good deal of labor and earnestness in the preachers mode of delivery although when he came to a close it appeared that the audience was not more than half a dozen people  the barriers being now withdrawn we walked adown the length of the nave which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which i have had of it since my visit of a year ago  but my preimaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things and so create disappointments for me while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than i imagine or remember it  we engaged an old man one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral to be our guide and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir with its sculptured kings of england and then the tombs in the north transept one of a modern archbishop and one of an ancient one behind which the insane person who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall  then our guide unlocked a side door and led us into the chapterhousean octagonal hall with a vaulted roof a tessellated floor and seven arched windows of old painted glass the richest that i ever saw or imagined each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning  what would they be with the sun shining through them with all their brilliancy moreover they were as soft as roseleaves i never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapterhouse at least i thought so while i was looking at it and think so still and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows i remember looking at these windows from the outside yesterday and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved  returning into the body of the cathedral we next entered the choir where instead of the crimson cushions and draperies which we had seen yesterday we found everything folded in black  it was a token of mourning for one of the canons who died on saturday night  the great east window seventyfive feet high and full of old painted glass in many exquisitely wrought and imagined scriptural designs is considered the most splendid object in the minster  it is a pity that it is partially hidden from view even in the choir by a screen before the high altar but indeed the gothic architects seem first to imagine beautiful and noble things and then to consider how they may best be partially screened from sight  a certain secrecy and twilight effect belong to their plan  we next went round the side aisles of the choir which contain many interesting monuments of prelates and a specimen of the very common elizabethan design of an old gentleman in a double ruff and trunk breeches with one of his two wives on either side of him all kneeling in prayer and their conjoint children in two rows kneeling in the lower compartments of the tomb  we saw too a rich marble monument of one of the strafford family and the tombstone of the famous earl himselfa flat tombstone in the pavement of the aisle covering the vault where he was buried and with four iron rings fastened into the four corners of the stone whereby to lift it  and now the guide led us into the vestry where there was a good fire burning in the grate and it really thawed my heart which was congealed with the dismal chill of the cathedral  here we saw a good many curious thingsfor instance two wooden figures in knightly armor which had stood sentinels beside the ancient clock before it was replaced by a modern one and opening a closet the guide produced an old iron helmet which had been found in a tomb where a knight had been buried in his armor and three gold rings and one brass one taken out of the graves and off the fingerbones of mediaeval archbishopsone of them with a ruby set in it and two silvergilt chalices also treasures of the tombs and a wooden head carved in human likeness and painted to the life likewise taken from a grave where an archbishop was supposed to have been buried  they found no veritable skull nor bones but only this blockhead as if death had betrayed the secret of what the poor prelate really was  we saw too a canopy of cloth wrought with gold threads which had been borne over the head of king james i when he came to york on his way to receive the english crown  there were also some old brass dishes in which pence used to be collected in monkish times  over the door of this vestry were hung two banners of a yorkshire regiment tattered in the peninsular wars and inscribed with the names of the battles through which they had been borne triumphantly and waterloo was among them  the vestry i think occupies that excrescential edifice which i noticed yesterday as having grown out of the cathedral  after looking at these things we went down into the crypts under the choir  these were very interesting as far as we could see them being more antique than anything above ground but as dark as any cellar there is here in the midst of these sepulchral crypts a spring of water said to be very pure and delicious owing to the limestone through which the rain that feeds its source is filtered  near it is a stone trough in which the monks used to wash their hands  i do not remember anything more that we saw at the cathedral and at noon we returned to the black swan  the rain still continued so that s could not share in any more of my rambles but j and i went out again and discovered the guildhall  it is a very ancient edifice of richard iis time and has a statue over the entrance which looks timegnawed enough to be of coeval antiquity although in reality it is only a representation of george ii in his royal robes  we went in and found ourselves in a large and lofty hall with an oaken roof and a stone pavement and the farther end was partitioned off as a court of justice in that portion of the hall the judge was on the bench and a trial was going forward but in the hither portion a mob of people with their hats on were lounging and talking and enjoying the warmth of the stoves the window over the judgmentseat had painted glass in it and so i think had some of the hall windows  at the end of the hall hung a great picture of paul defending himself before agrippa where the apostle looked like an athlete and had a remarkably bushy black beard  between two of the windows hung an indian bell from burmah ponderously thick and massive  both the picture and the bell had been presented to the city as tokens of affectionate remembrance by its children and it is pleasant to think that such failings exist in these old stable communities and that there are permanent localities where such gifts can be kept from generation to generation  at four oclock we left the city of york still in a pouring rain  the black swan where we had been staying is a good specimen of the old english inn sombre quiet with dark staircases dingy rooms curtained bedsall the possibilities of a comfortable life and good english fare in a fashion which cannot have been much altered for half a century  it is very homelike when one has ones family about him but must be prodigiously stupid for a solitary man  we took the train for manchester over pretty much the same route that i travelled last year  many of the higher hills in yorkshire were white with snow which in our lower region softened into rain but as we approached manchester the western sky reddened and gave promise of better weather  we arrived at nearly eight oclock and put up at the palatine hotel  in the evening i scrawled away at my journal till past ten oclock for i have really made it a matter of conscience to keep a tolerably full record of my travels though conscious that everything good escapes in the process  in the morning we went out and visited the    manchester cathedral   a particularly black and grimy edifice containing some genuine old wood carvings within the choir  we stayed a good while in order to see some people married  one couple with their groomsman and bridesmaid were sitting within the choir but when the clergyman was robed and ready there entered five other couples each attended by groomsman and bridesmaid  they all were of the lower orders one or two respectably dressed but most of them povertystrickenthe men in their ordinary loafers or laborers attire the women with their poor shabby shawls drawn closely about them faded untimely wrinkled with penury and care nothing fresh virginlike or hopeful about them joining themselves to their mates with the idea of making their own misery less intolerable by adding anothers to it  all the six couple stood up in a row before the altar with the groomsmen and bridesmaids in a row behind them and the clergyman proceeded to marry them in such a way that it almost seemed to make every man and woman the husband and wife of every other however there were some small portions of the service directed towards each separate couple and they appeared to assort themselves in their own fashion afterwards each one saluting his bride with a kiss  the clergyman the sexton and the clerk all seemed to find something funny in this affair and the woman who admitted us into the church smiled too when she told us that a weddingparty was waiting to be married  but i think it was the saddest thing we have seen since leaving home though funny enough if one likes to look at it from a ludicrous point of view this mob of poor marriages was caused by the fact that no marriage fee is paid during easter  this ended the memorable things of our tour for my wife and j left manchester for southport and i for liverpool before noon   april 19thon the 15th having been invited to attend at the laying of the cornerstone of    mr brownes free library   i went to the town hall according to the programme at eleven oclock there was already a large number of people invited guests members of the historical society and other local associations assembled in the great hallroom and one of these was delivering an address to mr browne as i entered  approaching the outer edge of the circle i was met and cordially greeted by monckton milnes whom i like and who always reminds me of longfellow though his physical man is more massive  while we were talking together a young man approached him with a pretty little expression of surprise and pleasure at seeing him there  he had a slightly affected or madeup manner and was rather a comely person  mr milnes introduced him to me as lord   hereupon of course i observed him more closely and i must say that i was not long in discovering a gentle dignity and halfimperceptible reserve in his manner but still my first impression was quite as real as my second one he occupies i suppose the foremost position among the young men of england and has the fairest prospects of a high course before him nevertheless he did not impress me as possessing the native qualities that could entitle him to a high public career  he has adopted public life as his hereditary profession and makes the very utmost of all his abilities cultivating himself to a determined end knowing that he shall have every advantage towards attaining his object  his natural disadvantages must have been in some respects unusually great his voice for instance is not strong and appeared to me to have a more positive defect than mere weakness  doubtless he has struggled manfully against this defect and it made me feel a certain sympathy and indeed a friendliness for which he would not at all have thanked me had he known it  i felt in his person what a burden it is upon human shoulders the necessity of keeping up the fame and historical importance of an illustrious house at least when the heir to its honors has sufficient intellect and sensibility to feel the claim that his country and his ancestors and his posterity all have upon him  lord  is fully capable of feeling these claims but i would not care methinks to take his position unless i could have considerably more than his strength  in a little while we formed ourselves into a procession four in a row and set forth from the town hall through james street lord street lime street all the way through a line of policemen and a throng of people and all the windows were alive with heads and i never before was so conscious of a great mass of humanity though perhaps i may often have seen as great a crowd  but a procession is the best point of view from which to see the crowd that collects together  the day too was very fine even sunshiny and the streets drya blessing which cannot be overestimated for we should have been in a strange trim for the banquet had we been compelled to wade through the ordinary mud of liverpool  the procession itself could not have been a very striking object  in america it would have had a hundred picturesque and perhaps ludicrous featuresthe symbols of the different trades banners with strange devices flowershows children volunteer soldiers cavalcades and every suitable and unsuitable contrivance but we were merely a trail of ordinarylooking individuals in greatcoats and with precautionary umbrellas  the only characteristic or professional costume as far as i noticed was that of the bishop of chester in his flat cap and blacksilk gown and that of sir henry smith the general of the district in full uniform with a star and half a dozen medals on his breast  mr browne himself the hero of the day was the plainest and simplest man of allan exceedingly unpretending gentleman in black small whitehaired pale quiet and respectable  i rather wondered why he chose to be the centre of all this ceremony for he did not seem either particularly to enjoy it or to be at all incommoded by it as a more nervous and susceptible man might have been  the site of the projected edifice is on one of the streets bordering on st georges hall and when we came within the enclosure the cornerstone a large square of red freestone was already suspended over its destined place  it has a brass plate let into it with an inscription which will perhaps not be seen again till the present english type has grown as antique as blackletter is now  two or three photographs were now taken of the site the cornerstone mr browne the distinguished guests and the crowd at large then ensued a prayer from the bishop of chester and speeches from mr holme mr browne lord  sir john pakington sir henry smith and as many others as there was time for  lord  acquitted himself very creditably though brought out unexpectedly and with evident reluctance  i am convinced that men liable to be called on to address the public keep a constant supply of commonplaces in their minds which with little variation can be adapted to one subject about as well as to another and thus they are always ready to do well enough though seldom to do particularly well  from the scene of the cornerstone we went to st georges hall where a drawingroom and dressingroom had been prepared for the principal guests  before the banquet i had some conversation with sir james kay shuttleworth who had known miss bronte very intimately and bore testimony to the wonderful fidelity of mrs gaskells life of her  he seemed to have had an affectionate regard for her and said that her marriage promised to have been productive of great happiness her husband being not a remarkable man but with the merit of an exceeding love for her  mr browne now took me up into the gallery which by this time was full of ladies and thence we had a fine view of the noble hall with the tables laid in readiness for the banquet  i cannot conceive of anything finer than this hall it needs nothing but painted windows to make it perfect and those i hope it may have one day or another  at two oclock we sat down to the banquet which hardly justified that name being only a cold collation though sufficiently splendid in its way  in truth it would have been impossible to provide a hot dinner for nine hundred people in a place remote from kitchens  the principal table extended lengthwise of the hall and was a little elevated above the other tables which stretched across about twenty in all  before each guest besides the bill of fare was laid a programme of the expected toasts among which appeared my own name to be proposed by mr monckton milnes  these things do not trouble me quite as much as they used though still it sufficed to prevent much of the enjoyment which i might have had if i could have felt myself merely a spectator  my lefthand neighbor was colonel campbell of the artillery my righthand one was mr picton of the library committee and i found them both companionable men especially the colonel who had served in china and in the crimea and owned that he hated the french  we did not make a very long business of the eatables and then came the usual toasts of ceremony and afterwards those more peculiar to the occasion one of the first of which was the house of stanley to which lord  responded  it was a noble subject giving scope for as much eloquence as any man could have brought to bear upon it and capable of being so wrought out as to develop and illustrate any sort of conservative or liberal tendencies which the speaker might entertain  there could not be a richer opportunity for reconciling and making friends betwixt the old system of society and the new but lord  did not seem to make anything of it i remember nothing that he said excepting his statement that the family had been five hundred years connected with the town of liverpool  i wish i could have responded to the house of stanley and his lordship could have spoken in my behalf  none of the speeches were remarkably good the bishop of chesters perhaps the best though he is but a little man in aspect not at all filling up ones idea of a bishop and the rest were on an indistinguishable level though being all practised speakers they were less humy and hay than english orators ordinarily are  i was really tired to death before my own turn came sitting all that time as it were on the scaffold with the rope round my neck  at last monckton milnes was called up and made a speech of which to my dismay i could hardly hear a single word owing to his being at a considerable distance on the other side of the chairman and flinging his voice which is a bass one across the hall instead of adown it in my direction  i could not distinguish one word of any allusions to my works nor even when he came to the toast did i hear the terms in which he put it nor whether i was toasted on my own basis or as representing american literature or as consul of the united states  at all events there was a vast deal of clamor and uprose peers and bishop general mayor knights and gentlemen everybody in the hall greeting me with all the honors  i had uprisen too to commence my speech but had to sit down again till matters grew more quiet and then i got up and proceeded to deliver myself with as much composure as i ever felt at my own fireside  it is very strange this selfpossession and clearsightedness which i have experienced when standing before an audience showing me my way through all the difficulties resulting from my not having heard monckton milness speech and on since reading the latter i do not see how i could have answered it better  my speech certainly was better cheered than any other especially one passage where i made a colossus of mr browne at which the audience grew so tumultuous in their applause that they drowned my figure of speech before it was half out of my mouth  after rising from table lord  and i talked about our respective oratorical performances and he appeared to have a perception that he is not naturally gifted in this respect  i like lord  and wish that it were possible that we might know one another better  if a nobleman has any true friend out of his own class it ought to be a republican nothing further of interest happened at the banquet and the next morning came out the newspapers with the reports of my speech attributing to me a variety of forms of ragged nonsense which poor speaker as i am i was quite incapable of uttering   may 10ththe winter is over but as yet we scarcely have what ought to be called spring nothing but cold eastwinds accompanied with sunshine however as eastwinds generally are in this country  all milder winds seem to bring rain  the grass has been green for a monthindeed it has never been entirely brownand now the trees and hedges are beginning to be in foliage  weeks ago the daisies bloomed even in the sandy grassplot bordering on the promenade beneath our front windows and in the progress of the daisy and towards its consummation i saw the propriety of burnss epithet wee modest crimsonnipped flowerits little white petals in the bud being fringed all round with crimson which fades into pure white when the flower blooms  at the beginning of this month i saw fruittrees in blossom stretched out flat against stone walls reminding me of a dead bird nailed against the side of a barn but it has been a backward and dreary spring and i think southport in the course of it has lost its advantage over the rest of the liverpool neighborhood in point of milder atmosphere  the eastwind feels even rawer here than in the city  nevertheless the columns of the southport visitor begin to be well replenished with the names of guests and the town is assuming its aspect of summer life  to say the truth except where cultivation has done its utmost there is very little difference between winter and summer in the mere material aspect of southport there being nothing but a waste of sand intermixed with plashy pools to seaward and a desert of sandhillocks on the land side  but now the brown weatherhardened donkeywomen haunt people that stray along the reaches and delicate persons face the cold rasping illtempered blast on the promenade and children dig in the sands and for want of something better it seems to be determined that this shall be considered spring  southport is as stupid a place as i ever lived in and i cannot but bewail our ill fortune to have been compelled to spend so many months on these barren sands when almost every other square yard of england contains something that would have been historically or poetically interesting  our life here has been a blank  there was indeed a shipwreck a month or two ago when a large ship came ashore within a mile from our windows the larger portion of the crew landing safely on the hither sands while six or seven betook themselves to the boat and were lost in attempting to gain the shore on the other side of the ribble  after a lapse of several weeks two or three of their drowned bodies were found floating in this vicinity and brought to southport for burial so that it really is not at all improbable that miltons lycidas floated hereabouts in the rise and lapse of the tides and that his bones may still be whitening among the sands  in the same gale that wrecked the abovementioned vessel a portion of a ships mast was driven ashore after evidently having been a very long time in and under water for it was covered with great barnacles and torn seaweed insomuch that there was scarcely a bare place along its whole length clusters of seaanemones were sticking to it and i know not what strange marine productions besides  j at once recognized the seaanemones knowing them by his much reading of gosses aquarium and though they must now have been two or three days high and dry out of water he made an extempore aquarium out of a bowl and put in above a dozen of these strange creatures  in a little while they bloomed out wonderfully and even seemed to produce young anemones but from some fault in his management they afterwards grew sickly and died  s thinks that the old stormshattered mast so studded with the growth of the ocean depths is a relic of the spanish armada which strewed its wrecks along all the shores of england but i hardly think it would have taken three hundred years to produce this crop of barnacles and seaanemones  a single summer might probably have done it  yesterday we all of us except r went to liverpool to see the performances of an american circus company  i had previously been a day or two before with j and had been happy to perceive that the fact of its being an american establishment really induced some slight swelling of the heart within me  it is ridiculous enough to be sure but i like to find myself not wholly destitute of this noble weakness patriotism  as for the circus i never was fond of that species of entertainment nor do i find in this one the flash and glitter and whirl which i remember in other american exhibitions  here follow the visits to lincoln and boston printed in our old home ed   may 27thwe left boston by railway at noon and arrived in peterborough in about an hour and a quarter and have put up at the railway hotel after dinner we walked into the town to see    the cathedral   of the towers and arches of which we had already had a glimpse from our parlor window  our journey from boston hitherward was through a perfectly level countrythe fens of lincolnshiregreen green and nothing else with old villages and farmhouses and old churchtowers very pleasant and rather wearisomely monotonous  to return to peterborough  it is a town of ancient aspect and we passed on our way towards the marketplace a very ancientlooking church with a very far projecting porch opening in front and on each side through arches of broad sweep  the street by which we approached from our hotel led us into the marketplace which had what looked like an old guildhall on one side  on the opposite side above the houses appeared the towers of the cathedral and a street leads from the marketplace to its front through an arched gateway which used to be the external entrance to the abbey i suppose of which the cathedral was formerly the church  the front of the cathedral is very striking and unlike any other that i have seen being formed by three lofty and majestic arches in a row with three gable peaks above them forming a sort of colonnade within which is the western entrance of the nave  the towers are massive but low in proportion to their bulk  there are no spires but pinnacles and statues and all the rich detail of gothic architecture the whole of a venerable gray line  it is in perfect repair and has not suffered externally except by the loss of multitudes of statues gargoyles and miscellaneous eccentricities of sculpture which used to smile frown laugh and weep over the faces of these old fabrics  we entered through a side portal and sat down on a bench in the nave and kept ourselves quiet for the organ was sounding and the choristers were chanting in the choir  the nave and transepts are very noble with clustered pillars and norman arches and a great height under the central tower the whole however being covered with plaster and whitewash except the roof which is of painted oak  this latter adornment has the merit i believe of being veritably ancient but certainly i should prefer the oak of its native hue for the effect of the paint is to make it appear as if the ceiling were covered with imitation mosaicwork or an oilcloth carpet  after sitting awhile we were invited by a verger who came from within the screen to enter the choir and hear the rest of the service  we found the choristers there in their white garments and an audience of half a dozen people and had time to look at the interior of the choir all the carved woodwork of the tabernacle the bishops throne the prebends stalls and whatever else is modern for this cathedral seems to have suffered wofully from cromwells soldiers who hacked at the old oak and hammered and pounded upon the marble tombs till nothing of the first and very few of the latter remain  it is wonderful how suddenly the english people lost their sense of the sanctity of all manner of externals in religion without losing their religion too  the french in their revolution underwent as sudden a change but they became pagans and atheists and threw away the substance with the shadow  i suspect that the interior arrangement of the choir and the chancel has been greatly modernized for it is quite unlike anything that i have seen elsewhere  instead of one vast eastern window there are rows of windows lighting the lady chapel and seen through rows of arches in the screen of the chancel the effect being whoever is to have the credit of it very rich and beautiful  there is i think no stained glass in the windows of the nave though in the windows of the chancel there is some of recent date and from fragments of veritable antique  the effect of the whole interior is grand expansive and both ponderous and airy not dim mysterious and involved as gothic interiors often are the roundness and openness of the arches being opposed to this latter effect  when the chanting came to a close one verger took his stand at the entrance of the choir and another stood farther up the aisle and then the door of a stall opened and forth came a clerical dignity of much breadth and substance aged and infirm and was ushered out of the choir with a great deal of ceremony  we took him for the bishop but he proved to be only a canon  we now engaged an attendant to show us through the lady chapel and the other penetralia which it did not take him long to accomplish  one of the first things he showed us was the tombstone in the pavement of the southern aisle beneath which mary queen of scots had been originally buried and where she lay for a quarter of a century till borne to her present restingplace in westminster abbey  it is a plain marble slab with no inscription  near this there was a saxon monument of the date 870 with sculpture in relief upon itthe memorial of an abbot hedda who was killed by the danes when they destroyed the monastery that preceded the abbey and church  i remember likewise the recumbent figure of the prelate whose face has been quite obliterated by puritanic violence and i think that there is not a single tomb older than the parliamentary wars which has not been in like manner battered and shattered except the saxon abbots just mentioned  the most pretentious monument remaining is that of a mr deacon a gentleman of george is time in wig and breeches leaning on his elbow and resting one hand upon a skull  in the north aisle precisely opposite to that of queen mary the attendant pointed out to us the slab beneath which lie the ashes of catharine of aragon the divorced queen of henry viii  in the nave there was an ancient font a venerable and beautiful relic which has been repaired not long ago but in such a way as not to lessen its individuality  this sacred vessel suffered especial indignity from cromwells soldiers insomuch that if anything could possibly destroy its sanctity they would have effected that bad end  on the eastern wall of the nave and near the entrance hangs the picture of old scarlet the sexton who buried both mary of scotland and catharine of aragon and not only these two queens but everybody else in peterborough twice over  i think one feels a sort of enmity and spite against these gravediggers who live so long and seem to contract a kindred and partnership with death being boon companions with him and taking his part against mankind  in a chapel or some side apartment there were two pieces of tapestry wretchedly faded the handiwork of two nuns and copied from two of raphaels cartoons  we now emerged from the cathedral and walked round its exterior admiring it to our utmost capacity and all the more because we had not heard of it beforehand and expected to see nothing so huge majestic grand and gray  and of all the lovely closes that i ever beheld that of peterborough cathedral is to me the most delightful so quiet it is so solemnly and nobly cheerful so verdant so sweetly shadowed and so presided over by the stately minster and surrounded by ancient and comely habitations of christian men  the most enchanting place the most enviable as a residence in all this world seemed to me that of the bishops secretary standing in the rear of the cathedral and bordering on the churchyard so that you pass through hallowed precincts in order to come at it and find it a paradise the holier and sweeter for the dead men who sleep so near  we looked through the gateway into the lawn which really seemed hardly to belong to this world so bright and soft the sunshine was so fresh the grass so lovely the trees so trained and refined and mellowed down was the whole nature of the spot and so shut in and guarded from all intrusion  it is in vain to write about it nowhere but in england can there be such a spot nor anywhere but in the close of peterborough cathedral   may 28thi walked up into the town this morning and again visited the cathedral  on the way i observed the falcon inn a very oldfashioned hostelry with a thatched roof and what looked like the barn door or stable door in a side front  very likely it may have been an inn ever since queen elizabeths time  the guildhall as i supposed it to be in the marketplace has a basement story entirely open on all sides but from its upper story it communicates with a large old house in the rear i have not seen an olderlooking town than peterborough but there is little that is picturesque about it except within the domain of the cathedral  it was very fortunate for the beauty and antiquity of these precincts that henry viii did not suffer the monkish edifices of the abbey to be overthrown and utterly destroyed as was the case with so many abbeys at the reformation but converting the abbey church into a cathedral he preserved much of the other arrangement of the buildings connected with it  and so it happens that to this day we have the massive and stately gateway with its great pointed arch still keeping out the world from those who have inherited the habitations of the old monks for though the gate is never closed one feels himself in a sacred seclusion the instant he passes under the archway  and everywhere there are old houses that appear to have been adapted from the monkish residences or from their spacious offices and made into convenient dwellings for ecclesiastics or vergers or great or small people connected with the cathedral and with all modern comfort they still retain much of the quaintness of the olden timearches even rows of arcades pillars walls beautified with patches of gothic sculpture not wilfully put on by modern taste but lingering from a long past deep niches let into the fronts of houses and occupied by images of saints a growth of ivy overspreading walls and just allowing the windows to peep throughso that no novelty nor anything of our hard ugly and actual life comes into these limits through the defences of the gateway without being mollified and modified  except in some of the old colleges of oxford i have not seen any other place that impressed me in this way and the grounds of peterborough cathedral have the advantage over even the oxford colleges insomuch that the life is here domesticthat of the family that of the affectionsa natural life which one deludes himself with imagining may be made into something sweeter and purer in this beautiful spot than anywhere else  doubtless the inhabitants find it a stupid and tiresome place enough and get morbid and sulky and heavy and obtuse of head and heart with the monotony of their life  but still i must needs believe that a man with a full mind and objects to employ his affection ought to be very happy here  and perhaps the forms and appliances of human life are never fit to make people happy until they cease to be used for the purposes for which they were directly intended and are taken as it were in a sidelong application  i mean that the monks probably never enjoyed their own edifices while they were a part of the actual life of the day so much as these present inhabitants now enjoy them when a new use has grown up apart from the original one  towards noon we all walked into the town again and on our way went into the old church with the projecting portal which i mentioned yesterday a woman came hastening with the keys when she saw us looking up at the door  the interior had an exceeding musty odor and was very ancient with side aisles opening by a row of pointed arches into the nave and a gallery of wood on each side and built across the two rows of arches it was paved with tombstones and i suppose the dead people contributed to the musty odor  very naked and unadorned it was except with a few mural monuments of no great interest  we stayed but a little while and amply rewarded the poor woman with a sixpence  thence we proceeded to the cathedral pausing by the way to look at the old guildhall which is no longer a guildhall but a buttermarket and then we bought some prints of exterior and interior views of the minster of which there are a great variety on notepaper lettersheets large engravings and lithographs  it is very beautiful there seems to be nothing better than to say this over again  we found the doors most hospitably open and every part entirely free to usa kindness and liberality which we have nowhere else experienced in england whether as regards cathedrals or any other public buildings  my wife sat down to draw the font and i walked through the lady chapel meanwhile pausing over the empty bed of queen mary and the grave of queen catharine and looking at the rich and sumptuous roof where a fountain as it were of groins of arches spouts from numberless pilasters intersecting one another in glorious intricacy  under the central tower opening to either transept to the nave and to the choir are four majestic arches which i think must equal in height those of which i saw the ruins and one all but perfect at furness abbey  they are about eighty feet high  i may as well give up peterborough here though i hate to leave it undescribed even to the tufts of yellow flowers which grow on the projections high out of reach where the winds have sown their seeds in soil made by the aged decay of the edifice  i could write a page too about the rooks or jackdaws that flit and clamor about the pinnacles and dart in and out of the eyeletholes the piercingswhatever they are calledin the turrets and buttresses  on our way back to the hotel j saw an advertisement of some knights in armor that were to tilt today so he and i waited and by and by a procession appeared passing through the antique marketplace and in front of the abbey gateway which might have befitted the same spot three hundred years ago  they were about twenty menatarms on horseback with lances and banners  we were a little too near for the full enjoyment of the spectacle for though some of the armor was real i could not help observing that other suits were made of silver paper or gold tinsel  a policeman a queer anomaly in reference to such a mediaeval spectacle told us that they were going to joust and run at the ring in a field a little beyond the bridge    to nottingham   may 28thwe left peterborough this afternoon and however reluctant to leave the cathedral we were glad to get away from the hotel for though outwardly pretentious it is a wretched and uncomfortable place with scanty table poor attendance and enormous charges  the first stage of our journey today was to grantham through a country the greater part of which was as level as the lincolnshire landscapes have been throughout our experience of them  we saw several old villages gathered round their several churches and one of these little communities little byforth had a very primitive appearancea group of twenty or thirty dwellings of stone and thatch without a house among them that could be so modern as a hundred years  it is a little wearisome to think of people living from century to century in the same spot going in and out of the same doors cultivating the same fields meeting the same faces and marrying one another over and over again and going to the same church and lying down in the same churchyardto appear again and go through the same monotonous round in the next generation  at grantham our route branches off from the main line and there was a delay of about an hour during which we walked up into the town to take a nearer view of a tall gray steeple which we saw from the railway station  the streets that led from the station were poor and commonplace and indeed a railway seems to have the effect of making its own vicinity mean  we noticed nothing remarkable until we got to the marketplace in the centre of which there is a cross doubtless of great antiquity though it is in too good condition not to have been recently repaired  it consists of an upright pillar with a pedestal of half a dozen stone steps which are worn hollow by the many feet that have scraped their hobnailed shoes upon them  among these feet it is highly probable may have been those of sir isaac newton who was a scholar of the free school of this town and when j scampered up the steps we told him so  visible from the marketplace also stands the angel inn which seems to be a wonderfully old inn being adorned with gargoyles and other antique sculpture with projecting windows and an arched entrance and presenting altogether a frontispiece of so much venerable state that i feel curious to know its history  had i been aware that the chief hotel of grantham were such a timehonored establishment i should have arranged to pass the night there especially as there were interesting objects enough in the town to occupy us pleasantly  the churchthe steeple of which is seen over the marketplace but is removed from it by a street or twois very fine the tower and spire being adorned with arches canopies and nichestwelve of the latter for the twelve apostles all of whom have now vanishedand with fragments of other gothic ornaments  the jackdaws have taken up their abodes in the crevices and crannies of the upper half of the steeple  we left grantham at nearly seven and reached    nottingham   just before eight  the castle situated on a high and precipitous rock directly over the edge of which look the walls was visible as we drove from the station to our hotel  we followed the advice of a railway attendant in going first to the may pole which proved to be a commercial inn with the air of a drinkingshop in a byalley and furthermore they could not take us in  so we drove to the george the fourth which seems to be an excellent house and here i have remained quiet the size of the town discouraging me from going out in the twilight which was fast coming on after tea  these are glorious long days for travel daylight fairly between four in the morning and nine at night and a margin of twilight on either side   may 29thafter breakfast this morning i wandered out and lost myself but at last found the postoffice and a letter from mr wilding with some perplexing intelligence  nottingham is an unlovely and uninteresting town  the castle i did not see but i happened upon a large and stately old church almost cathedralic in its dimensions  on returning to the hotel we deliberated on the mode of getting to newstead abbey and we finally decided upon taking a fly in which conveyance accordingly we set out before twelve  it was a slightly overcast day about half intermixed of shade and sunshine and rather cool but not so cool that we could exactly wish it warmer  our drive to newstead lay through what was once a portion of sherwood forest though all of it i believe has now become private property and is converted into fertile fields except where the owners of estates have set out plantations  we have now passed out of the fencountry and the land rises and falls in gentle swells presenting a pleasant but not striking character of scenery  i remember no remarkable object on the roadhere and there an old inn a gentlemans seat of moderate pretension a great deal of tall and continued hedge a quiet english greenness and rurality till drawing near    newstead abbey   we began to see copious plantations principally of firs larches and trees of that order looking very sombre though with some intermingling of lighter foliage  it was after one when we reached the huta small modern wayside inn almost directly across the road from the entrancegate of newstead  the postboy calls the distance ten miles from nottingham  he also averred that it was forbidden to drive visitors within the gates so we left the fly at the inn and set out to walk from the entrance to the house  there is no porters lodge and the grounds in this outlying region had not the appearance of being very primly kept but were well wooded with evergreens and much overgrown with ferns serving for cover for hares which scampered in and out of their hidingplaces  the road went winding gently along and at the distance of nearly a mile brought us to a second gate through which we likewise passed and walked onward a good way farther seeing much wood but as yet nothing of the abbey  at last through the trees we caught a glimpse of its battlements and saw too the gleam of water and then appeared the abbeys venerable front  it comprises the western wall of the church which is all that remains of that fabrica great central window entirely empty without tracery or mullions the ivy clambering up on the inside of the wall and hanging over in front  the front of the inhabited part of the house extends along on a line with this church wall rather low with battlements along its top and all in good keeping with the ruinous remnant  we met a servant who replied civilly to our inquiries about the mode of gaining admittance and bade us ring a bell at the corner of the principal porch  we rang accordingly and were forthwith admitted into a low vaulted basement ponderously wrought with intersecting arches dark and rather chilly just like what i remember to have seen at battle abbey and after waiting here a little while a respectable elderly gentlewoman appeared of whom we requested to be shown round the abbey  she courteously acceded first presenting us to a book in which to inscribe our names  i suppose ten thousand people three fourths of them americans have written descriptions of newstead abbey and none of them so far as i have read give any true idea of the place neither will my description if i write one  in fact i forget very much that i saw and especially in what order the objects came  in the basement was byrons batha dark and cold and cellarlike hole which it must have required good courage to plunge into in this region too or near it was the chapel which colonel wildman has decorously fitted up and where service is now regularly performed but which was used as a dogs kennel in byrons time  after seeing this we were led to byrons own bedchamber which remains just as when he slept in itthe furniture and all the other arrangements being religiously preserved  it was in the plainest possible style homely indeed and almost meanan ordinary paperhanging and everything so commonplace that it was only the deep embrasure of the window that made it look unlike a bedchamber in a middlingclass lodginghouse  it would have seemed difficult beforehand to fit up a room in that picturesque old edifice so that it should be utterly void of picturesqueness but it was effected in this apartment and i suppose it is a specimen of the way in which old mansions used to be robbed of their antique character and adapted to modern tastes before mediaeval antiquities came into fashion  some prints of the cambridge colleges and other pictures indicating byrons predilections at the time and which he himself had hung there were on the walls  this the housekeeper told us had been the abbots chamber in the monastic time  adjoining it is the haunted room where the ghostly monk whom byron introduces into don juan is said to have his lurkingplace  it is fitted up in the same style as byrons and used to be occupied by his valet or page  no doubt in his lordships day these were the only comfortable bedrooms in the abbey and by the housekeepers account of what colonel wildman has done it is to be inferred that the place must have been in a most wild shaggy tumbledown condition inside and out when he bought it  it is very different now  after showing us these two apartments of byron and his servant the housekeeper led us from one to another and another magnificent chamber fitted up in antique style with oak panelling and heavily carved bedsteads of queen elizabeths time or of the stuarts hung with rich tapestry curtains of similar date and with beautiful old cabinets of carved wood sculptured in relief or tortoiseshell and ivory  the very pictures and realities these rooms were of stately comfort and they were called by the name of kingsking edwards king charles iis king henry viis chamber and they were hung with beautiful pictures many of them portraits of these kings  the chimneypieces were carved and emblazoned and all so far as i could judge was in perfect keeping so that if a prince or noble of three centuries ago were to come to lodge at newstead abbey he would hardly know that he had strayed out of his own century  and yet he might have known by some token for there are volumes of poetry and light literature on the tables in these royal bedchambers and in that of henry vii  i saw the house of the seven gables and the scarlet letter in routledges edition  certainly the house is admirably fitted up and there must have been something very excellent and comprehensive in the domestic arrangements of the monks since they adapt themselves so well to a state of society entirely different from that in which they originated  the library is a very comfortable room and provocative of studious ideas though lounging and luxurious  it is long and rather low furnished with soft couches and on the whole though a man might dream of study i think he would be most likely to read nothing but novels there  i know not what the room was in monkish times but it was waste and ruinous in lord byrons here i think the housekeeper unlocked a beautiful cabinet and took out the famous skull which lord byron transformed into a drinkinggoblet  it has a silver rim and stand but still the ugly skull is bare and evident and the naked inner bone receives the wine  i should think it would hold at least a quartenough to overpower any living head into which this deathshead should transfer its contents and a man must be either very drunk or very thirsty before he would taste wine out of such a goblet i think byrons freak was outdone by that of a cousin of my own who once solemnly assured me that he had a spittoon made out of the skull of his enemy  the ancient coffin in which the gobletskull was found was shown us in the basement of the abbey  there was much more to see in the house than i had any previous notion of but except the two chambers already noticed nothing remained the least as byron left it  yes another place there washis own small diningroom with a table of moderate size where no doubt the skullgoblet has often gone its rounds  colonel wildmans diningroom was once byrons shootinggallery and the original refectory of the monks  it is now magnificently arranged with a vaulted roof a musicgallery at one end suits of armor and weapons on the walls and mailed arms extended holding candelabras  there are one or two painted windows commemorative of the peninsular war and the battles in which the colonel and his two brothers foughtfor these wildmen seem to have been mighty troopers and colonel wildman is represented as a fiercelooking mustachioed hussar at two different ages  the housekeeper spoke of him affectionately but says that he is now getting into years and that they fancy him failing  he has no children  he appears to have been on good terms with byron and had the latter ever returned to england he was under promise to make his first visit to his old home and it was in such an expectation that colonel wildman had kept byrons private apartments in the same condition in which he found them  byron was informed of all the colonels fittings up and restorations and when he introduces the abbey in don juan the poet describes it not as he himself left it but as colonel wildman has restored it  there is a beautiful drawingroom and all these apartments are adorned with pictures the collection being especially rich in portraits by sir peter lelythat of nell gwynn being one who is one of the few beautiful women whom i have seen on canvas  we parted with the housekeeper and i with a good many shillings at the door by which we entered and our next business was to see the private grounds and gardens  a little boy attended us through the first part of our progress but soon appeared the veritable gardenera shrewd and sensible old man who has been very many years on the place  there was nothing of special interest as concerning byron until we entered the original old monkish garden which is still laid out in the same fashion as the monks left it with a large oblong piece of water in the centre and terraced banks rising at two or three different stages with perfect regularity around it so that the sheet of water looks like the plate of an immense lookingglass of which the terraces form the frame  it seems as if were there any giant large enough he might raise up this mirror and set it on end  in the monks garden there is a marble statue of pan which the gardener told us was brought by the wicked lord greatuncle of byron from italy and was supposed by the country people to represent the devil and to be the object of his worshipa natural idea enough in view of his horns and cloven feet and tail though this indicates at all events a very jolly devil  there is also a female statue beautiful from the waist upward but shaggy and clovenfooted below and holding a little clovenfooted child by the hand  this the old gardener assured us was pandora wife of the abovementioned pan with her son  not far from this spot we came to the tree on which byron carved his own name and that of his sister augusta  it is a tree of twin stemsa birchtree i thinkgrowing up side by side  one of the stems still lives and flourishes but that on which he carved the two names is quite dead as if there had been something fatal in the inscription that has made it forever famous  the names are still very legible although the letters had been closed up by the growth of the bark before the tree died  they must have been deeply cut at first  there are old yewtrees of unknown antiquity in this garden and many other interesting things and among them may be reckoned a fountain of very pure water called the holy well of which we drank  there are several fountains besides the large mirror in the centre of the garden and these are mostly inhabited by carp the genuine descendants of those which peopled the fishponds in the days of the monks  coming in front of the abbey the gardener showed us the oak that byron planted now a vigorous young tree and the monument which he erected to his newfoundland dog and which is larger than most christians get being composed of a marble altarshaped tomb surrounded by a circular area of steps as much as twenty feet in diameter  the gardener said however that byron intended this not merely as the burialplace of his dog but for himself too and his sister  i know not how this may have been but this inconvenience would have attended his being buried there that on transfer of the estate his mortal remains would have become the property of some other man  we had now come to the empty spacea smooth green lawn where had once been the abbey church  the length had been sixtyfour yards the gardener said and within his remembrance there had been many remains of it but now they are quite removed with the exception of the one ivygrown western wall which as i mentioned forms a picturesque part of the present front of the abbey  through a door in this wall the gardener now let us out      in the evening our landlady who seems to be a very intelligent woman of a superior class to most landladies came into our parlor while i was out and talked about the present race of byrons and lovelaces who have often been at this house  there seems to be a taint in the byron blood which makes those who inherit it wicked mad and miserable  even colonel wildman comes in for a share of this ill luck for he has almost ruined himself by his expenditure on the estate and by his lavish hospitality especially to the duke of sussex who liked the colonel and used often to visit him during his lifetime and his royal highnesss gentlemen ate and drank colonel wildman almost up  so says our good landlady  at any rate looking at this miserable race of byrons who held the estate so long and at colonel wildman whom it has ruined in forty years we might see grounds for believing in the evil fate which is supposed to attend confiscated church property  nevertheless i would accept the estate were it offered me      glancing back i see that i have omitted some items that were curious in describing the house for instance one of the cabinets had been the personal property of queen elizabeth  it seems to me that the fashion of modern furniture has nothing to equal these old cabinets for beauty and convenience  in the state apartments the floors were so highly waxed and polished that we slid on them as if on ice and could only make sure of our footing by treading on strips of carpeting that were laid down   june 7thwe left nottingham a week ago and made our first stage to derby where we had to wait an hour or two at a great bustling pellmell crowded railway station  it was much thronged with second and third class passengers coming and departing in continual trains for these were the whitsuntide holidays which set all the lower orders of english people astir  this time of festival was evidently the origin of the old election holidays in massachusetts the latter occurring at the same period of the year and being celebrated so long as they could be so in very much the same way with games idleness merriment of set purpose and drunkenness  after a weary while we took the train for    matlock   via ambergate and arrived of the former place late in the afternoon the village of matlock is situated on the banks of the derwent in a delightful little nook among the hills which rise above it in steeps and in precipitous crags and shut out the world so effectually that i wonder how the railway ever found it out  indeed it does make its approach to this region through a long tunnel  it was a beautiful sunny afternoon when we arrived and my present impressions are that i have never seen anywhere else such exquisite scenery as that which surrounds the village  the street itself to be sure is commonplace enough and hot dusty and disagreeable but if you look above it or on either side there are green hills descending abruptly down and softened with woods amid which are seen villas cottages castles and beyond the river is a line of crags perhaps three hundred feet high clothed with shrubbery in some parts from top to bottom but in other places presenting a sheer precipice of rock over which tumbles as it were a cascade of ivy and creeping plants  it is very beautiful and i might almost say very wild but it has those characteristics of finish and of being redeemed from nature and converted into a portion of the adornment of a great garden which i find in all english scenery  not that i complain of this on the contrary there is nothing that delights an american more in contrast with the roughness and ruggedness of his native scenesto which also he might be glad to return after a while  we put up at the old bath hotelan immense house with passages of such extent that at first it seemed almost a days journey from parlor to bedroom  the house stands on a declivity and after ascending one pair of stairs we came in travelling along the passageway to a door that opened upon a beautifully arranged garden with arbors and grottos and the hillside rising steep above  during all the time of our stay at matlock there was brilliant sunshine and the grass and foliage being in their freshest and most luxuriant phase the place has left as bright a picture as i have anywhere in my memory  the morning after our arrival we took a walk and following the sound of a churchbell entered what appeared to be a park and passing along a road at the base of a line of crags soon came in sight of a beautiful church  i rather imagine it to be the place of worship of the arkwright family whose seat is in this vicinitythe descendants of the famous arkwright who contributed so much towards turning england into a cotton manufactory  we did not enter the church but passed beyond it and over a bridge and along a road that ascended among the hills and finally brought us out by a circuit to the other end of matlock village after a walk of three or four miles  in the afternoon we took a boat across the derwenta passage which half a dozen strokes of the oars accomplished and reached a very pleasant seclusion called the lovers walk  a ferriage of twopence pays for the transit across the river and gives the freedom of these grounds which are threaded with paths that meander and zigzag to the top of the precipitous ridge amid trees and shrubbery and the occasional ease of rustic seats  it is a sweet walk for lovers and was so for us although j with his scramblings and disappearances and shouts from above and headlong scamperings down the precipitous paths occasionally frightened his mother  after gaining the heights the path skirts along the precipice allowing us to see down into the village street and nearer the derwent winding through the valley so close beneath us that we might have flung a stone into it  these crags would be very rude and harsh if left to themselves but they are quite softened and made sweet and tender by the great deal of foliage that clothes their sides and creeps and clambers over them only letting a stern face of rock be seen here and there and with a smile rather than a frown  the next day monday we went to see the grand cavern  the entrance is high up on the hillside whither we were led by a guide of whom there are many and they all pay tribute to the proprietor of the cavern there is a small shed by the side of the cavern mouth where the guide provided himself and us with tallow candles and then led us into the darksome and ugly pit the entrance of which is not very imposing for it has a door of rough pine boards and is kept under lock and key  this is the disagreeable phaseone of the disagreeable phasesof mans conquest over nature in englandcavern mouths shut up with cellar doors cataracts under lock and key precipitous crags compelled to figure in ornamented gardensand all accessible at a fixed amount of shillings or pence  it is not possible to draw a full free breath under such circumstances  when you think of it it makes the wildest scenery look like the artificial rockwork which englishmen are so fond of displaying in the little bit of grassplot under their suburban parlor windows however the cavern was dreary enough and wild enough though in a mean sort of way for it is but a long series of passages and crevices generally so narrow that you scrape your elbows and so low that you hit your head  it has nowhere a lofty height though sometimes it broadens out into ample space but not into grandeur the roof being always within reach and in most places smoky with the tallow candles that have been held up to it  a very dirty sordid disagreeable burrow more like a cellar gone mad than anything else but it served to show us how the crust of the earth is moulded  this cavern was known to the romans and used to be worked by them as a leadmine  derbyshire spar is now taken from it and in some of its crevices the gleam of the tallow candles is faintly reflected from the crystallizations but on the whole i felt like a mole as i went creeping along and was glad when we came into the sunshine again  i rather think my idea of a cavern is taken from the one in the forty thieves or in gil blasa vast hollow womb roofed and curtained with obscurity  this reality is very mean  leaving the cavern we went to the guides cottage situated high above the village where he showed us specimens of ornaments and toys manufactured by himself from derbyshire spar and other materials  there was very pretty mosaic work flowers of spar and leaves of malachite and miniature copies of cleopatras needle and other egyptian monuments and vases of graceful pattern brooches too and many other things  the most valuable spar is called blue john and is only to be found in one spot where also the supply is said to be growing scant  we bought a number of articles and then came homeward still with our guide who showed us on the way the romantic rocks  these are some crags which have been rent away and stand insulated from the hillside affording a pathway between it and then while the places can yet be seen where the sundered rocks would fit into the craggy hill if there were but a titan strong enough to adjust them again  it is a very picturesque spot and the price for seeing it is twopence though in our case it was included in the four shillings which we had paid for seeing the cavern  the representative men of england are the showmen and the policemen both very good people in their way  returning to the hotel j and his mother went through the village to the river near the railway where j set himself to fishing and caught three minnows  i followed after a while to fetch them back and we called into one or two of the many shops in the village which have articles manufactured of the spar for sale  some of these are nothing short of magnificent  there was an inlaid table valued at sixty guineas and a splendid ornament for any drawingroom another inlaid with the squares of a chessboard  we heard of a table in the possession of the marquis of westminster the value of which is three hundred guineas  it would be easy and pleasant to spend a great deal of money in such things as we saw there but all our purchases in matlock did not amount to more than twenty shillings invested in brooches shawlpins little vases and toys which will be valuable to us as memorials on the other side of the water  after this we visited a petrifying cave of which there are several hereabouts  the process of petrifaction requires some months or perhaps a year or two varying with the size of the article to be operated upon  the articles are placed in the cave under the drippings from the roof and a hard deposit is formed upon them and sometimes as in the case of a birdsnest causes a curious result every straw and hair being immortalized and stiffened into stone  a horses head was in process of petrifaction and j bought a broken eggshell for a penny though larger articles are expensive  the process would appear to be entirely superficiala mere crust on the outside of thingsbut we saw some specimens of petrified oak where the stony substance seemed to be intimately incorporated with the wood and to have really changed it into stone  these specimens were immensely ponderous and capable of a high polish which brought out beautiful streaks and shades  one might spend a very pleasant summer in matlock and i think there can be no more beautiful place in the world but we left it that afternoon and railed to manchester where we arrived between ten and eleven at night  the next day i left s to go to the art exhibition and took j with me to liverpool where i had an engagement that admitted of no delay  thus ended our tour in which we had seen but a little bit of england yet rich with variety and interest  what a wonderful land  it is our forefathers land our land for i will not give up such a precious inheritance  we are now back again in flat and sandy southport which during the past week has been thronged with whitsuntide people who crowd the streets and pass to and fro along the promenade with a universal and monotonous air of nothing to do and very little enjoyment it is a pity that poor folks cannot employ their little hour of leisure to better advantage in a country where the soil is so veined with gold  these are delightfully long days  last night at half past nine i could read with perfect ease in parts of the room remote from the window and at nearly half past eleven there was a broad sheet of daylight in the west gleaming brightly over the plashy sands  i question whether there be any total night at this season   june 21stsouthport i presume is now in its most vivid aspect there being a multitude of visitors here principally of the middling classes and a frequent crowd whom i take to be workingpeople from manchester and other factory towns  it is the strangest place to come to for the pleasures of the sea of which we scarcely have a glimpse from months end to mouths end nor any fresh exhilarating breath from it but a lazy languid atmosphere brooding over the waste of sands or even if there be a sulky and bitter wind blowing along the promenade it still brings no salt elixir  i never was more weary of a place in all my life and never felt such a disinterested pity as for the people who come here for pleasure  nevertheless the town has its amusements in the first place the daylong and perennial one of donkeyriding along the sands large parties of men and girls pottering along together the flying dutchman trundles hither and thither when there is breeze enough an arch cryman sets up his targets on the beach the bathinghouses stand by scores and fifties along the shore and likewise on the banks of the ribble a mile seaward the hotels have their billiardrooms there is a theatre every evening from morning till night comes a succession of organgrinders playing interminably under your window and a man with a bassoon and a monkey who takes your pennies and pulls off his cap in acknowledgment and wandering minstrels with guitar and voice and a highland bagpipe squealing out a tangled skein of discord together with a highland maid who dances a hornpipe and punch and judyin a word we have specimens of all manner of vagrancy that infests england  in these long days and long and pleasant ones the promenade is at its liveliest about nine oclock which is but just after sundown and our little r finds it difficult to go to sleep amid so much music as comes to her ears from bassoon bagpipe organ guitar and now and then a military band  one feature of the place is the sick and infirm people whom we see dragged along in bathchairs or dragging their own limbs languidly or sitting on benches or meeting in the streets and making acquaintance on the strength of mutual maladiespale men leaning on their ruddy wives cripples three or four together in a ring and planting their crutches in the centre  i dont remember whether i have ever mentioned among the notabilities of southport the town criera meeklooking old man who sings out his messages in a most doleful tone as if he took his title in a literal sense and were really going to cry or crying in the worlds behalf one other stroller a foreigner with a dog shaggy round the head and shoulders and closely shaven behind  the poor little beast jumped through hoops ran about on two legs of one side danced on its hind legs or on its fore paws with its hind ones straight up in the airall the time keeping a watch on his masters eye and evidently mindful of many a beating   june 25ththe warsteamer niagara came up the mersey a few days since and day before yesterday captain hudson called at my officea somewhat meagre elderly gentleman of simple and hearty manners and address having his purser mr eldredge with him who i think rather prides himself upon having a napoleonic profile  the captain is an old acquaintance of mrs blodgett and has cone ashore principally with a view to calling on her so after we had left our cards for the mayor i showed these naval gentlemen the way to her house  mrs blodgett and miss w were prodigiously glad to see him and they all three began to talk of old times and old acquaintances for when mrs blodgett was a rich lady at gibraltar she used to have the whole navylist at her tableyoung midshipmen and lieutenants then perhaps but old gouty paralytic commodores now if still even partly alive  it was arranged that mrs blodgett with as many of the ladies of her family as she chose to bring should accompany me on my official visit to the ship the next day and yesterday we went accordingly mrs blodgett miss w and six or seven american captains wives their husbands following in another boat  i know too little of ships to describe one or even to feel any great interest in the details of this or of any other ship but the nautical people seemed to see much to admire  she lay in the sloyne in the midst of a broad basin of the mersey with a pleasant landscape of green england now warm with summer sunshine on either side with churches and villa residences and suburban and rural beauty  the officers of the ship are gentlemanly men externally very well mannered although not polished and refined to any considerable extent  at least i have not found naval men so in general but still it is pleasant to see americans who are not stirred by such motives as usually interest our countrymenno hope nor desire of growing rich but planting their claims to respectability on other grounds and therefore acquiring a certain nobleness whether it be inherent in their nature or no  it always seems to me they look down upon civilians with quiet and not illnatured scorn which one has the choice of smiling or being provoked at  it is not a true life which they lead but shallow and aimless and unsatisfactory it must be to the better minds among them nor do they appear to profit by what would seem the advantages presented to them in their worldwide though not worlddeep experience  they get to be very clannish too  after seeing the ship we landed all of us ladies and captain and went to the gardens of the rock ferry hotel where j and i stayed behind the rest    to scotland   june 28thon the 26th my wife j and i left southport taking the train for preston and as we had to stop an hour or two before starting for carlisle i walked up into the town  the street through which most of my walk lay was brickbuilt lively bustling and not particularly noteworthy but turning a little way down another street the town had a more ancient aspect  the day was intensely hot the sun lying bright and broad as ever i remember it in an american city so that i was glad to get back again to the shade and shelter of the station  the heat and dust moreover made our journey to carlisle very uncomfortable  it was through very pretty and sometimes picturesque scenery being on the confines of the hillcountry which we could see on our left dim and blue and likewise we had a refreshing breath from the sea in passing along the verge of morecambe bay  we reached carlisle at about five oclock and after taking tea at the bush hotel set forth to look at the town  the notable objects were a castle and a cathedral and we first found our way to the castle which stands on elevated ground on the side of the city towards scotland  a broad wellconstructed path winds round the castle at the base of the wall on the verge of a steep descent to the plain beneath through which winds the river eden  along this path we walked quite round the castle a circuit of perhaps half a mile pleasant being shaded by the castles height and by the foliage of trees  the walls have been so much rebuilt and restored that it is only here and there that we see an old buttress or a few timeworn stones intermixed with the new facing with which the aged substance is overlaid the material is red freestone which seems to be very abundant in this part of the country  we found no entrance to the castle till the path had led us from the free and airy country into a very mean part of the town where the wretched old houses thrust themselves between us and the castle wall and then passing through a narrow street we walked up what appeared like a bylane and the portal of the castle was before us there was a sentrybox just within the gate and a sentinel was on guard for carlisle castle is a national fortress and has usually been a depot for arms and ammunition  the sergeant or corporal of the guard sat reading within the gateway and on my request for admittance he civilly appointed one of the soldiers to conduct us to the castle  as i recollect the chief gateway of the castle with the guardroom in the thickness of the wall is situated some twenty yards behind the first entrance where we met the sentinel  it was an intelligent young soldier who showed as round the castle and very civil as i always find soldiers to be  he had not anything particularly interesting to show nor very much to say about it and what be did say so far as it referred to the history of the castle was probably apocryphal  the castle has an inner and outer ward on the descent of the hill and included within the circuit of the exterior wall  having been always occupied by soldiers it has not been permitted to assume the picturesque aspect of a ruin but the buildings of the interior have either been constantly repaired as they required it or have been taken down when past repair  we saw a small part of the tower where mary queen of scots was confined on her first coming to england these remains consist only of a portion of a winding stone staircase at which we glanced through a window  the keep is very large and massive and no doubt old in its inner substance  we ascended to the castle walls and looked out over the river towards the scottish hills which are visible in the distancethe scottish border being not more than eight or nine miles off  carlisle castle has stood many sieges and witnessed many battles under its walls  there are now on its ramparts only some half a dozen oldfashioned guns which our soldier told us had gone quite out of use in these days  they were long iron twelvepounders with one or two carronades  the soldier was of an artillery regiment and wore the crimean medal  he said the garrison now here consists only of about twenty men all of whom had served in the crimea like himself  they seem to lead a very dull and monotonous life as indeed it must be without object or much hope or any great employment of the present like prisoners as indeed they are  our guide showed us on the rampart a place where the soldiers had been accustomed to drop themselves down at night hanging by their hands from the top of the wall and alighting on their feet close beside the path on the outside  the height seemed at least that of an ordinary house but the soldier said that nine times out of ten the fall might be ventured without harm and he spoke from experience having himself got out of the castle in this manner  the place is now boarded up so as to make egress difficult or impossible  the castle after all was not particularly worth seeing  the soldiers most romantic story was of a daughter of lord scroope a former governor of the castle when mary of scotland was confined here  she attempted to assist the queen in escaping but was shot dead in the gateway by the warder and the soldier pointed out the very spot where the poor young lady fell and diedall which would be very interesting were there a word of truth in the story  but we liked our guide for his intelligence simplicity and for the pleasure which he seemed to take as an episode of his dull daily life in talking to strangers  he observed that the castle walls were solid and indeed there was breadth enough to drive a coach and four along the top but the artillery of the crimea would have shelled them into ruins in a very few hours  when we got back to the guardhouse he took us inside and showed the dismal and comfortless rooms where soldiers are confined for drunkenness and other offences against military laws telling us that he himself had been confined there and almost perished with cold  i should not much wonder if he were to get into durance again through misuse of the fee which i put into his hand at parting  the cathedral is at no great distance from the castle and though the streets are mean and sordid in the vicinity the close has the antique repose and shadowy peace at once domestic and religious which seem peculiar and universal in cathedral closes  the foundation of this cathedral church is very ancient it having been the church portion of an old abbey the refectory and other remains of which are still seen around the close  but the whole exterior of the building except here and there a buttress and one old patch of gray stones seems to have been renewed within a very few years with red freestone and really i think it is all the more beautiful for being newthe ornamental parts being so sharply cut and the stone moreover showing various shadings which will disappear when it gets weatherworn  there is a very large and fine east window of recent construction wrought with delicate stone tracery the door of the south transept stood open though barred by an iron grate  we looked in and saw a few monuments on the wall but found nobody to give us admittance  the portal of this entrance is very lovely with wreaths of stone foliage and flowers round the arch recently carved yet not so recently but that the swallows have given their sanction to it as if it were a thousand years old and have built their nests in the deeply carved recesses  while we were looking a little bird flew into the small opening between two of these petrified flowers behind which was his nest quite out of sight  after some attempts to find the verger we went back to the hotel      in the morning my wife and j went back to see the interior of the cathedral while i strayed at large about the town again passing round the castle site and thence round the city where i found some inconsiderable portions of the wall which once girt it about  it was marketday in carlisle and the principal streets were much thronged with human life and business on that account and in as busy a street as any stands a marble statue in robes of antique state fitter for a niche in westminster abbey than for the thronged street of a town  it is a statue of the earl of lonsdale lord lieutenant of cumberland who died about twenty years ago  here follows the record of the visits to the haunts of burns already published in our old homeed    glasgow   july 1stimmediately after our arrival yesterday we went out and inquired our way to the cathedral which we reached through a good deal of scotch dirt and a rabble of scotch people of all sexes and ages  the women of scotland have a faculty of looking exceedingly ugly as they grow old  the cathedral i have already noticed in the record of my former visit to scotland  i did it no justice then nor shall do it any better justice now but it is a fine old church although it makes a colder and severer impression than most of the gothic architecture which i have elsewhere seen  i do not know why this should be so for portions of it are wonderfully rich and everywhere there are arches opening beyond arches and clustered pillars and groined roofs and vistas lengthening along the aisles  the person who shows it is an elderly man of jolly aspect and demeanor he is enthusiastic about the edifice and makes it the thought and object of his life and being such a merry sort of man always saying something mirthfully and yet in all his thoughts words and actions having reference to this solemn cathedral he has the effect of one of the corbels or gargoylesthose ludicrous strange sculptures which the gothic architects appended to their arches  the upper portion of the minster though very stately and beautiful is not nearly so extraordinary as the crypts  here the intricacy of the arches and the profound system on which they are arranged is inconceivable even when you see thema whole company of arches uniting in one keystone arches uniting to form a glorious canopy over the shrine or tomb of a prelate arches opening through and beyond one another whichever way you look all amidst a shadowy gloom yet not one detail wrought out the less beautifully and delicately because it could scarcely be seen  the wreaths of flowers that festoon one of the arches are cut in such relief that they do but just adhere to the stone on which they grow  the pillars are massive and the arches very low the effect being a twilight which at first leads the spectator to imagine himself underground but by and by i saw that the sunshine came in through the narrow windows though it scarcely looked like sunshine then  for many years these crypts were used as burialground and earth was brought in for the purpose of making graves so that the noble columns were half buried and the beauty of the architecture quite lost and forgotten  now the dead mens bones and the earth that covered them have all been removed leaving the original pavement of the crypt or a new one in its stead with only the old relics of saints martyrs and heroes underneath where they have lain so long that they have become a part of the spot     i was quite chilled through and the old verger regretted that we had not come during the late hot weather when the everlasting damp and chill of the spot would have made us entirely comfortable  these crypts originated in the necessity of keeping the floor of the upper cathedral on one level the edifice being built on a declivity and the height of the crypt being measured by the descent of the site  after writing the above we walked out and saw something of the newer portion of glasgow and really i am inclined to think it the stateliest of cities  the exchange and other public buildings and the shops in buchanan street are very magnificent the latter especially excelling those of london  there is however a pervading sternness and grimness resulting from the dark gray granite which is the universal buildingmaterial both of the old and new edifices  later in the forenoon we again walked out and went along argyle street and through the trongate and the saltmarket  the two latter were formerly the principal business streets and together with high street the abode of the rich merchants and other great people of the town  high street and still more the saltmarket now swarm with the lower orders to a degree which i never witnessed elsewhere so that it is difficult to make ones way among the sullen and unclean crowd and not at all pleasant to breathe in the noisomeness of the atmosphere  the children seem to have been unwashed from birth  some of the gray houses appear to have once been stately and handsome and have their high gable ends notched at the edges like a flight of stairs  we saw the tron steeple and the statue of king william iii and searched for the old tolbooth     wandering up the high street we turned once more into the quadrangle of the university and mounted a broad stone staircase which ascends square and with rightangular turns on one corner on the outside of the edifices  it is very striking in appearance being ornamented with a balustrade on which are large globes of stone and a great lion and unicorn curiously sculptured on the opposite side  while we waited here staring about us a man approached and offered to show us the interior he seemed to be in charge of the college buildings  we accepted his offer and were led first up this stone staircase and into a large and stately hall panelled high towards the ceiling with dark oak and adorned with elaborately carved cornices and other woodwork  there was a long readingtable towards one end of the hall on which were laid pamphlets and periodicals and a venerable old gentleman with white head and bowed shoulders sat there reading a newspaper  this was the principal of the university and as he looked towards us graciously yet as if expecting some explanation of our entrance i approached and apologized for intruding on the plea of our being strangers and anxious to see the college  he made a courteous response though in exceedingly decayed and broken accents being now eightysix years old and gave us free leave to inspect everything that was to be seen  this hall was erected two years after the restoration of charles ii and has been the scene doubtless of many ceremonials and high banquetings since that period and among other illustrious personages queen victoria has honored it with her presence  thence we went into several recitation or lecture rooms in various parts of the buildings but they were all of an extreme plainness very unlike the rich old gothic libraries and chapels and halls which we saw in oxford  indeed the contrast between this scotch severity and that noble luxuriance and antique majesty and rich and sweet repose of oxford is very remarkable both within the edifices and without  but we saw one or two curious thingsfor instance a chair of mahogany elaborately carved with the arms of scotland and other devices and having a piece of the kingly stone of scone inlaid in its seat  this chair is used by the principal on certain high occasions and we ourselves of course sat down in it  our guide assigned to it a date preposterously earlier than could have been the true one judging either by the character of the carving or by the fact that mahogany has not been known or used much more than a century and a half  afterwards he led us into the divinity hall where he said there were some old portraits of historic people and among them an original picture of mary queen of scots  there was indeed a row of old portraits at each end of the apartmentfor instance zachariah boyd who wrote the rhyming version of the bible which is still kept safe from any critical eye in the library of the university to which he presented this besides other more valuable benefactionsfor which they have placed his bust in a niche in the principal quadrangle also john knox makes one of the row of portraits and a dozen or two more of scotch worthies all very dark and dingy  as to the picture of mary of scotland it proved to be not hers at all but a picture of queen mary the consort of william iii whose portrait together with that of her sister queen anne hangs in the same row  we told our guide this but he seemed unwilling to accept it as a fact  there is a museum belonging to the university but this for some reason or other could not be shown to us just at this time and there was little else to show  we just looked at the gardens but though of large extent they are so meagre and bareso unlike that lovely shade of the oxford gardensthat we did not care to make further acquaintance with them  then we went back to our hotel and if there were not already more than enough of description both past and to come i should describe georges square on one side of which the hotel is situated  a tall column rises in the grassy centre of it lifting far into the upper air a fine statue of sir walter scott which we saw to great advantage last night relieved against the sunset sky and there are statues of sir john moore a native of glasgow and of james watt at corners of the square  glasgow is certainly a noble city  after lunch we embarked on board the steamer and came up the clyde  ben lomond and other highland hills soon appeared on the horizon we passed douglas castle on a point of land projecting into the river and passing under the precipitous height of dumbarton castle which we had long before seen came to our voyages end at this village where we have put up at the elephant hotel   july 2dafter tea not far from seven oclock it being a beautiful decline of day we set out to walk to    dumbarton castle   which stands apart from the town and is said to have been once surrounded by the waters of the clyde  the rocky height on which the castle stands is a very striking object bulging up out of the clyde with abrupt decision to the elevation of five hundred feet  the summit is cloven in twain the cleft reaching nearly to the bottom on the side towards the river but not coming down so deeply on the landward side it is precipitous all around and wherever the steepness admits or does not make assault impossible there are gray ramparts round the hill with cannon threatening the lower world  our path led its beneath one of these precipices several hundred feet sheer down and with an ivied fragment of ruined wall at the top  a soldier who sat by the wayside told us that this was called the lovers leap because a young girl in some loveexigency had once jumped down from it and came safely to the bottom  we reached the castle gate which is near the shore of the clyde and there found another artillery soldier who guided us through the fortress  he said that there were now but about a dozen soldiers stationed in the castle and no officer  the lowest battery looks towards the river and consists of a few twelvepound cannon but probably the chief danger of attack was from the land and the chief pains have been taken to render the castle defensible in that quarter  there are flights of stone stairs ascending up through the natural avenue in the cleft of the doublesummited rock and about midway there is an arched doorway beneath which there used to be a portcullisso that if an enemy had won the lower part of the fortress the upper portion was still inaccessible  where the cleft of the rock widens into a gorge there are several buildings old but not appertaining to the ancient castle which has almost entirely disappeared  we ascended both summits and reaching the loftiest point on the right stood upon the foundation of a tower that dates back to the fifth century whence we had a glorious prospect of highlands and lowlands the chief object being ben lomond with its great dome among a hundred other blue and misty hills with the sun going down over them and in another direction the clyde winding far downward through the plain with the headland of dumbeck close at hand and douglas castle at no great distance  on the ramparts beneath us the soldier pointed out the spot where wallace scaled the wall climbing an apparently inaccessible precipice and taking the castle  the principal parts of the ancient castle appear to have been on the other and lower summit of the hill and thither we now went and traced the outline of its wall although none of it is now remaining  here is the magazine still containing some powder and here is a battery of eighteenpound guns with pyramids of balls all in readiness against an assault which however hardly any turn of human affairs can hereafter bring about  the appearance of a fortress is kept up merely for ceremonys sake and these cannon have grown antiquated  moreover as the soldier told us they are seldom or never fired even for purposes of rejoicing or salute because their thunder produces the singular effect of depriving the garrison of water  there is a large tank and the concussion causes the rifts of the stone to open and thus lets the water out  above this battery and elsewhere about the fortress there are warders turrets of stone resembling great pepperboxes  when dr johnson visited the castle he introduced his bulky person into one of these narrow receptacles and found it difficult to get out again  a gentleman who accompanied him was just stepping forward to offer his assistance but boswell whispered him to take no notice lest johnson should be offended so they left him to get out as he could  he did finally extricate himself else we might have seen his skeleton in the turret  boswell does not tell this story which seems to have been handed down by local tradition  the less abrupt declivities of the rock are covered with grass and afford food for a few sheep who scamper about the heights and seem to have attained the dexterity of goats in clambering  i never knew a purer air than this seems to be nor a lovelier golden sunset  descending into the gorge again we went into the armory which is in one of the buildings occupying the space between the two hilltops  it formerly contained a large collection of arms but these have been removed to the tower of london and there are now only some tattered banners of which i do not know the history and some festoons of pistols and grenades shells and grape and canister shot kept merely as curiosities and far more interesting than the above a few battleaxes daggers and spearheads from the field of bannockburn and more interesting still the sword of william wallace  it is a formidablelooking weapon made for being swayed with both hands and with its hilt on the floor reached about to my chin but the young girl who showed us the armory said that about nine inches had been broken off the point  the blade was not massive but somewhat thin compared with its great length and i found that i could blandish it using both hands with perfect ease  it is twoedged without any gaps and is quite brown and lustreless with old rust from point to hilt  these were all the memorables of our visit to dumbarton castle which is a most interesting spot and connected with a long series of historical events  it was first besieged by the danes and had a prominent share in all the warfare of scotland so long as the old warlike times and manners lasted  our soldier was very intelligent and courteous but as usual with these guides was somewhat apocryphal in his narrative telling us that mary queen of scots was confined here before being taken to england and that the cells in which she then lived are still extant under one of the ramparts  the fact is she was brought here when a child of six years old before going to france and doubtless scrambled up and down these heights as freely and merrily as the sheep we saw  we now returned to our hotel a very nice one and found the street of dumbarton all alive in the summer evening with the sports of children and the gossip of grown people  there was almost no night for at twelve oclock there was still a golden daylight and yesterday before it died must have met the morrow  in the lower part of the fortress there is a large sundial of stone which was made by a french officer imprisoned here during the peninsular war  it still numbers faithfully the hours that are sunny and it is a lasting memorial of him in the stronghold of his enemies    inverannan   eveningafter breakfast at dumbarton i went out to look at the town which is of considerable size and possesses both commerce and manufactures  there was a screwsteamship at the pier and many sailorlooking people were seen about the streets  there are very few old houses though still the town retains an air of antiquity which one does not well see how to account for when everywhere there is a modern front and all the characteristics of a street built today  turning from the main thoroughfare i crossed a bridge over the clyde and gained from it the best view of the cloven crag of dumbarton castle that i had yet found  the two summits are wider apart more fully relieved from each other than when seen from other points and the highest ascends into a perfect pyramid the lower one being obtusely rounded  there seem to be ironworks or some kind of manufactory on the farther side of the bridge and i noticed a quaint chateaulike mansion with hanging turrets standing apart from the street probably built by some person enriched by business  we left dumbarton at noon taking the rail to balloch and the steamer to the head of loch lomond  wild mountain scenery is not very good to describe nor do i think any distinct impressions are ever conveyed by such attempts so i mean to be brief in what i saw about this part of our tour especially as i suspect that i have said whatever i knew how to say in the record of my former visit to the highlands  as for loch lomond it lies amidst very striking scenery being poured in among the gorges of steep and lofty mountains which nowhere stand aside to give it room but on the contrary do their best to shut it in  it is everywhere narrow compared with its length of thirty miles but it is the beauty of a lake to be of no greater width than to allow of the scenery of one of its shores being perfectly enjoyed from the other  the scenery of the highlands so far as i have seen it cannot properly be called rich but stern and impressive with very hard outlines which are unsoftened mostly by any foliage though at this season they are green to their summits  they have hardly flesh enough to cover their boneshardly earth enough to lie over their rocky substanceas may be seen by the minute varietythe notched and jagged appearance of the profile of their sides and tops this being caused by the scarcely covered rocks wherewith these great hills are heaped together  our little steamer stopped at half a dozen places on its voyage up the lake most of them being stations where hotels have been established morally the highlands must have been more completely sophisticated by the invention of railways and steamboats than almost any other part of the world but physically it can have wrought no great change  these mountains in their general aspect must be very much the same as they were thousands of years ago for their sides never were capable of cultivation nor even with such a soil and so bleak an atmosphere could they have been much more richly wooded than we see them now  they seem to me to be among the unchangeable things of nature like the sea and sky but there is no saying what use human ingenuity may hereafter put them to  at all events i have no doubt in the world that they will go out of fashion in due time for the taste for mountains and wild scenery is with most people an acquired taste and it was easy to see today that nine people in ten care nothing about them  one group of gentlemen and ladiesat least men and womenspent the whole time in listening to a trial for murder which was read aloud by one of their number from a newspaper  i rather imagine that a taste for trim gardens is the most natural and universal taste as regards landscape  but perhaps it is necessary for the health of the human mind and heart that there should be a possibility of taking refuge in what is wild and uncontaminated by any meddling of mans hand and so it has been ordained that science shall never alter the aspect of the sky whether stern angry or beneficent nor of the awful sea either in calm or tempestnor of these rude highlands  but they will go out of general fashion as i have said and perhaps the next fashionable taste will be for cloud landthat is looking skyward and observing the wonderful variety of scenery that now constantly passes unnoticed among the clouds  at the head of the lake we found that there was only a horsecart to convey our luggage to the hotel at inverannan and that we ourselves must walk the distance being two miles  it had sprinkled occasionally during our voyage but was now sunshiny and not excessively warm so we set forth contentedly enough and had an agreeable walk along an almost perfectly level road for it is one of the beauties of these hills that they descend abruptly down instead of undulating away forever  there were lofty heights on each side of us but not so lofty as to have won a distinctive name and adown their sides we could see the rocky pathways of cascades which at this season are either quite dry or mere trickles of a rill  the hills and valleys abound in streams sparkling through pebbly beds and forming here and there a dark pool and they would be populous with trout if all england with one fell purpose did not come hither to fish them  a fisherman must find it difficult to gratify his propensities in these days for even the lakes and streams in norway are now preserved  j by the way threatens ominously to be a fisherman  he rode the latter portion of the way to the hotel on the luggagecart and when we arrived we found that he had already gone off to catch fish or to attempt it for there is as much chance of his catching a whale as a trout in a mountain stream near the house  i went in search of him but without success and was somewhat startled at the depth and blackness of some of the pools into which the stream settled itself and slept  finally he came in while we were at dinner we afterwards walked out with him to let him play at fishing again and discovered on the bank of the stream a wonderful oak with as many as a dozen holes springing either from close to the ground or within a foot or two of it and looking like twelve separate trees at least instead of one    inversnaid   july 3dlast night seemed to close in clear and even at midnight it was still light enough to read but this morning rose on us misty and chill with spattering showers of rain  clouds momentarily settled and shifted on the hilltops shutting us in even more completely than these steep and rugged green walls would be sure to do even in the clearest weather  often these clouds came down and enveloped us in a drizzle or rather a shower of such minute drops that they had not weight enough to fall  this i suppose was a genuine scotch mist and as such it is well enough to have experienced it though i would willingly never see it again  such being the state of the weather my wife did not go out at all but i strolled about the premises in the intervals of raindrops gazing up at the hillsides and recognizing that there is a vast variety of shape of light and shadow and incidental circumstance even in what looks so monotonous at first as the green slope of a hill  the little rills that come down from the summits were rather more distinguishable than yesterday having been refreshed by the nights rain but still they were very much out of proportion with the wide pathways of bare rock adown which they ran  these little rivulets no doubt often lead through the wildest scenery that is to be found in the highlands or anywhere else and to the formation and wildness of which they have greatly contributed by sawing away for countless ages and thus deepening the ravines  i suspect the american clouds are more picturesque than those of great britain whatever our mountains may be at least i remember the berkshire hills looking grander under the influence of mist and cloud than the highlands did today  our clouds seem to be denser and heavier and more decided and form greater contrasts of light and shade  i have remarked in england that the cloudy firmament even on a day of settled rain always appears thinner than those i had been accustomed to at home so as to deceive me with constant expectations of better weather  it has been the same today  whenever i looked upward i thought it might be going to clear up but instead of that it began to rain more in earnest after midday and at half past two we left inverannan in a smart shower  at the head of the lake we took the steamer with the rain pouring more heavily than ever and landed at inversnaid under the same dismal auspices  we left a very good hotel behind us and have come to another that seems also good  we are more picturesquely situated at this spot than at inverannan our hotel being within a short distance of the lake shore with a glen just across the water which will doubtless be worth looking at when the mist permits us to see it  a good many tourists were standing about the door when we arrived and looked at us with the curiosity of idle and weatherbound people  the lake is here narrow but a hundred fathoms deep so that a great part of the height of the mountains which beset it round is hidden beneath its surface   july 4ththis morning opened still misty but with a more hopeful promise than yesterday and when i went out after breakfast there were gleams of sunshine here and there on the hillsides falling one did not exactly see how through the volumes of cloud  close beside the hotel of inversnaid is the waterfall all night my room being on that side of the house i had heard its voice and now i ascended beside it to a point where it is crossed by a wooden bridge  there is thence a view upward and downward of the most striking descents of the river as i believe they call it though it is but a mountainstream which tumbles down an irregular and broken staircase in its headlong haste to reach the lake it is very picturesque however with its ribbons of white foam over the precipitous steps and its deep black pools overhung by black rocks which reverberate the rumble of the falling water  j and i ascended a little distance along the cascade and then turned aside he going up the hill and i taking a path along its side which gave me a view across the lake  i rather think this particular stretch of loch lomond in front of inversnaid is the most beautiful lake and mountain view that i have ever seen  it is so shut in that you can see nothing beyond nor would suspect anything more to exist than this watery vale among the hills except that directly opposite there is the beautiful glen of invernglass which winds away among the feet of ben crook ben ein ben vain and ben voirlich standing mistinwreathed together  the mists this morning had a very soft and beautiful effect and made the mountains tenderer than i have hitherto felt them to be and they lingered about their heads like morningdreams flitting and retiring and letting the sunshine in and snatching it away again  my wife came up and we enjoyed it together till the steamer came smoking its pipe along the loch stopped to land some passengers and steamed away again while we stood there a highlander passed by us with a very dark tartan and bare shanks most enormously calved  i presume he wears the dress for the sole purpose of displaying those stalwart legs for he proves to be no genuine gael but a manufacturer who has a shootingbox or a share in one on the hill above the hotel  we now engaged a boat and were rowed to rob roys cave which is perhaps half a mile distant up the lake  the shores look much more striking from a rowboat creeping along near the margin than from a steamer in the middle of the loch and the ridge beneath which robs cave lies is precipitous with gray rocks and clothed too with thick foliage  over the cave itself there is a huge ledge of rock from which immense fragments have tumbled down ages and ages ago and fallen together in such a way as to leave a large irregular crevice in rob roys cave  we scrambled up to its mouth by some natural stairs and scrambled down into its depths by the aid of a ladder  i suppose i have already described this hole in the record of my former visit  certainly rob roy and robert bruce who is said to have inhabited it before him were not to be envied their accommodations yet these were not so very intolerable when compared with a highland cabin or with cottages such as burns lived in  j had chosen to remain to fish  on our return from the cave we found that he had caught nothing but just as we stepped into the boat a fish drew his float far under water and j tugging at one end of the line and the fish at the other the latter escaped with the hook in his month  j avers that he saw the fish and gives its measurement as about eighteen inches but the fishes that escape us are always of tremendous size  the boatman thought however that it might have been a pike    the trosachs hotelardcheanochrochan   july 5thnot being able to get a postchaise we took places in the omnibus for the bead of loch katrine  going up to pay a parting visit to the waterfall before starting i met with miss c as she lately was who is now on her wedding tour as mrs b  she was painting the falls in oil with good prospect of a successful picture  she came down to the hotel to see my wife and soon afterwards j and i set out to ascend the steep hill that comes down upon the lake of inversnaid leaving the omnibus to follow at leisure  the highlander who took us to rob roys cave had foreboded rain from the way in which the white clouds hung about the mountaintops nor was his augury at fault for just at three oclock the time he foretold there were a few raindrops and a more defined shower during the afternoon while we were on loch katrine the few drops however did not disturb us and reaching the top of the hill j and i turned aside to examine the old stone fortress which was erected in this mountain pass to bridle the highlanders after the rebellion of 1745  it stands in a very desolate and dismal situation at the foot of long bare slopes on mossy ground in the midst of a disheartening loneliness only picturesque because it is so exceedingly ungenial and unlovely  the chief interest of this spot in the fact that wolfe in his earlier military career was stationed here  the fortress was a very plain structure built of rough stones in the form of a parallelogram one side of which i paced and found it between thirty and forty of my paces long  the two ends have fallen down the two sides that remain are about twenty feet high and have little portholes for defence but no openings of the size of windows  the roof is gone and the interior space overgrown with grass  two little girls were at play in one corner and going round to the rear of the ruin i saw that a small highland cabin had been built against the wall  a dog sat in the doorway and gave notice of my approach and some hens kept up their peculiarly domestic converse about the door  we kept on our way often looking back towards loch lomond and wondering at the grandeur which ben vain and ben voirlich and the rest of the ben fraternity had suddenly put on  the mists which had hung about them all day had now descended lower and lay among the depths and gorges of the hills where also the sun shone softly down among them and filled those deep mountain laps as it were with a dimmer sunshine  ben vain too and his brethren had a veil of mist all about them which seemed to render them really transparent and they had unaccountably grown higher vastly higher than when we viewed them from the shore of the lake  it was as if we were looking at them through the medium of a poets imagination  all along the road since we left inversnaid there had been the stream which there formed the waterfall and which here was brawling down little declivities and sleeping in black pools which we disturbed by flinging stones into them from the roadside  we passed a drunken old gentleman who civilly bade me good day and a man and woman at work in a field the former of whom shouted to inquire the hour and we had come in sight of little loch arklet before the omnibus came up with us  it was about five oclock when we reached the head of    loch katrine   and went on board the steamer rob roy and setting forth on our voyage a highland piper made music for us the better part of the way  we did not see loch katrine perhaps under its best presentment for the surface was roughened with a little wind and darkened even to inky blackness by the clouds that overhung it  the hilltops too wore a very dark frown  a lake of this size cannot be terrific and is therefore seen to best advantage when it is beautiful  the scenery of its shores is not altogether so rich and lovely as i had preimagined not equal indeed to the best parts of loch lomondthe hills being lower and of a more ridgy shape and exceedingly bare at least towards the lower end  but they turn the lake aside with headland after headland and shut it in closely and open one vista after another so that the eye is never weary and least of all as we approach the end  the length of the loch is ten miles and at its termination it meets the pass of the trosachs between ben an and ben venue which are the rudest and shaggiest of hills  the steamer passes ellens isle but to the right which is the side opposite to that on which fitzjames must be supposed to have approached it  it is a very small island situated where the loch narrows and is perhaps less than a quarter of a mile distant from either shore  it looks like a lump of rock with just soil enough to support a crowd of dwarf oaks birches and firs which do not grow so high as to be shadowy trees  our voyage being over we landed and found two omnibuses one of which took us through the famous pass of the trosachs a distance of a mile and a quarter to a hotel erected in castellated guise by lord willoughby deresby  we were put into a parlor within one of the round towers panelled all round and with four narrow windows opening through deep embrasures  no playcastle was ever more like the reality and it is a very good hotel like all that we have had experience of in the highlands  after tea we walked out and visited a little kirk that stands near the shore of loch achray at a good point of view for seeing the hills round about  this morning opened cloudily but after breakfast i set out alone and walked through the pass of the trosachs and thence by a path along the right shore of the lake  it is a very picturesque and beautiful path following the windings of the lakenow along the beach now over an impending bank until it comes opposite to ellens isle which on this side looks more worthy to be the island of the poem than as we first saw it  its shore is craggy and precipitous but there was a point where it seemed possible to land nor was it too much to fancy that there might be a rustic habitation among the shrubbery of this rugged spot  it is foolish to look into these matters too strictly  scott evidently used as much freedom with his natural scenery as he did with his historic incidents and he could have made nothing of either one or the other if he had been more scrupulous in his arrangement and adornment of them  in his description of the trosachs he has produced something very beautiful and as true as possible though certainly its beauty has a little of the scenepainters gloss on it  nature is better no doubt but nature cannot be exactly reproduced on canvas or in print and the artists only resource is to substitute something that may stand instead of and suggest the truth  the path still kept onward after passing ellens isle and i followed it finding it wilder more shadowy with overhanging foliage of trees old and youngmore like a mountainpath in berkshire or new hampshire yet still with an old world restraint and cultivation about itthe farther i went  at last i came upon some bars and though the track was still seen beyond i took this as a hint to stop especially as i was now two or three miles from the hotel and it just then began to rain  my umbrella was a poor one at best and had been tattered and turned inside out a day or two ago by a gust on loch lomond but i spread it to the shower and furthermore took shelter under the thickest umbrage i could find  the rain came straight down and bubbled in the loch the little rills gathered force and plashed merrily over the stones the leaves of the trees condensed the shower into large drops and shed them down upon me where i stood  still i was comfortable enough in a thick skye tweed and waited patiently till the rain abated then took my way homeward and admired the pass of the trosachs more than when i first traversed it  if it has a fault it is one that few scenes in great britain share with itthat is the trees and shrubbery with which the precipices are shagged conceal them a little too much  a crag streaked with black and white here and there shows its head aloft or its whole height from base to summit and suggests that more of such sublimity is bidden than revealed  i think however that it is this unusual shagginess which made the scene a favorite with scott and with the people on this side of the ocean generally  there are many scenes as good in america needing only the poet   july 6thwe dined yesterday at the table dhote at the suggestion of the butler in order to give less trouble to the servants of the hotel and afford them an opportunity to go to kirk  the diningroom is in accordance with the rest of the architecture and fittings up of the house and is a very good reproduction of an old baronial hall with high panellings and a roof of dark polished wood  there were about twenty guests at table and if they and the waiters had been dressed in mediaeval costume we might have imagined ourselves banqueting in the middle ages  after dinner we all took a walk through the trosachs pass again and by the righthand path along the lake as far as ellens isle  it was very pleasant there being gleams of calm evening sunshine gilding the mountainsides and putting a golden crown occasionally on the tread of ben venue  it is wonderful how many aspects a mountain hashow many mountains there are in every single mountainhow they vary too in apparent attitude and bulk  when we reached the lake its surface was almost unruffled except by now and then the narrow pathway of a breeze as if the wing of an unseen spirit had just grazed it in flitting across the scene was very beautiful and on the whole i do not know that walter scott has overcharged his description although he has symbolized the reality by types and images which it might not precisely suggest to other minds  we were reluctant to quit the spot and cherish still a hope of seeing it again though the hope does not seem very likely to be gratified  this was a lowering and sullen morning but soon after breakfast i took a walk in the opposite direction to loch katrine and reached the brig of turk a little beyond which is the new trosachs hotel and the little rude village of duncraggan consisting of a few hovels of stone at the foot of a bleak and dreary hill  to the left stretching up between this and other hills is the valley of glenfinlasa very awful region in scotts poetry and in highland tradition as the haunt of spirits and enchantments  it presented a very desolate prospect  the walk back to the trosachs showed me ben venue and ben an under new aspectsthe bare summit of the latter rising in a perfect pyramid whereas from other points of view it looks like quite a different mountain  sometimes a gleam of sunshine came out upon the rugged side of ben venue but his prevailing mood like that of the rest of the landscape was stern and gloomy  i wish i could give an idea of the variety of surface upon one of these hillsidesso bulging out and hollowed in so bare where the rock breaks through so shaggy in other places with heath and then perhaps a thick umbrage of birch oak and ash ascending from the base high upward  when i think i have described them i remember quite a different aspect and find it equally true and yet lacking something to make it the whole or an adequate truth  j had gone with me part of the way but stopped to fish with a pinhook in loch achray which bordered along our path  when i returned i found him much elated at having caught a fish which however had got away carrying his pinhook along with it  then he had amused himself with taking some lizards by the tail and had collected several in a small hollow of the rocks  we now walked home together and at half past three we took our seats in a genuine oldfashioned stagecoach of which there are few specimens now to be met with  the coachman was smartly dressed in the queens scarlet and was a very pleasant and affable personage conducting himself towards the passengers with courteous authority  inside we were four including j but on the top there were at least a dozen and i would willingly have been there too but had taken an inside seat under apprehension of rain and was not allowed to change it  our drive was not marked by much describable incident  on changing horses at callender we alighted and saw ben ledi behind us making a picturesque background to the little town which seems to be the meetingpoint of the highlands and lowlands  we again changed horses at doune an old town which would doubtless have been well worth seeing had time permitted  thence we kept on till the coach drew up at a spacious hotel where we alighted fancying that we had reached stirling which was to have been our journeys end but after fairly establishing ourselves we found that it was the    brig of allan   the place is three miles short of stirling  nevertheless we did not much regret the mistake finding that the brig of allan is the principal spa of scotland and a very pleasant spot to all outward appearance after tea we walked out both up and down the village street and across the bridge and up a gentle eminence beyond it whence we had a fine view of a glorious plain out of which rose several insulated headlands  one of these was the height on which stands stirling castle and which reclines on the plain like a hound or a lion or a sphinx holding the castle on the highest part where its head should be  a mile or two distant from this picturesque hill rises another still more striking called the abbey craig on which is a ruin and where is to be built the monument to william wallace  i cannot conceive a nobler or more fitting pedestal  the sullenness of the day had vanished the air was cool but invigorating and the cloud scenery was as fine as that below it     though it was nearly ten oclock the boys of the village were in full shout and play for these long and late summer evenings keep the children out of bed interminably    stirling   july 7thwe bestirred ourselves early this morning     and took the rail for stirling before eight  it is but a few minutes ride so that doubtless we were earlier on the field than if we had slept at stirling  after our arrival our first call was at the postoffice where i found a large package containing letters from america but none from u  we then went to a booksellers shop and bought some views of stirling and the neighborhood and it is surprising what a quantity and variety of engravings there are of every noted place that we have visited  you seldom find two sets alike  it is rather nauseating to find that what you came to see has already been looked at in all its lights over and over again with thousandfold repetition and beyond question its depictment in words has been attempted still oftener than with the pencil  it will be worth while to go back to america were it only for the chance of finding a still virgin scene  we climbed the steep slope of the castle hill sometimes passing an antiquelooking house with a high notched gable perhaps with an ornamented front until we came to the sculptures and battlemented wall with an archway that stands just below the castle     a shabbylooking man now accosted us and could hardly be shaken off  i have met with several such boors in my experience of sightseeing  he kept along with us in spite of all hints to the contrary and insisted on pointing out objects of interest  he showed us a house in broad street below the castle and cathedral which he said had once been inhabited by henry darnley queen marys husband  there was little or nothing peculiar in its appearance a large gray gabled house standing lengthwise to the street with three windows in the roof and connected with other houses on each side  almost directly across the street he pointed to an archway through the side of a house and peeping through it we found a soldier on guard in a courtyard the sides of which were occupied by an old mansion of the argyle family having towers at the corners with conical tops like those reproduced in the hotel at the trosachs  it is now occupied as a military hospital  shaking off our selfinflicted guide we now made our way to the castle parade and to the gateway where a soldier with a tremendously red nose and two medals at once took charge of us  beyond all doubt i have written quite as good a description of the castle and carse of stirling in a former portion of my journal as i can now write  we passed through the outer rampart of queen anne through the old round gatetower of an earlier day and beneath the vacant arch where the portcullis used to fall thus reaching the inner region where stands the old palace on one side and the old parliament house on the other  the former looks aged ragged and rusty but makes a good appearance enough pictorially being adorned all round about with statues which may have been white marble once but are as gray as weatherbeaten granite now and look down from between the windows above the basement story  a photograph would give the idea of very rich antiquity but as it really stands looking on a gravelled courtyard and with canteen painted on one of its doors the spectator does not find it very impressive  the great hall of this palace is now partitioned off into two or three rooms and the whole edifice is arranged to serve as barracks  of course no trace of ancient magnificence if anywise destructible can be left in the interior  we were not shown into this palace nor into the parliament house nor into the tower where king james stabbed the earl of douglas  when i was here a year ago i went up the old staircase and into the room where the murder was committed although it had recently been the scene of a fire which consumed as much of it as was inflammable  the window whence the earls body was thrown then remained but now the whole tower seems to have been renewed leaving only the mullions of the historic window  we merely looked up at the new lightcolored freestone of the restored tower in passing and ascended to the ramparts where we found one of the most splendid views morally and materially that this world can show indeed i think there cannot be such a landscape as the carse of stirling set in such a frame as it isthe highlands comprehending our friends ben lomond ben venue ben an and the whole ben brotherhood with the grampians surrounding it to the westward and northward and in other directions some range of prominent objects to shut it in and the plain itself so worthy of the richest setting so fertile so beautiful so written over and over again with histories  the silver links of forth are as sweet and gently picturesque an object as a man sees in a lifetime  i do not wonder that providence caused great things to happen on this plain it was like choosing a good piece of canvas to paint a great picture upon  the battle of bannockburn which we saw beneath us with the gillies hill on the right could not have been fought upon a meaner plain nor wallaces victory gained and if any other great historic act still remains to be done in this country i should imagine the carse of stirling to be the future scene of it  scott seems to me hardly to have done justiceto this landscape or to have bestowed pains enough to put it in strong relief before the world although it is from the light shed on it and so much other scottish scenery by his mind that we chiefly see it and take an interest in it      i do not remember seeing the hill of execution beforea mound on the same level as the castles base looking towards the highlands  a solitary cow was now feeding upon it  i should imagine that no person could ever have been unjustly executed there the spot is too much in the sight of heaven and earth to countenance injustice  descending from the ramparts we went into the armory which i did not see on my former visit  the superintendent of this department is an old soldier of very great intelligence and vast communicativeness and quite absorbed in thinking of and handling weapons for he is a practical armorer  he had few things to show us that were very interestinga helmet or two a bomb and grenade from the crimea also some muskets from the same quarter one of which with a sword at the end he spoke of admiringly as the best weapon in the collection its only fault being its extreme weight  he showed us too some minie rifles and whole ranges of the oldfashioned brown bess which had helped to win wellingtons victories also the halberts of sergeants now laid aside and some swords that had been used at the battle of sheriffmuir  these latter were very short not reaching to the floor when i held one of them point downward in my hand  the shortness of the blade and consequent closeness of the encounter must have given the weapon a most daggerlike murderousness  ranging in the hall of arms there were two tattered banners that had gone through the peninsular battles one of them belonging to the gallant 42d regiment  the armorer gave my wife a rag from each of these banners consecrated by so much battlesmoke also a piece of old oak half burned to charcoal which had been rescued from the panelling of the douglas tower  we saw better things moreover than all these rusty weapons and ragged flags namely the pulpit and communiontable of john knox  the frame of the former if i remember aright is complete but one or two of the panels are knocked out and lost and on the whole it looks as if it had been shaken to pieces by the thunder of his holdings forthmuch wormeaten too is the old oak wood as well it may be for the letters md 1500 are carved on its front  the communiontable is polished and in much better preservation  then the armorer showed us a damascus blade of the kind that will cut a delicate silk handkerchief while floating in the air and some inlaid matchlock guns  a childs little toygun was lying on a workbench among all this array of weapons and when i took it up and smiled he said that it was his sons  so he called in a little fellow four years old who was playing in the castle yard and made him go through the musket exercise which he did with great goodwill  this small son of a gun the father assured us cares for nothing but arms and has attained all his skill with the musket merely by looking at the soldiers on parade      our soldier who had resigned the care of us to the armorer met us again at the door and led us round the remainder of the ramparts dismissing us finally at the gate by which we entered  all the time we were in the castle there had been a great discordance of drums and fifes caused by the musicians who were practising just under the walls likewise the sergeants were drilling their squads of men and putting them through strange gymnastic motions  most if not all of the garrison belongs to a highland regiment and those whom we saw on duty in full costume looked very martial and gallant  emerging from the castle we took the broad and pleasant footpath which circles it about midway on the grassy steep which descends from the rocky precipice on which the walls are built  this is a very beautiful walk and affords a most striking view of the castle right above our heads the height of its wall forming one line with the precipice  the grassy hillside is almost as precipitous as the dark gray rock that rises out of it to form the foundations of the castle but wild rosebushes both of a white and red variety are abundant here and all in bloom nor are these the only flowers  there is also shrubbery in some spots tossing up green waves against the precipice and broad sheets of ivy here and there mantle the headlong rock which also has a growth of weeds in its crevices  the castle walls above however are quite bare of any such growth  thus looking up at the old storied fortress and looking down over the wide historic plain we wandered halfway round the castle and then retracing our steps entered the town close by an old hospital  a hospital it was or had been intended for but the authorities of the town had made some convenient arrangement with those entitled to its charity and had appropriated the ancient edifice to themselves  so said a boy who showed us into the guildhallan apartment with a vaulted oaken roof and otherwise of antique aspect and furniture all of which however were modern restorations  we then went into an old church or cathedral which was divided into two parts one of them in which i saw the royal arms being probably for the churchofengland service and the other for the kirk of scotland  i remember little or nothing of this edifice except that the covenanters had uplifted it with pews and a gallery and whitewash though i doubt not it was a stately gothic church with innumerable enrichments and incrustations of beauty when it passed from popish hands into theirs  thence we wandered downward through a back street amid very shabby houses some of which bore tokens of having once been the abodes of courtly and noble personages  we paused before one that displayed i think the sign of a spiritretailer and looked as disreputable as a house could yet was built of stalwart stone and had two circular towers in front once doubtless crowned with conical tops  we asked an elderly man whether he knew anything of the history of this house and he said that he had been acquainted with it for almost fifty years but never knew anything noteworthy about it reaching the foot of the hill along whose back the streets of stirling run and which blooms out into the castle craig we returned to the railway and at noon took leave of stirling  i forgot to tell of the things that awakened rather more sympathy in us than any other objects in the castle armory  these were some rude weaponspikes very roughly made and old rusty muskets broken and otherwise out of order and swords by no means with damascus blades that had been taken from some poor weavers and other handicraft men who rose against the government in 1820  i pitied the poor fellows much seeing how wretched were their means of standing up against the cannon bayonets swords shot shell and all manner of murderous facilities possessed by their oppressors  afterwards our guide showed in a gloomy quadrangle of the castle the low windows of the dungeons where two of the leaders of the insurrectionists had been confined before their execution  i have not the least shadow of doubt that these men had a good cause to fight for but what availed it with such weapons and so few even of those      i believe i cannot go on to recount any further this evening the experiences of today  it has been a very rich day only that i have seen more than my sluggish powers of reception can well take in at once after quitting stirling we came in somewhat less than an hour to    linlithgow   and alighting took up our quarters at the star and garter hotel which like almost all the scottish caravansaries of which we have had experience turns out a comfortable one     we stayed within doors for an hour or two and i busied myself with writing up my journal  at about three however the sky brightened a little and we set forth through the ancient rusty and queerlooking town of linlithgow towards the palace and the ancient church which latter was one of st davids edifices and both of which stand close together a little removed from the long street of the village  but i can never describe them worthily and shall make nothing of the description if i attempt it now   july 8that about three oclock yesterday as i said we walked forth through the ancient street of linlithgow and coming to the marketplace stopped to look at an elaborate and heavy stone fountain which we found by an inscription to be the facsimile of an old one that used to stand on the same site  turning to the right the outer entrance to the palace fronts on this marketplace if such it be and close to it a little on one side is the church  a young woman with a key in her hand offered to admit us into the latter so we went in and found it divided by a wall across the middle into two parts  the hither portion being the nave was whitewashed and looked as bare and uninteresting as an old gothic church of st davids epoch possibly could do  the interior portion being the former choir is covered with pews over the whole floor and further defaced by galleries that unmercifully cut midway across the stately and beautiful arches  it is likewise whitewashed  there were i believe some mural monuments of bailies and other such people stuck up about the walls but nothing that much interested me except an ancient oaken chair which the girl said was the chair of st crispin and it was fastened to the wall in the holiest part of the church  i know not why it was there but as it had been the chair of so distinguished a personage we all sat down in it  it was in this church that the apparition of st james appeared to king james iv to warn him against engaging in that war which resulted in the battle of flodden where he and the flower of his nobility were slain  the young woman showed us the spot where the apparition spake to hima side chapel with a groined roof at the end of the choir next the nave  the covenanters seem to have shown some respect to this one chapel by refraining from drawing the gallery across its height so that except for the whitewash and the loss of the painted glass in the window and probably of a good deal of rich architectural detail it looks as it did when the ghostly saint entered beneath its arch while the king was kneeling there  we stayed but a little while in the church and then proceeded to the palace which as i said is close at hand  on entering the outer enclosure through an ancient gateway we were surprised to find how entire the walls seemed to be but the reason is i suppose that the ruins have not been used as a stonequarry as has almost always been the case with old abbeys and castles  the palace took fire and was consumed so far as consumable in 1745 while occupied by the soldiers of general hawley but even yet the walls appear so stalwart that i should imagine it quite possible to rebuild and restore the stately rooms on their original plan  it was a noble palace one hundred and seventyfive feet in length by one hundred and sixtyfive in breadth and though destitute of much architectural beauty externally yet its aspect from the quadrangle which the four sides enclose is venerable and sadly beautiful at each of the interior angles there is a circular tower up the whole height of the edifice and overtopping it and another in the centre of one of the sides all containing winding staircases  the walls facing upon the enclosed quadrangle are pierced with many windows and have been ornamented with sculpture rich traces of which still remain over the arched entranceways and in the grassy centre of the court there is the ruin and broken fragments of a fountain which once used to play for the delight of the king and queen and lords and ladies who looked down upon it from hall and chamber  many old carvings that belonged to it are heaped together there but the water has disappeared though had it been a natural spring it would have outlasted all the heavy stonework  as far as we were able and could find our way we went through every room of the palace all round the four sides  from the first floor upwards it is entirely roofless  in some of the chambers there is an accumulation of soil and a goodly crop of grass in others there is still a flooring of flags or brick tiles though damp and mossgrown and with weeds sprouting between the crevices  grass and weeds indeed have found soil enough to flourish in even on the highest ranges of the walls though at a dizzy height above the ground and it was like an old and trite touch of romance to see how the weeds sprouted on the many hearthstones and aspired under the chimneyflues as if in emulation of the longextinguished flame  it was very mournful very beautiful very delightful too to see how nature takes back the palace now that kings have done with it and adopts it as a part of her great garden  on one side of the quadrangle we found the roofless chamber where mary queen of scots was born and in the same range the bedchamber that was occupied by several of the scottish jameses and in one corner of the latter apartment there is a narrow winding staircase down which i groped expecting to find a door either into the enclosed quadrangle or to the outside of the palace  but it ends in nothing unless it be a dungeon and one does not well see why the bedchamber of the king should be so convenient to a dungeon  it is said that king james iii once escaped down this secret stair and lay concealed from some conspirators who had entered his chamber to murder him  this range of apartments is terminated like the other sides of the palace by a circular tower enclosing a staircase up which we mounted winding round and round and emerging at various heights until at last we found ourselves at the very topmost point of the edifice and here there is a small pepperbox of a turret almost as entire as when the stones were first laid  it is called queen margarets bower and looks forth on a lovely prospect of mountain and plain and on the old red roofs of linlithgow town and on the little loch that lies within the palace grounds  the cold northwind blew chill upon us through the empty windowframes which very likely were never glazed but it must be a delightful nook in a calmer and warmer summer evening  descending from this high perch we walked along ledges and through arched corridors and stood contemplative in the dampness of the banquetinghall and sat down on the seats that still occupy the embrasures of the deep windows  in one of the rooms the sculpture of a huge fireplace has recently been imitated and restored so as to give an idea of what the richness of the adornments must have been when the building was perfect  we burrowed down too a little way in the direction of the cells where prisoners used to be confined but these were too ugly and too impenetrably dark to tempt us far  one vault exactly beneath a queens very bedchamber was designated as a prison  i should think bad dreams would have winged up and made her pillow an uncomfortable one  there seems to be no certain record as respects the date of this palace except that the most recent part was built by james i of england and bears the figures 1620 on its central tower  in this part were the kitchens and other domestic offices  in robert bruces time there was a castle here instead of a palace and an ancestor of our friend bennoch was the means of taking it from the english by a stratagem in which valor went halves  four centuries afterwards it was a royal residence and might still have been nominally so had not hawleys dragoons lighted their fires on the floors of the magnificent rooms but on the whole i think it more valuable as a ruin than if it were still perfect scotland and the world needs only one holyrood and linlithgow were it still a perfect palace must have been second in interest to that from its lack of association with historic events so grand and striking  after tea we took another walk and this time went along the high street in quest of the house whence bothwellhaugh fired the shot that killed the regent murray  it has been taken down however or if any part of it remain it has been built into and incorporated with a small house of dark stone which forms one range with two others that stand a few feet back from the general line of the street  it is as meanlooking and commonplace an edifice as is anywhere to be seen and is now occupied by one steele a tailor  we went under a square arch if an arch can be square that goes quite through the house and found ourselves in a little court but it was not easy to identify anything as connected with the historic event so we did but glance about us and returned into the street  it is here narrow and as bothwellhaugh stood in a projecting gallery the regent must have been within a few yards of the muzzle of his carbine  the street looks as old as any that i have seen except perhaps a vista here and there in chesterthe houses all of stone many of them tall with notched gables and with stone staircases going up outside the steps much worn by feet now dust a pervading ugliness which yet does not fail to be picturesque a general filth and evil odor of gutters and people suggesting sorrowful ideas of what the inner houses must be when the outside looks and smells so badly and finally a great rabble of the inhabitants talking idling sporting staring about their own thresholds and those of dramshops the town being most alive in the long twilight of the summer evening  there was nothing uncivil in the deportment of these dirty people old or young but they did stare at us most unmercifully  we walked very late entering after all that we had seen into the palace grounds and skirting along linlithgow loch which would be very beautiful if its banks were made shadowy with trees instead of being almost bare  we viewed the palace on the outside too and saw what had once been the principal entrance but now looked like an arched window pretty high in the wall for it had not been accessible except by a drawbridge  i might write pages in telling how venerable the ruin looked as the twilight fell deeper and deeper around it but we have had enough of linlithgow especially as there have been so many old palaces and old towns to write about and there will still be more  we left linlithgow early this morning and reached edinburgh in half an hour tomorrow i suppose i shall try to set down what i see at least some points of it   july 9tharriving at    edinburgh   and acting under advice of the cabman we drove to addisons alma hotel which we find to be in princes street having scotts monument a few hundred yards below and the castle hill about as much above  the edinburgh people seem to be accustomed to climb mountains within their own houses so we had to mount several staircases before we reached our parlor which is a very good one and commands a beautiful view of princes street and of the picturesque old town and the valley between and of the castle on its hill  our first visit was to the castle which we reached by going across the causeway that bridges the valley and has some edifices of grecian architecture on it contrasting strangely with the nondescript ugliness of the old town into which we immediately pass  as this is my second visit to edinburgh i surely need not dwell upon describing it at such length as if i had never been here before  after climbing up through various wards of the castle to the topmost battery where mons meg holds her station looking like an uncouth dragonwith a pile of huge stone balls beside her for eggswe found that we could not be admitted to queen marys apartments nor to the crownroom till twelve oclock moreover that there was no admittance to the crownroom without tickets from the crownoffice in parliament square  there being no help for it i left my wife and j to wander through the fortress and came down through high street in quest of parliament square which i found after many inquiries of policemen and after first going to the justiciary court where there was a great throng endeavoring to get in for the trial of miss smith for the murder of her lover is causing great excitement just now  there was no difficulty made about the tickets and returning found s and j but j grew tired of waiting and set out to return to our hotel through the great strange city all by himself  through means of an attendant we were admitted into queen margarets little chapel on the top of the rock and then we sat down in such shelter as there was to avoid the keen wind blowing through the embrasures of the ramparts and waited as patiently as we could  twelve oclock came and we went into the crownroom with a throng of other visitorsso many that they could only be admitted in separate groups  the regalia of scotland lie on a circular table within an iron railing round and round which the visitors pass gazing with all their eyes  the room was dark however except for the dim twinkle of a candle or gaslight and the regalia did not show to any advantage though there are some rich jewels set in their ancient gold  the articles consist of a twohanded sword with a hilt and scabbard of gold ornamented with gems and a mace with a silver handle all very beautifully made besides the golden collar and jewelled badge of the garter and something else which i forget  why they keep this room so dark i cannot tell but it is a poor show and gives the spectator an idea of the poverty of scotland and the minuteness of her sovereignty which i had not gathered from her royal palaces  thence we went into queen marys room and saw that beautiful portrait that very queen and very womanwith which i was so much impressed at my last visit  it is wonderful that this picture does not drive all the other portraits of mary out of the field whatever may be the comparative proofs of their authenticity  i do not know the history of this one except that it is a copy by sir william gordon of a picture by an italian preserved at dunrobin castle  after seeing what the castle had to show which is but little except itself its rocks and its old dwellings of princes and prisoners we came down through the high street inquiring for john knoxs house  it is a strangelooking edifice with gables on high projecting far and some sculpture and inscriptions referring to knox  there is a tobacconists shop in the basement story where i learned that the house used to be shown to visitors till within three months but it is now closed for some reason or other  thence we crossed a bridge into the new town and came back through princes street to the hotel and had a good dinner as preparatory to fresh wearinesses for there is no other weariness at all to be compared to that of sightseeing  in mid afternoon we took a cab and drove to holyrood palace which i have already described as well as the chapel and do not mean to meddle with either of them again  we looked at our faces in the old mirrors that queen mary brought from france with her and which had often reflected her own lovely face and figure and i went up the winding stair through which the conspirators ascended  this i think was not accessible at my former visit  before leaving the palace one of the attendants advised us to see some pictures in the apartments occupied by the marquis of breadalbane during the queens residence here  we found some fine old portraits and other paintings by vandyke sir peter lely sir godfrey kneller and a strange head by rubens amid all which i walked wearily wishing that there were nothing worth looking at in the whole world  my wife differs altogether from me in this matter     but we agreed on this occasion in being tired to death  just as we got through with the pictures i became convinced of what i had been dimly suspecting all the while namely that at my last visit to the palace i had seen these selfsame pictures and listened to the selfsame womans civil answers in just the selfsame miserable weariness of mood  we left the palace and toiled up through the dirty canongate looking vainly for a fly and employing our time as well as we could in looking at the squalid mob of edinburgh and peeping down the horrible vistas of the closes which were swarming with dirty life as some mouldy and halfdecayed substance might swarm with insectsvistas down alleys where sin sorrow poverty drunkenness all manner of sombre and sordid earthly circumstances had imbued the stone brick and wood of the habitations for hundreds of years  and such a multitude of children too that was a most striking feature  after tea i went down into the valley between the old town and the new which is now laid out as an ornamental garden with grass shrubbery flowers gravelled walks and frequent seats  here the sun was setting and gilded the old town with its parting rays making it absolutely the most picturesque scene possible to be seen  the mass of tall ancient houses heaped densely together looked like a gothic dream for there seemed to be towers and all sorts of stately architecture and spires ascended out of the mass and above the whole was the castle with a diadem of gold on its topmost turret  it wanted less than a quarter of nine when the last gleam faded from the windows of the old town and left the crowd of buildings dim and indistinguishable to reappear on the morrow in squalor lifting their meanness skyward the home of layer upon layer of unfortunate humanity  the change symbolized the difference between a poets imagination of life in the pastor in a state which he looks at through a colored and illuminated mediumand the sad reality  this morning we took a cab and set forth between ten and eleven to see edinburgh and its environs driving past the university and other noticeable objects in the old town and thence out to arthurs seat salisbury crags are a very singular feature of the outskirts  from the heights beneath arthurs seat we had a fine prospect of the sea with leith and portobello in the distance and of a fertile plain at the foot of the hill  in the course of our drive our cabman pointed out dumbiedikes house also the cottage of jeanie deansat least the spot where it formerly stood and muschats cairn of which a small heap of stones is yet remaining  near this latter object are the ruins of st anthonys chapel a roofless gable and other remains standing on the abrupt hillside  we drove homeward past a paradeground on which a body of cavalry was exercising and we met a company of infantry on their route thither  then we drove near calton hill which seems to be not a burialground although the site of stately monuments  in fine we passed through the grassmarket where we saw the cross in the pavement in the street marking the spot as i recorded before where porteous was executed  thence we passed through the cowgate all the latter part of our drive being amongst the tall quaint edifices of the old town alike venerable and squalid  from the grassmarket the rock of the castle looks more precipitous than as we had hitherto seen it and its prisons palaces and barracks approach close to its headlong verge and form one steep line with its descent  we drove quite round the castle hill and returned down princes street to our hotel  there can be no other city in the world that affords more splendid scenery both natural and architectural than edinburgh  then we went to st giless cathedral which i shall not describe it having been kirkified into three interior divisions by the covenanters and i left my wife to take drawings while j and i went to shorts observatory near the entrance of the castle  here we saw a cameraobscura which brought before us without our stirring a step almost all the striking objects which we had been wandering to and fro to see  we also saw the mites in cheese gigantically magnified by a solar microscope likewise some dioramic views with all which i was mightily pleased and for myself being tired to death of sights i would as lief see them as anything else  we found on calling for mamma at st giless that she had gone away but she rejoined us between four and five oclock at our hotel where the next thing we did was to dine again after dinner we walked out looking at the shopwindows of jewellers where ornaments made of cairngorm pebbles are the most peculiar attraction  as it was our weddingday     i gave s a golden and amethystbodied cairngorm beetle with a ruby head and after sitting awhile in princes street gardens we came home   july 10thlast evening i walked round the castle rock and through the grassmarket where i stood on the inlaid cross in the pavement thence down the high street beyond john knoxs house  the throng in that part of the town was very great  there is a strange fascination in these old streets and in the peeps down the closes but it doubtless would be a great blessing were a fire to sweep through the whole of ancient edinburgh  this system of living on flats up to i know not what story must be most unfavorable to cleanliness since they have to fetch their water all that distance towards heaven and how they get rid of their rubbish is best known to themselves  my wife has gone to roslin this morning and since her departure it has been drizzly so that j and i after a walk through the new part of the town are imprisoned in our parlor with little resource except to look across the valley to the castle where mons meg is plainly visible on the upper platform and the lower ramparts zigzagging about the edge of the precipice which nearly in front of us is concealed or softened by a great deal of shrubbery but farther off descends steeply down to the grass below  somewhere on this side of the rock was the point where claverhouse on quitting edinburgh before the battle of killiecrankie clambered up to hold an interview with the duke of gordon  what an excellent thing it is to have such striking and indestructible landmarks and timemarks that they serve to affix historical incidents to and thus as it were nail down the past for the benefit of all future ages  the old town of edinburgh appears to be situated in its densest part on the broad back of a ridge which rises gradually to its termination in the precipitous rock on which stands the castle  between the old town and the new is the valley which runs along at the base of this ridge and which in its natural state was probably rough and broken like any mountain gorge  the lower part of the valley adjacent to the canongate is now a broad hollow space fitted up with dwellings shops or manufactories the next portion between two bridges is converted into an ornamental garden free to the public and contains scotts beautiful monumenta canopy of gothic arches and a fantastic spire beneath which he sits thoughtful and observant of what passes in the contiguous street the third portion of the valley above the last bridge is another ornamental garden open only to those who have passkeys  it is an admirable garden with a great variety of surface and extends far round the castle rock with paths that lead up to its very base among leafy depths of shrubbery and winds beneath the sheer black precipice j and i walked there this forenoon and took refuge from a shower beneath an overhanging jut of the rock where a bench had been placed and where a curtain of hanging ivy helped to shelter us  on our return to the hotel we found mamma just alighting from a cab  she had had very bad fortune in her excursion to roslin having had to walk a long distance to the chapel and being caught in the rain and after all she could only spend seven minutes in viewing the beautiful roslin architecture    melrose   july 11thwe left edinburgh where we had found at addisons 87 princes street the most comfortable hotel in great britain and went to melrose where we put up at the george  this is all travelled ground with me so that i need not much perplex myself with further description especially as it is impossible by any repetition of attempts to describe melrose abbey  we went thither immediately after tea and were shown over the ruins by a very delectable old scotchman incomparably the best guide i ever met with  i think he must take pains to speak the scotch dialect he does it with such pungent felicity and effect and it gives a flavor to everything he says like the mustard and vinegar in a salad  this is not the man i saw when here before  the scotch dialect is still in a greater or less degree universally prevalent in scotland insomuch that we generally find it difficult to comprehend the answers to our questions though more i think from the unusual intonation than either from strange words or pronunciation  but this old man though he spoke the most unmitigated scotch was perfectly intelligibleperhaps because his speech so well accorded with the classic standard of the waverley novels  moreover he is thoroughly acquainted with the abbey stone by stone and it was curious to see him as we walked among its aisles and over the grass beneath its roofless portions pick up the withered leaves that had fallen there and do other such little things as a good housewife might do to a parlor  i have met with two or three instances where the guardian of an old edifice seemed really to love it and this was one although the old man evidently had a scotch covenanters contempt and dislike of the faith that founded the abbey he repeated king davids dictum that king david the first was a sair saint for the crown as bestowing so much wealth on religious edifices but really unless it be walter scott i know not any scotchman who has done so much for his country as this same st david  as the founder of melrose and many other beautiful churches and abbeys he left magnificent specimens of the only kind of poetry which the age knew how to produce and the world is the better for him to this daywhich is more i believe than can be said of any hero or statesman in scottish annals  we went all over the ruins of course and saw the marble stone of king alexander and the spot where bruces heart is said to be buried and the slab of michael scott with the cross engraved upon it also the exquisitely sculptured kailleaves and other foliage and flowers with which the gothic artists inwreathed this edifice bestowing more minute and faithful labor than an artist of these days would do on the most delicate piece of cabinetwork  we came away sooner than we wished but we hoped to return thither this morning and for my part i cherish a presentiment that this will not be our last visit to scotland and melrose     j and i then walked to the tweed where we saw two or three people angling with naked legs or trousers turned up and wading among the rude stones that make something like a dam over the wide and brawling stream  i did not observe that they caught any fish but j was so fascinated with the spectacle that he pulled out his poor little fishingline and wished to try his chance forthwith  i never saw the anglers instinct stronger in anybody  we walked across the footbridge that here spans the tweed and j observed that he did not see how william of deloraine could have found so much difficulty in swimming his horse across so shallow a river  neither do i  it now began to sprinkle and we hastened back to the hotel  it was not a pleasant morning but we started immediately after breakfast for    abbotsford   which is but about three miles distant  the country between melrose and that place is not in the least beautiful nor very noteworthyone or two old irregular villages one tower that looks principally domestic yet partly warlike and seems to be of some antiquity and an undulation or rounded hilly surface of the landscape sometimes affording wide vistas between the slopes  these hills which i suppose are some of them on the abbotsford estate are partly covered with woods but of scotch fir or some tree of that species which creates no softened undulation but overspreads the hill like a tightly fitting wig  it is a cold dreary disheartening neighborhood that of abbotsford at least it has appeared so to me at both of my visitsone of which was on a bleak and windy may morning and this one on a chill showery morning of midsummer  the entranceway to the house is somewhat altered since my last visit and we now following the direction of a painted finger on the wall went round to a side door in the basement story where we found an elderly man waiting as if in expectation of visitors  he asked us to write our names in a book and told us that the desk on the leaf of which it lay was the one in which sir walter found the forgotten manuscript of waverley while looking for some fishingtackle  there was another desk in the room which had belonged to the colonel gardiner who appears in waverley  the first apartment into which our guide showed us was sir walters study where i again saw his clothes and remarked how the sleeve of his old green coat was worn at the cuffa minute circumstance that seemed to bring sir walter very near me  thence into the library thence into the drawingroom whence methinks we should have entered the diningroom the most interesting of all as being the room where he died  but this room seems not to be shown now  we saw the armory with the gun of rob roy into the muzzle of which i put my finger and found the bore very large the beautifully wrought pistol of claverhouse and a pair of pistols that belonged to napoleon the sword of montrose which i grasped and drew half out of the scabbard and queen marys iron jewelbox six or eight inches long and two or three high with a lid rounded like that of a trunk and much corroded with rust  there is no use in making a catalogue of these curiosities  the feeling in visiting abbotsford is not that of awe it is little more than going to a museum i do abhor this mode of making pilgrimages to the shrines of departed great men  there is certainly something wrong in it for it seldom or never produces in me at least the right feeling  it is an odd truth too that a house is forever after spoiled and ruined as a home by having been the abode of a great man  his spirit haunts it as it were with a malevolent effect and takes hearth and hall away from the nominal possessors giving all the world the right to enter there because he had such intimate relations with all the world  we had intended to go to dryburgh abbey but as the weather more than threatened rain     we gave up the idea and so took the rail for berwick after one oclock  on our road we passed several ruins in scotland and some in englandone old castle in particular beautifully situated beside a deepbanked stream  the road lies for many miles along the coast affording a fine view of the german ocean which was now blue sunny and breezy the day having risen out of its morning sulks  we waited an hour or more at berwick and j and i took a hasty walk into the town  it is a rough and rude assemblage of rather mean houses some of which are thatched  there seems to have been a wall about the town at a former period and we passed through one of the gates  the view of the river tweed here is very fine both above and below the railway bridge and especially where it flows a broad tide and between high banks into the sea  thence we went onward along the coast as i have said pausing a few moments in smoky newcastle and reaching durham about eight oclock    durham   i wandered out in the dusk of the eveningfor the dusk comes on comparatively early as we draw southwardand found a beautiful and shadowy path along the riverside skirting its high banks up and adown which grow noble elms  i could not well see in that obscurity of twilight boughs whither i was going or what was around me but i judged that the castle or cathedral or both crowned the highest line of the shore and that i was walking at the base of their walls  there was a pair of lovers in front of me and i passed two or three other tender couples  the walk appeared to go on interminably by the riverside through the same sweet shadow but i turned and found my way into the cathedral close beneath an ancient archway whence issuing again i inquired my way to the waterloo hotel where we had put up   itemswe saw the norham castle of marmion at a short distance from the station of the same name  viewed from the railway it has not a very picturesque appearancea high square ruin of what i suppose was the keepat abbotsford treasured up in a glass case in the drawingroom were memorials of sir walter scotts servants and humble friendsfor instance a brass snuffbox of tom purdiethere too among precious relics of illustrious personsin the armory i grasped with some interest the sword of sir adam ferguson which he had worn in the peninsular war  our guide said of his own knowledge that he was a very funny old gentleman  he died only a year or two since   july 11ththe morning after our arrival in durham being sunday we attended service in the cathedral     we found a tolerable audience seated on benches within and in front of the choir and people continually strayed in and out of the sunny churchyard and sat down or walked softly and quietly up and down the side aisle  sometimes too one of the vergers would come in with a handful of little boys whom he had caught playing among the tombstones    durham cathedral   has one advantage over the others which i have seen there being no organscreen nor any sort of partition between the choir and nave so that we saw its entire length nearly five hundred feet in one vista the pillars of the nave are immensely thick but hardly of proportionate height and they support the round norman arch nor is there as far as i remember a single pointed arch in the cathedral  the effect is to give the edifice an air of heavy grandeur  it seems to have been built before the best style of church architecture had established itself so that it weighs upon the soul instead of helping it to aspire  first there are these round arches supported by gigantic columns then immediately above another row of round arches behind which is the usual gallery that runs as it were in the thickness of the wall around the nave of the cathedral then above all another row of round arches enclosing the windows of the clerestory  the great pillars are ornamented in various wayssome with a great spiral groove running from bottom to top others with two spirals ascending in different directions so as to cross over one another some are fluted or channelled straight up and down some are wrought with chevrons like those on the sleeve of a policeinspector  there are zigzag cuttings and carvings which i do not know how to name scientifically round the arches of the doors and windows but nothing that seems to have flowered out spontaneously as natural incidents of a grand and beautiful design  in the nave between the columns of the side aisles i saw one or two monuments      the cathedral service is very long and though the choral part of it is pleasant enough i thought it not best to wait for the sermon especially as it would have been quite unintelligible so remotely as i sat in the great space  so i left my seat and after strolling up and down the aisle a few times sallied forth into the churchyard  on the cathedral door there is a curious old knocker in the form of a monstrous face which was placed there centuries ago for the benefit of fugitives from justice who used to be entitled to sanctuary here  the exterior of the cathedral being huge is therefore grand it has a great central tower and two at the western end and reposes in vast and heavy length without the multitude of niches and crumbling statues and richness of detail that make the towers and fronts of some cathedrals so endlessly interesting  one piece of sculpture i remembera carving of a cow a milkmaid and a monk in reference to the legend that the site of the cathedral was in some way determined by a woman bidding her cow go home to dunholme  cadmus was guided to the site of his destined city in some such way as this  it was a very beautiful day and though the shadow of the cathedral fell on this side yet it being about noontide it did not cover the churchyard entirely but left many of the graves in sunshine  there were not a great many monuments and these were chiefly horizontal slabs some of which looked aged but on closer inspection proved to be mostly of the present century  i observed an old stone figure however half worn away which seemed to have something like a bishops mitre on its head and may perhaps have lain in the proudest chapel of the cathedral before occupying its present bed among the grass  about fifteen paces from the central tower and within its shadow i found a weatherworn slab of marble seven or eight feet long the inscription on which interested me somewhat  it was to the memory of robert dodsley the bookseller johnsons acquaintance who as his tombstone rather superciliously avers had made a much better figure as an author than could have been expected in his rank of life  but after all it is inevitable that a mans tombstone should look down on him or at all events comport itself towards him de haut en bas  i love to find the graves of men connected with literature  they interest me more even though of no great eminence than those of persons far more illustrious in other walks of life  i know not whether this is because i happen to be one of the literary kindred or because all men feel themselves akin and on terms of intimacy with those whom they know or might have known in books  i rather believe that the latter is the case  my wife had stayed in the cathedral but she came out at the end of the sermon and told me of two little birds who had got into the vast interior and were in great trouble at not being able to find their way out again  thus two winged souls may often have been imprisoned within a faith of heavy ceremonials  we went round the edifice and passing into the close penetrated through an arched passage into the crypt which methought was in a better style of architecture than the nave and choir  at one end stood a crowd of venerable figures leaning against the wall being stone images of bearded saints apostles patriarchs kingspersonages of great dignity at all events who had doubtless occupied conspicuous niches in and about the cathedral till finally imprisoned in this cellar  i looked at every one and found not an entire nose among them nor quite so many heads as they once had  thence we went into the cloisters which are entire but not particularly interesting  indeed this cathedral has not taken hold of my affections except in one aspect when it was exceedingly grand and beautiful  after looking at the crypt and the cloisters we returned through the close and the churchyard and went back to the hotel through a path by the riverside  this is the same dim and dusky path through which i wandered the night before and in the sunshine it looked quite as beautiful as i knew it must a shadow of elmtrees clothing the high bank and overarching the paths above and below some of the elms growing close to the waterside and flinging up their topmost boughs not nearly so high as where we stood and others climbing upward and upward till our way wound among their roots while through the foliage the quiet river loitered along with this lovely shade on both its banks to pass through the centre of the town  the stately cathedral rose high above us and farther onward in a line with it the battlemented walls of the old norman castle gray and warlike though now it has become a university  this delightful walk terminates at an old bridge in the heart of the town and the castle hangs immediately over its busiest street  on this bridge last night in the embrasure or just over the pier where there is a stone seat i saw some old men seated smoking their pipes and chatting  in my judgment a river flowing through the centre of a town and not too broad to make itself familiar nor too swift but idling along as if it loved better to stay there than to go is the pleasantest imaginable piece of scenery so transient as it is and yet enduringjust the same from lifes end to lifes end and this river wear with its sylvan wildness and yet so sweet and placable is the best of all little riversnot that it is so very small but with a bosom broad enough to be crossed by a threearched bridge  just above the cathedral there is a mill upon its shore as ancient as the times of the abbey  we went homeward through the marketplace and one or two narrow streets for the town has the irregularity of all ancient settlements and moreover undulates upward and downward and is also made more unintelligible to a stranger in its points and bearings by the tortuous course of the river  after dinner j and i walked along the bank opposite to that on which the cathedral stands and found the paths there equally delightful with those which i have attempted to describe  we went onward while the river gleamed through the foliage beneath us and passed so far beyond the cathedral that we began to think we were getting into the country and that it was time to return when all at once we saw a bridge before us and beyond that on the opposite bank of the wear the cathedral itself the stream had made a circuit without our knowing it  we paused upon the bridge and admired and wondered at the beauty and glory of the scene with those vast ancient towers rising out of the green shade and looking as if they were based upon it  the situation of durham cathedral is certainly a noble one finer even than that of lincoln though the latter stands even at a more lordly height above the town  but as i saw it then it was grand venerable and sweet all at once and i never saw so lovely and magnificent a scene nor being content with this do i care to see a better  the castle beyond came also into the view and the whole picture was mirrored in the tranquil stream below  and so crossing the bridge the path led us back through many a bower of hollow shade and we then quitted the hotel and took the rail for    york   where we arrived at about half past nine  we put up at the black swan with which we had already made acquaintance at our previous visit to york  it is a very ancient hotel for in the coffeeroom i saw on the wall an old printed advertisement announcing that a stagecoach would leave the black swan in london and arrive at the black swan in york with gods permission in four days  the date was 1706 and still after a hundred and fifty years the black swan receives travellers in coney street  it is a very good hotel and was much thronged with guests when we arrived as the sessions come on this week  we found a very smart waiter whose english faculties have been brightened by a residence of several years in america  in the morning before breakfast i strolled out and walked round the cathedral passing on my way the sheriffs javelinmen in long gowns of faded purple embroidered with gold carrying halberds in their hands also a gentleman in a cocked hat goldlace and breeches who no doubt had something to do with the ceremonial of the sessions  i saw too a procession of a good many old cabs and other carriages filled with people and a banner flaunting above each vehicle  these were the pianoforte makers of york who were going out of town to have a jollification together  after breakfast we all went to the cathedral and no sooner were we within it than we found how much our eyes had recently been educated by our greater power of appreciating this magnificent interior for it impressed us both with a joy that we never felt before  j felt it too and insisted that the cathedral must have been altered and improved since we were last here  but it is only that we have seen much splendid architecture since then and so have grown in some degree fitted to enjoy it  york cathedral i say it now for it is my present feeling is the most wonderful work that ever came from the hands of man  indeed it seems like a house not made with hands but rather to have come down from above bringing an awful majesty and sweetness with it and it is so light and aspiring with all its vast columns and pointed arches that one would hardly wonder if it should ascend back to heaven again by its mere spirituality  positively the pillars and arches of the choir are so very beautiful that they give the impression of being exquisitely polished though such is not the fact but their beauty throws a gleam around them  i thank god that i saw this cathedral again and i thank him that he inspired the builder to make it and that mankind has so long enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it   july 14thwe left york at twelve oclock and were delayed an hour or two at leeds waiting for a train  i strolled up into the town and saw a fair with puppetshows booths of penny actors merrygorounds clowns boxers and other such things as i saw above a year ago at greenwich fair and likewise at tranmere during the whitsuntide holidays  we resumed our journey and reached southport in pretty good trim at about nine oclock  it has been a very interesting tour  we find southport just as we left it with its regular streets of little and big lodginghouses where the visitors perambulate to and fro without any imaginable object  the tide too seems not to have been up over the waste of sands since we went away and far seaward stands the same row of bathingmachines and just on the verge of the horizon a gleam of water even this being not the sea but the mouth of the river ribble seeking the sea amid the sandy desert  but we shall soon say goodby to southport    old trafford manchester   july 22dwe left southport for good on the 20th and have established ourselves in this place in lodgings that had been provided for us by mr swain our principal object being to spend a few weeks in the proximity of the arts exhibition  we are here about three miles from the victoria railway station in manchester on one side and nearly a mile from the exhibition on the other  this is a suburb of manchester and consists of a long street called the stratford road bordered with brick houses two stories high such as are usually the dwellings of tradesmen or respectable mechanics but which are now in demand for lodgings at high prices on account of the exhibition  it seems to be rather a new precinct of the city and the houses though ranged along a continuous street are but a brick border of the green fields in the rear occasionally you get a glimpse of this country aspect between two houses but the street itself even with its little grassplots and bits of shrubbery under the front windows is as ugly as it can be made  some of the houses are better than i have described but the brick used here in building is very unsightly in hue and surface  betimes in the morning the exhibition omnibuses begin to trundle along and pass at intervals of two and a half minutes through the dayimmense vehicles constructed to carry thirtynine passengers and generally with a good part of that number inside and out  the omnibuses are painted scarlet bordered with white have three horses abreast and a conductor in a red coat  they perform the journey from this point into town in about half an hour and yesterday morning being in a hurry to get to the railway station i found that i could outwalk them taking into account their frequent stoppages  we have taken the whole house except some inscrutable holes into which the family creeps of respectable people who never took lodgers until this juncture  their furniture however is of the true lodginghouse pattern sofas and chairs which have no possibility of repose in them rickety tables an old piano and old music with lady helen elizabeth somebodys name written on it  it is very strange how nothing but a genuine home can ever look homelike  they appear to be good people a little girl of twelve a daughter waits on table and there is an elder daughter who yesterday answered the doorbell looking very like a young lady besides five or six smaller children who make less uproar of grief or merriment than could possibly be expected  the husband is not apparent though i see his hat in the hall  the house is new and has a trim lightcolored interior of halfgentility  i suppose the rent in ordinary times might be 25 pounds per annum but we pay at the rate of 335 pounds for the part which we occupy  this like all the other houses in the neighborhood was evidently built to be sold or let the builder never thought of living in it himself and so that subtile element which would have enabled him to create a home was entirely left out  this morning j and i set forth on a walk first towards the palace of the arts exhibition which looked small compared with my idea of it and seems to be of the crystal palace order of architecture only with more iron to its glass  its front is composed of three round arches in a row  we did not go in     turning to the right we walked onward two or three miles passing the botanic garden and thence along by suburban villas belgrave terraces and other such prettinesses in the modern gothic or elizabethan style with fancifully ornamented flowerplats before them thence by hedgerows and fields and through two or three villages with here and there an old plaster and timberbuilt thatched house among a street full of modern brickfrontsthe alehouse or rural inn being generally the most ancient house in the village  it was a sultry heavy day and i walked without much enjoyment of the air and exercise  we crossed a narrow and swift river flowing between deep banks  it must have been either the mersey still an infant stream and little dreaming of the thousand mighty ships that float on its farther tide or else the irwell which empties into the mersey  we passed through the village beyond this stream and went to the railway station and then were brought back to old trafford and deposited close by the exhibition  it has showered this afternoon and i beguiled my time for half an hour by setting down the vehicles that went past not that they were particularly numerous but for the sake of knowing the character of the travel along the road   july 26thday before yesterday we went to the arts exhibition of which i do not think that i have a great deal to say  the edifice being built more for convenience than show appears better in the interior than from withoutlong vaulted vistas lighted from above extending far away all hung with pictures and on the floor below statues knights in armor cabinets vases and all manner of curious and beautiful things in a regular arrangement  scatter five thousand people through the scene and i do not know how to make a better outline sketch  i was unquiet from a hopelessness of being able to enjoy it fully  nothing is more depressing to me than the sight of a great many pictures together it is like having innumerable books open before you at once and being able to read only a sentence or two in each  they bedazzle one another with cross lights  there never should be more than one picture in a room nor more than one picture to be studied in one day  galleries of pictures are surely the greatest absurdities that ever were contrived there being no excuse for them except that it is the only way in which pictures can be made generally available and accessible  we went first into the gallery of british painters where there were hundreds of pictures every one of which would have interested me by itself but i could not fix nay mind on one more than another so i wandered about to get a general idea of the exhibition  truly it is very fine truly also every great show is a kind of humbug  i doubt whether there were half a dozen people there who got the kind of enjoyment that it was intended to createvery respectable people they seemed to be and very well behaved but all skimming the surface as i did and none of them so feeding on what was beautiful as to digest it and make it a part of themselves  such a quantity of objects must be utterly rejected before you can get any real profit from one  it seemed like throwing away time to look twice even at whatever was most precious and it was dreary to think of not fully enjoying this collection the very flower of time which never bloomed before and never by any possibility can bloom again  viewed hastily moreover it is somewhat sad to think that mankind after centuries of cultivation of the beautiful arts can produce no more splendid spectacle than this  it is not so very grand although poor as it is i lack capacity to take in even the whole of it  what gave me most pleasure because it required no trouble nor study to come at the heart of it were the individual relics of antiquity of which there are some very curious ones in the cases ranged along the principal saloon or nave of the building  for example the dagger with which felton killed the duke of buckinghama knife with a bone handle and a curved blade not more than three inches long sharppointed murderouslooking but of very coarse manufacture  also the duke of alvas leading staff of iron and the target of the emperor charles v which seemed to be made of hardened leather with designs artistically engraved upon it and gilt  i saw wolseys portrait and in close proximity to it his veritable cardinals hat in a richly ornamented glass case on which was an inscription to the effect that it had been bought by charles kean at the sale of horace walpoles collection  it is a felt hat with a brim about six inches wide all round and a rather high crown the color was doubtless a bright red originally but now it is mottled with a grayish hue and there are cracks in the brim as if the hat had seen a good deal of wear  i suppose a far greater curiosity than this is the signetring of one of the pharaohs who reigned over egypt during josephs prime ministrya large ring to be worn on the thumb if at allof massive gold seal part and all and inscribed with some characters that looked like hebrew  i had seen this before in mr mayers collection in liverpool  the mediaeval and english relics however interested me moresuch as the golden and enamelled george worn by sir thomas more or the embroidered shirt of charles ithe very one i presume which he wore at his execution  there are no bloodmarks on it it being very nicely washed and folded  the texture of the linen clothif linen it beis coarser than any peasant would wear at this day but the needlework is exceedingly fine and elaborate another relic of the same periodthe cavalier general sir jacob astleys buffcoat with his belt and sword the leather of the buffcoat for i took it between my fingers is about a quarter of an inch thick of the same material as a washleather glove and by no means smoothly dressed though the sleeves are covered with silverlace  of old armor there are admirable specimens and it makes ones head ache to look at the iron pots which men used to thrust their heads into  indeed at one period they seem to have worn an inner iron cap underneath the helmet  i doubt whether there ever was any age of chivalry     it certainly was no chivalric sentiment that made men case themselves in impenetrable iron and ride about in iron prisons fearfully peeping at their enemies through little slits and gimletholes  the unprotected breast of a private soldier must have shamed his leaders in those days the point of honor is very different now  i mean to go again and again many times more and will take each day some one department and so endeavor to get some real use and improvement out of what i see  much that is most valuable must be immitigably rejected but something according to the measure of my poor capacity will really be taken into my mind  after all it was an agreeable day and i think the next one will be more so   july 28thday before yesterday i paid a second visit to the exhibition and devoted the day mainly to seeing the works of british painters which fill a very large spacetwo or three great saloons at the right side of the nave  among the earliest are hogarths pictures including the sigismunda which i remember to have seen before with her lovers heart in her hand looking like a monstrous strawberry and the march to finchley than which nothing truer to english life and character was ever painted nor ever can be and a large stately portrait of captain coram and others all excellent in proportion as they come near to ordinary life and are wrought out through its forms  all english painters resemble hogarth in this respect  they cannot paint anything high heroic and ideal and their attempts in that direction are wearisome to look at but they sometimes produce good effects by means of awkward figures in illmade coats and smallclothes and hard coarsecomplexioned faces such as they might see anywhere in the street they are strong in homeliness and ugliness weak in their efforts at the beautiful  sir thomas lawrence attains a sort of grace which you feel to be a trick and therefore get disgusted with it  reynolds is not quite genuine though certainly he has produced some noble and beautiful heads  but hogarth is the only english painter except in the landscape department there are no others who interpret life to me at all unless it be some of the modern preraphaelites  pretty village scenes of common lifepleasant domestic passages with a touch of easy humor in themlittle pathoses and fancynesses are abundant enough and wilkie to be sure has done more than this though not a great deal more  his merit lies not in a high aim but in accomplishing his aim so perfectly it is unaccountable that the english painters achievements should be so much inferior to those of the english poets who have really elevated the human mind but to be sure painting has only become an english art subsequently to the epochs of the greatest poets and since the beginning of the last century during which england had no poets  i respect haydon more than i once did not for his pictures they being detestable to see but for his heroic rejection of whatever his countrymen and he himself could really do and his bitter resolve to achieve something higher failing in which he died  no doubt i am doing vast injustice to a great many gifted men in what i have here writtenas for instance copley who certainly has painted a slain man to the life and to a crowd of landscapepainters who have made wonderful reproductions of little english streams and shrubbery and cottage doors and country lanes  and there is a picture called the evening gun by danbya ship of war on a calm glassy tide at sunset with the cannonsmoke puffing from her porthole it is very beautiful and so effective that you can even hear the report breaking upon the stillness with so grand a roar that it is almost like stillness too  as for turner i care no more for his lightcolored pictures than for so much lacquered ware or painted gingerbread  doubtless this is my fault my own deficiency but i cannot help itnot at least without sophisticating myself by the effort  the only modern pictures that accomplish a higher end than that of pleasing the eyethe only ones that really take hold of my mind and with a kind of acerbity like unripe fruitare the works of hunt and one or two other painters of the preraphaelite school  they seem wilfully to abjure all beauty and to make their pictures disagreeable out of mere malice but at any rate for the thought and feeling which are ground up with the paint they will bear looking at and disclose a deeper value the longer you look  never was anything so stiff and unnatural as they appear although every single thing represented seems to be taken directly out of life and reality and as it were pasted down upon the canvas  they almost paint even separate hairs  accomplishing so much and so perfectly it seems unaccountable that the picture does not live but nature has an art beyond these painters and they leave out some mediumsome enchantment that should intervene and keep the object from pressing so baldly and harshly upon the spectators eyeballs  with the most lifelike reproduction there is no illusion  i think if a semiobscurity were thrown over the picture after finishing it to this nicety it might bring it nearer to nature  i remember a heap of autumn leaves every one of which seems to have been stiffened with gum and varnish and then put carefully down into the stiffly disordered heap  perhaps these artists may hereafter succeed in combining the truth of detail with a broader and higher truth  coming from such a depth as their pictures do and having really an idea as the seed of them it is strange that they should look like the most madeup things imaginable  one picture by hunt that greatly interested me was of some sheep that had gone astray among heights and precipices and i could have looked all day at these poor lost creaturesso true was their meek alarm and hopeless bewilderment their huddling together without the slightest confidence of mutual help all that the courage and wisdom of the bravest and wisest of them could do being to bleat and only a few having spirits enough even for this  after going through these modern masters among whom were some french painters who do not interest me at all i did a miscellaneous business chiefly among the watercolors and photographs and afterwards among the antiquities and works of ornamental art  i have forgotten what i saw except the breastplate and helmet of henry of navarre of steel engraved with designs that have been half obliterated by scrubbing  i remember too a breastplate of an elector of saxony with a bullethole through it  he received his mortal wound through that hole and died of it two days afterwards three hundred years ago  there was a crowd of visitors insomuch that it was difficult to get a satisfactory view of the most interesting objects  they were nearly all middlingclass people the exhibition i think does not reach the lower classed at all in fact it could not reach them nor their betters either without a good deal of study to help it out  i shall go today and do my best to get profit out of it   july 30thwe all with r and fanny went to the exhibition yesterday and spent the day there not j however for he went to the botanical gardens  after some little skirmishing with other things i devoted myself to the historical portraits which hang on both sides of the great nave and went through them pretty faithfully  the oldest are pictures of richard ii and henry iv and edward iv and jane shore and seem to have little or no merit as works of art being cold and stiff the life having perhaps faded out of them but these older painters were trustworthy inasmuch as they had no idea of making a picture but only of getting the face before them on canvas as accurately as they could  all english history scarcely supplies half a dozen portraits before the time of henry viii after that period and through the reigns of elizabeth and james there are many ugly pictures by dutchmen and italians and the collection is wonderfully rich in portraits of the time of charles i and the commonwealth  vandyke seems to have brought portraitpainting into fashion and very likely the kings love of art diffused a taste for it throughout the nation and remotely suggested even to his enemies to get their pictures painted  elizabeth has perpetuated her cold thin visage on many canvases and generally with some fantasy of costume that makes her ridiculous to all time  there are several of mary of scotland none of which have a gleam of beauty but the stiff old brushes of these painters could not catch the beautiful of all the older pictures the only one that i took pleasure in looking at was a portrait of lord deputy falkland by vansomer in james is timea very stately fulllength figure in white looking out of the picture as if he saw you  the catalogue says that this portrait suggested an incident in horace walpoles castle of otranto but i do not remember it  i have a haunting doubt of the value of portraitpainting that is to say whether it gives you a genuine idea of the person purporting to be represented  i do not remember ever to have recognized a man by having previously seen his portrait  vandykes pictures are full of grace and nobleness but they do not look like englishmenthe burly rough wineflushed and weatherreddened faces and sturdy flesh and blood which we see even at the present day when they must naturally have become a good deal refined from either the country gentleman or the courtier of the stuarts age  there is an old fat portrait of gervoyse holles in a buffcoata coarse hoggish yet manly man  the painter is unknown but i honor him and gervoyse holles toofor one was willing to be truly rendered and the other dared to do it  it seems to be the aim of portraitpainters generally especially of those who have been most famous to make their pictures as beautiful and noble as can anywise consist with retaining the very slightest resemblance to the person sitting to them  they seldom attain even the grace and beauty which they aim at but only hit some temporary or individual taste vandyke however achieved graces that rise above time and fashion and so did sir peter lely in his female portraits but the doubt is whether the works of either are genuine history  not more so i suspect than the narrative of a historian who should seek to make poetry out of the events which he relates rejecting those which could not possibly be thus idealized  i observe furthermore that a fulllength portrait has seldom face enough not that it lacks its fair proportion by measurement but the artist does not often find it possible to make the face so intellectually prominent as to subordinate the figure and drapery  vandyke does this however  in his pictures of charles i for instance it is the melancholy grace of the visage that attracts the eye and it passes to the rest of the composition only by an effort  earlier and later pictures are but a few inches of face to several feet of figure and costume and more insignificant than the latter because seldom so well done and i suspect the same would generally be the case now only that the present simplicity of costume gives the face a chance to be seen  i was interrupted here and cannot resume the thread but considering how much of his own conceit the artist puts into a portrait how much affectation the sitter puts on and then again that no face is the same to any two spectators also that these portraits are darkened and faded with age and can seldom be more than half seen being hung too high or somehow or other inconvenient on the whole i question whether there is much use in looking at them  the truest test would be for a man well read in english history and biography and himself an observer of insight to go through the series without knowing what personages they represented and write beneath each the name which the portrait vindicated for itself  after getting through the portraitgallery i went among the engravings and photographs and then glanced along the old masters but without seriously looking at anything  while i was among the dutch painters a gentleman accosted me  it was mr j whom i once met at dinner with bennoch  he told me that the poet laureate as he called him was in the exhibition rooms and as i expressed great interest mr j was kind enough to go in quest of him  not for the purpose of introduction however for he was not acquainted with tennyson  soon mr j returned and said that he had found the poet laureateand going into the saloon of the old masters we saw him there in company with mr woolner whose bust of him is now in the exhibition  gazing at him with all my eyes i liked him well and rejoiced more in him than in all the other wonders of the exhibition  how strange that in these two or three pages i cannot get one single touch that may call him up hereafter  i would most gladly have seen more of this one poet of our day but forbore to follow him for i must own that it seemed mean to be dogging him through the saloons or even to look at him since it was to be done stealthily if at all  he is as unenglish as possible indeed an englishman of genius usually lacks the national characteristics and is great abnormally  even the great sailor nelson was unlike his countrymen in the qualities that constituted him a hero he was not the perfection of an englishman but a creature of another kindsensitive nervous excitable and really more like a frenchman  unenglish as he was tennyson had not however an american look  i cannot well describe the difference but there was something more mellow in himsofter sweeter broader more simple than we are apt to be living apart from men as he does would hurt any one of us more than it does him  i may as well leave him here for i cannot touch the central point   august 2dday before yesterday i went again to the exhibition and began the day with looking at the old masters  positively i do begin to receive some pleasure from looking at pictures but as yet it has nothing to do with any technical merit nor do i think i shall ever get so far as that  some landscapes by ruysdael and some portraits by murillo velasquez and titian were those which i was most able to appreciate and i see reason for allowing contrary to my opinion as expressed a few pages back that a portrait may preserve some valuable characteristics of the person represented  the pictures in the english portraitgallery are mostly very bad and that may be the reason why i saw so little in them i saw too at this last visit a virgin and child which appeared to me to have an expression more adequate to the subject than most of the innumerable virgins and children in which we see only repetitions of simple maternity indeed any mother with her first child would serve an artist for one of them  but in this picture the virgin had a look as if she were loving the infant as her own child and at the same time rendering him an awful worship as to her creator  while i was sitting in the central saloon listening to the music a young man accosted me presuming that i was soandso the american author  he himself was a traveller for a publishing firm and he introduced conversation by talking of uttoxeter and my description of it in an annual  he said that the account had caused a good deal of pique among the good people of uttoxeter because of the ignorance which i attribute to them as to the circumstance which connects johnson with their town  the spot where johnson stood can it appears still be pointed out  it is on one side of the marketplace and not in the neighborhood of the church  i forget whether i recorded at the time that an uttoxeter newspaper was sent me containing a proposal that a statue or memorial should be erected on the spot  it would gratify me exceedingly if such a result should come from my pious pilgrimage thither  my new acquaintance who was cockneyish but very intelligent and agreeable went on to talk about many literary matters and characters among others about miss bronte whom he had seen at the chapter coffeehouse when she and her sister anne first went to london  he was at that time connected with the house of  and  and he described the surprise and incredulity of mr when this little commonplacelooking woman presented herself as the author of jane eyre his story brought out the insignificance of charlotte brontes aspect and the bluff rejection of her by mr  much more strongly than mrs gaskells narrative   chorlton road august 9thwe have changed our lodgings since my last date those at old trafford being inconvenient and the landlady a sharp peremptory housewife better fitted to deal with her own family than to be complaisant to guests  we are now a little farther from the exhibition and not much better off as regards accommodation but the housekeeper is a pleasant civil sort of a woman auspiciously named mrs honey  the house is a specimen of the poorer middleclass dwellings as built nowadaysnarrow staircase thin walls and being constructed for sale very ill put together indeedthe floors with wide cracks between the boards and wide crevices admitting both air and light over the doors so that the house is full of draughts  the outer walls it seems to me are but of one brick in thickness and the partition walls certainly no thicker and the movements and sometimes the voices of people in the contiguous house are audible to us  the exhibition has temporarily so raised the value of lodgings here that we have to pay a high price for even such a house as this  mr wilding having gone on a tour to scotland i had to be at the consulate every day last week till yesterday when i absented myself from duty and went to the exhibition  u and i spent an hour together looking principally at the old dutch masters who seem to me the most wonderful set of men that ever handled a brush  such lifelike representations of cabbages onions brass kettles and kitchen crockery such blankets with the woollen fuzz upon them such everything i never thought that the skill of man could produce  even the photograph cannot equal their miracles  the closer you look the more minutely true the picture is found to be and i doubt if even the microscope could see beyond the painters touch  gerard dow seems to be the master among these queer magicians  a straw mat in one of his pictures is the most miraculous thing that human art has yet accomplished and there is a metal vase with a dent in it that is absolutely more real than reality these painters accomplish all they aim ata praise methinks which can be given to no other men since the world began  they must have laid down their brushes with perfect satisfaction knowing that each one of their million touches had been necessary to the effect and that there was not one too few nor too many  and it is strange how spiritual and suggestive the commonest household articlean earthen pitcher for example becomes when represented with entire accuracy  these dutchmen got at the soul of common things and so made them types and interpreters of the spiritual world  afterwards i looked at many of the pictures of the old masters and found myself gradually getting a taste for them at least they give me more and more pleasure the oftener i come to see them  doubtless i shall be able to pass for a man of taste by the time i return to america  it is an acquired taste like that for wines and i question whether a man is really any truer wiser or better for possessing it  from the old masters i went among the english painters and found myself more favorably inclined towards some of them than at my previous visits seeing something wonderful even in turners lights and mists and yeasty waves although i should like him still better if his pictures looked in the least like what they typify  the most disagreeable of english painters is etty who had a diseased appetite for womans flesh and spent his whole life apparently in painting them with enormously developed busts  i do not mind nudity in a modest and natural way but ettys women really thrust their nudity upon you with malice aforethought     and the worst of it is they are not beautiful  among the last pictures that i looked at was hogarths march to finchley and surely nothing can be covered more thick and deep with english nature than that piece of canvas  the face of the tall grenadier in the centre between two women both of whom have claims on him wonderfully expresses trouble and perplexity and every touch in the picture meant something and expresses what it meant  the price of admission after two oclock being sixpence the exhibition was thronged with a class of people who do not usually come in such large numbers  it was both pleasant and touching to see how earnestly some of them sought to get instruction from what they beheld  the english are a good and simple people and take life in earnest   august 14thpassing by the gateway of the manchester cathedral the other morning on my way to the station i found a crowd collected and high overhead the bells were chiming for a wedding  these chimes of bells are exceedingly impressive so broadly gladsome as they are filling the whole air and every nook of ones heart with sympathy  they are good for a people to rejoice with and good also for a marriage because through all their joy there is something solemna tone of that voice which we have heard so often at funerals  it is good to see how everybody up to this old age of the world takes an interest in weddings and seems to have a faith that now at last a couple have come together to make each other happy  the high black rough old cathedral tower sent out its chime of bells as earnestly as for any bridegroom and bride that came to be married five hundred years ago  i went into the churchyard but there was such a throng of people on its pavement of flat tombstones and especially such a cluster along the pathway by which the bride was to depart that i could only see a white dress waving along and really do not know whether she was a beauty or a fright  the happy pair got into a postchaise that was waiting at the gate and immediately drew some crimson curtains and so vanished into their paradise  there were two other postchaises and pairs and all three had postilions in scarlet  this is the same cathedral where last may i saw a dozen couples married in the lump  in a railway carriage two or three days ago an old merchant made rather a good point of one of the uncomfortable results of the electric telegraph  he said that formerly a man was safe from bad news such as intelligence of failure of debtors except at the hour of opening his letters in the morning and then he was in some degree prepared for it since among say fifteen letters he would be pretty certain to find some queer one  but since the telegraph has come into play he is never safe and may be hit with news of failure shipwreck fall of stocks or whatever disaster at all hours of the day  i went to the exhibition on wednesday with u and looked at the pencil sketches of the old masters also at the pictures generally old and new  i particularly remember a spring landscape by john linnell the younger  it is wonderfully good so tender and fresh that the artist seems really to have caught the evanescent april and made her permanent here at least is eternal spring  i saw a little man behind an immense beard whom i take to be the duke of newcastle at least there was a photograph of him in the gallery with just such a beard  he was at the palace on that day   august 16thi went again to the exhibition day before yesterday and looked much at both the modern and ancient pictures as also at the watercolors  i am making some progress as a connoisseur and have got so far as to be able to distinguish the broader differences of style as for example between rubens and rembrandt  i should hesitate to claim any more for myself thus far  in fact however i do begin to have a liking for good things and to be sure that they are good  murillo seems to me about the noblest and purest painter that ever lived and his good shepherd the loveliest picture i have seen  it is a hopeful symptom moreover of improving taste that i see more merit in the crowd of painters than i was at first competent to acknowledge  i could see some of their defects from the very first but that is the earliest stage of connoisseurship after a formal and ignorant admiration  mounting a few steps higher one sees beauties  but how much study how many opportunities are requisite to form and cultivate a taste  the exhibition must be quite thrown away on the mass of spectators  both they and i are better able to appreciate the specimens of ornamental art contained in the oriental room and in the numerous cases that are ranged up and down the nave  the gewgaws of all time are here in precious metals glass china ivory and every other material that could be wrought into curious and beautiful shapes great basins and dishes of embossed gold from the queens sideboard or from the beaufets of noblemen vessels set with precious stones the pastoral staffs of prelates some of them made of silver or gold and enriched with gems and what have been found in the tombs of the bishops state swords and silver maces the rich plate of colleges elaborately wroughtgreat cups salvers tureens that have been presented by loving sons to their alma mater the heirlooms of old families treasured from generation to generation and hitherto only to be seen by favored friends famous historical jewels some of which are painted in the portraits of the historical men and women that hang on the walls numerous specimens of the beautiful old venetian glass some of which looks so fragile that it is a wonder how it could bear even the weight of the wine that used to be poured into it without breaking  these are the glasses that tested poison by being shattered into fragments at its touch  the strangest and ugliest old crockery pictured over with monstrositiesthe palissy ware embossed with vegetables fishes lobsters that look absolutely real the delicate sevres china each piece made inestimable by pictures from a masters handin short it is a despair and misery to see so much that is curious and beautiful and to feel that far the greater portion of it will slip out of the memory and be as if we had never seen it  but i mean to look again and again at these things  we soon perceive that the present day does not engross all the taste and ingenuity that has ever existed in the mind of man that in fact we are a barren age in that respect   august 20thi went to the exhibition on monday and again yesterday and measurably enjoyed both visits  i continue to think however that a picture cannot be fully enjoyed except by long and intimate acquaintance with it nor can i quite understand what the enjoyment of a connoisseur is  he is not usually i think a man of deep poetic feeling and does not deal with the picture through his heart nor set it in a poem nor comprehend it morally  if it be a landscape he is not entitled to judge of it by his intimacy with nature if a picture of human action he has no experience nor sympathy of lifes deeper passages  however as my acquaintance with pictures increases i find myself recognizing more and more the merit of the acknowledged masters of the art but possibly it is only because i adopt the wrong principles which may have been laid down by the connoisseurs  but there can be no mistake about murillo not that i am worthy to admire him yet however  seeing the many pictures of holy families and the virgin and child which have been painted for churches and convents the idea occurs that it was in this way that the poor monks and nuns gratified as far as they could their natural longing for earthly happiness  it was not mary and her heavenly child that they really beheld or wished for but an earthly mother rejoicing over her baby and displaying it probably to the world as an object worthy to be admired by kingsas mary does in the adoration of the magi  every mother i suppose feels as if her first child deserved everybodys worship  i left the exhibition at three oclock and went to manchester where i sought out mr c  s in his little office  he greeted me warmly and at five we took the omnibus for his house about four miles from town  he seems to be on pleasant terms with his neighbors for almost everybody that got into the omnibus exchanged kindly greetings with him and indeed his kindly simple genial nature comes out so evidently that it would be difficult not to like him  his house stands with others in a green parka small pretty semidetached suburban residence of brick with a lawn and garden round it  in close vicinity there is a deep clough or dell as shaggy and wild as a poet could wish and with a little stream running through it as much as five miles long  the interior of the house is very pretty and nicely even handsomely and almost sumptuously furnished and i was very glad to find him so comfortable  his recognition as a poet has been hearty enough to give him a feeling of success for he showed me various tokens of the estimation in which he is heldfor instance a presentation copy of southeys works in which the latter had written amicus amicopoeta poetae  he said that southey had always been most kind to him     there were various other testimonials from people of note american as well as english  in his parlor there is a good oilpainting of himself and in the drawingroom a very fine crayon sketch wherein his face handsome and agreeable is lighted up with all a poets ecstasy likewise a large and fine engraving from the picture  the government has recognized his poetic merit by a pension of fifty poundsa small sung it is true but enough to mark him out as one who has deserved well of his country     the man himself is very good and lovable     i was able to gratify him by saying that i had recently seen many favorable notices of his poems in the american newspapers an edition having been published a few months since on our side of the ocean  he was much pleased at this and asked me to send him the notices       august 30thi have been two or three times to the exhibition since my last date and enjoy it more as i become familiar with it  there is supposed to be about a third of the good pictures here which england contains and it is said that the tory nobility and gentry have contributed to it much more freely and largely than the whigs  the duke of devonshire for instance seems to have sent nothing  mr ticknor the spanish historian whom i met yesterday observed that we should not think quite so much of this exhibition as the english do after we have been to italy although it is a good school in which to gain a preparatory knowledge of the different styles of art  i am glad to hear that there are better things still to be seen  nevertheless i should suppose that certain painters are better represented here than they ever have been or will be elsewhere  vandyke certainly can be seen nowhere else so well rembrandt and rubens have satisfactory specimens and the whole series of english pictorial achievement is shown more perfectly than within any other walls  perhaps it would be wise to devote myself to the study of this latter and leave the foreigners to be studied on their own soil  murillo can hardly have done better than in the pictures by him which we see here  there is nothing of raphaels here that is impressive  titian has some noble portraits but little else that i care to see  in all these old masters murillo only excepted it is very rare i must say to find any trace of natural feeling and passion and i am weary of naked goddesses who never had any real life and warmth in the painters imaginationor if so it was the impure warmth of an unchaste woman who sat for him  last week i dined at mr f heywoods to meet mr adolphus the author of a critical work on the waverley novels published long ago and intended to prove from internal evidence that they were written by sir walter scott     his wife was likewise of the party     and also a young spanish lady their niece and daughter of a spaniard of literary note  she herself has literary tastes and ability and is well known to prescott whom i believe she has assisted in his historical researches and also to professor ticknor and furthermore she is very handsome and unlike an english damsel very youthful and maidenlike and her manners have all ardor and enthusiasm that were pleasant to see especially as she spoke warmly of my writings and yet i should wrong her if i left the impression of her being forthputting and obtrusive for it was not the fact in the least  she speaks english like a native insomuch that i should never have suspected her to be anything else  my nerves recently have not been in an exactly quiet and normal state  i begin to weary of england and need another clime   september 6thi think i paid my last visit to the exhibition and feel as if i had had enough of it although i have got but a small part of the profit it might have afforded me  but pictures are certainly quite other things to me now from what they were at my first visit it seems even as if there were a sort of illumination within them that makes me see them more distinctly  speaking of pictures the miniature of anne of cleves is here on the faith of which henry viii married her also the picture of the infanta of spain which buckingham brought over to charles i while prince of wales  this has a delicate rosy prettiness  one rather interesting portion of the exhibition is the refreshmentroom or rather rooms for very much space is allowed both to the first and second classes  i have looked most at the latter because there john ball and his wife may be seen in full gulp aid guzzle swallowing vast quantities of cold boiled beef thoroughly moistened with porter or bitter ale and very good meat and drink it is  at my last visit on friday i met judge pollock of liverpool who introduced me to a gentleman in a gray slouched hat as mr du val an artist resident in manchester and mr du val invited me to dine with him at six oclock  so i went to carlton grove his residence and found it a very pretty house with its own lawn and shrubbery about it     there was a mellow fire in the grate which made the drawingroom very cosey and pleasant as the dusk came on before dinner  mr du val looked like an artist and like a remarkable man     we had very good talk chiefly about the exhibition and du val spoke generously and intelligently of his brotherartists  he says that england might furnish five exhibitions each one as rich as the present  i find that the most famous picture here is one that i have hardly looked at the three marys by annibal caracci  in the drawingroom there were several pictures and sketches by du val one of which i especially likeda misty moonlight picture of the mersey near seacombe  i never saw painted such genuine moonlight      i took my leave at half past ten and found my cab at the door and my cabman snugly asleep inside of it and when mr du val awoke him he proved to be quite drunk insomuch that i hesitated whether to let him clamber upon the box or to take post myself and drive the cabman home however i propounded two questions to him first whether his horse would go of his own accord and secondly whether be himself was invariably drunk at that time of night because if it were his normal state i should be safer with him drunk than sober  being satisfied on these points i got in and was driven home without accident or adventure except indeed that the cabman drew up and opened the door for me to alight at a vacant lot on stratford road just as if there had been a house and home and cheerful lighted windows in that vacancy  on my remonstrance he resumed the whip and reins and reached boston terrace at last and thanking me for an extra sixpence as well as he could speak he begged me to inquire for little john whenever i next wanted a cab  cabmen are as a body the most illnatured and ungenial men in the world but this poor little man was excellently goodhumored  speaking of the former rudeness of manners now gradually refining away of the manchester people judge  said that when he first knew manchester women meeting his wife in the street would take hold of her dress and say ah three and sixpence a yard  the men were very rough after the old lancashire fashion  they have always however been a musical people and this may have been a germ of refinement in them they are still much more simple and natural than the liverpool people who love the aristocracy and whom they heartily despise  it is singular that the great artexhibition should have come to pass in the rudest great town in england    leamington   lansdowne cirrus september 10thwe have become quite weary of our small mean uncomfortable and unbeautiful lodgings at chorlton road with poor and scanty furniture within doors and no better prospect from the parlor windows than a mudpuddle larger than most english lakes on a vacant buildinglot opposite our house  the exhibition too was fast becoming a bore for you must really love a picture in order to tolerate the sight of it many times  moreover the smoky and sooty air of that abominable manchester affected my wifes throat disadvantageously so on a tuesday morning we struck our tent and set forth again regretting to leave nothing except the kind disposition of mrs honey our housekeeper i do not remember meeting with any other lodginghouse keeper who did not grow hateful and fearful on short acquaintance but i attribute this not so much to the people themselves as primarily to the unfair and ungenerous conduct of some of their english guests who feel so sure of being cheated that they always behave as if in an enemys country and therefore they find it one  the rain poured down upon us as we drove away in two cabs laden with mountainous luggage to the london road station and the whole day was grim with cloud and moist with showers  we went by way of birmingham and stayed three hours at the great dreary station there waiting for the train to leamington whither fanny had gone forward the day before to secure lodgings for us as she is english and understands the matter we all were tired and dull by the time we reached the leamington station where a note from fanny gave us the address of our lodgings  lansdowne circus is really delightful after that ugly and grimy suburb of manchester  indeed there could not possibly be a greater contrast than between leamington and manchesterthe latter built only for dirty uses and scarcely intended as a habitation for man the former so cleanly so set out with shade trees so regular in its streets so neatly paved its houses so prettily contrived and nicely stuccoed that it does not look like a portion of the workaday world    kenilworth   september 13ththe weather was very uncertain through the last week and yesterday morning too was misty and sunless notwithstanding which we took the rail for kenilworth before eleven  the distance from leamington is less than five miles and at the kenilworth station we found a little bit of an omnibus into which we packed ourselves together with two ladies one of whom at least was an american  i begin to agree partly with the english that we are not a people of elegant manners  at all events there is sometimes a bare hard meagre sort of deportment especially in our women that has not its parallel elsewhere  but perhaps what sets off this kind of behavior and brings it into alto relievo is the fact of such uncultivated persons travelling abroad and going to see sights that would not be interesting except to people of some education and refinement  we saw but little of the village of kenilworth passing through it sidelong fashion in the omnibus but i learn that it has between three and four thousand inhabitants and is of immemorial antiquity  we saw a few old gabled and timberframed houses but generally the town was of modern aspect although less so in the immediate vicinity of the castle gate across the road from which there was an inn with bowlinggreens and a little bunch of houses and shops  apart from the high road there is a gatehouse ancient but in excellent repair towered turreted and battlemented and looking like a castle in itself  until cromwells time the entrance to the castle used to be beneath an arch that passed through this structure but the gatehouse being granted to one of the parliament officers he converted it into a residence and apparently added on a couple of gables which now look quite as venerable as the rest of the edifice  admission within the outer grounds of the castle is now obtained through a little wicket close beside the gatehouse at which sat one or two old men who touched their hats to us in humble willingness to accept a fee  one of them had guidebooks for sale and finding that we were not to be bothered by a cicerone we bought one of his books  the ruins are perhaps two hundred yards from the gatehouse and the road and the space between is a pasture for sheep which also browse in the inner court and shelter themselves in the dungeons and state apartments of the castle  goats would be fitter occupants because they would climb to the tops of the crumbling towers and nibble the weeds and shrubbery that grow there  the first part of the castle which we reach is called caesars tower being the oldest portion of the ruins and still very stalwart and massive and built of red freestone like all the rest caesars tower being on the right leicesters buildings erected by the earl of leicester queen elizabeths favorite are on the left and between these two formerly stood other structures which have now as entirely disappeared as if they had never existed and through the wide gap thus opened appears the grassy inner court surrounded on three sides by halffallen towers and shattered walls  some of these were erected by john of gaunt and among these ruins is the banquetinghall or rather wasfor it has now neither floor nor roof but only the broken stonework of some tall arched windows and the beautiful old ivied arch of the entranceway now inaccessible from the ground  the ivy is very abundant about the ruins and hangs its green curtains quite from top to bottom of some of the windows  there are likewise very large and aged trees within the castle there being no roof nor pavement anywhere except in some dungeonlike nooks so that the trees having soil and air enough and being sheltered from unfriendly blasts can grow as if in a nursery  hawthorn however next to ivy is the great ornament and comforter of these desolate ruins  i have not seen so much nor such thriving hawthorn anywhere elsein the court high up on crumbly heights on the sod that carpets roofless roomseverywhere indeed and now rejoicing in plentiful crops of red berries  the ivy is even more wonderfully luxuriant its trunks being in some places two or three feet in diameter and forming real buttresses against the walls which are actually supported and vastly strengthened by this parasite that clung to them at first only for its own convenience and now holds them up lest it should be ruined by their fall  thus an abuse has strangely grown into a use and i think we may sometimes see the same fact morally in english matters  there is something very curious in the close firm grip which the ivy fixes upon the wall closer and closer for centuries  neither is it at all nice as to what it clutches in its necessity for support  i saw in the outer court an old hawthorntree to which a plant of ivy had married itself and the ivy trunk and the hawthorn trunk were now absolutely incorporated and in their close embrace you could not tell which was which  at one end of the banquetinghall there are two large baywindows one of which looks into the inner court and the other affords a view of the surrounding country  the former is called queen elizabeths dressingroom  beyond the banquetinghall is what is called the strong tower up to the top of which we climbed principally by the aid of the stones that have tumbled down from it  a lady sat halfway down the crumbly descent within the castle on a campstool and before an easel sketching this tower on the summit of which we sat  she said it was amy robsarts tower and within it open to the day and quite accessible we saw a room that we were free to imagine had been occupied by her  i do not find that these associations of real scenes with fictitious events greatly heighten the charm of them  by this time the sun had come out brightly and with such warmth that we were glad to sit down in the shadow  several sightseers were now rambling about and among them some schoolboys who kept scrambling up to points whither no other animal except a goat would have ventured their shouts and the sunshine made the old castle cheerful and what with the ivy and the hawthorn and the other old trees it was very beautiful and picturesque  but a castle does not make nearly so interesting and impressive a ruin as an abbey because the latter was built for beauty and on a plan in which deep thought and feeling were involved and having once been a grand and beautiful work it continues grand and beautiful through all the successive stages of its decay  but a castle is rudely piled together for strength and other material conveniences and having served these ends it has nothing left to fall back upon but crumbles into shapeless masses which are often as little picturesque as a pile of bricks  without the ivy and the shrubbery this huge kenilworth would not be a pleasant object except for one or two windowframes with broken tracery in the banquetinghall      we stayed from eleven till two and identified the various parts of the castle as well as we could by the guidebook  the ruins are very extensive though less so than i should have imagined considering that seven acres were included within the castle wall  but a large part of the structures have been taken away to build houses in kenilworth village and elsewhere and much too to make roads with and a good deal lies under the green turf in the courtyards inner and outer  as we returned to the gate my wife and u went into the gatehouse to see an old chimneypiece and other antiquities and j and i proceeded a little way round the outer wall and saw the remains of the moat and lins towera real and shattered fabric of john of gaunt  the omnibus now drove up and one of the old men at the gate came hobbling up to open the door and was rewarded with a sixpence and we drove down to the kings head     we then walked out and bought prints of the castle and inquired our way to the church and to the ruins of the priory  the latter so far as we could discover them are very few and uninteresting and the church though it has a venerable exterior and an aged spire has been so modernized within and in so plain a fashion as to have lost what beauty it may once have had  there were a few brasses and mural monuments one of which was a marble group of a dying woman and her family by westmacott  the sexton was a cheerful little man but knew very little about his church and nothing of the remains of the priory  the day was spent very pleasantly amid this beautiful green english scenery these fine old warwickshire trees and broad gently swelling fields    liverpool   september 17thi took the train for rugby and thence to liverpool the most noticeable character at mrs blodgetts now is mr t a yankee who has seen the world and gathered much information and experience already though still a young mana handsome man with black curly hair a dark intelligent bright face and rather cold blue eyes but a very pleasant air and address  his observing faculties are very strongly developed in his forehead and his reflective ones seem to be adequate to making some if not the deepest use of what he sees  he has voyaged and travelled almost all over the world and has recently published a book of his peregrinations which has been well received  he is of exceeding fluent talk though rather too much inclined to unfold the secret springs of action in louis napoleon and other potentates and to tell of revolutions that are coming at some unlookedfor moment but soon  still i believe in his wisdom and foresight about as much as in any other mans  there are no such things  he is a merchant and meditates settling in london and making a colossal fortune there during the next ten or twenty years that being the period during which london is to hold the exchanges of the world and to continue its metropolis after that new york is to be the worlds queen city  there is likewise here a young american named a who has been at a german university and favors us with descriptions of his student life there which seems chiefly to have consisted in drinking beer and fighting duels  he shows a cut on his nose as a trophy of these combats he has with him a dog of st bernard who is a much more remarkable character than himselfan immense dog a noble and gentle creature and really it touches my heart that his master is going to take him from his native snowmountain to a southern plantation to die  mr a says that there are now but five of these dogs extant at the convent there having within two or three years been a disease among them with which this dog also has suffered  his master has a certificate of his genuineness and of himself being the rightful purchaser and he says that as he descended the mountain every peasant along the road stopped him and would have compelled him to give up the dog had he not produced this proof of property  the neighboring mountaineers are very jealous of the breed being taken away considering them of such importance to their own safety  this huge animal the very biggest dog i ever saw though only eleven months old and not so high by two or three inches as he will be allows mr  to play with him and take him on his shoulders he weighs at least a hundred pounds like any lapdog    leamington   lansdowne circus october 10thi returned hither from liverpool last week and have spent the time idly since then reposing myself after the four years of unnatural restraint in the consulate  being already pretty well acquainted with the neighborhood of leamington i have little or nothing to record about the prettiest cheerfullest cleanest of english towns  on saturday we took the rail for coventry about a halfhours travel distant  i had been there before more than two years ago     no doubt i described it on my first visit and it is not remarkable enough to be worth two descriptionsa large town of crooked and irregular streets and lanes not looking nearly so ancient as it is because of new brick and stuccoed fronts which have been plastered over its antiquity although still there are interspersed the peaked gables of oldfashioned timberbuilt houses or an archway of worn stone which if you pass through it shows like an avenue from the present to the past for just in the rear of the newfangled aspect lurks the old arrangement of courtyards and rustiness and grimness that would not be suspected from the exterior  right across the narrow street stands st michaels church with its tall tall tower and spire  the body of the church has been almost entirely recased with stone since i was here before but the tower still retains its antiquity and is decorated with statues that look down from their lofty niches seemingly in good preservation  the tower and spire are most stately and beautiful the whole church very noble  we went in and found that the vulgar plaster of cromwells time has been scraped from the pillars and arches leaving them all as fresh and splendid as if just made  we looked also into trinity church which stands close by st michaels separated only i think by the churchyard  we also visited st johns church which is very venerable as regards its exterior the stone being worn and smoothedif not roughened ratherby centuries of storm and fitful weather  this wear and tear however has almost ceased to be a charm to my mind comparatively to what it was when i first began to see old buildings  within the church is spoiled by wooden galleries built across the beautiful pointed arches  we saw nothing else particularly worthy of remark except fords hospital in grey friars street  it has an elizabethan front of timber and plaster facing on the street with two or three peaked gables in a row beneath which is a low arched entrance giving admission into a small paved quadrangle open to the sky above but surrounded by the walls lozengepaned windows and gables of the hospital  the quadrangle is but a few paces in width and perhaps twenty in length and through a halfclosed doorway at the farther end there was a glimpse into a garden  just within the entrance through an open door we saw the neat and comfortable apartment of the matron of the hospital and along the quadrangle on each side there were three or four doors through which we glanced into little rooms each containing a fireplace a bed a chair or twoa little homely domestic scene with one old woman in the midst of it one old woman in each room  they are destitute widows who have their lodging and home herea small room for each one to sleep cook and be at home inand three and sixpence a week to feed and clothe themselves witha cloak being the only garment bestowed on them when one of the sisterhood dies each old woman has to pay twopence towards the funeral and so they slowly starve and wither out of life and claim each their twopence contribution in turn  i am afraid they have a very dismal time  there is an old mans hospital in another part of the town on a similar plan  a collection of sombre and lifelike tales might be written on the idea of giving the experiences of these hospitallers male and female and they might be supposed to be written by the matron of one who had acquired literary taste and practice as a governessand by the master of the other a retired schoolusher  it was marketday in coventry and far adown the street leading from it there were booths and stalls and apples pears toys books among which i saw my twicetold tales with an awful portrait of myself as frontispieceand various country produce offered for sale by men women and girls  the scene looked lively but had not much vivacity in it   october 27ththe autumn has advanced progressively and is now fairly established though still there is much green foliage in spite of many brown trees and an enormous quantity of withered leaves too damp to rustle strewing the pathswhence however they are continually swept up and carried off in wheelbarrows either for neatness or for the agricultural worth as manure of even a withered leaf  the pastures look just as green as evera deep bright verdure that seems almost sunshine in itself however sombre the sky may be  the little plats of grass and flowers in front of our circle of houses might still do credit to an american midsummer for i have seen beautiful roses here within a day or two and dahlias asters and such autumnal flowers are plentiful and i have no doubt that the old years flowers will bloom till those of the new year appear  really the english winter is not so terrible as ours   october 30thwednesday was one of the most beautiful of all days and gilded almost throughout with the precious english sunshinethe most delightful sunshine ever made both for its positive fine qualities and because we seldom get it without too great an admixture of water  we made no use of this lovely day except to walk to an arboretum and pinetum on the outskirts of the town  u and mrs shepard made an excursion to guys cliff  here comes in the visit to leicesters hospital and redferns shop and st marys church printed in our old homeed  from redferns we went back to the marketplace expecting to find j at the museum but the keeper said he had gone away  we went into this museum which contains the collections in natural history etc of a county society  it is very well arranged and is rich in specimens of ornithology among which was an albatross huge beyond imagination  i do not think that coleridge could have known the size of the fowl when he caused it to be hung round the neck of his ancient mariner  there were a great many hummingbirds from various parts of the world and some of their breasts actually gleamed and shone as with the brightest lustre of sunset  also many strange fishes and a huge pike taken from the river avon and so long that i wonder how he could turn himself about in such a little river as the avon is near warwick  a great curiosity was a bunch of skeleton leaves and flowers prepared by a young lady and preserving all the most delicate fibres of the plant looking like inconceivably fine lacework white as snow while the substance was quite taken away in another room there were minerals shells and a splendid collection of fossils among which were remains of antediluvian creatures several feet long  in still another room we saw some historical curiositiesthe most interesting of which were two locks of reddishbrown hair one from the head and one from the beard of edward iv  they were fastened to a manuscript letter which authenticates the hair as having been taken from king edwards tomb in 1739  near these relics was a seal of the great earl of warwick the mighty kingmaker also a sword from bosworth field smaller and shorter than those now in use for indeed swords seem to have increased in length weight and formidable aspect now that the weapon has almost ceased to be used in actual warfare  the short roman sword was probably more murderous than any weapon of the same species except the bowieknife  here too were parliamentary cannonballs etc      the visit to whitnash intervenes hereed    london   24 great russell street november 10thwe have been thinking and negotiating about taking lodgings in london lately and this morning we left leamington and reached london with no other misadventure than that of leaving the great bulk of our luggage behind usthe van which we hired to take it to the railway station having broken down under its prodigious weight in the middle of the street  on our journey we saw nothing particularly worthy of notebut everywhere the immortal verdure of england scarcely less perfect than in june so far as the fields are concerned though the foliage of the trees presents pretty much the same hues as those of our own forests after the gayety and gorgeousness have departed from them  our lodgings are in close vicinity to the british museum which is the great advantage we took them for  i felt restless and uncomfortable and soon strolled forth without any definite object and walked as far as charing cross  very dull and dreary the city looked and not in the least lively even where the throng was thickest and most brisk  as i trudged along my reflection was that never was there a dingier uglier less picturesque city than london and that it is really wonderful that so much brick and stone for centuries together should have been built up with so poor a result  yet these old names of the cityfleet street ludgate hill the strandused to throw a glory over these homely precincts when i first saw them and still do so in a less degree  where farrington street opens upon fleet street moreover i had a glimpse of st pauls along ludgate street in the gathering dimness and felt as if i saw an old friend  in that neighborhoodspeaking of old friendsi met mr parker of boston who told me sad news of a friend whom i love as much as if i had known him for a lifetime though he is indeed but of two or three years standing  he said that my friends bankruptcy is in todays gazette of all men on earth i had rather this misfortune should have happened to any other but i hope and think he has sturdiness and buoyancy enough to rise up beneath it  i cannot conceive of his face otherwise than with a glow on it like that of the sun at noonday  before i reached our lodgings the dusk settled into the streets and a mist bedewed and bedamped me and i went astray as is usual with me and had to inquire my way indeed except in the principal thoroughfares london is so miserably lighted that it is impossible to recognize ones whereabouts  on my arrival i found our parlor looking cheerful with a brisk fire     but the first day or two in new lodgings is at best an uncomfortable time  fanny has just come in with more unhappy news about   pray heaven it may not be true     troubles are a sociable brotherhood they love to come hand in hand or sometimes even to come side by side with long lookedfor and hopedfor good fortune       november 11ththis morning we all went to the british museum always a most wearisome and depressing task to me  i strolled through the lower rooms with a good degree of interest looking at the antique sculptures some of which were doubtless grand and beautiful in their day     the egyptian remains are on the whole the more satisfactory for though inconceivably ugly they are at least miracles of size and ponderosityfor example a hand and arm of polished granite as much as ten feet in length  the upper rooms containing millions of specimens of natural history in all departments really made my heart ache with a pain and woe that i have never felt anywhere but in the british museum and i hurried through them as rapidly as i could persuade j to follow me  we had left the rest of the party still intent on the grecian sculptures and though j was much interested in the vast collection of shells he chose to quit the museum with me in the prospect of a stroll about london  he seems to have my own passion for thronged streets and the utmost bustle of human life  we went first to the railway station in quest of our luggage which we found  then we made a pretty straight course down to holborn and through newgate street stopping a few moments to look through the iron fence at the christs hospital boys in their long blue coats and yellow petticoats and stockings  it was between twelve and one oclock and i suppose this was their hour of play for they were running about the enclosed space chasing and overthrowing one another without their caps with their yellow petticoats tucked up and all in immense activity and enjoyment  they were eminently a healthy and handsome set of boys  then we went into cheapside where i called at mr bennetts shop to inquire what are the facts about   when i mentioned his name mr bennett shook his head and expressed great sorrow but on further talk i found that he referred only to the failure and had heard nothing about the other rumor  it cannot therefore be true for bennett lives in his neighborhood and could not have remained ignorant of such a calamity there must be some mistake none however in regard to the failure it having been announced in the times  from bennetts shopwhich is so near the steeple of bow church that it would tumble upon it if it fell overwe strolled still eastward aiming at london bridge but missed it and bewildered ourselves among many dingy and frowzy streets and lanes  i bore towards the right however knowing that that course must ultimately bring me to the thames and at last i saw before me ramparts towers circular and square with battlemented summits large sweeps and curves of fortification as well as straight and massive walls and chimneys behind them all a great confusionto my eye of ancient and more modern structure and four loftier turrets rising in the midst the whole great space surrounded by a broad dry moat which now seemed to be used as an ornamental walk bordered partly with trees  this was the tower but seen from a different and more picturesque point of view than i have heretofore gained of it  being so convenient for a visit i determined to go in at the outer gate which is not a part of the fortification a sentinel walks to and fro besides whom there was a warder in the rich old costume of henry viiis time looking very gorgeous indeedas much so as scarlet and gold can make him  as j and i were not going to look at the jewelroom we loitered about in the open space before the white tower while the tall slender whitehaired gentlemanly warder led the rest of the party into that apartment  we found what one might take for a square in a town with gabled houses lifting their peaks on one side and various edifices enclosing the other sides and the great white towernow more black than whiterising venerable and rather picturesque than otherwise the most prominent object in the scene  i have no plan nor available idea of it whatever in my mind but it seems really to be a town within itself with streets avenues and all that pertains to human life  there were soldiers going through their exercise in the open space and along at the base of the white tower lay a great many cannon and mortars some of which were of turkish manufacture and immensely long and ponderous others likewise of mighty size had once belonged to the famous ship great harry and had lain for ages under the sea  others were eastindian  several were beautiful specimens of workmanship  the mortarssome so large that a fairsized man might easily be rammed into themheld their great mouths slanting upward to the sky and mostly contained a quantity of rainwater  while we were looking at these warlike toysfor i suppose not one of them will ever thunder in earnest againthe warder reappeared with his ladies and leading us all to a certain part of the open space he struck his foot on the small stones with which it is paved and told us that we were standing on the spot where anne boleyn and catharine parr were beheaded  it is not exactly in the centre of the square but on a line with one of the angles of the white tower  i forgot to mention that the middle of the open space is occupied by a marble statue of wellington which appeared to me very poor and laboriously spirited  lastly the warder led us under the bloody tower and by the side of the wakefield tower and showed us the traitors gate which is now closed up so as to afford no access to the thames  no we first visited the beauchamp tower famous as the prison of many historical personages some of its former occupants have left their initials or names and inscriptions of piety and patience cut deep into the freestone of the walls together with devicesas a crucifix for instanceneatly and skilfully done  this room has a long deep fireplace it is chiefly lighted by a large window which i fancy must have been made in modern times but there are four narrow apertures throwing in a little light through deep alcoves in the thickness of the octagon wall  one would expect such a room to be picturesque but it is really not of striking aspect being low with a plastered ceilingthe beams just showing through the plastera boarded floor and the walls being washed over with a buff color  a warder sat within a railing by the great window with sixpenny books to sell containing transcripts of the inscriptions on the walls  we now left the tower and made our way deviously westward passing st pauls which looked magnificently and beautifully so huge and dusky as it was with here and there a space on its vast form where the original whiteness of the marble came out like a streak of moonshine amid the blackness with which time has made it grander than it was in its newness it is a most noble edifice and i delight too in the statues that crown some of its heights and in the wreaths of sculpture which are hung around it   november 12ththis morning began with such fog that at the window of my chamber lighted only from a small courtyard enclosed by high dingy walls i could hardly see to dress  it kept alternately darkening and then brightening a little and darkening again so much that we could but just discern the opposite houses but at eleven or thereabouts it grew so much clearer that we resolved to venture out  our plan for the day was to go in the first place to westminster abbey and to the national gallery if we should find time     the fog darkened again as we went down regent street and the duke of yorks column was but barely visible looming vaguely before us nor from pall mall was nelsons pillar much more distinct though methought his statue stood aloft in a somewhat clearer atmosphere than ours  passing whitehall however we could scarcely see inigo joness banquetinghouse on the other side of the street and the towers and turrets of the new houses of parliament were all but invisible as was the abbey itself so that we really were in some doubt whither we were going  we found our way to poets corner however and entered those holy precincts which looked very dusky and grim in the smoky light     i was strongly impressed with the perception that very commonplace people compose the great bulk of society in the home of the illustrious dead  it is wonderful how few names there are that one cares anything about a hundred years after their departure but perhaps each generation acts in good faith in canonizing its own men     but the fame of the buried person does not make the marble livethe marble keeps merely a cold and sad memory of a man who would else be forgotten  no man who needs a monument ever ought to have one  the painted windows of the abbey though mostly modern are exceedingly rich and beautiful and i do think that human art has invented no other such magnificent method of adornment as this  our final visit today was to the national gallery where i came to the conclusion that murillos st john was the most lovely picture i have ever seen and that there never was a painter who has really made the world richer except murillo   november 12ththis morning we issued forth and found the atmosphere chill and almost frosty tingling upon our cheeks     the gateway of somerset house attracted us and we walked round its spacious quadrangle encountering many government clerks hurrying to their various offices at least i presumed them to be so  this is certainly a handsome square of buildings with its grecian facades and pillars and its sculptured basreliefs and the group of statuary in the midst of the court besides the part of the edifice that rises above ground there appear to be two subterranean stories below the surface  from somerset house we pursued our way through temple bar but missed it and therefore entered by the passage from what was formerly alsatia but which now seems to be a very respectable and humdrum part of london  we came immediately to the temple gardens which we walked quite round  the grass is still green but the trees are leafless and had an aspect of not being very robust even at more genial seasons of the year  there were however large quantities of brilliant chrysanthemums golden and of all hues blooming gorgeously all about the borders and several gardeners were at work tending these flowers and sheltering them from the weather  i noticed no roses nor even rosebushes in the spot where the factions of york and lancaster plucked their two hostile flowers  leaving these grounds we went to the hall of the middle temple where we knocked at the portal and finding it not fastened thrust it open  a boy appeared within and the porter or keeper at a distance along the inner passage called to us to enter and opening the door of the great hall left us to view it till he should be at leisure to attend to us truly it is a most magnificent apartment very loftyso lofty indeed that the antique oak roof was quite hidden as regarded all its details in the sombre gloom that brooded under its rafters  the hall was lighted by four great windows i think on each of the two sides descending halfway from the ceiling to the floor leaving all beneath enclosed by oaken panelling which on three sides was carved with escutcheons of such members of the society as have held the office of reader  there is likewise in a large recess or transept a great window occupying the full height of the hall and splendidly emblazoned with the arms of the templars who have attained to the dignity of chief justices  the other windows are pictured in like manner with coats of arms of local dignitaries connected with the temple and besides all these there are arched lights high towards the roof at either end full of richly and chastely colored glass and all the illumination that the great hall had come through these glorious panes and they seemed the richer for the sombreness in which we stood  i cannot describe or even intimate the effect of this transparent glory glowing down upon us in that gloomy depth of the hall  the screen at the lower end was of carved oak very dark and highly polished and as old as queen elizabeths time  the keeper told us that the story of the armada was said to be represented in these carvings but in the imperfect light we could trace nothing of it out  along the length of the apartment were set two oaken tables for the students of law to dine upon and on the dais at the upper end there was a crosstable for the bigwigs of the society the latter being provided with comfortable chairs and the former with oaken benches from a notification posted near the door i gathered that the cost of dinners is two shillings to each gentleman including as the attendant told me ale and wine  i am reluctant to leave this hall without expressing how grave how grand how sombre and how magnificent i feel it to be  as regards historical association it was a favorite dancinghall of queen elizabeth and sir christopher hatton danced himself into her good graces here  we next went to the temple church and finding the door ajar made free to enter beneath its norman arches which admitted us into a circular vestibule very ancient and beautiful  in the body of the church beyond we saw a boy sitting but nobody either forbade or invited our entrance on the floor of the vestibule lay about half a score of templarsthe representatives of the warlike priests who built this church and formerly held these precinctsall in chain armor grasping their swords and with their shields beside them  except two or three they lay crosslegged in token that they had really fought for the holy sepulchre  i think i have seen nowhere else such wellpreserved monumental knights as these  we proceeded into the interior of the church and were greatly impressed with its wonderful beautythe roof springing as it were in a harmonious and accordant fountain out of the clustered pillars that support its groined arches and these pillars immense as they are are polished like so many gems  they are of purbeck marble and if i mistake not had been covered with plaster for ages until latterly redeemed and beautified anew  but the glory of the church is its old painted windows and positively those great spaces over the chancel appeared to be set with all manner of precious stonesor it was as if the manycolored radiance of heaven were breaking upon usor as if we saw the wings of angels storied over with richly tinted pictures of holy things  but it is idle to talk of this marvellous adornment it is to be seen and wondered at not written about  before we left the church the porter made his appearance in time to receive his fee which somebody indeed is always ready to stretch out his hand for  and so ended our visit to the temple which by the by though close to the midmost bustle of london is as quiet as if it were always sunday there  we now went to st pauls  u and miss shepard ascended to the whispering gallery and we sitting under the dome at the base of one of the pillars saw them far above us looking very indistinct for those misty upperdepths seemed almost to be hung with clouds  this cathedral i think does not profit by gloom but requires cheerful sunshine to show it to the best advantage  the statues and sculptures in st pauls are mostly covered with years of dust and look thereby very grim and ugly but there are few memories there from which i should care to brush away the dust they being in nine cases out of ten naval and military heroes of second or third class merit  i really remember no literary celebrity admitted solely on that account except dr johnson  the crimean war has supplied two or three monuments chiefly mural tablets and doubtless more of the same excrescences will yet come out upon the walls  one thing that i newly noticed was the beautiful shape of the great covered marble vase that serves for a font  from st pauls we went down cheapside and turning into king street visited guildhall which we found in process of decoration for a public ball to take place next week  it looked rather gewgawish thus gorgeous being hung with flags of all nations and adorned with military trophies and the scene was repeated by a range of lookingglasses at one end of the room  the execrably painted windows really shocked us by their vulgar glare after those of the temple hall and church yet a few years ago i might very likely have thought them beautiful  our own national banner i must remember to say was hanging in guildhall but with only ten stars and an insufficient number of stripes   november 15thyesterday morning we went to london bridge and along lower thames street and quickly found ourselves in billingsgate market a dirty evilsmelling crowded precinct thronged with people carrying fish on their heads and lined with fishshops and fishstalls and pervaded with a fishy odor  the footwalk was narrowas indeed was the whole streetand filthy to travel upon and we had to elbow our way among rough men and slatternly women and to guard our heads from the contact of fishtrays very ugly grimy and misty moreover is billingsgate market and though we heard none of the foul language of which it is supposed to be the fountainhead yet it has its own peculiarities of behavior  for instance u tells me that one man staring at her and her governess as they passed cried out what beautiesanother looking under her veil greeted her with good morning my love  we were in advance and heard nothing of these civilities  struggling through this fishy purgatory we caught sight of the tower as we drew near the end of the street and i put all my party under charge of one of the trump cards not being myself inclined to make the rounds of the small part of the fortress that is shown so soon after my late visit  when they departed with the warder i set out by myself to wander about the exterior of the tower looking with interest at what i suppose to be tower hilla slight elevation of the large open space into which great tower street opens though perhaps what is now called trinity square may have been a part of tower hill and possibly the precise spot where the executions took place  keeping to the right round the tower i found the moat quite surrounded by a fence of iron rails excluding me from a pleasant gravelpath among flowers and shrubbery on the inside where i could see nurserymaids giving children their airings  possibly these may have been the privileged inhabitants of the tower which certainly might contain the population of a large village  the aspect of the fortress has so much that is new and modern about it that it can hardly be called picturesque and yet it seems unfair to withhold that epithet from such a collection of gray ramparts  i followed the iron fence quite round the outer grounds till it approached the thames and in this direction the moat and the pleasureground terminate in a narrow graveyard which extends beneath the walls and looks neglected and shaggy with long grass  it appeared to contain graves enough but only a few tombstones of which i could read the inscription of but one it commemorated a mr george gibson a person of no note nor apparently connected with the place  st katharines dock lies along the thames in this vicinity and while on one side of me were the tower the quiet gravelpath and the shaggy graveyard on the other were draymen and their horses docklaborers sailors empty puncheons and a miscellaneous spectacle of lifeincluding organgrinders men roasting chestnuts over small ovens on the sidewalk boys and women with boards or wheelbarrows of apples oysterstands besides pedlers of small wares dirty children at play and other figures and things that a dutch painter would seize upon  i went a little way into st katharines dock and found it crowded with great ships then returning i strolled along the range of shops that front towards this side of the tower  they have all something to do with ships sailors and commerce being for the sale of ships stores nautical instruments arms clothing together with a tavern and grogshop at every other door bookstalls too covered with cheap novels and songbooks cigarshops in great numbers and everywhere were sailors and here and there a soldier and children at the doorsteps and women showing themselves at the doors or windows of their domiciles these latter figures however pertain rather to the street up which i walked penetrating into the interior of this region which i think is blackwallno i forget what its name is  at all events it has an ancient and most grimy and rough look with its old gabled houses each of them the seat of some petty trade and business in its basement story among these i saw one house with three or four peaks along its fronta second story projecting over the basement and the whole clapboarded over     there was a butchers stall in the lower story with a front open to the street in the ancient fashion which seems to be retained only by butchers shops  this part of london having escaped the great fire i suppose there may be many relics of architectural antiquity hereabouts  at the end of an hour i went back to the refreshmentroom within the outer gate of the tower where the rest of us shortly appeared  we now returned westward by way of great tower street eastcheap and cannon street and entering st pauls sat down beneath the misty dome to rest ourselves  the muffled roar of the city as we heard it there is very soothing and keeps one listening to it somewhat as the flow of a river keeps us looking at it  it is a grand and quiet sound and ever and anon a distant door slammed somewhere in the cathedral and reverberated long and heavily like the roll of thunder or the boom of cannon  every noise that is loud enough to be heard in so vast an edifice melts into the great quietude  the interior looked very sombre and the dome hung over us like a cloudy sky  i wish it were possible to pass directly from st pauls into york minster or from the latter into the former that is if ones mind could manage to stagger under both in the same day there is no other way of judging of their comparative effect  under the influence of that grand lullabythe roar of the citywe sat for some time after we were sufficiently rested but at last plunged forth again and went up newgate street pausing to look through the iron railings of christs hospital  the boys however were not at play so we went onward in quest of smithfield and on our way had a greeting from mr silsbee a gentleman of our own native town  parting with him we found smithfield which is still occupied with pens for cattle though i believe it has ceased to be a cattlemarket  except it be st bartholomews hospital on one side there is nothing interesting in this ugly square though no doubt a few feet under the pavement there are bones and ashes as precious as anything of the kind on earth  i wonder when men will begin to erect monuments to human error hitherto their pillars and statues have only been for the sake of glorification  but after all the present fashion may be the better and wholesomer       november 16thmr silsbee called yesterday and talked about matters of art in which he is deeply interested and which he has had good opportunities of becoming acquainted with during three years travel on the continent  he is a man of great intelligence and true feeling and absolutely brims over with ideashis conversation flowing in a constant stream which it appears to be no trouble whatever to him to keep up     he took his leave after a long call and left with us a manuscript describing a visit to berlin which i read to my wife in the evening  it was well worth reading  he made an engagement to go with us to the crystal palace and came rather for that purpose this morning  we drove to the london bridge station where we bought return tickets that entitled us to admission to the palace as well as conveyance thither for half a crown apiece  on our arrival we entered by the garden front thus gaining a fine view of the ornamental grounds with their fountains and stately pathways bordered with statues and of the edifice itself so vast and fairylike looking as if it were a bubble and might vanish at a touch  there is as little beauty in the architecture of the crystal palace however as was possible to be with such gigantic use of such a material  no doubt an architectural order of which we have as yet little or no idea is to be developed from the use of glass as a buildingmaterial instead of brick and stone  it will have its own rules and its own results but meanwhile even the present palace is positively a very beautiful object  on entering we found the atmosphere chill and comfortlessmore so it seemed to me than the open air itself  it was not a genial day though now and then the sun gleamed out and once caused fine effects in the glasswork of a crystal fountain in one of the courts  we were under mr silshees guidance for the day     and first we looked at the sculpture which is composed chiefly of casts or copies of the most famous statues of all ages and likewise of those crumbs and little fragments which have fallen from times jawand halfpicked bones as it were that have been gathered up from spots where he has feasted fulltorsos heads and broken limbs some of them half worn away as if they had been rolled over and over in the sea  i saw nothing in the sculptural way either modern or antique that impressed me so much as a statue of a nude mother by a french artist  in a sitting posture with one knee over the other she was clasping her highest knee with both hands and in the hollow cradle thus formed by her arms lay two sweet little babies as snug and close to her heart as if they had not yet been borntwo little loveblossomsand the mother encircling them and pervading them with love  but an infinite pathos and strange terror are given to this beautiful group by some faint basreliefs on the pedestal indicating that the happy mother is eve and cain and abel the two innocent babes  then we went to the alhambra which looks like an enchanted palace  if it had been a sunny day i should have enjoyed it more but it was miserable to shiver and shake in the court of the lions and in those chambers which were contrived as places of refuge from a fervid temperature  furthermore it is not quite agreeable to see such clever specimens of stage decoration they are so very good that it gets to be past a joke without becoming actual earnest  i had not a similar feeling in respect to the reproduction of mediaeval statues arches doorways all brilliantly colored as in the days of their first glory yet i do not know but that the first is as little objectionable as the last  certainly in both cases scenes and objects of a past age are here more vividly presented to the dullest mind than without such material facilities they could possibly be brought before the most powerful imagination  truly the crystal palace in all its departments offers wonderful means of education  i marvel what will come of it among the things that i admired most was benvenuto cellinis statue of perseus holding the head of medusa and standing over her headless and still writhing body out of which at the severed neck gushed a vast exuberance of snakes  likewise a sitting statue by michel angelo of one of the medici full of dignity and grace and reposeful might  also the bronze gate of a baptistery in florence carved all over with relieves of scripture subjects executed in the most lifelike and expressive manner  the cast itself was a miracle of art  i should have taken it for the genuine original bronze  we then wandered into the house of diomed which seemed to me a dismal abode affording no possibility of comfort  we sat down in one of the rooms on an iron bench very cold  it being by this time two oclock we went to the refreshmentroom and lunched and before we had finished our repast my wife discovered that she had lost her sable tippet which she had been carrying on her arm mr silsbee most kindly and obligingly immediately went in quest of it     but to no purpose      upon entering the tropical saloon we found a most welcome and delightful change of temperature among those gigantic leaves of banyantrees and the broad expanse of waterplants floating on lakes and spacious aviaries where birds of brilliant plumage sported and sang amid such foliage as they knew at home  howbeit the atmosphere was a little faint and sickish perhaps owing to the odor of the halftepid water  the most remarkable object here was the trunk of a tree huge beyond imagination a pinetree from california  it was only the strippedoff bark however which had been conveyed hither in segments and put together again beyond the height of the palace roof and the hollow interior circle of the tree was large enough to contain fifty people i should think  we entered and sat down in all the remoteness from one another that is attainable in a goodsized drawingroom  we then ascended the gallery to get a view of this vast tree from a more elevated position and found it looked even bigger from above  then we loitered slowly along the gallery as far as it extended and afterwards descended into the nave for it was getting dusk and a horn had sounded and a bell rung a warning to such as delayed in the remote regions of the building mr silsbee again most kindly went in quest of the sables but still without success     i have not much enjoyed the crystal palace but think it a great and admirable achievement   november 19thon tuesday evening mr silsbee came to read some letters which he has written to his friends chiefly giving his observations on art together with descriptions of venice and other cities on the continent  they were very good and indicate much sensibility and talent  after the reading we had a little oystersupper and wine  i had written a note to  and received an answer indicating that he was much weighed down by his financial misfortune     however he desired me to come and see him so yesterday morning i wended my way down into the city and after various reluctant circumlocutions arrived at his house  the interior looked confused and dismal  it seems to me nobody else runs such risks as a man of business because he risks everything  every other man into whatever depth of poverty he may sink has still something left be he author scholar handicraftman or what not the merchant has nothing  we parted with a long and strong grasp of the hand and  promised to come and see us soon      on my way home i called at truebners in pater noster row     i waited a few minutes he being busy with a tall muscular englishbuilt man who after he had taken leave truebner told me was charles reade i once met him at an evening party but should have been glad to meet him again now that i appreciate him so much better after reading never too late to mend   december 6thall these days since my last date have been marked by nothing very well worthy of detail and description  i have walked the streets a great deal in the dull november days and always take a certain pleasure in being in the midst of human lifeas closely encompassed by it as it is possible to be anywhere in this world and in that way of viewing it there is a dull and sombre enjoyment always to be had in holborn fleet street cheapside and the other busiest parts of london it is human life it is this material world it is a grim and heavy reality  i have never had the same sense of being surrounded by materialisms and hemmed in with the grossness of this earthly existence anywhere else these broad crowded streets are so evidently the veins and arteries of an enormous city  london is evidenced in every one of them just as a megatherium is in each of its separate bones even if they be small ones  thus i never fail of a sort of selfcongratulation in finding myself for instance passing along ludgate hill but in spite of this it is really an ungladdened life to wander through these huge thronged ways over a pavement foul with mud ground into it by a million of footsteps jostling against people who do not seem to be individuals but all one mass so homogeneous is the streetwalking aspect of them the roar of vehicles pervading mewearisome cabs and omnibuses everywhere the dingy brick edifices heaving themselves up and shutting out all but a strip of sullen cloud that serves london for a skyin short a general impression of grime and sordidness and at this season always a fog scattered along the vista of streets sometimes so densely as almost to spiritualize the materialism and make the scene resemble the other world of worldly people gross even in ghostliness it is strange how little splendor and brilliancy one sees in londonin the city almost none though some in the shops of regent street  my wife has had a season of indisposition within the last few weeks so that my rambles have generally been solitary or with j only for a companion  i think my only excursion with my wife was a week ago when we went to lincolns inn fields which truly are almost fields right in the heart of london and as retired and secluded as if the surrounding city were a forest and its heavy roar were the wind among the branches we gained admission into the noble hall which is modern but built in antique style and stately and beautiful exceedingly  i have forgotten all but the general effect with its lofty oaken roof its panelled walls with the windows high above and the great arched window at one end full of painted coats of arms which the light glorifies in passing through them as if each were the escutcheon of some illustrious personage  thence we went to the chapel of lincolns inn where on entering we found a class of young choristers receiving instruction from their musicmaster while the organ accompanied their strains  these young clear fresh elastic voices are wonderfully beautiful they are like those of women yet have something more birdlike and aspiring more like what one conceives of the singing of angels  as for the singing of saints and blessed spirits that have once been human it never can resemble that of these young voices for no duration of heavenly enjoyments will ever quite take the mortal sadness out of it  in this chapel we saw some painted windows of the time of james i a period much subsequent to the age when painted glass was in its glory but the pictures of scriptural people in these windows were certainly very finethe figures being as large as life and the faces having much expression  the sunshine came in through some of them and produced a beautiful effect almost as if the painted forms were the glorified spirits of those holy personages  after leaving lincolns inn we looked at grays inn which is a great quiet domain quadrangle beyond quadrangle close beside holborn and a large space of greensward enclosed within it  it is very strange to find so much of ancient quietude right in the monster citys very jaws which yet the monster shall not eat upright in its very belly indeed which yet in all these ages it shall not digest and convert into the same substance as the rest of its bustling streets  nothing else in london is so like the effect of a spell as to pass under one of these archways and find yourself transported from the jumble mob tumult uproar as of an age of weekdays condensed into the present hour into what seems an eternal sabbath  thence we went into staple inn i think it waswhich has a front upon holborn of four or five ancient gables in a row and a low arch under the impending story admitting you into a paved quadrangle beyond which you have the vista of another  i do not understand that the residences and chambers in these inns of court are now exclusively let to lawyers though such inhabitants certainly seem to preponderate there  since then j and i walked down into the strand and found ourselves unexpectedly mixed up with a crowd that grew denser as we approached charing cross and became absolutely impermeable when we attempted to make our way to whitehall  the wicket in the gate of northumberland house by the by was open and gave me a glimpse of the front of the edifice withina very partial glimpse however and that obstructed by the solid person of a footman who with some women were passing out from within  the crowd was a real english crowd perfectly undemonstrative and entirely decorous being composed mostly of welldressed people and largely of women  the cause of the assemblage was the opening of parliament by the queen but we were too late for any chance of seeing her majesty  however we extricated ourselves from the multitude and going along pall mall got into the park by the steps at the foot of the duke of yorks column and thence went to the whitehall gateway outside of which we found the horse guards drawn upa regiment of black horses and burnished cuirasses  on our way thither an open carriage came through the gateway into the park conveying two ladies in court dresses and another splendid chariot pressed out through the gatewaythe coachman in a cocked hat and scarlet and gold embroidery and two other scarlet and gold figures hanging behind  it was one of the queens carriages but seemed to have nobody in it  i have forgotten to mention what i think produced more effect on me than anything else namely the clash of the bells from the steeple of st martins church and those of st margaret  really london seemed to cry out through them and bid welcome to the queen   december 7ththis being a muddy and dismal day i went only to the    british museum   which is but a short walk down the street great russell street  i have now visited it often enough to be on more familiar terms with it than at first and therefore do not feel myself so weighed down by the many things to be seen  i have ceased to expect or hope or wish to devour and digest the whole enormous collection so i content myself with individual things and succeed in getting now and then a little honey from them unless i were studying some particular branch of history or science or art this is the best that can be done with the british museum  i went first today into the townley gallery and so along through all the ancient sculpture and was glad to find myself able to sympathize more than heretofore with the forms of grace and beauty which are preserved therepoor maimed immortalities as they areheadless and legless trunks godlike cripples faces beautiful and brokennosed heroic shapes which have stood so long or lain prostrate so long in the open air that even the atmosphere of greece has almost dissolved the external layer of the marble and yet however much they may be worn away or battered and shattered the grace and nobility seem as deep in them as the very heart of the stone  it cannot be destroyed except by grinding them to powder  in short i do really believe that there was an excellence in ancient sculpture which has yet a potency to educate and refine the minds of those who look at it even so carelessly and casually as i do  as regards the frieze of the parthenon i must remark that the horses represented on it though they show great spirit and lifelikeness are rather of the pony species than what would be considered fine horses now  doubtless modern breeding has wrought a difference in the animal flaxman in his outlines seems to have imitated these classic steeds of the parthenon and thus has produced horses that always appeared to me affected and diminutively monstrous  from the classic sculpture i passed through an assyrian room where the walls are lined with great slabs of marble sculptured in basrelief with scenes in the life of senmacherib i believe very ugly to be sure yet artistically done in their own style and in wonderfully good preservation  indeed if the chisel had cut its last stroke in them yesterday the work could not be more sharp and distinct  in glass cases in this room are little relics and scraps of utensils and a great deal of fragmentary rubbish dug up by layard in his researches things that it is hard to call anything but trash but which yet may be of great significance as indicating the modes of life of a longpast race  i remember nothing particularly just now except some pieces of broken glass iridescent with certainly the most beautiful hues in the worldindescribably beautiful and unimaginably unless one can conceive of the colors of the rainbow and a thousand glorious sunsets and the autumnal forestleaves of america all condensed upon a little fragment of a glass cupand that too without becoming in the least glaring or flagrant but mildly glorious as we may fancy the shifting lines of an angels wing may be  i think this chaste splendor will glow in my memory for years to come  it is the effect of time and cannot be imitated by any known process of art  i have seen it in specimens of old roman glass which has been famous here in england but never in anything is there the brilliancy of these oriental fragments  how strange that decay in dark places and underground and where there are a billion chances to one that nobody will ever see its handiwork should produce these beautiful effects  the glass seems to become perfectly brittle so that it would vanish like a soapbubble if touched  ascending the stairs i went through the halls of fossil remainswhich i care little for though one of them is a human skeleton in limestone and through several rooms of mineralogical specimens including all the gems in the world among which is seen not the kohinoor itself but a facsimile of it in crystal  i think the aerolites are as interesting as anything in this department and one piece of pure iron laid against the wall of the room weighs about fourteen hundred pounds  whence could it have come  if these aerolites are bits of other planets how happen they to be always iron  but i know no more of this than if i were a philosopher  then i went through rooms of shells and fishes and reptiles and tortoises crocodiles and alligators and insects including all manner of butterflies some of which had wings precisely like leaves a little withered and faded even the skeleton and fibres of the leaves represented and immense hairy spiders covering with the whole circumference of their legs a space as big as a saucer and centipedes little less than a foot long and winged insects that look like jointed twigs of a tree  in america i remember when i lived in lenox i found an insect of this species and at first really mistook it for a twig  it was smaller than these specimens in the museum  i suppose every creature almost that runs or creeps or swims or flies is represented in this collection of natural history and it puzzles me to think what they were all made for though it is quite as mysterious why man himself was made  by and by i entered the room of egyptian mummies of which there are a good many one of which the body of a priestess is unrolled except the innermost layer of linen  the outline of her face is perfectly visible mummies of cats dogs snakes and children are in the wallcases together with a vast many articles of egyptian manufacture and useeven childrens toys bread too in flat cakes grapes that have turned to raisins in the grave queerest of all methinks a curly wig that is supposed to have belonged to a womantogether with the wooden box that held it  the hair is brown and the wig is as perfect as if it had been made for some now living dowager  from egypt we pass into rooms containing vases and other articles of grecian and roman workmanship and funeral urns and beads and rings none of them very beautiful  i saw some splendid specimens however at a former visit when i obtained admission to a room not indiscriminately shown to visitors  what chiefly interested me in that room was a cast taken from the face of cromwell after death representing a widemouthed longchinned uncomely visage with a triangular english nose in the very centre  there were various other curiosities which i fancied were safe in my memory but they do not now come uppermost  to return to my todays progress through the museumnext to the classic rooms are the collections of saxon and british and early english antiquities the earlier portions of which are not very interesting to me possessing little or no beauty in themselves and indicating a kind of life too remote from our own to be readily sympathized with  who cares for glass beads and copper brooches and knives spearheads and swords all so rusty that they look as much like pieces of old iron hoop as anything else  the bed of the thames has been a rich treasury of antiquities from the time of the roman conquest downwards it seems to preserve bronze in considerable perfection but not iron  among the mediaeval relics the carvings in ivory are often very exquisite and elaborate  there are likewise caskets and coffers and a thousand other old world ornamental works but i saw so many and such superior specimens of them at the manchester exhibition that i shall say nothing of them here  the sealring of mary queen of scots is in one of the cases it must have been a thumbring judging from its size and it has a dark stone engraved with armorial bearings  in another case is the magic glass formerly used by dr doe and in which if i rightly remember used to be seen prophetic visions or figures of persons and scenes at a distance  it is a round ball of glass or crystal slightly tinged with a pinkish hue and about as big as a small apple or a little bigger than an egg would be if perfectly round  this ancient humbug kept me looking at it perhaps ten minutes and i saw my own face dimly in it but no other vision  lastly i passed through the ethnographical rooms but i care little for the varieties of the human raceall that is really important and interesting being found in our own variety  perhaps equally in any other  this brought me to the head of one of the staircases descending which i entered the library  herenot to speak of the noble rooms and hallsthere are numberless treasures beyond all price too valuable in their way for me to select any one as more curious and valuable than many others  letters of statesmen and warriors of all nations and several centuries backamong which long as it has taken europe to produce them i saw none so illustrious as those of washington nor more so than franklins whom america gave to the world in her nonage and epistles of poets and artists and of kings too whose chirography appears to have been much better than i should have expected from fingers so often cramped in iron gauntlets  in another case there were the original autograph copies of several famous worksfor example that of popes homer written on the backs of letters the direction and seals of which appear in the midst of the tale of troy divine which also is much scratched and interlined with popes corrections a manuscript of one of ben jonsons masques of the sentimental journey written in much more careful and formal style than might be expected the book pretending to be a harumscarum of walter scotts kenilworth bearing such an aspect of straightforward diligence that i shall hardly think of it again as a romancein short i may as well drop the whole matter here  all through the long vista of the kings library we come to cases in whichwith their pages open beneath the glasswe see books worth their weight in gold either for their uniqueness or their beauty or because they have belonged to illustrious men and have their autographs in them the copy of the english translation of montaigne containing the strange scrawl of shakespeares autograph is here  bacons name is in another book queen elizabeths in another and there is a little devotional volume with lady jane greys writing in it  she is supposed to have taken it to the scaffold with her  here too i saw a copy which was printed at a venetian press at the time of the challenge which the admirable crichton caused to be posted on the church doors of venice defying all the scholars of italy to encounter him  but if i mention one thing i find fault with myself for not putting down fifty others just as interestingand after all there is an official catalogue no doubt of the whole  as i do not mean to fill any more pages with the british museum i will just mention the hall of egyptian antiquities on the groundfloor of the edifice though i did not pass through it today  they consist of things that would be very ugly and contemptible if they were not so immensely magnified but it is impossible not to acknowledge a certain grandeur resulting from the scale on which those strange old sculptors wrought for instance there is a granite fist of prodigious size at least a yard across and looking as if it were doubled in the face of time defying him to destroy it  all the rest of the statue to which it belonged seems to have vanished but this fist will certainly outlast the museum and whatever else it contains unless it be some similar egyptian ponderosity  there is a beetle wrought out of immensely hard black stone as big as a hogshead  it is satisfactory to see a thing so big and heavy  then there are huge stone sarcophagi engraved with hieroglyphics within and without all as good as new though their age is reckoned by thousands of years  these great coffins are of vast weight and mass insomuch that when once the accurately fitting lids were shut down there might have seemed little chance of their being lifted again till the resurrection  i positively like these coffins they are so faithfully made and so black and sternand polished to such a nicety only to be buried forever for the workmen and the kings who were laid to sleep within could never have dreamed of the british museum  there is a deity named pasht who sits in the hall very big very grave carved of black stone and very ludicrous wearing a dogs head  i will just mention the rosetta stone with a greek inscription and another in egyptian characters which gave the clew to a whole field of history and shall pretermit all further handling of this unwieldy subject  in all the rooms i saw people of the poorer classes some of whom seemed to view the objects intelligently and to take a genuine interest in them  a poor man in london has great opportunities of cultivating himself if he will only make the best of them and such an institution as the british museum can hardly fail to attract as the magnet does steel the minds that are likeliest to be benefited by it in its various departments  i saw many children there and some ragged boys  it deserves to be noticed that some small figures of indian thugs represented as engaged in their profession and handiwork of cajoling and strangling travellers have been removed from the place which they formerly occupied in the part of the museum shown to the general public they are now in the more private room and the reason of their withdrawal is that according to the chaplain of newgate the practice of garroting was suggested to the english thieves by this representation of indian thugs  it is edifying after what i have written in the preceding paragraph to find that the only lesson known to have been inculcated here is that of a new mode of outrage   december 8ththis morning when it was time to rise there was but a glimmering of daylight and we had candles on the breakfasttable at nearly ten oclock  all abroad there was a dense dim fog brooding through the atmosphere insomuch that we could hardly see across the street  at eleven oclock i went out into the midst of the fogbank which for the moment seemed a little more interfused with daylight for there seem to be continual changes in the density of this dim medium which varies so much that now you can but just see your hand before you and a moment afterwards you can see the cabs dashing out of the duskiness a score of yards off  it is seldom or never moreover an unmitigated gloom but appears to be mixed up with sunshine in different proportions sometimes only one part sun to a thousand of smoke and fog and sometimes sunshine enough to give the whole mass a coppery line  this would have been a bright sunny day but for the interference of the fog and before i had been out long i actually saw the sun looking red and rayless much like the millionth magnification of a new halfpenny  i was bound towards bennochs for he had written a note to apologize for not visiting us and i had promised to call and see him today  i went to marlborough house to look at the english pictures which i care more about seeing here in england than those of foreign artists because the latter will be found more numerously and better on the continent  i saw many pictures that pleased me nothing that impressed me very strongly  pictorial talent seems to be abundant enough up to a certain point pictorial genius i should judge is among the rarest of gifts  to be sure i very likely might not recognize it where it existed and yet it ought to have the power of making itself known even to the uninstructed mind as literary genius does  if it exist only for connoisseurs it is a very suspicious matter  i looked at all turners pictures and at many of his drawings and must again confess myself wholly unable to understand more than a very few of them  even those few are tantalizing  at a certain distance you discern what appears to be a grand and beautiful picture which you shall admire and enjoy infinitely if you can get within the range of distinct vision  you come nearer and find only blotches of color and dabs of the brush meaning nothing when you look closely and meaning a mystery at the point where the painter intended to station you  some landscapes there were indeed full of imaginative beauty and of the better truth etherealized out of the prosaic truth of nature only it was still impossible actually to see it there was a mist over it or it was like a tract of beautiful dreamland seen dimly through sleep and glimmering out of sight if looked upon with wideopen eyes  these were the more satisfactory specimens  there were many others which i could not comprehend in the remotest degree not even so far as to conjecture whether they purported to represent earth sea or sky  in fact i should not have known them to be pictures at all but might have supposed that the artist had been trying his brush on the canvas mixing up all sorts of hues but principally white paint and now and then producing an agreeable harmony of color without particularly intending it  now that i have done my best to understand them without an interpreter i mean to buy ruskins pamphlet at my next visit and look at them through his eyes  but i do not think that i can be driven out of the idea that a picture ought to have something in common with what the spectator sees in nature  marlborough house may be converted i think into a very handsome residence for the young prince of wales  the entrance from the courtyard is into a large square central hall the painted ceiling of which is at the whole height of the edifice and has a gallery on one side whence it would be pleasant to look down on a festal scene below the rooms are of fine proportions with vaulted ceilings and with fireplaces and mantelpieces of great beauty adorned with pillars and terminal figures of white and of variegated marble and in the centre of each mantelpiece there is a marble tablet exquisitely sculptured with classical designs done in such high relief that the figures are sometimes almost disengaged from the background  one of the subjects was androcles or whatever was his name taking the thorn out of the lions foot  i suppose these works are of the era of the first old duke and duchess  after all however for some reason or other the house does not at first strike you as a noble and princely one and you have to convince yourself of it by examining it more in detail  on leaving marlborough house i stepped for a few moments into the national gallery and looked among other things at the turners and claudes that hung there side by side  these pictures i think are quite the most comprehensible of turners productions but i must say i prefer the claudes  the latter catches the light that never was on sea or land without taking you quite away from nature for it  nevertheless i will not be quite certain that i care for any painter except murillo whose st john i should like to own  as far as my own pleasure is concerned i could not say as much for any other picture for i have always found an infinite weariness and disgust resulting from a picture being too frequently before my eyes  i had rather see a basilisk for instance than the very best of those old familiar pictures in the boston athenaeum and most of those in the national gallery might soon affect me in the same way  from the gallery i almost groped my way towards the city for the fog seemed to grow denser and denser as i advanced and when i reached st pauls the sunny intermixture above spoken of was at its minimum so that the smokecloud grew really black about the dome and pinnacles and the statues of saints looked down dimly from their standpoints on high it was very grand however to see the pillars and porticos and the huge bulk of the edifice heaving up its dome from an obscure foundation into yet more shadowy obscurity and by the time i reached the corner of the churchyard nearest cheapside the whole vast cathedral had utterly vanished leaving not a wrack behind unless those thick dark vapors were the elements of which it had been composed and into which it had again dissolved  it is good to think neverthelessand i gladly accept the analogy and the moralthat the cathedral was really there and as substantial as ever though those earthly mists had hidden it from mortal eyes  i found  in better spirits than when i saw him last but his misfortune has been too real not to affect him long and deeply  he was cheerful however and his face shone with almost its old lustre  it has still the cheeriest glow that i ever saw in any human countenance  i went home by way of holborn and the fog was denser than eververy black indeed more like a distillation of mud than anything else the ghost of mudthe spiritualized medium of departed mud through which the dead citizens of london probably tread in the hades whither they are translated  so heavy was the gloom that gas was lighted in all the shopwindows and the little charcoalfurnaces of the women and boys roasting chestnuts threw a ruddy misty glow around them  and yet i liked it  this fog seems an atmosphere proper to huge grimy london as proper to london as that light neither of the sun nor moon is to the new jerusalem  on reaching home i found the same fog diffused through the drawingroom though how it could have got in is a mystery  since nightfall however the atmosphere is clear again   december 20thhere we are still in london at least a month longer than we expected and at the very dreariest and dullest season of the year had i thought of it sooner i might have found interesting people enough to know even when all london is said to be out of town but meditating a stay only of a week or two on our way to rome it did not seem worth while to seek acquaintances  i have been out only for one evening and that was at dr s who had been attending all the children in the measles  their illness was what detained us  he is a homoeopathist and is known in scientific or general literature at all events a sensible and enlightened man with an unenglish freedom of mind on some points  for example he is a swedenborgian and a believer in modern spiritualism  he showed me some drawings that had been made under the spiritual influence by a miniaturepainter who possesses no imaginative power of his own and is merely a good mechanical and literal copyist but these drawings representing angels and allegorical people were done by an influence which directed the artists hand he not knowing what his next touch would be nor what the final result  the sketches certainly did show a high and fine expressiveness if examined in a trustful mood  dr  also spoke of mr harris the american poet of spiritualism as being the best poet of the day and he produced his works in several volumes and showed me songs and paragraphs of longer poems in support of his opinion  they seemed to me to have a certain light and splendor but not to possess much power either passionate or intellectual  mr harris is the medium of deceased poets milton and lord byron among the rest and dr  said that lady byronwho is a devoted admirer of her husband in spite of their conjugal troublespronounced some of these posthumous strains to be worthy of his living genius  then the doctor spoke of various strange experiences which he himself has had in these spiritual matters for he has witnessed the miraculous performances of home the american medium and he has seen with his own eyes and felt with his own touch those ghostly hands and arms the reality of which has been certified to me by other beholders  dr  tells me that they are cold and that it is a somewhat awful matter to see and feel them  i should think so indeed  do i believe in these wonders  of course for how is it possible to doubt either the solemn word or the sober observation of a learned and sensible man like dr   but again do i really believe it  of course not for i cannot consent to have heaven and earth this world and the next beaten up together like the white and yolk of an egg merely out of respect to dr s sanity and integrity  i would not believe my own sight nor touch of the spiritual hands and it would take deeper and higher strains than those of mr harris to convince me  i think i might yield to higher poetry or heavenlier wisdom than mortals in the flesh have ever sung or uttered  meanwhile this matter of spiritualism is surely the strangest that ever was heard of and yet i feel unaccountably little interest in ita sluggish disgust and repugnance to meddle with itinsomuch that i hardly feel as if it were worth this page or two in my not very eventful journal  one or two of the ladies present at dr s little party seemed to be mediums  i have made several visits to the picturegalleries since my last date and i think it fair towards my own powers of appreciation to record that i begin to appreciate turners pictures rather better than at first  not that i have anything to recant as respects those strange whitegrounded performances in the chambers at the marlborough house but some of his happier productions a large landscape illustrative of childe harold for instance seem to me to have more magic in them than any other pictures i admire too that misty morning landscape in the national gallery and no doubt his very monstrosities are such as only he could have painted and may have an infinite value for those who can appreciate the genius in them  the shops in london begin to show some tokens of approaching christmas especially the toyshops and the confectionersthe latter ornamenting their windows with a profusion of bonbons and all manner of pygmy figures in sugar the former exhibiting christmastrees hung with rich and gaudy fruit  at the butchers shops there is a great display of fat carcasses and an abundance of game at the poulterers  we think of going to the crystal palace to spend the festival day and eat our christmas dinner but do what we may we shall have no home feeling or fireside enjoyment  i am weary weary of london and of england and can judge now how the old loyalists must have felt condemned to pine out their lives here when the revolution had robbed them of their native country  and yet there is still a pleasure in being in this dingy smoky midmost haunt of men and i trudge through fleet street and ludgate street and along cheapside with an enjoyment as great as i ever felt in a woodpath at home and i have come to know these streets as well i believe as i ever knew washington street in boston or even essex street in my stupid old native town  for piccadilly or for regent street though more brilliant promenades i do not care nearly so much   december 27thstill leading an idle life which however may not be quite thrown away as i see some things and think many thoughts  the other day we went to westminster abbey and through the chapels and it being as sunny a day as could well be in london and in december we could judge in some small degree what must have been the splendor of those tombs and monuments when first erected there  i presume i was sufficiently minute in describing my first visit to the chapels so i shall only mention the stiff figure of a lady of queen elizabeths court reclining on the point of her elbow under a mural arch through all these dusty years     and the old coronationchair with the stone of scone beneath the seat and the woodwork cut and scratched all over with names and initials      i continue to go to the picturegalleries  i have an idea that the face of murillos st john has a certain mischievous intelligence in it  this has impressed me almost from the first  it is a boys face very beautiful and very pleasant too but with an expression that one might fairly suspect to be roguish if seen in the face of a living boy  about equestrian statues as those of various kings at charing cross and otherwhere about london and of the duke of wellington opposite apsley house and in front of the exchange it strikes me as absurd the idea of putting a man on horseback on a place where one movement of the steed forward or backward or sideways would infallibly break his own and his riders neck  the english sculptors generally seem to have been aware of this absurdity and have endeavored to lessen it by making the horse as quiet as a cabhorse on the stand instead of rearing rampant like the bronze group of jackson at washington  the statue of wellington at the piccadilly corner of the park has a stately and imposing effect seen from far distances in approaching either through the green park or from the oxford street corner of hyde park   january 3d 1858on thursday we had the pleasure of a call from mr coventry patmore to whom dr wilkinson gave me a letter of introduction and on whom i had called twice at the british museum without finding him we had read his betrothal and angel in the house with unusual pleasure and sympathy and therefore were very glad to make his personal acquaintance  he is a man of much more youthful aspect than i had expected     a slender person to be an englishman though not remarkably so had he been an american with an intelligent pleasant and sensitive facea man very evidently of refined feelings and cultivated mind     he is very simple and agreeable in his manners a little shy yet perfectly frank and easy to meet on real grounds     he said that his wife had proposed to come with him and had indeed accompanied him to town but was kept away     we were very sorry for this because mr patmore seems to acknowledge her as the real angel in the house although he says she herself ignores all connection with the poem  it is well for her to do so and for her husband to feel that the character is her real portrait and both i suppose are right  it is a most beautiful and original poema poem for happy married people to read together and to understand by the light of their own past and present life but i doubt whether the generality of english people are capable of appreciating it  i told mr patmore that i thought his popularity in america would be greater than at home and he said that it was already so and he appeared to estimate highly his american fame and also our general gift of quicker and more subtle recognition of genius than the english public     we mutually gratified each other by expressing high admiration of one anothers works and mr patmore regretted that in the few days of our further stay here we should not have time to visit him at his home  it would really give me pleasure to do so     i expressed a hope of seeing him in italy during our residence there and he seemed to think it possible as his friend and our countryman thomas buchanan read had asked him to come thither and be his guest  he took his leave shaking hands with all of us because he saw that we were of his own people recognizing him as a true poet  he has since given me the new edition of his poems with a kind rote  we are now making preparations for our departure which we expect will take place on tuesday and yesterday i went to our ministers to arrange about the passport  the very moment i rang at his door it swung open and the porter ushered me with great courtesy into the anteroom not that he knew me or anything about me except that i was an american citizen this is the deference which an american servant of the public finds it expedient to show to his sovereigns  thank heaven i am a sovereign again and no longer a servant and really it is very singular how i look down upon our ambassadors and dignitaries of all sorts not excepting the president himself  i doubt whether this is altogether a good influence of our mode of government  i did not see and in fact declined seeing the minister himself but only his son the secretary of legation and a dr p an american traveller just from the continent  he gave a fearful account of the difficulties that beset a person landing with much luggage in italy and especially at civita vecchia the very port at which we intended to debark  i have been so long in england that it seems a cold and shivery thing to go anywhere else  bennoch came to take tea with us on the 5th it being his first visit since we came to london and likewise his farewell visit on our leaving for the continent  on his departure j and i walked a good way down oxford street and holborn with him and i took leave of him with the kindest wishes for his welfare   end of vol ii
