october 1912           the green helmet and           other poems     his dream     i swayed upon the gaudy stern   the butt end of a steering oar   and everywhere that i could turn   men ran upon the shore    and though i would have hushed the crowd   there was no mothers son but said   what is the figure in a shroud   upon a gaudy bed    and fishes bubbling to the brim   cried out upon that thing beneath   it had such dignity of limb   by the sweet name of death    though id my finger on my lip   what could i but take up the song   and fish and crowd and gaudy ship   cried out the whole night long    crying amid the glittering sea   naming it with ecstatic breath   because it had such dignity   by the sweet name of death     a woman homer sung     if any man drew near   when i was young   i thought he holds her dear   and shook with hate and fear   but oh twas bitter wrong   if he could pass her by   with an indifferent eye    whereon i wrote and wrought   and now being gray   i dream that i have brought   to such a pitch my thought   that coming time can say   he shadowed in a glass   what thing her body was    for she had fiery blood   when i was young   and trod so sweetly proud   as twere upon a cloud   a woman homer sung   that life and letters seem   but an heroic dream     that the night come     she lived in storm and strife   her soul had such desire   for what proud death may bring   that it could not endure   the common good of life   but lived as twere a king   that packed his marriage day   with banneret and pennon   trumpet and kettledrum   and the outrageous cannon   to bundle time away   that the night come     the consolation     i had this thought awhile ago   my darling cannot understand   what i have done or what would do   in this blind bitter land    and i grew weary of the sun   until my thoughts cleared up again   remembering that the best i have done   was done to make it plain    that every year i have cried at length   my darling understands it all   because i have come into my strength   and words obey my call    that had she done so who can say   what would have shaken from the sieve   i might have thrown poor words away   and been content to live     friends     now must i these three praise   three women that have wrought   what joy is in my days   one that no passing thought   nor those unpassing cares   no not in these fifteen   many times troubled years   could ever come between   heart and delighted heart   and one because her hand   had strength that could unbind   what none can understand   what none can have and thrive   youths dreamy load till she   so changed me that i live   labouring in ecstasy   and what of her that took   all till my youth was gone   with scarce a pitying look   how should i praise that one   when day begins to break   i count my good and bad   being wakeful for her sake   remembering what she had   what eagle look still shows   while up from my hearts root   so great a sweetness flows   i shake from head to foot     no second troy     why should i blame her that she filled my days   with misery or that she would of late   have taught to ignorant men most violent ways   or hurled the little streets upon the great   had they but courage equal to desire   what could have made her peaceful with a mind   that nobleness made simple as a fire   with beauty like a tightened bow a kind   that is not natural in an age like this   being high and solitary and most stern   why what could she have done being what she is   was there another troy for her to burn     reconciliation     some may have blamed you that you took away   the verses that could move them on the day   when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind   with lightning you went from me and i could find   nothing to make a song about but kings   helmets and swords and halfforgotten things   that were like memories of youbut now   well out for the world lives as long ago   and while were in our laughing weeping fit   hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit   but dear cling close to me since you were gone   my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone     king and no king     would it were anything but merely voice   the no king cried who after that was king   because he had not heard of anything   that balanced with a word is more than noise   yet old romance being kind let him prevail   somewhere or somehow that i have forgot   though hed but cannonwhereas we that had thought   to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale   have been defeated by that pledge you gave   in momentary anger long ago   and i that have not your faith how shall i know   that in the blinding light beyond the grave   well find so good a thing as that we have lost   the hourly kindness the days common speech   the habitual content of each with each   when neither soul nor body has been crossed     the cold heaven     suddenly i saw the cold and rook delighting heaven   that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice   and thereupon imagination and heart were driven   so wild that every casual thought of that and this   vanished and left but memories that should be out of season   with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago   and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason   until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro   riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken   confusion of the deathbed over is it sent   out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken   by the injustice of the skies for punishment     peace     ah that time could touch a form   that could show what homers age   bred to be a heros wage   were not all her life but storm   would not painters paint a form   of such noble lines i said   such a delicate high head   so much sternness and such charm   till they had changed us to like strength   ah but peace that comes at length   came when time had touched her form     against unworthy praise     o heart be at peace because   nor knave nor dolt can break   whats not for their applause   being for a womans sake   enough if the work has seemed   so did she your strength renew   a dream that a lion had dreamed   till the wilderness cried aloud   a secret between you two   between the proud and the proud    what still you would have their praise   but heres a haughtier text   the labyrinth of her days   that her own strangeness perplexed   and how what her dreaming gave   earned slander ingratitude   from selfsame dolt and knave   aye and worse wrong than these   yet she singing upon her road   half lion half child is at peace     the fascination of whats difficult     the fascination of whats difficult   has dried the sap out of my veins and rent   spontaneous joy and natural content   out of my heart theres something ails our colt   that must as if it had not holy blood   nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to cloud   shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt   as though it dragged

glass to my mouth   i look at you and i sigh     the coming of wisdom with time     though leaves are many the root is one   through all the lying days of my youth   i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun   now i may wither into the truth     on hearing that the students of our new university have joined the ancient order of hibernians and the agitation against immoral literature     where

wise   and yet not cold    i would but find whats there to find   love or deceit   it was the mask engaged your mind   and after set your heart to beat   not whats behind    but lest you are my enemy   i must enquire   o no my dear let all that be   what matter so there is but fire   in you in me     upon a house shaken by the land agitation     how should the world be luckier if this house   where passion and precision have been one   time out of mind became too ruinous   to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun   and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow   where wings have memory of wings and all   that comes of the best knit to the best although   mean rooftrees were the sturdier for its fall   how should their luck run high enough to reach   the gifts that govern men and after

green helmet  an heroic farce       scene a house made of logs there are two windows at the back and     a door which cuts off one of the corners of the room through the     door one can see low rocks which make the ground outside higher than     it is within and beyond the rocks a misty moonlit sea through the     windows one can see nothing but the sea there is a great chair at     the opposite side to the door and in front of it a table with cups     and a flagon of ale here and there are stools      at the abbey theatre the house is orange red and the chairs and     tables and flagons black with a slight purple tinge which is not     clearly distinguishable from the black the rocks are black with a     few green touches the sea is green and luminous and all the     characters except the red man and the black men are dressed in     various shades of green one or two with touches of purple which     look nearly black the black men all wear dark purple and have eared     caps and at the end their eyes should look green from the reflected     light of the sea the red man is altogether in red he is very tall     and his height increased by horns on the green helmet the effect is     intentionally violent and startling   laegaire    what is that i had thought that i saw though but in the wink of an       eye   a catheaded man out of connaught go pacing and spitting

old secret country beyond the woolwhite waves   or it may be down beneath them in foambewildered caves   where nine forsaken sea queens fling shuttles to and fro   but beyond them or beneath them whether you will or no   i am going too  laegaire             better tell it all out to the end   he was born to luck in the cradle his good luck may amend   the bad luck we were born to  conall

but a little while we were there and the alecup full   we were half drunk and merry and midnight on the stroke   when a wide high man came in with a red foxy cloak   with halfshut foxy eyes and a great laughing mouth   and he said when we bid him drink that he had so great a drouth   he could drink the sea  cuchulain      i thought he had come from one of you   out of some connaught rath and would lap up milk and mew   but if he so loved water i have the tale awry  conall    you would not be so merry if he were standing by   for when we had sung or danced as he were our next of kin   he promised to show us a game the best that ever had been   and when we had asked what game he answered why whip off my head   then one of you two stoop down and ill whip off his he said   a head for a head he said that is the game that i play  cuchulain    how could he whip off a head when his own had been whipped away  conall    we told him it over and over and that ale had fuddled his wit   but he stood and laughed at us there as though his sides would split   till i could stand it no longer and whipped off his head at a blow   being mad that he did not answer and more at his laughing so   and there on the ground where it fell it went on laughing at me  laegaire    till he took it up in his hands  conall          and splashed himself into the sea  cuchulain    i have imagined as good when ive been as deep in the cup  laegaire    you never did  cuchulain                 and believed it  conall              cuchulain when will you stop   boasting of your great deeds and weighing yourself with us two   and crying out to the world whatever we say or do   that youve said or done a betternor is it a drunkards tale   though we said to ourselves at first that it all came out of the ale   and thinking that if we told it we should be a laughingstock   swore we should keep it secret  laegaire          but twelve months upon the clock  conall    a twelvemonth from the first time  laegaire           and the jug full up to the brim   for we had been put from our drinking by the very thought of him  conall    we stood as were standing now  laegaire           the horns were as empty  conall                                when   he ran up out of the sea with his head on his shoulders again  cuchulain    why this is a tale worth telling  conall    and he called for his debt and his right   and said that the land was disgraced because of us two from that night   if we did not pay him his debt  laegaire                what is there to be said   when a man with a right to get it has come to ask for your head  conall    if you had been sitting there you had been silent like us  laegaire    he said that in twelve months more he would come again to this house   and ask his debt again twelve months are up today  conall    he would have followed after if we had run away  laegaire    will he tell every mothers son that we have broken our word  cuchulain    whether he does or does not well drive him out with the sword   and take his life in the bargain if he but dare to scoff  conall    how can you fight with a head that laughs when youve whipped it off  laegaire    or a man that can pick it up and carry it out in his hand  conall    he is coming now theres a splash and a rumble along the strand   as when he came last  cuchulain    come and put all your backs to the door      a tall redheaded redcloaked man stands upon the threshold     against the misty green of the sea the ground higher without than     within the house makes him seem taller even than he is he leans     upon a great twohanded sword  laegaire    it is too late to shut it for there he stands once more   and laughs like the sea  cuchulain    old herringyou whip off heads why then   whip off your own for it seems you can clap it on again   or else go down in the sea go down in the sea i say   find that old juggler manannan and whip his head away   or the red man of the boyne for they are of your own sort   or if the waves have vexed you and you would find a sport   of a more irish fashion go fight without a rest   a caterwauling phantom among the winds of the west   but what are you waiting for into the water i say   if theres no sword can harm you ive an older trick to play   an old fivefingered trick to tumble you out of the place   i am sualtims son cuchulainwhat do you laugh in my face  red man    so you too think me in earnest in wagering poll for poll   a drinking joke and a gibe and a jugglers feat that is all   to make the time go quicklyfor i am the drinkers friend   the kindest of all shapechangers from here to the worlds end   the best of all tipsy companions and now i bring you a gift   i will lay it there on the ground for the best of you all to lift      he

ale is in the cup   there im forgiven now      then in a more solemn voice as he goes out                  let the bravest take it up      conall takes up helmet and gazes at it with delight    laegaire      singing with a swaggering stride    laegaire is best   between water and hill   he fought in the west   with cat heads until   at the break of day   all fell by his sword   and he carried away   their hidden hoard      he seizes the helmet  conall    give it me for what did you find in the bag   but the straw and the broken delf and the bits of dirty rag   youd taken for good money  cuchulain              no no but give it me      he takes helmet  conall    the helmets mine or laegairesyoure the youngest of us three  cuchulain      filling helmet with ale    i did not take

    the others cry out and blow horns partly drowning the rest of his     speech                but they denied its worth   preferring laegaire or conall and they cried to drown my voice   but i have so strong a throat that i drowned all their noise   till they took to the hunting horns and blew them into my face   and as neither side would give inwe would settle it in this place   let the helmet

rivalry might cease   we have turned that murderous cat into a cup of peace   i drank the first and then conall give it to laegaire now      conall gives helmet to laegaire    that it may purr in his hand and all of our servants know   that since the ale went in its claws went out of sight  a servant    thats welli will stop my shouting  another                   cuchulain is in the right   i am tired of this big horn that has made me hoarse as a rook  laeg    cuchulain you drank the first  another               by drinking the first he took   the whole of the honours himself  laeg           cuchulain you drank the first  another    if laegaire drink from it now he claims to be last and worst  another    cuchulain and conall have drunk  another                           he is lost if he taste a drop  laegaire      laying helmet on table    did you claim to be better than us by drinking first from the cup  cuchulain      his words are partly drowned by the murmurs of the crowd though he     speaks very loud    that juggler from the sea that old red herring it is   who has set us all by the earshe brought the helmet for this   and because we would not quarrel he ran elsewhere to shout   that conall and laegaire wronged me till all had fallen out      the murmur grows less so that his words are heard    who knows where he is now or who he is spurring to fight   so get you gone and whatever may cry aloud in the night   or show itself in the air be silent until morn  a servant    cuchulain is in the righti am tired of this big horn  cuchulain    go      the servants turn toward the door but stop on hearing the voices     of women outside  laegaires wife      without          mine is the better to look at  conalls wife      without                but mine is better born  emer      without    my man is the pithier man  cuchulain                  old hurricane well done   youve set our wives to the game that they may egg us on   we are to kill each other that you may sport with us   ah now theyve begun to wrestle as to wholl be first at the house      the women come to the door struggling  emer    no i have the right of place for i married the better man  conalls wife      pulling emer back    my nails in your neck and shoulder  laegaires wife            and go before me if you can   my husband fought in the west  conalls wife      kneeling in the door so as to keep the others out who pull at     her        but what did he fight with there   but sidelong and spitting and helpless shadows of the dim air   and what did he carry away but straw and broken delf  laegaires wife    your own man made up that tale trembling alone by himself   drowning his terror  emer      forcing herself in front    i am emer it is i go first through the door   no one shall walk before me or praise any man before   my man has been praised  cuchulain      spreading his arms across the door so as to close it      come put an end to their quarrelling   one is as fair as the other and each one the wife of a king   break down the painted boards between the sill and the floor   that they come in together each one at her own door      laegaire and conall begin to break out the bottoms of the windows     then their wives go to the windows each to the window where her     husband is emer stands at the door and sings while the boards are     being broken out  emer    nothing that he has done   his mind that is fire   his body that is sun   have set my head higher   than all the worlds wives   himself on the wind   is the gift that he gives   therefore womenkind   when their eyes have met mine   grow cold and grow hot   troubled as with wine   by a secret thought   preyed upon fed upon   by jealousy and desire   i am moon to that sun   i am steel to that fire      the windows are now broken down to floor cuchulain takes his     spear from the door and the three women come in at the same     moment  emer    cuchulain put off this sloth and awake   i will sing till ive stiffened your lip against every knave that would       take   a share of your honour  laegaires wife    you lie for your man would take from my man  conalls wife      to laegaires wife    you say that you doubleface and your own husband began  cuchulain      taking up helmet from table    town land may rail at town land till all have gone to wrack   the very straws may wrangle till theyve thrown down the stack   the very doorposts bicker till theyve pulled in the door   the very alejars jostle till the ale is on the floor   but this shall help no further      he throws helmet into the sea  laegaires wife                  it was not for your head   and so you would let none wear it but fling it away instead  conalls wife    but you shall answer for it for youve robbed my man by this  conall    you have robbed us both cuchulain  laegaire               the greatest wrong there is   on the wide ridge of the world has been done to us two this day  emer      drawing her dagger    who is for cuchulain  cuchulain                       silence  emer              who is for cuchulain i say      she sings the same words as before flourishing her dagger about     while she is singing conalls wife and laegaires wife draw their     daggers and run at her but cuchulain forces them back laegaire and     conall draw their swords to strike cuchulain  laegaires wife      crying out so as to be heard through emers singing    deafen her singing with horns  conalls wife        cry aloud blow horns make a noise  laegaires wife    blow horns clap hands or shout so that you smother her voice      the horse boys and scullions blow their horns or fight among     themselves there is a deafening noise and a confused fight     suddenly three black hands come through the windows and put out the     torches it is now pitch dark but for a faint light outside the     house which merely shows that there are moving forms but not who or     what they are and in the darkness one can hear low terrified     voices  a voice    coalblack and headed like cats they came up over the strand  another voice    and i saw one stretch to a torch and cover it with his hand  another voice    another sooty fellow has plucked the moon from the air      a light gradually comes into the house from the sea on which the     moon begins to show once more there is no light within the house     and the great beams of the walls are dark and full of shadows and     the persons of the play dark too against the light the red man is     seen standing in the midst of the house the black catheaded men     crouch and stand about the door one carries the helmet one the     great sword  red man    i demand the debt thats owing let some man kneel down there   that i may cut his head off or all shall go to wrack  cuchulain    he played and paid with his head and its right that we pay him back   and give him more than he gave for he comes in here as a guest   so i will give him my head      emer begins to keen            little wife little wife be at rest   alive i have been far off in all lands under sun   and been no faithful man but when my story is done   my fame shall spring up and laugh and set you high above all  emer      putting her arms about him    it is you not your fame that i love  cuchulain      tries to put her from him    you are young you are wise you can call   some kinder and comelier man that will sit at home in the house  emer    live and be faithless still  cuchulain      throwing her from him    would you stay the great barnaclegoose   when its eyes are turned to the sea and its beak to the salt of the air  emer      lifting her dagger to stab herself    i too on the grey wings path  cuchulain      seizing dagger    do you dare do you dare do you dare   bear children and sweep the house      forcing his way through the servants who gather round           wail but keep from the road      he kneels before red man there is a pause    quick to your work old radish you will fade when the cocks have crowed      a black catheaded man holds out the helmet the red man takes it  red man    i have not come for your hurt im the rector of this land   and with my spitting catheads my frenzied moonbred band   age after age i sift it and choose for its championship   the man who hits my fancy      he places the helmet on cuchulains head            and i choose the laughing lip   that shall not turn from laughing whatever rise or fall   the heart that grows no bitterer although betrayed by all   the hand that loves to scatter the life like a gamblers throw   and these things i make prosper till a day come that i know   when heart and mind shall darken that the weak may end the strong   and the long remembering harpers have matter for their song     illustration
