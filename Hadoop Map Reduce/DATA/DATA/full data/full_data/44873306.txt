story which puzzles raja vikram  conclusion  preface  the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a baital is the history of a huge bat vampire or evil spirit which inhabited and animated dead bodies it is an old and thoroughly hindu legend composed in sanskrit and is the germ which culminated in the arabian nights and which inspired the golden ass of apuleius boccacios decamerone the pentamerone and all that class of facetious fictitious literature  the story turns chiefly on a great king named vikram the king arthur of the east who in pursuance of his promise to a jogi or magician brings to him the baital vampire who is hanging on a tree the difficulties king vikram and his son have in bringing the vampire into the presence of the jogi are truly laughable and on this thread is strung a series of hindu fairy stories which contain much interesting information on indian customs and manners it also alludes to that state which induces hindu devotees to allow themselves to be buried alive and to appear dead for weeks or months and then to return to life again a curious state of mesmeric catalepsy into which they work themselves by concentrating the mind and abstaining from food    a specimen of which i have given a practical illustration in the life of sir richard burton  the following translation is rendered peculiarly valuable and interesting by sir richard burtons intimate knowledge of the language to all who understand the ways of the east it is as witty and as full of what is popularly called chaff as it is possible to be there is not a dull page in it and it will especially please those who delight in the weird and supernatural the grotesque and the wild life  my husband only gives eleven of the best tales as it was thought the translation would prove more interesting in its abbreviated form  isabel burton  august 18th 1893   preface to the first 1870 edition  the genius of eastern nations says an established and respectable authority was from the earliest times much turned towards invention and the love of fiction the indians the persians and the arabians were all famous for their fables amongst the ancient greeks we hear of the ionian and milesian tales but they have now perished and from every account we hear of them appear to have been loose and indelicate similarly the classical dictionaries define milesiae fabulae to be licentious themes stories of an amatory or mirthful nature or ludicrous and indecent plays m deriege seems indeed to confound them with the moeurs du temps illustrated with artistic gouaches when he says une de ces fables milesiennes rehaussees de peintures que la corruption romaine recherchait alors avec une folle ardeur  my friend mr richard charnock fasl more correctly defines milesian fables to have been originally  certain tales or novels composed by aristides of miletus  gay in matter and graceful in manner they were translated into latin by the historian sisenna the friend of atticus and they had a great success at rome plutarch in his life of crassus tells us that after the defeat of carhes carrhae some milesiacs were found in the baggage of the roman prisoners the greek text and the latin translation have long been lost the only surviving fable is the tale of cupid and psychefn1 which apuleius calls milesius sermo and it makes us deeply regret the disappearance of the others besides this there are the remains of apollodorus and conon and a few traces to be found in pausanias athenaeus and the scholiasts  i do not therefore agree with blair with the dictionaries or with m deriege miletus the great maritime city of asiatic ionia was of old the meetingplace of the east and the west here the phoenician trader from the baltic would meet the hindu wandering to intra from extra gangem and the hyperborean would step on shore side by side with the nubian and the aethiop here was produced and published for the use of the then civilized world the genuine oriental apologue myth and tale combined which by amusing narrative and romantic adventure insinuates a lesson in morals or in humanity of which we often in our days must fail to perceive the drift the book of apuleius before quoted is subject to as many discoveries of recondite meaning as is rabelais as regards the licentiousness of the milesian fables this sign of semicivilization is still inherent in most eastern books of the description which we call light literature and the ancestral taleteller never collects a larger purse of coppers than when he relates the worst of his aurei but this looseness resulting from the separation of the sexes is accidental not necessary the following collection will show that it can be dispensed with and that there is such a thing as comparative purity in hindu literature the author indeed almost always takes the trouble to marry his hero and his heroine and if he cannot find a priest he generally adopts an exceedingly lefthand and caledonian but legal rite called gandharbavivahafn2  the work of apuleius as ample internal evidence shows is borrowed from the east the groundwork of the tale is the metamorphosis of lucius of corinth into an ass and the strange accidents which precede his recovering the human form  another old hindu storybook relates in the popular fairybook style the wondrous adventures of the hero and demigod the great gandharbasena that son of indra who was also the father of vikramajit the subject of this and another collection offended the ruler of the firmament by his fondness for a certain nymph and was doomed to wander over earth under the form of a donkey through the interposition of the gods however he was permitted to become a man during the hours of darkness thus comparing with the english legend              amundeville is lord by day           but the monk is lord by night  whilst labouring under this curse gandharbasena persuaded the king of dhara to give him a daughter in marriage but it unfortunately so happened that at the wedding hour he was unable to show himself in any but asinine shape after bathing however he proceeded to the assembly and hearing songs and music he resolved to give them a specimen of his voice  the guests were filled with sorrow that so beautiful a virgin should be married to a donkey they were afraid to express their feelings to the king but they could not refrain from smiling covering their mouths with their garments at length some one interrupted the general silence and said  o king is this the son of indra you have found a fine bridegroom you are indeed happy dont delay the marriage delay is improper in doing good we never saw so glorious a wedding it is true that we once heard of a camel being married to a jennyass when the ass looking up to the camel said bless me what a bridegroom and the camel hearing the voice of the ass exclaimed bless me what a musical voice in that wedding however the bride and the bridegroom were equal but in this marriage that such a bride should have such a bridegroom is truly wonderful  other brahmans then present said  o king at the marriage hour in sign of joy the sacred shell is blown but thou hast no need of that alluding to the donkeys braying  the women all cried out  o my motherfn3 what is this at the time of marriage to have an ass what a miserable thing what will he give that angelic girl in wedlock to a donkey  at length gandharbasena addressing the king in sanskrit urged him to perform his promise he reminded his future fatherinlaw that there is no act more meritorious than speaking truth that the mortal frame is a mere dress and that wise men never estimate the value of a person by his clothes he added that he was in that shape from the curse of his sire and that during the night he had the body of a man of his being the son of indra there could be no doubt  hearing the donkey thus speak sanskrit for it was never known that an ass could discourse in that classical tongue the minds of the people were changed and they confessed that although he had an asinine form he was unquestionably the son of indra the king therefore gave him his daughter in marriagefn4 the metamorphosis brings with it many misfortunes and strange occurrences and it lasts till fate in the authors hand restores the hero to his former shape and honours  gandharbasena is a quasihistorical personage who lived in the century preceding the christian era the story had therefore ample time to reach the ears of the learned african apuleius who was born ad 130  the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a baitalfn5   a vampire or evil spirit which animates dead bodies    is an old and thoroughly hindu repertory it is the rude beginning of that fictitious history which ripened to the arabian nights entertainments and which fostered by the genius of boccaccio produced the romance of the chivalrous days and its last development the novel    that proseepic of modern europe  composed in sanskrit the language of the gods alias the latin of india it has been translated into all the prakrit or vernacular and modern dialects of the great peninsula the reason why it has not found favour with the moslems is doubtless the highly polytheistic spirit which pervades it moreover the faithful had already a specimen of that style of composition this was the hitopadesa or advice of a friend which as a line in its introduction informs us was borrowed from an older book the panchatantra or five chapters it is a collection of apologues recited by a learned brahman vishnu sharma by name for the edification of his pupils the sons of an indian raja they have been adapted to or translated into a number of languages notably into pehlvi and persian syriac and turkish greek and latin hebrew and arabic and as the fables of pilpayfn6 are generally known by name at least to european litterateurs  voltaire remarksfn7 quand on fait reflexion que presque toute la terre a ete infatuee de pareils comes et quils ont fait leducation du genre humain on trouve les fables de pilpay lokman desope bien raisonnables these tales detached but strung together by artificial means  pearls with a thread drawn through them  are manifest precursors of the decamerone or ten days a modern italian critic describes the now classical fiction as a collection of one hundred of those novels which boccaccio is believed to have read out at the court of queen joanna of naples and which later in life were by him assorted together by a most simple and ingenious contrivance but the great florentine invented neither his stories nor his  plot if we may so call it he wrote in the middle of the fourteenth century 13448 when the west had borrowed many things from the east rhymesfn8 and romance lutes

central asia  the great kshatriyasoldier king vikramadityafn9 or vikramarka meaning the sun of heroism plays in india the part of king arthur and of harun alrashid further west he is a semihistorical personage the son of gandharbasena the donkey and the daughter of the king of dhara he was promised by his father the strength of a thousand male elephants when his sire died his grandfather the deity indra resolved that the babe should not be born upon which his mother stabbed herself but the tragic event duly happening during the ninth month vikram came into the world by himself and was carried to indra who pitied and adopted him and gave him a good education  the circumstances of his accession to the throne as will presently appear are differently told once however made king of malaya the modern malwa a province of western upper india he so distinguished himself that the hindu fabulists with their usual brave kind of speaking have made him bring the whole earth under the shadow of one umbrella  the last ruler of the race of mayura which reigned 318 years was rajapal he reigned 25 years but giving himself up to effeminacy his country was invaded by shakaditya a king from the highlands of kumaon vikramaditya in the fourteenth year of his reign pretended to espouse the cause of rajapal attacked and destroyed shakaditya and ascended the throne of delhi his capital was avanti or ujjayani the modern ujjain it was 13 kos 26 miles long by 18 miles wide an area of 468 square miles but a trifle in indian history he obtained the title of shakari foe of the shakas the sacae or scythians by his victories over that redoubtable race in the kali yug or iron age he stands highest amongst the hindu kings as the patron of learning nine persons under his patronage popularly known as the nine gems of science hold in india the honourable position of the seven wise men of greece  these learned persons wrote works in the eighteen original dialects from which say the hindus all the languages of the earth have been derivedfn10 dhanwantari enlightened the world upon the subjects of medicine and of incantations kshapanaka treated the primary elements amarasingha compiled a sanskrit dictionary and a philosophical treatise shankubetalabhatta composed comments and ghatakarpara a poetical work of no great merit the books of mihira are not mentioned varaha produced two works on astrology and one on arithmetic and bararuchi introduced certain improvements in grammar commented upon the incantations and wrote a poem in praise of king madhava  but the most celebrated of all the patronized ones was kalidasa his two dramas sakuntalafn11 and vikram and urvasifn12 have descended to our day besides which he produced a poem on the seasons a work on astronomy a poetical history of the gods and many other booksfn13  vikramaditya established the sambat era dating from ac 56 after a long happy and glorious reign he lost his life in a war with shalivahana king of pratisthana that monarch also left behind him an era called the  shaka beginning with ad 78 it is employed even now by the hindus in recording their births marriages and similar occasions  king vikramaditya was succeeded by his infant son vikramasena and father and son reigned over a period of 93 years at last the latter was supplanted by a devotee named samudrapala who entered into his body by miraculous means the usurper reigned 24 years and 2 months and the throne of delhi continued in the hands of his sixteen successors who reigned 641 years and 3 months vikramapala the last was slain in battle by tilakachandra king of vaharannahfn14  it is not pretended that the words of these hindu tales are preserved to the letter the question about the metamorphosis of cats into tigers for instance proceeded from a gem of learning in a university much nearer home than gaur similarly the learned and still living mgr gaume traite du saintesprit p 81 joins camerarius in the belief that serpents bite women rather than men and he quotes p 192 cornelius a lapide who informs us that the leopard is the produce of a lioness with a hyena or a bard  the merit of the old stories lies in their suggestiveness and in their general applicability i have ventured to remedy the conciseness of their language and to clothe the skeleton with flesh and blood                  to my uncle                               robert bagshaw of dovercourt                                        these tales     that will remind him of a land which              he knows so well        are affectionately inscribed                                   vikram and the vampire                  introduction  the sage bhavabhuti  eastern teller of these tales  after making his initiatory and propitiatory conge to ganesha lord of incepts informs the reader that this book is a string of fine pearls to be hung round the neck of human intelligence a fragrant flower to be borne on the turband of mental wisdom a jewel of pure gold which becomes the brow of all supreme minds and a handful of powdered rubies whose tonic effects will appear palpably upon the mental digestion of every patient finally that by aid of the lessons inculcated in the following pages man will pass happily through this world into the state of absorption where fables will be no longer required  he then teaches us how vikramaditya the brave became king of ujjayani  some nineteen centuries ago the renowned city of ujjayani witnessed the birth of a prince to whom was given the gigantic name vikramaditya even the sanskritspeaking people who are not usually pressed for time shortened it to vikram and a little further west it would infallibly have been docked down to vik  vikram was the second son of an old king gandharbasena concerning whom little favourable has reached posterity except that he became an ass married four queens and had by them six sons each of whom was more learned and powerful than the other it so happened that in course of time the father died thereupon his eldest heir who was known as shank succeeded to the carpet of rajaship and was instantly murdered by vikram his scorpion the hero of the following pagesfn15  by this act of vigour and manly decision which all younger brother princes should devoutly imitate vikram having obtained the title of bir or the brave made himself raja he began to rule well and the gods so favoured him that day by day his dominions increased at length he became lord of all india and having firmly established his government he instituted an eraan uncommon feat for a mere monarch especially when hereditary  the stepsfn16 says the historian which he took to arrive at that pinnacle of grandeur were these  the old king calling his two grandsons bhartarihari and vikramaditya gave them good counsel respecting their future learning they were told to master everything a certain way not to succeed in anything they were diligently to learn grammar the scriptures and all the religious sciences they were to become familiar with military tactics international law and music the riding of horses and elephants especially the latterthe driving of chariots and the use of the broadsword the bow and the mogdars or indian clubs they were ordered to be skilful in all kinds of games in leaping and running in besieging forts in forming and breaking bodies of troops they were to endeavour to excel in every princely quality to be cunning in ascertaining the power of an enemy how to make war to perform journeys to sit in the presence of the nobles to separate the different sides of a question to form alliances to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty to assign proper punishments to the wicked to exercise authority with perfect justice and to be liberal the boys were then sent to school and were placed under the care of excellent teachers where they became truly famous whilst under pupilage the eldest was allowed all the power necessary to obtain a knowledge of royal affairs and he was not invested with the regal office till in these preparatory steps he had given full satisfaction to his subjects who expressed high approval of his conduct  the two brothers often conversed on the duties of kings when the great vikramaditya gave the great bhartarihari the following valuable advicefn17  as indra during the four rainy months fills the earth with water so a king should replenish his treasury with money as surya the sun in warming the earth eight months does not scorch it so a king in drawing revenues from his people ought not to oppress them as vayu the wind surrounds and fills everything so the king by his officers and spies should become acquainted with the affairs and circumstances of his whole people as yama judges men without partiality or prejudice and punishes the guilty so should a king chastise without favour all offenders as varuna the regent of water binds with his pasha or divine noose his enemies so let a king bind every malefactor safely in prison as chandrafn18 the moon by his cheering light gives pleasure to all thus should a king by gifts and generosity make his people happy and as prithwi the earth sustains all alike so should a king feel an equal affection and forbearance towards every one  become a monarch vikram meditated deeply upon what is said of monarchsa king is fire and air he is both sun and moon he is the god of criminal justice he is the genius of wealth he is the regent of water he is the lord of the firmament he is a powerful divinity who appears in human shape he reflected with some satisfaction that the scriptures had made him absolute had left the lives and properties of all his subjects to his arbitrary will had pronounced him to be an incarnate deity and had threatened to punish with death even ideas derogatory to his honour  he punctually observed all the ordinances laid down by the author of the niti or institutes of government his night and day were divided into sixteen pahars or portions each one hour and a half and they were disposed of as follows   before dawn vikram was awakened by a servant appointed to this special duty he swallowed a thing allowed only to a khshatriya or warrior mithridatic every morning on the salivafn19 and he made the cooks taste every dish before he ate of it as soon as he had risen the pages in waiting repeated his splendid qualities and as he left his sleepingroom in full dress several brahmans rehearsed the praises of the gods presently he bathed worshipped his guardian deity again heard hymns drank a little water and saw alms distributed to the poor he ended this watch by auditing his accounts  next entering his court he placed himself amidst the assembly he was always armed when he received strangers and he caused even women to be searched for concealed weapons he was surrounded by so many spies and so artful that of a thousand no two ever told the same tale at the levee on his right sat his relations the brahmans and men of distinguished birth the other castes were on the left and close to him stood the ministers and those whom he delighted to consult afar in front gathered the bards chanting the praises of the gods and of the king also the charioteers elephanteers horsemen and soldiers of valour amongst the learned men in those assemblies there were ever some who were well instructed in all the scriptures and others who had studied in one particular school of philosophy and were acquainted only with the works on divine wisdom or with those on justice civil and criminal on the arts mineralogy or the practice of physic also persons cunning in all kinds of customs ridingmasters dancing masters teachers of good behaviour examiners tasters mimics mountebanks and others who all attended the court and awaited the kings commands he here pronounced judgment in suits of appeal his poets wrote about him                 the lord of lone splendour an instant suspends                his course at midnoon ere he westward descends                and brief are the moments our young monarch knows                devoted to pleasure or paid to repose  before the second sandhyafn20 or noon about the beginning of the third watch he recited the names of the gods bathed and broke his fast in his private room then rising from food he was amused by singers and dancing girls the labours of the day now became lighter after eating he retired repeating the name of his guardian deity visited the temples saluted the gods conversed with the priests and proceeded to receive and to distribute presents fifthly he discussed political questions with his ministers and councillors  on the announcement of the herald that it was the sixth watch about 2 or 3 pmvikram allowed himself to follow his own inclinations to regulate his family and to transact business of a private and personal nature  after gaining strength by rest he proceeded to review his troops examining the men saluting the officers and holding military councils at sunset he bathed a third time and performed the five sacraments of listening to a prelection of the veda making oblations to the manes sacrificing to fire in honour of the deities giving rice to dumb creatures and receiving guests with due ceremonies he spent the evening amidst a select company of wise learned and pious men conversing on different subjects and reviewing the business of the day  the night was distributed with equal care during the first portion vikram received the reports which his spies and envoys dressed in every disguise brought to him about his enemies against the latter he ceased not to use the five arts namelydividing the kingdom bribes mischiefmaking negotiations and bruteforce especially preferring the first two and the last his forethought and prudence taught him to regard all his nearest neighbours and their allies as hostile the powers beyond those natural enemies he considered friendly because they were the foes of his foes and all the remoter nations he looked upon as neutrals in a transitional or provisional state as it were till they became either his neighbours neighbours or his own neighbours that is to say his friends or his foes  this important duty finished he supped and at the end of the third watch he retired to sleep which was not allowed to last beyond three hours in the sixth watch he arose and purified himself the seventh was devoted to holding private consultations with his ministers and to furnishing the officers of government with requisite instructions the eighth or last watch was spent with the purohita or priest and with brahmans hailing the dawn with its appropriate rites he then bathed made the customary offerings and prayed in some unfrequented place near pure water  and throughout these occupations he bore in mind the duty of kings namelyto pursue every object till it be accomplished to succour all dependents and hospitably to receive guests however numerous he was generous to his subjects respecting taxes and kind of speech yet he was inexorable as death in the punishment of offenses he rarely hunted and he visited his pleasure gardens only on stated days he acted in his own dominions with justice he chastised foreign foes with rigour he behaved generously to brahmans and he avoided favouritism amongst his friends in war he never slew a suppliant a spectator a person asleep or undressed or anyone that showed fear whatever country he conquered offerings were presented to its gods and effects and money were given to the reverends but what benefited him most was his attention to the creature comforts of the nine gems of science those eminent men ate and drank themselves into fits of enthusiasm and ended by immortalizing their patrons name  become vikram the great he established his court at a delightful and beautiful location rich in the best of water the country was difficult of access and artificially made incapable of supporting a host of invaders but four great roads met near the city the capital was surrounded with durable ramparts having gates of defence and near it was a mountain fortress under the especial charge of a great captain  the metropolis was well garrisoned and provisioned and it surrounded the royal palace a noble building without as well as within grandeur seemed embodied there and prosperity had made it her own the nearer ground viewed from the terraces and pleasure pavilions was a lovely mingling of rock and mountain plain and valley field and fallow crystal lake and glittering stream the banks of the winding lavana were fringed with meads whose herbage pearly with morning dew afforded choicest grazing for the sacred cow and were dotted with perfumed clumps of botrees tamarinds and holy figs in one place vikram planted 100000 in a single orchard and gave them to his spiritual advisers the river valley separated the stream from a belt of forest growth which extended to a hill range dark with impervious jungle and cleared here and there for the cultivators village behind it rose another subrange wooded with a lower bush and already blue with air whilst in the background towered range upon range here rising abruptly into points and peaks there rampshaped or wall formed with sheer descents and all of light azure hue adorned with glories of silver and gold  after reigning for some years vikram the brave found himself at the age of thirty a staid and sober middleaged man he had several sonsdaughters are naught in indiaby his several wives and he had some paternal affection for nearly allexcept of course for his eldest son a youth who seemed to conduct himself as though he had a claim to the succession in fact the king seemed to have taken up his abode for life at ujjayani when suddenly he bethought himself i must visit those countries of whose names i am ever hearing the fact is he had determined to spy out in disguise the lands of all his foes and to find the best means of bringing against them his formidable army                                   we now learn how bhartari raja becomes regent of ujjayani  having thus resolved vikram the brave gave the government into the charge of a younger brother bhartari raja and in the garb of a religious mendicant accompanied by dharma dhwaj his second son a youth bordering on the age of puberty he began to travel from city to city and from forest to forest  the regent was of a settled melancholic turn of mind having lost in early youth a very peculiar wife one day whilst out hunting he happened to pass a funeral pyre upon which a brahmans widow had just become sati a holy woman with the greatest fortitude on his return home he related the adventure to sita rani his spouse and she at once made reply that virtuous women die with their husbands killed by the fire of grief not by the flames of the pile to prove her truth the prince after an affectionate farewell rode forth to the chase and presently sent back the suite with his robes torn and stained to report his accidental death sita perished upon the spot and the widower remained inconsolablefor a time  he led the dullest of lives and took to himself sundry spouses all equally distinguished for birth beauty and modesty like his brother he performed all the proper devoirs of a raja rising before the day to finish his ablutions to worship the gods and to do due obeisance to the brahmans he then ascended the throne to judge his people according to the shastra carefully keeping in subjection lust anger avarice folly drunkenness and pride preserving himself from being seduced by the love of gaming and of the chase restraining his desire for dancing singing and playing on musical instruments and refraining from sleep during daytime from wine from molesting men of worth from dice from putting human beings to death by artful means from useless travelling and from holding any one guilty without the commission of a crime his levees were in a hall decently splendid and he was distinguished only by an umbrella of peacocks feathers he received all complainants petitioners and presenters of offenses with kind looks and soft words he united to himself the seven or eight wise councillors and the sober and virtuous secretary that formed the high cabinet of his royal brother and they met in some secret lonely spot as a mountain a terrace a bower or a forest whence women parrots and other talkative birds were carefully excluded  and at the end of this useful and somewhat laborious day he retired to his private apartments and after listening to spiritual songs and to soft music he fell asleep sometimes he would summon his brothers nine gems of science and give ear to their learned discourses but it was observed that the viceroy reserved this exercise for nights when he was troubled with insomniathe words of wisdom being to him an infallible remedy for that disorder  thus passed onwards his youth doing nothing that it could desire forbidden all pleasures because they were unprincely and working in the palace harder than in the paupers hut having however fortunately for himself few predilections and no imagination he began to pride himself upon being a philosopher much business from an early age had dulled his wits which were never of the most brilliant and in the steadily increasing torpidity of his spirit he traced the germs of that quietude which forms the highest happiness of man in this storm of matter called the world he therefore allowed himself but one friend of his soul he retained i have said his brothers seven or eight ministers he was constant in attendance upon the brahman priests who officiated at the palace and who kept the impious from touching sacred property and he was courteous to the commanderinchief who directed his warriors to the officers of justice who inflicted punishment upon offenders and to the lords of towns varying in number from one to a thousand but he placed an intimate of his own in the high position of confidential councillor the ambassador to regulate war and peace  mahipala was a person of noble birth endowed with shining abilities popular dexterous in business acquainted with foreign parts famed for eloquence and intrepidity and as menu the lawgiver advises remarkably handsome  bhartari raja as i have said became a quietist and a philosopher but kamafn21 the bright god who exerts his sway over the three worlds heaven and earth and grewsome hadesfn22 had marked out the prince once more as the victim of his blossom tipped shafts and his flowery bow how indeed could he hope to escape the doom which has fallen equally upon brahma the creator vishnu the preserver and dreadful shiva the threeeyed destroyerfn23  by reason of her exceeding beauty her face was a full moon shining in the clearest sky her hair was the purple cloud of autumn when gravid with rain it hangs low over earth and her complexion mocked the pale waxen hue of the largeflowered jasmine her eyes were those of the timid antelope her lips were as red as those of the pomegranates bud and when they opened from them distilled a fountain of ambrosia her neck was like a pigeons her hand the pink lining of the conchshell her waist a leopards her feet the softest lotuses in a word a model of grace and loveliness was dangalah rani raja bhartaris last and youngest wife  the warrior laid down his arms before her the politician spoke out every secret in her presence the religious prince would have slaughtered a cowthat sole unforgivable sinto save one of her eyelashes the absolute king would not drink a cup of water without her permission the staid philosopher the sober quietist to win from her the shadow of a smile would have danced before her like a singinggirl so desperately enamoured became bhartari raja  it is written however that love alas breeds not love and so it happened to the regent the warmth of his affection instead of animating his wife annoyed her his protestations wearied her his vows gave her the headache and his caresses were a colic that made her blood run cold of course the prince perceived nothing being lost in wonder and admiration of the beautys coyness and coquetry and as women must give away their hearts whether asked or not so the lovely dangalah rani lost no time in lavishing all the passion of her idle soul upon mahipala the handsome ambassador of peace and war by this means the three were happy and were contented their felicity however being built on a rotten foundation could not long endure it soon ended in the following extraordinary way  in the city of ujjayanifn24 within sight of the palace dwelt a brahman and his wife who being old and poor and having nothing else to do had applied themselves to the practice of austere devotionfn25 they fasted and refrained from drink they stood on their heads and held their arms for weeks in the air they prayed till their knees were like pads they disciplined themselves with scourges of wire and they walked about unclad in the cold season and in summer they sat within a circle of flaming wood till they became the envy and admiration of all the plebeian gods that inhabit the lower heavens in fine as a reward for their exceeding piety the venerable pair received at the hands of a celestial messenger an apple of the tree kalpavriksha a fruit which has the virtue of conferring eternal life upon him that tastes it  scarcely had the god disappeared when the brahman opening his toothless mouth prepared to eat the fruit of immortality then his wife addressed him in these words shedding copious tears the while  to die o man is a passing pain to be poor is an interminable anguish surely our present lot is the penalty of some great crime committed by us in a past state of beingfn26 callest thou this state life better we die at once and so escape the woes of the world  hearing these words the brahman sat undecided with open jaws and eyes fixed upon the apple presently he found tongue i have accepted the fruit and have brought it here but having heard thy speech my intellect hath wasted away now i will do whatever thou pointest out  the wife resumed her discourse which had been interrupted by a more than usually copious flow of tears moreover o husband we are old and what are the enjoyments of the stricken in years truly quoth the poet                  die loved in youth not hated in age  if that fruit could have restored thy dimmed eyes and deaf ears and blunted taste and warmth of love i had not spoken to thee thus  after which the brahman threw away the apple to the great joy of his wife who felt a natural indignation at the prospect of seeing her goodman become immortal whilst she still remained subject to the laws of death but she concealed this motive in the depths of her thought enlarging as women are apt to do upon everything but the truth and she spoke with such success that the priest was about to toss in his rage the heavenly fruit into the fire reproaching the gods as if by sending it they had done him an injury then the wife snatched it out of his hand and telling him it was too precious to be wasted bade him arise and gird his loins and wend him to the regents palace and offer him the fruitas king vikram was absentwith a right reverend brahmanical benediction she concluded with impressing upon her unworldly husband the necessity of requiring a large sum of money as a return for his inestimable gift by this means she said thou mayst promote thy present and future welfarefn27  then the brahman went forth and standing in the presence of the raja told him all things touching the fruit concluding with o mighty prince vouchsafe to accept this tribute and bestow wealth upon me i shall be happy in your living long  bhartari raja led the supplicant into an inner strongroom where stood heaps of the finest golddust and bade him carry away all that he could this the priest did not forgetting to fill even his eloquent and toothless mouth with the precious metal having dismissed the devotee groaning under the burden the regent entered the apartments of his wives and having summoned the beautiful queen dangalah rani gave her the fruit and said eat this light of my eyes this fruitjoy of my heartwill make thee everlastingly young and beautiful  the pretty queen placing both hands upon her husbands bosom kissed his eyes and lips and sweetly smiling on his facefor great is the guile of womenwhispered eat it thyself dear one or at least share it with me for what is life and what is youth without the presence of those we love but the raja whose heart was melted by these unusual words put her away tenderly and having explained that the fruit would serve for only one person departed  whereupon the pretty queen sweetly smiling as before slipped the precious present into her pocket when the regent was transacting business in the hall of audience she sent for the ambassador who regulated war and peace and presented him with the apple in a manner at least as tender as that with which it had been offered to her  then the ambassador after slipping the fruit into his pocket also retired from the presence of the pretty queen and meeting lakha one of the maids of honour explained to her its wonderful power and gave it to her as a token of his love but the maid of honour being an ambitious girl determined that the fruit was a fit present to set before the regent in the absence of the king bhartari raja accepted it bestowed on her great wealth and dismissed her with many thanks  he then took up the apple and looked at it with eyes brimful of tears for he knew the whole extent of his misfortune his heart ached he felt a loathing for the world and he said with sighs and groansfn28  of what value are these delusions of wealth and affection whose sweetness endures for a moment and becomes eternal bitterness love is like the drunkards cup delicious is the first drink palling are the draughts that succeed it and most distasteful are the dregs what is life but a restless vision of imaginary pleasures and of real pains from which the only waking is the terrible day of death the affection of this world is of no use since in consequence of it we fall at last into hell for which reason it is best to practice the austerities of religion that the deity may bestow upon us hereafter that happiness which he refuses to us here  thus did bhartari raja determine to abandon the world but before setting out for the forest he could not refrain from seeing the queen once more so hot was the flame which kama had kindled in his heart he therefore went to the apartments of his women and having caused dangalah rani to be summoned he asked her what had become of the fruit which he had given to her she answered that according to his command she had eaten it upon which the regent showed her the apple and she beholding it stood aghast unable to make any reply the raja gave careful orders for her beheading he then went out and having had the fruit washed ate it he quitted the throne to be a jogi or religious mendicant and without communicating with any one departed into the jungle there he became such a devotee that death had no power over him and he is wandering still but some say that he was duly absorbed into the essence of the deity                                   we are next told how the valiant vikram returned to his own country  thus vikrams throne remained empty when the news reached king indra regent of the lower firmament and protector of earthly monarchs he sent prithwi pala a fierce giantfn29 to defend the city of ujjayani till such time as its lawful master might reappear and the guardian used to keep watch and ward night and day over his trust  in less than a year the valorous raja vikram became thoroughly tired of wandering about the woods half dressed now suffering from famine then exposed to the attacks of wild beasts and at all times very ill at ease he reflected also that he was not doing his duty to his wives and children that the heirapparent would probably make the worst use of the parental absence and finally that his subjects deprived of his fatherly care had been left in the hands of a man who for ought he could say was not worthy of the high trust he had also spied out all the weak points of friend and foe whilst these and other equally weighty considerations were hanging about the rajas mind he heard a rumour of the state of things spread abroad that bhartari the regent having abdicated his throne had gone away into the forest then quoth vikram to his sonwe have ended our wayfarings now let us turn our steps homewards  the gong was striking the mysterious hour of midnight as the king and the young prince approached the principal gate and they were pushing through it when a monstrous figure rose up before them and called out with a fearful voice who are ye and where are ye going  stand and deliver your names  i am raja vikram rejoined the king half choked with rage and i am come to mine own city who art thou that darest to stop or stay me  that question is easily answered cried prithwi pala the giant in his roaring voice the gods have sent me to protect ujjayani if thou be really raja vikram prove thyself a man first fight with me and then return to thine own  the warrior king cried sadhu wanting nothing better he girt his girdle tight round his loins summoned his opponent into the empty space beyond the gate told him to stand on guard and presently began to devise some means of closing with or running in upon him the giants fists were large as watermelons and his knotted arms whistled through the air like falling trees threatening fatal blows besides which the rajas head scarcely reached the giants stomach and the latter each time he struck out whooped so abominably loud that no human nerves could remain unshaken  at last vikrams good luck prevailed the giants left foot slipped and the hero seizing his antagonists other leg began to trip him up at the same moment the young prince hastening to his parents assistance jumped viciously upon the enemys naked toes by their united exertions they brought him to the ground when the son sat down upon his stomach making himself as weighty as he well could whilst the father climbing up to the monsters throat placed himself astride upon it and pressing both thumbs upon his eyes threatened to blind him if he would not yield  then the giant modifying the bellow of his voice cried out   o raja thou hast overthrown me and i grant thee thy life  surely thou art mad monster replied the king in jeering tone half laughing half angry to whom grantest thou life if i desire it i can kill thee how then cost thou talk about granting me my life  vikram of ujjayani said the giant be not too proud i will save thee from a nearly impending death only hearken to the tale which i have to tell thee and use thy judgment and act upon it so shalt thou rule the world free from care and live without danger and die happily  proceed quoth the raja after a moments thought dismounting from the giants throat and beginning to listen with all his ears  the giant raised himself from the ground and when in a sitting posture began in solemn tones to speak as follows  in short the history of the matter is that three men were born in this same city of ujjayani in the same lunar mansion in the same division of the great circle described upon the ecliptic and in the same period of time you the first were born in the house of a king the second was an oilmans son who was slain by the third a jogi or anchorite who kills all he can wafting the sweet scent of human sacrifice to the nostrils of durga goddess of destruction moreover the holy man after compassing the death of the oilmans son has suspended him head downwards from a mimosa tree in a cemetery he is now anxiously plotting thy destruction he hath murdered his own child   and how came an anchorite to have a child asked raja vikram incredulously  that is what i am about to tell thee replied the giant in the good days of thy generous father gandharbasena as the court was taking its pleasure in the forest they saw a devotee or rather a devotees head protruding from a hole in the ground the white ants had surrounded his body with a case of earth and had made their home upon his skin all kinds of insects and small animals crawled up and down the face yet not a muscle moved wasps had hung their nests to its temples and scorpions wandered in and out of the matted and clotted hair yet the hermit felt them not he spoke to no one he received no gifts and had it not been for the opening of his nostrils as he continually inhaled the pungent smoke of a thorn fire man would have deemed him dead such were his religious austerities  thy father marvelled much at the sight and rode home in profound thought that evening as he sat in the hall of audience he could speak of nothing but the devotee and his curiosity soon rose to such a pitch that he proclaimed about the city a reward of one hundred gold pieces to any one that could bring to court this anchorite of his own free will  shortly afterwards vasantasena a singing and dancing girl more celebrated for wit and beauty than for sagesse or discretion appeared before thy sire and offered for the petty inducement of a gold bangle to bring the anchorite into the palace carrying a baby on his shoulder  the king hearing her speak was astonished gave her a betel leaf in token that he held her to her promise and permitted her to depart which she did with a laugh of triumph  vasantasena went directly to the jungle where she found the pious man faint with thirst shriveled with hunger and half dead with heat and cold she cautiously put out the fire then having prepared a confection she approached from behind and rubbed upon his lips a little of the sweetmeat which he licked up with great relish thereupon she made more and gave it to him after two days of this generous diet he gained some strength and on the third as he felt a finger upon his mouth he opened his eyes and said why hast thou come here  the girl who had her story in readiness replied i am the daughter of a deity and have practiced religious observances in the heavenly regions i have now come into this forest and the devotee who began to think how much more pleasant is such society than solitude asked her where her hut was and requested to be led there  then vasantasena having unearthed the holy man and compelled him to purify himself led him to the abode which she had caused to be built for herself in the wood she explained its luxuries by the nature of her vow which bound her to indulge in costly apparel in food with six flavours and in every kind of indulgencefn30 in course of time the hermit learned to follow her example he gave up inhaling smoke and he began to eat and drink as a daily occupation  at length kama began to trouble him briefly the saint and saintess were made man and wife by the simple form of matrimony called the gandharbavivahafn31 and about ten months afterwards a son was born to them thus the anchorite came to have a child  remained vasantasenas last feat some months passed then she said to the devotee her husband oh saint let us now having finished our devotions perform a pilgrimage to some sacred place that all the sins of our bodies may be washed away after which we will die and depart into everlasting happiness cajoled by these speeches the hermit mounted his child upon his shoulder and followed her where she wentdirectly into raja gandharbasenas palace  when the king and the ministers and the officers and the courtiers saw vasantasena and her spouse carrying the baby they recognized her from afar the raja exclaimed lo this is the very singing girl who went forth to bring back the devotee and all replied o great monarch thou speakest truly this is the very same woman and be pleased to observe that whatever things she having asked leave to undertake went forth to do all these she hath done then gathering around her they asked her all manner of questions as if the whole matter had been the lightest and the most laughable thing in the world  but the anchorite having heard the speeches of the king and his courtiers thought to himself they have done this for the purpose of taking away the fruits of my penance cursing them all with terrible curses and taking up his child he left the hall thence he went to the forest slaughtered the innocent and began to practice austerities with a view to revenge that hour and having slain his child he will attempt thy life his prayers have been heard in the first place they deprived thee of thy father secondly they cast enmity between thee and thy brother thus dooming him to an untimely end thirdly they are now working thy ruin the anchorites design is to offer up a king and a kings son to his patroness durga and by virtue of such devotional act he will obtain the sovereignty of the whole world  but i have promised o vikram to save thee if such be the will of fortune from impending destruction therefore hearken well unto my words distrust them that dwell amongst the dead and remember that it is lawful and right to strike off his head that would slay thee so shalt thou rule the universal earth and leave behind thee an immortal name  suddenly prithwi pala the giant ceased speaking and disappeared vikram and his son then passed through the city gates feeling their limbs to be certain that no bones were broken and thinking over the scene that had occurred                                   we now are informed how the valiant king vikram met with the vampire  it was the spring season when the raja returned and the holi festivalfn32 caused dancing and singing in every house ujjayani was extraordinarily happy and joyful at the return of her ruler who joined in her gladness with all his kingly heart the faces and dresses of the public were red and yellow with gulal and abirperfumed powdersfn33which were sprinkled upon one another in token of merriment musicians deafened the citizens ears dancing girls performed till ready to faint with fatigue the manufacturers of comfits made their fortunes and the nine gems of science celebrated the auspicious day with the most long winded odes the royal hero decked in regal attire and attended by many thousands of state palanquins glittering with their various ornaments and escorted by a suite of a hundred kingly personages with their martial array of the four hosts of cavalry elephants chariots and infantry and accompanied by amazon girls lovely as the suite of the gods himself a personification of majesty bearing the white parasol of dominion with a golden staff and tassels began once more to reign  after the first pleasures of return the king applied himself unremittingly to good government and to eradicating the abuses which had crept into the administration during the period of his wanderings  mindful of the wise saying if the rajadid not punish the guilty the stronger would roast the weaker like a fish on the spit he began the work of reform with an iron hand he confiscated the property of a councillor who had the reputation of taking bribes he branded the forehead of a sudra or servile man whose breath smelt of ardent spirits and a goldsmith having been detected in fraud he ordered him to be cut in shreds with razors as the law in its mercy directs in the case of a notorious evilspeaker he opened the back of his head and had his tongue drawn through the wound a few murderers he burned alive on iron beds praying the while that vishnu might have mercy upon their souls his spies were ordered as the shastra called the prince advises to mix with robbers and thieves with a view of leading them into situations where they might most easily be entrapped and once or twice when the fellows were too wary he seized them and their relations and impaled them all thereby conclusively proving without any mistake that he was king of earth  with the sex feminine he was equally severe a woman convicted of having poisoned an elderly husband in order to marry a younger man was thrown to the dogs which speedily devoured her he punished simple infidelity by cutting off the offenders nosean admirable practice which is not only a severe penalty to the culprit but also a standing warning to others and an efficient preventative to any recurrence of the fault faithlessness combined with bad example or brazenfacedness was further treated by being led in solemn procession through the bazar mounted on a diminutive and cropeared donkey with the face turned towards the crupper after a few such examples the women of ujjayani became almost modest it is the fault of man when they are not tolerably well behaved in one point at least  every day as vikram sat upon the judgmentseat trying causes and punishing offenses he narrowly observed the speech the gestures and the countenances of the various criminals and litigants and their witnesses ever suspecting women as i have said and holding them to be the root of all evil he never failed when some sin or crime more horrible than usual came before him to ask the accused who is she and the suddenness of the question often elicited the truth by accident for there can be nothing thoroughly and entirely bad unless a woman is at the bottom of it and knowing this raja vikram made certain notable hits under the most improbable circumstances which had almost given him a reputation for omniscience but this is easily explained a man intent upon squaring the circle will see squares in circles wherever he looks and sometimes he will find them  in disputed cases of money claims the king adhered strictly to established practice and consulted persons learned in the law he seldom decided a cause on his own judgment and he showed great temper and patience in bearing with rough language from irritated plaintiffs and defendants from the infirm and from old men beyond eighty that humble petitioners might not be baulked in having access to the fountain of justice he caused an iron box to be suspended by a chain from the windows of his sleeping apartment every morning he ordered the box to be opened before him and listened to all the placets at full length even in this simple process he displayed abundant cautiousness for having forgotten what little of the humanities he had mastered in his youth he would hand the paper to a secretary whose business it was to read it out before him after which operation the man of letters was sent into an inner room and the petition was placed in the hands of a second scribe once it so happened by the bungling of the deceitful kayasthsclerks that an important difference was found to occur in the same sheet so upon strict inquiry one secretary lost his ears and the other his right hand after this petitions were rarely if ever falsified  the raja vikram also lost no time in attacking the cities and towns and villages of his enemies but the people rose to a man against him and hewing his army to pieces with their weapons vanquished him this took place so often that he despaired of bringing all the earth under the shadow of his umbrella  at length on one occasion when near a village he listened to a conversation of the inhabitants a woman having baked some cakes was giving them to her child who leaving the edges would eat only the middle on his asking for another cake she cried this boys way is like vikrams in his attempt to conquer the world on his inquiring mother why what am i doing and what has vikram done  thou my boy she replied throwing away the outside of the cake eatest the middle only vikram also in his ambition without subduing the frontiers before attacking the towns invades the heart of the country and lays it waste on that account both the townspeople and others rising close upon him from the frontiers to the centre and destroy his army that is his folly  vikram took notice of the womans words he strengthened his army and resumed his attack on the provinces and cities beginning with the frontiers reducing the outer towns and stationing troops in the intervals thus he proceeded regularly with his invasions after a respite adopting the same system and marshalling huge armies he reduced in regular course each kingdom and province till he became monarch of the whole world  it so happened that one day as vikram the brave sat upon the judgmentseat a young merchant by name mal deo who had lately arrived at ujjayani with loaded camels and elephants and with the reputation of immense wealth entered the palace court having been received with extreme condescension he gave into the kings hand a fruit which he had brought in his own and then spreading a prayer carpet on the floor he sat down presently after a quarter of an hour he arose and went away when he had gone the king reflected in his mind under this disguise perhaps is the very man of whom the giant spoke suspecting this he did not eat the fruit but calling the master of the household he gave the present to him ordering him to keep it in a very careful manner the young merchant however continued every day to court the honour of an interview each time presenting a similar gift  by chance one morning raja vikram went attended by his ministers to see his stables at this time the young merchant also arrived there and in the usual manner placed a fruit in the royal hand as the king was thoughtfully tossing it in the air it accidentally fell from his fingers to the ground then the monkey who was tethered amongst the horses to draw calamities from their headsfn34 snatched it up and tore it to pieces whereupon a ruby of such size and water came forth that the king and his ministers beholding its brilliancy gave vent to expressions of wonder  quoth vikram to the young merchant severelyfor his suspicions were now thoroughly rousedwhy hast thou given to us all this wealth  o great king replied mal deo demurely it is written in the scriptures shastra of ceremony that we must not go empty handed into the presence of the following persons namely rajas spiritual teachers judges young maidens and old women whose daughters we would marry but why o vikram cost thou speak of one ruby only since in each of the fruits which i have laid at thy feet there is a similar jewel having heard this speech the king said to the master of his household bring all the fruits which i have entrusted to thee the treasurer on receiving the royal command immediately brought them and having split them there was found in each one a ruby one and all equally perfect in size and water raja vikram beholding such treasures was excessively pleased having sent for a lapidary he ordered him to examine the rubies saying we cannot take anything with us out of this world virtue is a noble quality to possess here belowso tell justly what is the value of each of these gemsfn35  to so moral a speech the lapidary replied  maharajafn36 thou hast said truly whoever possesses virtue possesses everything virtue indeed accompanies us always and is of advantage in both worlds hear o great king each gem is perfect in colour quality and beauty if i were to say that the value of each was ten million millions of suvarnas gold pieces even then thou couldst not understand its real worth in fact each ruby would buy one of the seven regions into which the earth is divided  the king on hearing this was delighted although his suspicions were not satisfied and having bestowed a robe of honour upon the lapidary dismissed him thereon taking the young merchants hand he led him into the palace seated him upon his own carpet in presence of the court and began to say my entire kingdom is not worth one of these rubies tell me how it is that thou who buyest and sellest hast given me such and so many pearls  mal deo replied o great king the speaking of matters like the following in public is not right these thingsprayers spells drugs good qualities household affairs the eating of forbidden food and the evil we may have heard of our neighbourshould not be discussed in full assembly privately i will disclose to thee my wishes this is the way of the world when an affair comes to six ears it does not remain secret if a matter is confided to four ears it may escape further hearing and if to two ears even brahma the creator does not know it how then can any rumour of it come to man  having heard this speech raja vikram took mal deo aside and began to ask him saying o generous man you have given me so many rubies and even for a single day you have not eaten food with me i am exceedingly ashamed tell me what you desire  raja said the young merchant i am not mal deo but shanta shilfn37 a devotee i am about to perform spells incantations and magical rites on the banks of the river godavari in a large smashana a cemetery where bodies are burned by this means the eight powers of nature will all become mine this thing i ask of you as alms that you and the young prince dharma dhwaj will pass one night with me doing my bidding by you remaining near me my incantations will be successful  the valiant vikram nearly started from his seat at the word cemetery but like a ruler of men he restrained his face from expressing his feelings and he presently replied good we will come tell us on what day  you are to come to me said the devotee armed but without followers on the monday evening the 14th of the dark half of the month bhadrafn38 the raja said do you go your ways we will certainly come in this manner having received a promise from the king and having taken leave the devotee returned to his house thence he repaired to the temple and having made preparations and taken all the necessary things he went back into the cemetery and sat down to his ceremonies  the valiant vikram on the other hand retired into an inner apartment to consult his own judgment about an adventure with which for fear of ridicule he was unwilling to acquaint even the most trustworthy of his ministers  in due time came the evening moons day the 14th of the dark half of the month bhadra as the short twilight fell gloomily on earth the warrior king accompanied by his son with turbandends tied under their chins and with trusty blades tucked under their arms ready for foes human bestial or devilish slipped out unseen through the palace wicket and took the road leading to the cemetery on the river bank  dark and drear was the night urged by the furious blast of the lingering winterrains masses of bistrecoloured cloud like the forms of unwieldy beasts rolled heavily over the firmament plain whenever the crescent of the young moon rising from an horizon sable as the sad tamalas huefn39 glanced upon the wayfarers it was no brighter than the fine tip of an elephants tusk protruding from the muddy wave a heavy storm was impending big drops fell in showers from the forest trees as they groaned under the blast and beneath the gloomy avenue the clayey ground gleamed ghastly white as the raja and his son advanced a faint ray of light like the line of pure gold streaking the dark surface of the touchstone caught their eyes and directed their footsteps towards the cemetery  when vikram came upon the open space on the riverbank where corpses were burned he hesitated for a moment to tread its impure ground but seeing his son undismayed he advanced boldly trampling upon remnants of bones and only covering his mouth with his turbandend  presently at the further extremity of the smashana or burning ground appeared a group by the lurid flames that flared and flickered round the halfextinguished funeral pyres with remnants of their dreadful loads raja vikram and dharma dhwaj could note the several features of the illomened spot there was an outer circle of hideous bestial forms tigers were roaring and elephants were trumpeting wolves whose foul hairy coats blazed with sparks of bluish phosphoric light were devouring the remnants of human bodies foxes jackals and hyenas were disputing over their prey whilst bears were chewing the livers of children the space within was peopled by a multitude of fiends there were the subtle bodies of men that had escaped their grosser frames prowling about the charnel ground where their corpses had been reduced to ashes or hovering in the air waiting till the new bodies which they were to animate were made ready for their reception the spirits of those that had been foully slain wandered about with gashed limbs and skeletons whose mouldy bones were held together by bits of blackened sinew followed them as the murderer does his victim malignant witches with shriveled skins horrid eyes and distorted forms crawled and crouched over the earth whilst spectres and goblins now stood motionless and tall as lofty palm trees then as if in fits leaped danced and tumbled before their evocator the air was filled with shrill and strident cries with the fitful moaning of the stormwind with the hooting of the owl with the jackals long wild cry and with the hoarse gurgling of the swollen river from whose banks the earthslip thundered in its fall  in the midst of all close to the fire which lit up his evil countenance sat shantashil the jogi with the banner that denoted his calling and his magic staff planted in the ground behind him he was clad in the ochrecoloured loinwrap of his class from his head streamed long tangled locks of hair like horsehair his black body was striped with lines of chalk and a girdle of thighbones encircled his waist his face was smeared with ashes from a funeral pyre and his eyes fixed as those of a statue gleamed from this mask with an infernal light of hate his cheeks were shaven and he had not forgotten to draw the horizontal sectarian mark but this was of blood and vikram as he drew near saw that he was playing upon a human skull with two shank bones making music for the horrid revelry  now raja vikram as has been shown by his encounter with indras watchman was a bold prince and he was cautious as he was brave the sight of a human being in the midst of these terrors raised his mettle he determined to prove himself a hero and feeling that the critical moment was now come he hoped to rid himself and his house forever of the family curse that hovered over them  for a moment he thought of the giants words and remember that it is lawful and right to strike off his head that would slay thee a stroke with his good sword might at once and effectually put an end to the danger but then he remembered that he had passed his royal word to do the devotees bidding that night besides he felt assured that the hour for action had not yet sounded  these reflections having passed through his mind with the rapid course of a star that has lost its honoursfn40 vikram courteously saluted shantashil the jogi briefly replied come sit down both of ye the father and son took their places by no means surprised or frightened by the devil dances before and around them presently the valiant raja reminded the devotee that he was come to perform his promise and lastly asked what commands are there for us  the jogi replied o king since you have come just perform one piece of business about two kosfn41 hence in a southerly direction there is another place where dead bodies are burned and in that place is a mimosa tree on which a body is hanging bring it to me immediately  raja vikram took his sons hand unwilling to leave him in such company and catching up a firebrand went rapidly away in the proper direction he was now certain that shantashil was the anchorite who enraged by his father had resolved his destruction and his uppermost thought was a firm resolve to breakfast upon his enemy ere his enemy could dine upon him he muttered this old saying as he went whilst the tomtoming of the anchorite upon the skull resounded in his ears and the devilcrowd which had held its peace during his meeting with shantashil broke out again in an infernal din of whoops and screams yells and laughter  the darkness of the night was frightful the gloom deepened till it was hardly possible to walk the clouds opened their fountains raining so that you would say they could never rain again lightning blazed forth with more than the light of day and the roar of the thunder caused the earth to shake baleful gleams tipped the black cones of the trees and fitfully scampered like fireflies over the waste unclean goblins dogged the travellers and threw themselves upon the ground in their path and obstructed them in a thousand different ways huge snakes whose mouths distilled blood and black venom kept clinging around their legs in the roughest part of the road till they were persuaded to loose their hold either by the sword or by reciting a spell in fact there were so many horrors and such a tumult and noise that even a brave man would have faltered yet the king kept on his way  at length having passed over somehow or other a very difficult road the raja arrived at the smashana or burning place pointed out by the jogi suddenly he sighted the tree where from root to top every branch and leaf was in a blaze of crimson flame and when he still dauntless advanced towards it a clamour continued to be raised and voices kept crying kill them kill them seize them seize them take care that they do not get away let them scorch themselves to cinders let them suffer the pains of patalafn42  far from being terrified by this state of things the valiant raja increased in boldness seeing a prospect of an end to his adventure approaching the tree he felt that the fire did not burn him and so he sat there for a while to observe the body which hung head downwards from a branch a little above him  its eyes which were wide open were of a greenishbrown and never twinkled its hair also was brownfn43 and brown was its facethree several shades which notwithstanding approached one another in an unpleasant way as in an overdried cocoanut its body was thin and ribbed like a skeleton or a bamboo framework and as it held on to a bough like a flying foxfn44 by the toe tips its drawn muscles stood out as if they were ropes of coin blood it appeared to have none or there would have been a decided determination of that curious juice to the head and as the raja handled its skin it felt icy cold and clammy as might a snake the only sign of life was the whisking of a ragged little tail much resembling a goats  judging from these signs the brave king at once determined the creature to be a baitala vampire for a short time he was puzzled to reconcile the appearance with the words of the giant who informed him that the anchorite had hung the oilmans son to a tree but soon he explained to himself the difficulty remembering the exceeding cunning of jogis and other reverend men and determining that his enemy the better to deceive him had doubtless altered the shape and form of the young oilmans body  with this idea vikram was pleased saying my trouble has been productive of fruit remained the task of carrying the vampire to shantashil the devotee having taken his sword the raja fearlessly climbed the tree and ordering his son to stand away from below clutched the vampires hair with one hand and with the other struck such a blow of the sword that the bough was cut and the thing fell heavily upon the ground immediately on falling it gnashed its teeth and began to utter a loud wailing cry like the screams of an infant in pain vikram having heard the sound of its lamentations was pleased and began to say to himself this devil must be alive then nimbly sliding down the trunk he made a captive of the body and asked  who art thou  scarcely however had the words passed the royal lips when the vampire slipped through the fingers like a worm and uttering a loud shout of laughter rose in the air with its legs uppermost and as before suspended itself by its toes to another bough and there it swung to and fro moved by the violence of its cachinnation  decidedly this is the young oilman exclaimed the raja after he had stood for a minute or two with mouth open gazing upwards and wondering what he should do next presently he directed dharma dhwaj not to lose an instant in laying hands upon the thing when it next might touch the ground and then he again swarmed up the tree having reached his former position he once more seized the baitals hair and with all the force of his armsfor he was beginning to feel really angryhe tore it from its hold and dashed it to the ground saying o wretch tell me who thou art  then as before the raja slid deftly down the trunk and hurried to the aid of his son who in obedience to orders had fixed his grasp upon the vampires neck then too as before the vampire laughing aloud slipped through their fingers and returned to its danglingplace  to fail twice was too much for raja vikrams temper which was right kingly and somewhat hot this time he bade his son strike the baitals head with his sword then more like a wounded bear of himalaya than a prince who had established an era he hurried up the tree and directed a furious blow with his sabre at the vampires lean and calfless legs the violence of the stroke made its toes loose their hold of the bough and when it touched the ground dharma dhwajs blade fell heavily upon its matted brown hair but the blows appeared to have lighted on ironwoodto judge at least from the behaviour of the baital who no sooner heard the question o wretch who art thou than it returned in loud glee and merriment to its old position  five mortal times did raja vikram repeat this profitless labour but so far from losing heart he quite entered into the spirit of the adventure indeed he would have continued climbing up that tree and taking that corpse under his armhe found his sword useless and bringing it down and asking it who it was and seeing it slip through his fingers six times sixty times or till the end of the fourth and present agefn45 had such extreme resolution been required  however it was not necessary on the seventh time of falling the baital instead of eluding its capturers grasp allowed itself to be seized merely remarking that even the gods cannot resist a thoroughly obstinate manfn46 and seeing that the stranger for the better protection of his prize had stripped off his waistcloth and was making it into a bag the vampire thought proper to seek the most favourable conditions for himself and asked his conqueror who he was and what he was about to do  vile wretch replied the breathless hero know me to be vikram the great raja of ujjayani and i bear thee to a man who is amusing himself by drumming to devils on a skull  remember the old saying mighty vikram said the baital with a sneer that many a tongue has cut many a throat i have yielded to thy resolution and i am about to accompany thee bound to thy back like a beggars wallet but hearken to my words ere we set out upon the way i am of a loquacious disposition and it is well nigh an hours walk between this tree and the place where thy friend sits favouring his friends with the peculiar music which they love therefore i shall try to distract my thoughts which otherwise might not be of the most pleasing nature by means of sprightly tales and profitable reflections sages and men of sense spend their days in the delights of light and heavy literature whereas dolts and fools waste time in sleep and idleness and i purpose to ask thee a number of questions concerning which we will if it seems fit to thee make this covenant  whenever thou answerest me either compelled by fate or entrapped by my cunning into so doing or thereby gratifying thy vanity and conceit i leave thee and return to my favourite place and position in the sirastree but when thou shalt remain silent confused and at a loss to reply either through humility or thereby confessing thine ignorance and impotence and want of comprehension then will i allow thee of mine own free will to place me before thine employer perhaps i should not say so it may sound like bribing thee buttake my counsel and mortify thy pride and assumption and arrogance and haughtiness as soon as possible so shalt thou derive from me a benefit which none but myself can bestow  raja vikram hearing these rough words so strange to his royal ear winced then he rejoiced that his heir apparent was not near then he looked round at his son dharma dhwaj to see if he was impertinent enough to be amused by the baital but the first glance showed him the young prince busily employed in pinching and screwing the monsters legs so as to make it fit better into the cloth vikram then seized the ends of the waistcloth twisted them into a convenient form for handling stooped raised the bundle with a jerk tossed it over his shoulder and bidding his son not to lag behind set off at a round pace towards the western end of the cemetery  the shower had ceased and as they gained ground the weather greatly improved  the vampire asked a few indifferent questions about the wind and the rain and the mud when he received no answer he began to feel uncomfortable and he broke out with these words o king vikram listen to the true story which i am about to tell thee            the vampires first story        in which a man deceives a woman  in benares once reigned a mighty prince by name pratapamukut to whose eighth son vajramukut happened the strangest adventure  one morning the young man accompanied by the son of his fathers pradhan or prime minister rode out hunting and went far into the jungle at last the twain unexpectedly came upon a beautiful tank fn47 of a prodigious size it was surrounded by short thick walls of fine baked brick and flights and ramps of cutstone steps half the length of each face and adorned with turrets pendants and finials led down to the water the substantial plaster work and the masonry had fallen into disrepair and from the crevices sprang huge trees under whose thick shade the breeze blew freshly and on whose balmy branches the birds sang sweetly the grey squirrels fn48 chirruped joyously as they coursed one another up the gnarled trunks and from the pendent llianas the longtailed monkeys were swinging sportively the bountiful hand of sravana fn49 had spread the earthen rampart with a carpet of the softest grass and manyhued wild flowers in which were buzzing swarms of bees and myriads of bright winged insects and flocks of water fowl wild geese brahmini ducks bitterns herons and cranes male and female were feeding on the narrow strip of brilliant green that belted the long deep pool amongst the broadleaved lotuses with the lovely blossoms splashing through the pellucid waves and basking happily in the genial sun  the prince and his friend wondered when they saw the beautiful tank in the midst of a wild forest and made many vain conjectures about it they dismounted tethered their horses and threw their weapons upon the ground then having washed their hands and faces they entered a shrine dedicated to mahadeva and there began to worship the presiding deity  whilst they were making their offerings a bevy of maidens accompanied by a crowd of female slaves descended the opposite flight of steps they stood there for a time talking and laughing and looking about them to see if any alligators infested the waters when convinced that the tank was safe they disrobed themselves in order to bathe it was truly a splendid spectacle    concerning which the less said the better interrupted raja vikram in an offended tonefn50  but did not last long the rajas daughter  for the principal maiden was a princess  soon left her companions who were scooping up water with their palms and dashing it over one anothers heads and proceeded to perform the rites of purification meditation and worship then she began strolling with a friend under the shade of a small mango grove  the prince also left his companion sitting in prayer and walked forth into the forest suddenly the eyes of the rajas son and the rajas daughter met she started back with a little scream he was fascinated by her beauty and began to say to himself  o thou vile karmafn51 why worriest thou me  hearing this the maiden smiled encouragement but the poor youth between palpitation of the heart and hesitation about what to say was so confused that his tongue crave to his teeth she raised her eyebrows a little there is nothing which women despise in a man more than modesty fn52 for modesty    a violent shaking of the bag which hung behind vikrams royal back broke off the end of this offensive sentence and the warrior king did not cease that discipline till the baital promised him to preserve more decorum in his observations  still the prince stood before her with downcast eyes and suffused cheeks even the spur of contempt failed to arouse his energies then the maiden called to her friend who was picking jasmine flowers so as not to witness the scene and angrily asked why that strange man was allowed to stand and stare at her the friend in hot wrath threatened to call the slave and throw vajramukut into the pond unless he instantly went away with his impudence but as the prince was rooted to the spot and really had not heard a word of what had been said to him the two women were obliged to make the first move  as they almost reached the tank the beautiful maiden turned her head to see what the poor modest youth was doing  vajramukut was formed in every way to catch a womans eye the rajas daughter therefore half forgave him his offence of mod  again she sweetly smiled disclosing two rows of little opals then descending to the waters edge she stooped down and plucked a lotus this she worshipped next she placed it in her hair then she put it in her ear then she bit it with her teeth then she trod upon it with her foot then she raised it up again and lastly she stuck it in her bosom after which she mounted her conveyance and went home to her friends whilst the prince having become thoroughly desponding and drowned in grief at separation from her returned to the ministers son  females ejaculated the ministers son speaking to himself in a careless tone when his prayer finished he left the temple and sat down upon the tank steps to enjoy the breeze he presently drew a roll of paper from under his waistbelt and in a short time was engrossed with his study the women seeing this conduct exerted themselves in every possible way of wile to attract his attention and to distract his soul they succeeded only so far as to make him roll his head with a smile and to remember that such is always the custom of mans bane after which he turned over a fresh page of manuscript and although he presently began to wonder what had become of the prince his master he did not look up even once from his study  he was a philosopher that young man but after all raja vikram what is mortal philosophy nothing but another name for indifference who was ever philosophical about a thing truly loved or really hated  no one philosophy says shankharacharya is either a gift of nature or the reward of study but i the baital the devil ask you what is a born philosopher save a man of cold desires and what is a bred philosopher but a man who has survived his desires a young philosopher  a coldblooded youth an elderly philosopher a leucophlegmatic old man much nonsense of a verity ye hear in praise of nothing from your rajaships nine gems of science and from sundry other such wise fools  then the prince began to relate the state of his case saying  o friend i have seen a damsel but whether she be a musician from indras heaven a maiden of the sea a daughter of the serpent kings or the child of an earthly raja i cannot say  describe her said the statesman in embryo  her face quoth the prince was that of the full moon her hair like a swarm of bees hanging from the blossoms of the acacia the corners of her eyes touched her ears her lips were sweet with lunar ambrosia her waist was that of a lion and her walk the walk of a king goose fn53 as a garment she was white as a season the spring as a flower the jasmine as a speaker the kokila bird as a perfume musk as a beauty kamadeva and as a being love and if she does not come into my possession i will not live this i have certainly determined upon  the young minister who had heard his prince say the same thing more than once before did not attach great importance to these awful words he merely remarked that unless they mounted at once night would surprise them in the forest then the two young men returned to their horses untethered them drew on their bridles saddled them and catching up their weapons rode slowly towards the rajas palace during the three hours of return hardly a word passed between the pair vajramukut not only avoided speaking he never once replied till addressed thrice in the loudest voice  the young minister put no more questions for quoth he to himself when the prince wants my counsel he will apply for it in this point he had borrowed wisdom from his father who held in peculiar horror the giving of unasked for advice so when he saw that conversation was irksome to his master he held his peace and meditated upon what he called his daythought it was his practice to choose every morning some tough food for reflection and to chew the cud of it in his mind at times when without such employment his wits would have gone woolgathering you may imagine raja vikram that with a few years of this head work the ministers son became a very crafty young person  after the second day the prince vajramukut being restless from grief at separation fretted himself into a fever having given up writing reading drinking sleeping the affairs entrusted to him by his father and everything else he sat down as he said to die he used constantly to paint the portrait of the beautiful lotus gatherer and to lie gazing upon it with tearful eyes then he would start up and tear it to pieces and beat his forehead and begin another picture of a yet more beautiful face  at last as the pradhans son had foreseen he was summoned by the young raja whom he found upon his bed looking yellow and complaining bitterly of headache frequent discussions upon the subject of the tender passion had passed between the two youths and one of them had ever spoken of it so very disrespectfully that the other felt ashamed to introduce it but when his friend with a view to provoke communicativeness advised a course of boiled and bitter herbs and great attention to diet quoting the hemistich attributed to the learned physician charndatta          a fever starve but feed a cold  the unhappy vajramukuts fortitude abandoned him he burst into tears and exclaimed whosoever enters upon the path of love cannot survive it and if by chance he should live what is life to him but a prolongation of his misery  yea replied the ministers son the sage hath said    the road of love is that which hath no beginning nor end take thou heed of thyself man i ere thou place foot upon it  and the wise knowing that there are three things whose effect upon himself no man can foretell namely desire of woman the dicebox and the drinking of ardent spirits  find total abstinence from them the best of rules yet after all if there is no cow we must milk the bull  the advice was of course excellent but the hapless lover could not help thinking that on this occasion it came a little too late however after a pause he returned to the subject and said i have ventured to tread that dangerous way be its end pain or pleasure happiness or destruction he then hung down his head and sighed from the bottom of his heart  she is the person who appeared to us at the tank asked the pradhans son moved to compassion by the state of his master  the prince assented  o great king resumed the ministers son at the time of going away had she said anything to you or had you said anything to her  nothing replied the other laconically when he found his friend beginning to take an interest in the affair  then said the ministers son it will be exceedingly difficult to get possession of her  then repeated the rajas son i am doomed to death to an early and melancholy death  humph ejaculated the young statesman rather impatiently did she make any sign or give any hint let me know all that happened half confidences are worse than none  upon which the prince related everything that took place by the side of the tank bewailing the false shame which had made him dumb and concluding with her pantomime  the pradhans son took thought for a while he thereupon seized the opportunity of representing to his master all the evil effects of bashfulness when women are concerned and advised him as he would be a happy lover to brazen his countenance for the next interview  which the young raja faithfully promised to do  and now said the other be comforted o my master i know her name and her dwellingplace when she suddenly plucked the lotus flower and worshipped it she thanked the gods for having blessed her with a sight of your beauty  vajramukut smiled the first time for the last month  when she applied it to her ear it was as if she would have explained to thee i am a daughter of the carnatic fn54 and when she bit it with her teeth she meant to say that my father is raja dantawat fn55 who bythebye has been is and ever will be a mortal foe to thy father  vajramukut shuddered  when she put it under her foot it meant my name is padmavati fn56  vajramukut uttered a cry of joy  and when she placed it in her bosom you are truly dwelling in my heart was meant to be understood  at these words the young raja started up full of new life and after praising with enthusiasm the wondrous sagacity of his dear friend begged him by some contrivance to obtain the permission of his parents and to conduct him to her city the ministers son easily got leave for vajramukut to travel under pretext that his body required change of water and his mind change of scene they both dressed and armed themselves for the journey and having taken some jewels mounted their horses and followed the road in that direction in which the princess had gone  arrived after some days at the capital of the carnatic the ministers son having disguised his master and himself in the garb of travelling traders alighted and pitched his little tent upon a clear bit of ground in one of the suburbs he then proceeded to inquire for a wise woman wanting he said to have his fortune told when the prince asked him what this meant he replied that elderly dames who professionally predict the future are never above ministering to the present and therefore that in such circumstances they are the properest persons to be consulted  is this a treatise upon the subject of immorality devil demanded the king vikram ferociously the baital declared that it was not but that he must tell his story  the person addressed pointed to an old woman who seated before the door of her hut was spinning at her wheel then the young men went up to her with polite salutations and said mother we are travelling traders and our stock is coming after us we have come on in advance for the purpose of finding a place to live in if you will give us a house we will remain there and pay you highly  the old woman who was a physiognomist as well as a fortuneteller looked at the faces of the young men and liked them because their brows were wide and their mouths denoted generosity having listened to their words she took pity upon them and said kindly this hovel is yours my masters remain here as long as you please then she led them into an inner room again welcomed them lamented the poorness of her abode and begged them to lie down and rest themselves  after some interval of time the old woman came to them once more and sitting down began to gossip the ministers son upon this asked her how is it with thy family thy relatives and connections and what are thy means of subsistence she replied my son is a favourite servant in the household of our great king dantawat and your slave is the wetnurse of the princess padmavati his eldest child from the coming on of old age she added i dwell in this house but the king provides for my eating and drinking i go once a day to see the girl who is a miracle of beauty and goodness wit and accomplishments and returning thence i bear my own griefs at home fn57  in a few days the young vajramukut had by his liberality soft speech and good looks made such progress in nurse lakshmis affections that by the advice of his companion he ventured to broach the subject ever nearest his heart he begged his hostess when she went on the morrow to visit the charming padmavati that she would be kind enough to slip a bit of paper into the princesss hand  son she replied delighted with the proposal  and what old woman would not be there is no need for putting off so urgent an affair till the morrow get your paper ready and i will immediately give it  trembling with pleasure the prince ran to find his friend who was seated in the garden reading as usual and told him what the old nurse had engaged to do he then began to debate about how he should write his letter to cull sentences and to weigh phrases whether light of my eyes was not too trite and blood of my liver rather too forcible at this the ministers son smiled and bade the prince not trouble his head with composition he then drew his inkstand from his waist shawl nibbed a reed pen and choosing a piece of pink and flowered paper he wrote upon it a few lines he then folded it gummed it sketched a lotus flower upon the outside and handing it to the young prince told him to give it to their hostess and that all would be well  the old woman took her staff in her hand and hobbled straight to the palace arrived there she found the rajas daughter sitting alone in her apartment the maiden seeing her nurse immediately arose and making a respectful bow led her to a seat and began the most affectionate inquiries after giving her blessing and sitting for some time and chatting about indifferent matters the nurse said  o daughter in infancy i reared and nourished thee now the bhagwan deity has rewarded me by giving thee stature beauty health and goodness my heart only longs to see the happiness of thy womanhood fn58 after which i shall depart in peace i implore thee read this paper given to me by the handsomest and the properest young man that my eyes have ever seen  the princess glancing at the lotus on the outside of the note slowly unfolded it and perused its contents which were as follows                       1                   she was to me the pearl that clings                       to sands all hid from mortal sight                  yet fit for diadems of kings                       the pure and lovely light                       2                   she was to me the gleam of sun                       that breaks the gloom of wintry day                  one moment shone my soul upon                       then passed how soon  away                       3                   she was to me the dreams of bliss                       that float the dying eyes before                  for one short hour shed happiness                       and fly to bless no more                       4                   o light again upon me shine                       o pearl again delight my eyes                  o dreams of bliss again be mine                        no earth may not be paradise  i must not forget to remark parenthetically that the ministers son in order to make these lines generally useful had provided them with a last stanza in triplicate for lovers he said sagely are either in the optative mood the desperative or the exultative this time he had used the optative for the desperative he would substitute                       4                   the joys of life lie dead lie dead                       the light of day is quenched in gloom                  the spark of hope my heart hath fled                        what now witholds me from the tomb  and this was the termination exultative as he called it                       4                   o joy i the pearl is mine again                       once more the day is bright and clear                  and now tis real then twas vain                       my dream of bliss  o heaven is here  the princess padmavati having perused this doggrel with a contemptuous look tore off the first word of the last line and said to the nurse angrily get thee gone o mother of yama fn59 o unfortunate creature and take back this answer giving her the scrap of paper  to the fool who writes such bad verses i wonder where he studied the humanities begone and never do such an action again  the old nurse distressed at being so treated rose up and returned home vajramukut was too agitated to await her arrival so he went to meet her on the way imagine his disappointment when she gave him the fatal word and repeated to him exactly what happened not forgetting to describe a single look he felt tempted to plunge his sword into his bosom but fortune interfered and sent him to consult his confidant  be not so hasty and desperate my prince said the pradhans son seeing his wild grief you have not understood her meaning later in life you will be aware of the fact that in nine cases out of ten a womans no is a distinct yes this mornings work has been good the maiden asked where you learnt the humanities which being interpreted signifies who are you  on the next day the prince disclosed his rank to old lakshmi who naturally declared that she had always known it the trust they reposed in her made her ready to address padmavati once more on the forbidden subject so she again went to the palace and having lovingly greeted her nursling said to her the rajas son whose heart thou didst fascinate on the brim of the tank on the fifth day of the moon in the light half of the month yeth has come to my house and sends this message to thee perform what you promised we have now come and i also tell thee that this prince is worthy of thee just as thou art beautiful so is he endowed with all good qualities of mind and body  when padmavati heard this speech she showed great anger and rubbing sandal on her beautiful hands she slapped the old womans cheeks and cried wretch daina witch get out of my house did i not forbid thee to talk such folly in my presence  the lover and the nurse were equally distressed at having taken the advice of the young minister till he explained what the crafty damsel meant when she smeared the sandal on her ten fingers he explained and struck the old woman on the face she signified that when the remaining ten moonlight nights shall have passed away she will meet you in the dark at the same time he warned his master that to all appearances the lady padmavati was far too clever to make a comfortable wife the ministers son especially hated talented intellectual and strongminded women he had been heard to describe the torments of naglok fn60 as the compulsory companionship of a polemical divine and a learned authoress well stricken in years and of forbidding aspect as such persons mostly are amongst womankind he admired  theoretically as became a philosopher the small plump laughing chattering unintellectual and materialminded and therefore excuse the digression raja vikram he married an old maid tall thin yellow strictly proper coldmannered a conversationist and who prided herself upon spirituality but more wonderful still after he did marry her he actually loved her what an incomprehensible being is man in these matters  to return however the pradhans son who detected certain symptoms of strongmindedness in the princess padmavati advised his lord to be wise whilst wisdom availed him this sage counsel was as might be guessed most ungraciously rejected by him for whose benefit it was intended then the sensible young statesman rated himself soundly for having broken his fathers rule touching advice and atoned for it by blindly forwarding the views of his master  after the ten nights of moonlight had passed the old nurse was again sent to the palace with the usual message this time padmavati put saffron on three of her fingers and again left their marks on the nurses cheek the ministers son explained that this was to crave delay for three days and that on the fourth the lover would have access to her  when the time had passed the old woman again went and inquired after her health and wellbeing the princess was as usual very wroth and having personally taken her nurse to the western gate she called her mother of the elephants trunk fn61 and drove her out with threats of the bastinado if she ever came back this was reported to the young statesman who after a few minutes consideration said the explanation of this matter is that she has invited you tomorrow at nighttime to meet her at this very gate  when brown shadows fell upon the face of earth and here and there a star spangled the pale heavens the ministers son called vajramukut who had been engaged in adorning himself at least half that day he had carefully shaved his cheeks and chin his mustachio was trimmed and curled he had arched his eyebrows by plucking out with tweezers the fine hairs around them he had trained his curly muskcoloured lovelocks to hang gracefully down his face he had drawn broad lines of antimony along his eyelids a most brilliant sectarian mark was affixed to his forehead the colour of his lips had been heightened by chewing betelnut   one would imagine that you are talking of a silly girl not of a prince fiend interrupted vikram who did not wish his son to hear what he called these fopperies and frivolities   and whitened his neck by having it shaved continued the baital speaking quickly as if determined not to be interrupted and reddened the tips of his ears by squeezing them and made his teeth shine by rubbing copper powder into the roots and set off the delicacy of his fingers by staining the tips with henna he had not been less careful with his dress he wore a wellarranged turband which had taken him at least two hours to bind and a rich suit of brown stuff chosen for the adventure he was about to attempt and he hung about his person a number of various weapons so as to appear a hero  which young damsels admire  vajramukut asked his friend how he looked and smiled happily when the other replied admirable his happiness was so great that he feared it might not last and he asked the ministers son how best to conduct himself  as a conqueror my prince answered that astute young man if it so be that you would be one when you wish to win a woman always impose upon her tell her that you are her master and she will forthwith believe herself to be your servant inform her that she loves you and forthwith she will adore you show her that you care nothing for her and she will think of nothing but you prove to her by your demeanour that you consider her a slave and she will become your pariah but above all things excuse me if i repeat myself too often  beware of the fatal virtue which men call modesty and women sheepishness recollect the trouble it has given us and the danger which we have incurred all this might have been managed at a tank within fifteen miles of your royal fathers palace and allow me to say that you may still thank your stars in love a lost opportunity is seldom if ever recovered the time to woo a woman is the moment you meet her before she has had time to think allow her the use of reflection and she may escape the net and after avoiding the rock of modesty fall not i conjure you into the gulf of security i fear the lady padmavati she is too clever and too prudent when damsels of her age draw the sword of love they throw away the scabbard of precaution but you yawn  i weary you it is time for us to move  two watches of the night had passed and there was profound stillness on earth the young men then walked quietly through the shadows till they reached the western gate of the palace and found the wicket ajar the ministers son peeped in and saw the porter dozing stately as a brahman deep in the vedas and behind him stood a veiled woman seemingly waiting for somebody he then returned on tiptoe to the place where he had left his master and with a parting caution against modesty and security bade him fearlessly glide through the wicket then having stayed a short time at the gate listening with anxious ear he went back to the old womans house  vajramukut penetrating to the staircase felt his hand grasped by the veiled figure who motioning him to tread lightly led him quickly forwards they passed under several arches through dim passages and dark doorways till at last running up a flight of stone steps they reached the apartments of the princess  vajramukut was nearly fainting as the flood of splendour broke upon him recovering himself he gazed around the rooms and presently a tumult of delight invaded his soul and his body bristled with joy fn62 the scene was that of fairyland golden censers exhaled the most costly perfumes and gemmed vases bore the most beautiful flowers silver lamps containing fragrant oil illuminated doors whose panels were wonderfully decorated and walls adorned with pictures in which such figures were formed that on seeing them the beholder was enchanted on one side of the room stood a bed of flowers and a couch covered with brocade of gold and strewed with freshlyculled jasmine flowers on the other side arranged in proper order were attar holders betelboxes rosewater bottles trays and silver cases with four partitions for essences compounded of rose leaves sugar and spices prepared sandal wood saffron and pods of musk scattered about a stuccoed floor white as crystal were coloured caddies of exquisite confections and in others sweetmeats of various kindsfn63 female attendants clothed in dresses of various colours were standing each according to her rank with hands respectfully joined some were reading plays and beautiful poems others danced and others performed with glittering fingers and flashing arms on various instruments the ivory lute the ebony pipe and the silver kettledrum in short all the means and appliances of pleasure and enjoyment were there and any description of the appearance of the apartments which were the wonder of the age is impossible  then another veiled figure the beautiful princess padmavati came up and disclosed herself and dazzled the eyes of her delighted vajramukut she led him into an alcove made him sit down rubbed sandal powder upon his body hung a garland of jasmine flowers round his neck sprinkled rosewater over his dress and began to wave over his head a fan of peacock feathers with a golden handle  said the prince who despite all efforts could not entirely shake off his unhappy habit of being modest those very delicate hands of yours are not fit to ply the pankhafn64 why do you take so much trouble i am cool and refreshed by the sight of you do give the fan to me and sit down  nay great king replied padmavati with the most fascinating of smiles you have taken so much trouble for my sake in coming here it is right that i perform service for you  upon which her favourite slave taking the pankha from the hand of the princess exclaimed this is my duty i will perform the service do you two enjoy yourselves  the lovers then began to chew betel which by the bye they disposed of in little agate boxes which they drew from their pockets and they were soon engaged in the tenderest conversation  here the baital paused for a while probably to take breath then he resumed his tale as follows  in the meantime it became dawn the princess concealed him and when night returned they again engaged in the same innocent pleasures thus day after day sped rapidly by imagine if you can the youths felicity he was of an ardent temperament deeply enamoured barely a score of years old and he had been strictly brought up by serious parents he therefore resigned himself entirely to the siren for whom he willingly forgot the world and he wondered at his good fortune which had thrown in his way a conquest richer than all the mines of merufn65 he could not sufficiently admire his padmavatis grace beauty bright wit and numberless accomplishments every morning for vanitys sake he learned from her a little useless knowledge in verse as well as prose for instance the saying of the poet         enjoy the present hour tis thine be this o man thy law      who eer resew the yester who the morrow eer foresaw  and this highly philosophical axiom         eat drink and love the rests not worth a fillip  by means of which he hoped raja vikram said the demon not heeding his royal carriers ughs and poohs to become in course of time almost as clever as his mistress  padmavati being as you have seen a maiden of superior mind was naturally more smitten by her lovers dulness than by any other of his qualities she adored it it was such a contrast to herselffn66 at first she did what many clever women do she invested him with the brightness of her own imagination still water she pondered runs deep certainly under this disguise must lurk a brilliant fancy a penetrating but a mature and ready judgment are they not written by natures hand on that broad high brow with such lovely mustachios can he be aught but generous nobleminded magnanimous can such eyes belong to any but a hero and she fed the delusion she would smile upon him with intense fondness when after wasting hours over a few lines of poetry he would misplace all the adjectives and barbarously entreat the metre she laughed with gratification when excited by the bright sayings that fell from her lips the youth put forth some platitude dim as the lamp in the expiring firefly when he slipped in grammar she saw malice under it when he retailed a borrowed jest she called it a good one and when he used as princes sometimes will bad language she discovered in it a charming simplicity  at first she suspected that the stratagems which had won her heart were the results of a deeplaid plot proceeding from her lover but clever women are apt to be rarely sharpsighted in every matter which concerns themselves she frequently determined that a third was in the secret she therefore made no allusion to it before long the enamoured vajramukut had told her everything beginning with the diatribe against love pronounced by the ministers son and ending with the solemn warning that she the pretty princess would some day or other play her husband a foul trick  if i do not revenge myself upon him thought the beautiful padmavati smiling like an angel as she listened to the youths confidence may i become a gardeners ass in the next birth  having thus registered a vow she broke silence and praised to the skies the young pradhans wisdom and sagacity professed herself ready from gratitude to become his slave and only hoped that one day or other she might meet that true friend by whose skill her soul had been gratified in its dearest desire only she concluded i am convinced that now my vajramukut knows every corner of his little padmavatis heart he will never expect her to do anything but love admire adore and kiss him then suiting the action to the word she convinced him that the young minister had for once been too crabbed and cynic in his philosophy  but after the lapse of a month vajramukut who had eaten and drunk and slept a great deal too much and who had not once hunted became bilious in body and in mind melancholic his face turned yellow and so did the whites of his eyes he yawned as liver patients generally do complained occasionally of sick headaches and lost his appetite he became restless and anxious and once when alone at night he thus thought aloud i have given up country throne home and everything else but the friend by means of whom this happiness was obtained i have not seen for the long length of thirty days what will he say to himself and how can i know what has happened to him  in this state of things he was sitting and in the meantime the beautiful princess arrived she saw through the matter and lost not a moment in entering upon it she began by expressing her astonishment at her lovers fickleness and fondness for change and when he was ready to wax wroth and quoted the words of the sage a barren wife may be superseded by another in the eighth year she whose children all die in the tenth she who brings forth only daughters in the eleventh she who scolds without delay thinking that she alluded to his love she smoothed his temper by explaining that she referred to his forgetting his friend how is it possible o my soul she asked with the softest of voices that thou canst happiness here whilst thy heart is wandering there why didst thou conceal this from me o astute one was it for fear of distressing me think better of thy wife than to suppose that she would ever separate thee from one to whom we both owe so much  after this padmavati advised nay ordered her lover to go forth that night and not to return till his mind was quite at ease and she begged him to take a few sweetmeats and other trifles as a little token of her admiration and regard for the clever young man of whom she had heard so much  vajramukut embraced her with a transport of gratitude which so inflamed her anger that fearing lest the cloak of concealment might fall from her countenance she went away hurriedly to find the greatest delicacies which her comfit boxes contained presently she returned carrying a bag of sweetmeats of every kind for her lover and as he rose up to depart she put into his hand a little parcel of sugarplums especially intended for the friend they were made up with her own delicate fingers and they would please she flattered herself even his discriminating palate  the young prince after enduring a number of farewell embraces and hopings for a speedy return and last words ever beginning again passed safely through the palace gate and with a relieved aspect walked briskly to the house of the old nurse although it was midnight his friend was still sitting on his mat  the two young men fell upon one anothers bosoms and embraced affectionately they then began to talk of matters nearest their hearts the rajas son wondered at seeing the jaded and haggard looks of his companion who did not disguise that they were caused by his anxiety as to what might have happened to his friend at the hand of so talented and so superior a princess upon which vajramukut who now thought padmavati an angel and his late abode a heaven remarked with formality  and two blunders to one quotation that abilities properly directed win for a man the happiness of both worlds  the pradhans son rolled his head  again on your hobbyhorse nagging at talent whenever you find it in others  cried the young prince with a pun which would have delighted padmavati surely you are jealous of her he resumed anything but pleased with the dead silence that had received his joke jealous of her cleverness and of her love for me she is the very best creature in the world even you womanhater as you are would own it if you only knew all the kind messages she sent and the little pleasant surprise that she has prepared for you there take and eat they are made by her own dear hands cried the young raja producing the sweetmeats as she herself taught me to say            thank god i am a man      not a philosopher  the kind messages she sent me the pleasant surprise she has prepared for me repeated the ministers son in a hard dry tone my lord will be pleased to tell me how she heard of my name  i was sitting one night replied the prince in anxious thought about you when at that moment the princess coming in and seeing my condition asked why are you thus sad explain the cause to me i then gave her an account of your cleverness and when she heard it she gave me permission to go and see you and sent these sweetmeats for you eat them and i shall be pleased  great king rejoined the young statesman one thing vouchsafe to hear from me you have not done well in that you have told my name you should never let a woman think that your left hand knows the secret which she confided to your right much less that you have shared it to a third person secondly you did evil in allowing her to see the affection with which you honour your unworthy servant a woman ever hates her lovers or husbands friend  what could i do rejoined the young raja in a querulous tone of voice when i love a woman i like to tell her everything to have no secrets from her to consider her another self   which habit interrupted the pradhans son you will lose when you are a little older when you recognize the fact that love is nothing but a bout a game of skill between two individuals of opposite sexes the one seeking to gain as much and the other striving to lose as little as possible and that the sharper of the twain thus met on the chessboard must in the long run win and reticence is but a habit practise it for a year and you will find it harder to betray than to conceal your thoughts it hath its joy also is there no pleasure think you when suppressing an outbreak of tender but fatal confidence in saying to yourself o if she only knew this o if she did but suspect that returning however to the sugarplums my life to a pariahs that they are poisoned  impossible exclaimed the prince horrorstruck at the thought what you say surely no one ever could do if a mortal fears not his fellowmortal at least he dreads the deity  i never yet knew rejoined the other what a woman in love does fear however prince the trial is easy come here muti cried he to the old womans dog and off with thee to that threeheaded kinsman of thine that attends upon his amiablelooking masterfn67  having said this he threw one of the sweetmeats to the dog the animal ate it and presently writhing and falling down died  the wretch o the wretch cried vajramukut transported with wonder and anger  and i loved her but now it is all over i dare not associate with such a calamity  what has happened my lord has happened quoth the ministers son calmly i was prepared for something of this kind from so talented a princess none commit such mistakes such blunders such follies as your clever women they cannot even turn out a crime decently executed o give me dulness with one idea one aim one desire o thrice blessed dulness that combines with happiness power  this time vajramukut did not defend talent  and your slave did his best to warn you against perfidy but now my heart is at rest i have tried her strength she has attempted and failed the defeat will prevent her attempting again just yet but let me ask you to put to yourself one question can you be happy without her  brother replied the prince after a pause i cannot and he blushed as he made the avowal  well replied the other better confess then conceal that fact we must now meet her on the battlefield and beat her at her own weapons cunning i do not willingly begin treachery with women because in the first place i dont like it and secondly i know that they will certainly commence practicing it upon me after which i hold myself justified in deceiving them and probably this will be a good wife remember that she intended to poison me not you during the last month my fear has been lest my prince had run into the tigers brake tell me my lord when does the princess expect you to return to her  she bade me said the young raja not to return till my mind was quite at ease upon the subject of my talented friend  this means that she expects you back tomorrow night as you cannot enter the palace before and now i will retire to my cot as it is there that i am wont to ponder over my plans before dawn my thought shall mature one which must place the beautiful padmavati in your power  a word before parting exclaimed the prince you know my father has already chosen a spouse for me what will he say if i bring home a second   in my humble opinion said the ministers son rising to retire woman is a monogamous man a polygamous creature a fact scarcely established in physio logical theory but very observable in everyday practice for what said the poet             divorce friend rewed thee the spring draweth nearfn68           and a wifes but an almanac good for the year  if your royal father say anything to you refer him to what he himself does  reassured by these words vajramukut bade his friend a cordial goodnight and sought his cot where he slept soundly despite the emotions of the last few hours the next day passed somewhat slowly in the evening when accompanying his master to the palace the ministers son gave him the following directions  our object dear my lord is how to obtain possession of the princess take then this trident and hide it carefully when you see her show the greatest love and affection conceal what has happened and when she wondering at your calmness asks about me tell her that last night i was weary and out of health that illness prevented my eating her sweetmeats but that i shall eat them for supper tonight when she goes to sleep then taking off her jewels and striking her left leg with the trident instantly come away to me but should she lie awake rub upon your thumb a little of this do not fear it is only a powder of grubs fed on verdigris  and apply it to her nostrils it would make an elephant senseless so be careful how you approach it to your own face  vajramukut embraced his friend and passed safely through the palace gate he found padmavati awaiting him she fell upon his bosom and looked into his eyes and deceived herself as clever women will do overpowered by her joy and satisfaction she now felt certain that her lover was hers eternally and that her treachery had not been discovered so the beautiful princess fell into a deep sleep  then vajramukut lost no time in doing as the ministers son had advised and slipped out of the room carrying off padmavatis jewels and ornaments his counsellor having inspected them took up a sack and made signs to his master to follow him leaving the horses and baggage at the nurses house they walked to a burningplace outside the city the ministers son there buried his dress together with that of the prince and drew from the sack the costume of a religious ascetic he assumed this himself and gave to his companion that of a disciple then quoth the guru spiritual preceptor to his chela pupil go youth to the bazar and sell these jewels remembering to let half the jewellers in the place see the things and if any one lay hold of thee bring him to me  upon which as day had dawned vajramukut carried the princesss ornaments to the market and entering the nearest goldsmiths shop offered to sell them and asked what they were worth as your majesty well knows gardeners tailors and goldsmiths are proverbially dishonest and this man was no exception to the rule he looked at the pupils face and wondered because he had brought articles whose value he did not appear to know a thought struck him that he might make a bargain which would fill his coffers so he offered about a thousandth part of the price this the pupil rejected because he wished the affair to go further then the goldsmith seeing him about to depart sprang up and stood in the door way threatening to call the officers of justice if the young man refused to give up the valuables which he said had lately been stolen from his shop as the pupil only laughed at this the goldsmith thought seriously of executing his threat hesitating only because he knew that the officers of justice would gain more than he could by that proceeding as he was still in doubt a shadow darkened his shop and in entered the chief jeweller of the city the moment the ornaments were shown to him he recognized them and said these jewels belong to raja dantawats daughter i know them well as i set them only a few months ago then he turned to the disciple who still held the valuables in his hand and cried tell me truly whence you received them  while they were thus talking a crowd of ten or twenty persons had collected and at length the report reached the superintendent of the archers he sent a soldier to bring before him the pupil the goldsmith and the chief jeweller together with the ornaments and when all were in the hall of justice he looked at the jewels and said to the young man tell me truly whence have you obtained these  my spiritual preceptor said vajramukut pretending great fear who is now worshipping in the cemetery outside the town gave me these white stones with an order to sell them how know i whence he obtained them dismiss me my lord for i am an innocent man  let the ascetic be sent for commanded the kotwalfn69 then having taken both of them along with the jewels into the presence of king dantawat he related the whole circumstances  master said the king on hearing the statement whence have you obtained these jewels  the spiritual preceptor before deigning an answer pulled from under his arm the hide of a black antelope which he spread out and smoothed deliberately before using it as an asanfn70 he then began to finger a rosary of beads each as large as an egg and after spending nearly an hour in mutterings and in rollings of the head he looked fixedly at the raja and repined  by shiva great king they are mine own on the fourteenth of the dark half of the moon at night i had gone into a place where dead bodies are burned for the purpose of accomplishing a witchs incantation after long and toilsome labour she appeared but her demeanour was so unruly that i was forced to chastise her i struck her with this my trident on the left leg if memory serves me as she continued to be refractory in order to punish her i took off all her jewels and clothes and told her to go where she pleased even this had little effect upon her never have i looked upon so perverse a witch in this way the jewels came into my possession  raja dantawat was stunned by these words he begged the ascetic not to leave the palace for a while and forthwith walked into the private apartments of the women happening first to meet the queen dowager he said to her go without losing a minute o my mother and look at padmavatis left leg and see if there is a mark or not and what sort of a mark presently she returned and coming to the king said son i find thy daughter lying upon her bed and complaining that she has met with an accident and indeed padmavati must be in great pain i found that some sharp instrument with three points had wounded her the girl says that a nail hurt her but i never yet heard of a nail making three holes however we must all hasten or there will be erysipelas tumefaction gangrene mortification amputation and perhaps death in the house concluded the old queen hurrying away in the pleasing anticipation of these ghastly consequences  for a moment king dantawats heart was ready to break but he was accustomed to master his feelings he speedily applied the reins of reflection to the wild steed of passion he thought to himself the affairs of ones household the intentions of ones heart and whatever ones losses may be should not be disclosed to any one since padmavati is a witch she is no longer my daughter i will verily go forth and consult the spiritual preceptor  with these words the king went outside where the guru was still sitting upon his black hide making marks with his trident on the floor having requested that the pupil might be sent away and having cleared the room he said to the jogi o holy man what punishment for the heinous crime of witchcraft is awarded to a woman in the dharma shastra fn71  great king replied the devotee in the dharma shastra it is thus written if a brahman a cow a woman a child or any other person whatsoever who may be dependent on us should be guilty of a perfidious act their punishment is that they be banished the country however much they may deserve death we must not spill their blood as lakshmifn72 flies in horror from the deed  hearing these words the raja dismissed the guru with many thanks and large presents he waited till nightfall and then ordered a band of trusty men to seize padmavati without alarming the household and to carry her into a distant jungle full of fiends tigers and bears and there to abandon her  in the meantime the ascetic and his pupil hurrying to the cemetery resumed their proper dresses they then went to the old nurses house rewarded her hospitality till she wept bitterly girt on their weapons and mounting their horses followed the party which issued from the gate of king dantawats palace and it may easily be believed that they found little difficulty in persuading the poor girl to exchange her chance in the wild jungle for the prospect of becoming vajramukuts wife lawfully wedded at benares she did not even ask if she was to have a rival in the house a question which women you know never neglect to put under usual circumstances after some days the two pilgrims of one love arrived at the house of their fathers and to all both great and small excess in joy came  now raja vikram said the baital you have not spoken much doubtless you are engrossed by the interest of a story wherein a man beats a woman at her own weapon deceit but i warn you that you will assuredly fall into narak the infernal regions if you do not make up your mind upon and explain this matter who was the most to blame amongst these four the loverfn73 the lovers friend the girl or the father  for my part i think padmavati was the worst she being at the bottom of all their troubles cried dharma dhwaj the king said something about young people and the two senses of seeing and hearing but his sons sentiment was so sympathetic that he at once pardoned the interruption at length determined to do justice despite himself vikram said raja dantawat is the person most at fault  in what way was he at fault  asked the baital curiously  king vikram gave him this reply the prince vajramukut being tempted of the lovegod was insane and therefore not responsible for his actions the ministers son performed his masters business obediently without considering causes or asking questions a very excellent quality in a dependent who is merely required to do as he is bid with respect to the young woman i have only to say that she was a young woman and thereby of necessity a possible murderess but the raja a prince a man of a certain age and experience a father of eight he ought never to have been deceived by so shallow a trick nor should he without reflection have banished his daughter from the country  gramercy to you cried the vampire bursting into a discordant shout of laughter i now return to my tree by my tail i never yet heard a raja so readily condemn a raja with these words he slipped out of the cloth leaving it to hang empty over the great kings shoulder  vikram stood for a moment fixed to the spot with blank dismay presently recovering himself he retraced his steps followed by his son ascended the sirestree tore down the baital packed him up as before and again set out upon his way  soon afterwards a voice sounded behind the warrior kings back and began to tell another true story           the vampires second story   of the relative villany of men and women  in the great city of bhogavati dwelt once upon a time a young prince concerning whom i may say that he strikingly resembled this amiable son of your majesty  raja vikram was silent nor did he acknowledge the baitals indirect compliment he hated flattery but he liked when flattered to be flattered in his own person a feature in their royal patrons character which the nine gems of science had turned to their own account  now the young prince raja ram continued the tale teller had an old father concerning whom i may say that he was exceedingly unlike your rajaship both as a man and as a parent he was fond of hunting dicing sleeping by day drinking at night and eating perpetual tonics while he delighted in the idleness of watching nautch girls and the vanity of falling in love but he was adored by his children because he took the trouble to win their hearts he did not lay it down as a law of heaven that his offspring would assuredly go to patala if they neglected the duty of bestowing upon him without cause all their affections as your moral virtuous and highly respectable fathers are only too apt  aie aie  these sounds issued from the vampires lips as the warrior king speechless with wrath passed his hand behind his back and viciously twisted up a piece of the speakers skin this caused the vampire to cry aloud more however it would appear in derision than in real suffering for he presently proceeded with the same subject  fathers great king may be divided into three kinds and be it said aside that mothers are the same firstly we have the parent of many ideas amusing pleasant of course poor and the idol of his children secondly there is the parent with one idea and a half this sort of man would in your place say to himself that demon fellow speaks a manner of truth i am not above learning from him despite his position in life i will carry out his theory just to see how far it goes and so saying he wends his way home and treats his young ones with prodigious kindness for a time but it is not lasting thirdly there is the real oneidead type of parentyourself o warrior king vikram an admirable example you learn in youth what you are taught for instance the blessed precept that the green stick is of the trees of paradise and in age you practice what you have learned you cannot teach yourselves anything before your beards sprout and when they grow stiff you cannot be taught by others if any one attempt to change your opinions you cry            what is new is not true           what is true is not new  and you rudely pull his hand from the subject yet have you your uses like other things of earth in life you are good working camels for the milltrack and when you die your ashes are not worse compost than those of the wise  your rajaship will observe continued the vampire as vikram began to show symptoms of ungovernable anger that i have been concise in treating this digression had i not been so it would have led me far indeed from my tale now to return  when the old king became air mixed with air the young king though he found hardly ten pieces of silver in the paternal treasury and legacies for thousands of golden ounces yet mourned his loss with the deepest grief he easily explained to himself the reckless emptiness of the royal coffers as a proof of his dear kind parents goodness because he loved him  but the old man had left behind him as he could not carry it off with him a treasure more valuable than gold and silver one churaman a parrot who knew the world and who besides discoursed in the most correct sanscrit by sage counsel and wise guidance this admirable bird soon repaired his young masters shattered fortunes  one day the prince said parrot thou knowest everything tell me where there is a mate fit for me the shastras inform us respecting the choice of a wife she who is not descended from his paternal or maternal ancestors within the sixth degree is eligible by a high caste man for nuptials in taking a wife let him studiously avoid the following families be they ever so great or ever so rich in kine goats sheep gold or grain the family which has omitted prescribed acts of devotion that which has produced no male children that in which the veda scripture has not been read that which has thick hair on the body and that in which members have been subject to hereditary disease let a person choose for his wife a girl whose person has no defect who has an agreeable name who walks gracefully like a young elephant whose hair and teeth are moderate in quantity and in size and whose body is of exquisite softness  great king responded the parrot churaman there is in the country of magadh a raja magadheshwar by name and he has a daughter called chandravati you will marry her she is very learned and what is better far very fait she is of yellow colour with a nose like the flower of the sesamum her legs are taper like the plantaintree her eyes are large like the principal leaf of the lotus her eyebrows stretch towards her ears her lips are red like the young leaves of the mangotree her face is like the full moon her voice is like the sound of the cuckoo her arms reach to her knees her throat is like the pigeons her flanks are thin like those of the lion her hair hangs in curls only down to her waist her teeth are like the seeds of the pomegranate and her gait is that of the drunken elephant or the goose  on hearing the parrots speech the king sent for an astrologer and asked him whom shall i marry the wise man having consulted his art replied chandravati is the name of the maiden and your marriage with her will certainly take place thereupon the young raja though he had never seen his future queen became incontinently enamoured of her he summoned a brahman and sent him to king magadheshwar saying if you arrange satisfactorily this affair of our marriage we will reward you amplya promise which lent wings to the priest  now it so happened that this talented and beautiful princess had a jayfn74 whose name was madanmanjari or lovegarland she also possessed encyclopaedic knowledge after her degree and like the parrot she spoke excellent sanscrit  be it briefly said o warrior kingfor you think that i am talking fablesthat in the days of old men had the art of making birds discourse in human language the invention is attributed to a great philosopher who split their tongues and after many generations produced a selected race born with those members split he altered the shapes of their skulls by fixing ligatures behind the occiput which caused the sinciput to protrude their eyes to become prominent and their brains to master the art of expressing thoughts in words  but this wonderful discovery like those of great philosophers generally had in it a terrible practical flaw the birds beginning to speak spoke wisely and so well they told the truth so persistently they rebuked their brethren of the featherless skins so openly they flattered them so little and they counselled them so much that mankind presently grew tired of hearing them discourse thus the art gradually fell into desuetude and now it is numbered with the things that were  one day the charming princess chandravati was sitting in confidential conversation with her jay the dialogue was not remarkable for maidens in all ages seldom consult their confidantes or speculate upon the secrets of futurity or ask to have dreams interpreted except upon one subject at last the princess said for perhaps the hundredth time that month where o jay is there a husband worthy of me  princess replied madanmanjari i am happy at length to be able as willing to satisfy your just curiosity for just it is though the delicacy of our sex   now no preaching said the maiden or thou shalt have salt instead of sugar for supper  jays your rajaship are fond of sugar so the confidante retained a quantity of good advice which she was about to produce and replied  i now see clearly the ways of fortune raja ram king of bhogavati is to be thy husband he shall be happy in thee and thou in him for he is young and handsome rich and generous goodtempered not too clever and without a chance of being an invalid  thereupon the princess although she had never seen her future husband at once began to love him in fact though neither had set eyes upon the other both were mutually in love  how can that be sire asked the young dharma dhwaj of his father  i always thought that   the great vikram interrupted his son and bade him not to ask silly questions thus he expected to neutralize the evil effects of the baitals doctrine touching the amiability of parents unlike himself  now as both these young people resumed the baital were of princely family and well to do in the world the course of their love was unusually smooth when the brahman sent by raja ram had reached magadh and had delivered his kings homage to the raja magadheshwar the latter received him with distinction and agreed to his proposal the beautiful princesss father sent for a brahman of his own and charging him with nuptial gifts and the customary presents sent him back to bhogavati in company with the other envoy and gave him this order greet raja ram on my behalf and after placing the tilak or mark upon his forehead return here with all speed when you come back i will get all things ready for the marriage  raja ram on receiving the deputation was greatly pleased and after generously rewarding the brahmans and making all the necessary preparations he set out in state for the land of magadha to claim his betrothed  in due season the ceremony took place with feasting and bands of music fireworks and illuminations rehearsals of scripture songs entertainments processions and abundant noise and hardly had the turmeric disappeared from the beautiful hands and feet of the bride when the bridegroom took an affectionate leave of his new parents  he had not lived long in the house  and receiving the dowry and the bridal gifts set out for his own country  chandravati was dejected by leaving her mother and therefore she was allowed to carry with her the jay madanmanian she soon told her husband the wonderful way in which she had first heard his name and he related to her the advantage which he had derived from confabulation with churaman his parrot  then why do we not put these precious creatures into one cage after marrying them according to the rites of the angelic marriage gandharvalagana said the charming queen like most brides she was highly pleased to find an opportunity of making a match  ay why not love  surely they cannot live happy in what the world calls single blessedness replied the young king as bridegrooms sometimes are for a short time he was very warm upon the subject of matrimony  thereupon without consulting the parties chiefly concerned in their scheme the master and mistress after being comfortably settled at the end of their journey caused a large cage to be brought and put into it both their favourites  upon which churaman the parrot leaned his head on one side and directed a peculiar look at the jay but madan manjari raised her beak high in the air puffed through it once or twice and turned away her face in extreme disdain  perhaps quoth the parrot at length breaking silence you will tell me that you have no desire to be married  probably replied the jay  and why asked the male bird  because i dont choose replied the female  truly a feminine form of resolution this ejaculated the parrot i will borrow my masters words and call it a womans reason that is to say no reason at all have you any objection to be more explicit  none whatever retorted the jay provoked by the rude innuendo into telling more plainly than politely exactly what she thought none whatever sir parrot you hethings are all of you sinful treacherous deceitful selfish devoid of conscience and accustomed to sacrifice us the weaker sex to your smallest desire or convenience  of a truth fair lady quoth the young raja ram to his bride this pet of thine is sufficiently impudent  let her words be as wind in thine ear master interrupted the parrot and pray mistress jay what are you shethings but treacherous false ignorant and avaricious beings whose only wish in this world is to prevent life being as pleasant as it might be  verily my love said the beautiful chandravati to her bridegroom this thy bird has a habit of expressing his opinions in a very free and easy way  i can prove what i assert whispered the jay in the ear of the princess  we can confound their feminine minds by an anecdote whispered the parrot in the ear of the prince  briefly king vikram it was settled between the twain that each should establish the truth of what it had advanced by an illustration in the form of a story  chandravati claimed and soon obtained precedence for the jay then the wonderful bird madanmanjari began to speak as follows  i have often told thee o queen that before coming to thy feet my mistress was ratnawati the daughter of a rich trader the dearest the sweetest the    here the jay burst into tears and the mistress was sympathetically affected presently the speaker resumed   however i anticipate in the city of ilapur there was a wealthy merchant who was without offspring on this account he was continually fasting and going on pilgrimage and when at home he was ever engaged in reading the puranas and in giving alms to the brahmans  at length by favour of the deity a son was born to this merchant who celebrated his birth with great pomp and rejoicing and gave large gifts to brahmans and to bards and distributed largely to the hungry the thirsty and the poor when the boy was five years old he had him taught to read and when older he was sent to a guru who had formerly himself been a student and who was celebrated as teacher and lecturer  in the course of time the merchants son grew up praise be to brahma what a wonderful youth it was with a face like a monkeys legs like a storks and a back like a camels you know the old proverb             expect thirtytwo villanies from the limping and eighty from the oneeyed man           but when the hunchback comes say lord defend us  instead of going to study he went to gamble with other neerdoweels to whom he talked loosely and whom he taught to be badhearted as himself he made love to every woman and despite his ugliness he was not unsuccessful for they are equally fortunate who are very handsome or very ugly in so far as they are both remarkable and remarked but the latter bear away the palm beautiful men begin well with women who do all they can to attract them love them as the apples of their eyes discover them to be fools hold them to be their equals deceive them and speedily despise them it is otherwise with the ugly man who in consequence of his homeliness must work his wits and take pains with himself and become as pleasing as he is capable of being till women forget his apes face birds legs and bunchy back  the hunchback moreover became a tantri so as to complete his villanies he was duly initiated by an apostate brahman made a declaration that he renounced all the ceremonies of his old religion and was delivered from their yoke and proceeded to perform in token of joy an abominable rite in company with eight men and eight womena brahman female a dancing girl a weavers daughter a woman of ill fame a washerwoman a barbers wife a milkmaid and the daughter of a landowner choosing the darkest time of night and the most secret part of the house he drank with them was sprinkled and anointed and went through many ignoble ceremonies such as sitting nude upon a dead body the teacher informed him that he was not to indulge shame or aversion to anything nor to prefer one thing to another nor to regard caste ceremonial cleanness or uncleanness but freely to enjoy all the pleasures of sensethat is of course wine and us since we are the representatives of the wife of cupid and wine prevents the senses from going astray and whereas holy men holding that the subjugation or annihilation of the passions is essential to final beatitude accomplish this object by bodily austerities and by avoiding temptation he proceeded to blunt the edge of the passions with excessive indulgence and he jeered at the pious reminding them that their ascetics are safe only in forests and while keeping a perpetual fast but that he could subdue his passions in the very presence of what they most desired  presently this excellent youths father died leaving him immense wealth he blunted his passions so piously and so vigorously that in very few years his fortune was dissipated then he turned towards his neighbours goods and prospered for a time till being discovered robbing he narrowly escaped the stake at length he exclaimed let the gods perish the rascals send me nothing but ill luck and so saying he arose and fled from his own country  chance led that villain hunchback to the city of chandrapur where hearing the name of my master hemgupt he recollected that one of his fathers wealthiest correspondents was so called thereupon with his usual audacity he presented himself at the house walked in and although he was clothed in tatters introduced himself told his fathers name and circumstances and wept bitterly  the good man was much astonished and not less grieved to see the son of his old friend in such woful plight he rose up however embraced the youth and asked the reason of his coming  i freighted a vessel said the false hunchback for the purpose of trading to a certain land having gone there i disposed of my merchandise and taking another cargo i was on my voyage home suddenly a great storm arose and the vessel was wrecked and i escaped on a plank and after a time arrived here but i am ashamed since i have lost all my wealth and i cannot show my face in this plight in my own city my excellent father would have consoled me with his pity but now that i have carried him and my mother to gangesfn75 every one will turn against me they will rejoice in my misfortunes they will accuse me of folly and recklessness   alas alas i am truly miserable  my dear master was deceived by the cunning of the wretch he offered him hospitality which was readily enough accepted and he entertained him for some time as a guest then having reason to be satisfied with his conduct hemgupt admitted him to his secrets and finally made him a partner in his business briefly the villain played his cards so well that at last the merchant said to himself  i have had for years an anxiety and a calamity in my house my neighbours whisper things to my disadvantage and those who are bolder speak out with astonishment amongst themselves saying at seven or eight people marry their daughters and this indeed is the appointment of the law that period is long since gone she is now thirteen or fourteen years old and she is very tall and lusty resembling a married woman of thirty how can her father eat his rice with comfort and sleep with satisfaction whilst such a disreputable thing exists in his house at present he is exposed to shame and his deceased friends are suffering through his retaining a girl from marriage beyond the period which nature has prescribed and now while i am sitting quietly at home the bhagwan deity removes all my uneasiness by his favour such an opportunity occurs it is not right to delay it is best that i shall give my daughter in marriage to him whatever can be done today is best who knows what may happen tomorrow  thus thinking the old man went to his wife and said to her birth marriage and death are all under the direction of the gods can anyone say when they will be ours we want for our daughter a young man who is of good birth rich and handsome clever and honourable but we do not find him if the bridegroom be faulty thou sayest all will go wrong i cannot put a string round the neck of our daughter and throw her into the ditch if however thou think well of the merchants son now my partner we will celebrate ratnawatis marriage with him  the wife who had been won over by the hunchbacks hypocrisy was also pleased and replied my lord when the deity so plainly indicates his wish we should do it since though we have sat quietly at home the desire of our hearts is accomplished it is best that no delay be made and having quickly summoned the family priest and having fixed upon a propitious planetary conjunction that the marriage be celebrated  then they called their daughter  ah me what a beautiful being she was and worthy the love of a gandharva demigod her long hair purple with the light of youth was glossy as the bramrasfn76 wing her brow was pure and clear as the agate the oceancoral looked pale beside her lips and her teeth were as two chaplets of pearls everything in her was formed to be loved who could look into her eyes without wishing to do it again who could hear her voice without hoping that such music would sound once more and she was good as she was fair her father adored her her mother though a middleaged woman was not envious or jealous of her her relatives doted on her and her friends could find no fault with her i should never end were i to tell her precious qualities alas alas  my poor ratnawati  so saying the jay wept abundant tears then she resumed  when her parents informed my mistress of their resolution she replied sadhuit is well she was not like most young women who hate nothing so much as a man whom their seniors order them to love she bowed her head and promised obedience although as she afterwards told her mother she could hardly look at her intended on account of his prodigious ugliness but presently the hunchbacks wit surmounted her disgust she was grateful to him for his attention to her father and mother she esteemed him for his moral and religious conduct she pitied him for his misfortunes and she finished with forgetting his face legs and back in her admiration of what she supposed to be his mind  she had vowed before marriage faithfully to perform all the duties of a wife however distasteful to her they might be but after the nuptials which were not long deferred she was not surprised to find that she loved her husband not only did she omit to think of his features and figure i verily believe that she loved him the more for his repulsiveness ugly very ugly men prevail over women for two reasons firstly we begin with repugnance which in the course of nature turns to affection and we all like the most that which when unaccustomed to it we most disliked hence the poet says with as much truth as is in the male            never despair o man when womans spite           detests thy name and sickens at thy sight           sometime her heart shall learn to love thee more           for the wild hatred which it felt before c  secondly the very ugly man appears deceitfully enough to think little of his appearance and he will give himself the trouble to pursue a heart because he knows that the heart will not follow after him moreover we women said the jay are by nature pitiful and this our enemies term a strange perversity a widow is generally disconsolate if she loses a little wizenfaced shrunken shanked ugly spiteful distempered thing that scolded her and quarrelled with her and beat her and made her hours bitter whereas she will follow her husband to ganges with exemplary fortitude if he was brave handsome generous    either hold your tongue or go on with your story cried the warrior king in whose mind these remarks awakened disagreeable family reflections  hi hi hi laughed the demon i will obey your majesty and make madanmanjari the misanthropical jay proceed  yes she loved the hunchback and how wonderful is our love quoth the jay a light from heaven which rains happiness on this dull dark earth a spell falling upon the spirit which reminds us of a higher existence a memory of bliss a present delight an earnest of future felicity it makes hideousness beautiful and stupidity clever old age young and wickedness good moroseness amiable and lowmindedness magnanimous perversity pretty and vulgarity piquant truly it is sovereign alchemy and excellent flux for blending contradictions is our love exclaimed the jay  and so saying she cast a triumphant look at the parrot who only remarked that he could have desired a little more originality in her remarks  for some months resumed madanmanjari the bride and the bridegroom lived happily together in hemgupts house but it is said            never yet did the tiger become a lamb  and the hunchback felt that the edge of his passions again wanted blunting he reflected wisdom is exemption from attachment and affection for children wife and home then he thus addressed my poor young mistress  i have been now in thy country some years and i have heard no tidings of my own family hence my mind is sad i have told thee everything about myself thou must now ask thy mother leave for me to go to my own city and if thou wishest thou mayest go with me  ratnawati lost no time in saying to her mother my husband wishes to visit his own country will you so arrange that he may not be pained about this matter  the mother went to her husband and said your soninlaw desires leave to go to his own country  hemgupt replied  very well we will grant him leave one has no power over another mans son we will do what he wishes  the parents then called their daughter and asked her to tell them her real desirewhether she would go to her fatherinlaws house or would remain in her mothers home she was abashed at this question and could not answer but she went back to her husband and said as my father and mother have declared that you should do as you like do not leave me behind  presently the merchant summoned his soninlaw and having bestowed great wealth upon him allowed him to depart he also bade his daughter farewell after giving her a palanquin and a female slave and the parents took leave of them with wailing and bitter tears their hearts were like to break and so was mine  for some days the hunchback travelled quietly along with his wife in deep thought he could not take her to his city where she would find out his evil life and the fraud which he had passed upon her father besides which although he wanted her money he by no means wanted her company for life after turning on many projects in his evilbegotten mind he hit upon the following  he dismissed the palanquinbearers when halting at a little shed in the thick jungle through which they were travelling and said to his wife this is a place of danger give me thy jewels and i will hide them in my waistshawl when thou reachest the city thou canst wear them again she then gave up to him all her ornaments which were of great value thereupon he inveigled the slave girl into the depths of the forest where he murdered her and left her body to be devoured by wild beasts lastly returning to my poor mistress he induced her to leave the hut with him and pushed her by force into a dry well after which exploit he set out alone with his illgotten wealth walking towards his own city  in the meantime a wayfaring man who was passing through that jungle hearing the sound of weeping stood still and began to say to himself how came to my ears the voice of a mortals grief in this wild wood then followed the direction of the noise which led him a pit and peeping over the side he saw a woman crying at the bottom the traveller at once loosened his gird cloth knotted it to his turband and letting down the line pulled out the poor bride he asked her who she was and how she came to fall into that well she replied i am the daughter of hemgupt the wealthiest merchant in the city of chandrapur and i was journeying with my husband to his own country when robbers set upon us and surrounded us they slew my slave girl the threw me into a well and having bound my husband they took him away together with my jewels i have no tidings of him nor he of me and so saying she burst into tears and lamentations  the wayfaring man believed her tale and conducted her to her home where she gave the same account of the accident which had befallen her ending with beyond this i know not if they have killed my husband or have let him go the father thus soothed her grief daughter have no anxiety thy husband is alive and by the will of the deity he will come to thee in a few days thieves take mens money not their lives then the parents presented her with ornaments more precious than those which she had lost and summoning their relations and friends they comforted her to the best of their power  and so did i the wicked hunchback had meanwhile returned to his own city where he was excellently well received because he brought much wealth with him his old associates flocked around him rejoicing and he fell into the same courses which had beggared him before gambling and debauchery soon blunted his passions and emptied his purse again his boon companions finding him without a broken cowrie drove him from their doors he stole and was flogged for theft and lastly half famished he fled the city then he said to himself i must go to my fatherinlaw and make the excuse that a grandson has been born to him and that i have come to offer him congratulations on the event  imagine however his fears and astonishment when as he entered the house his wife stood before him at first he thought it was a ghost and turned to run away but she went out to him and said husband be not troubled  i have told my father that thieves came upon us and killed the slave girl and robbed me and threw me into a well and bound thee and carried thee off tell the same story and put away all anxious feelings come up and change thy tattered garmentsalas some misfortune hath befallen thee but console thyself all is now well since thou art returned to me and fear not for the house is thine and i am thy slave  the wretch with all his hardness of heart could scarcely refrain from tears he followed his wife to her room where she washed his feet caused him to bathe dressed him in new clothes and placed food before him when her parents returned she presented him to their embrace saying in a glad way rejoice with me o my father and mother the robbers have at length allowed him to come back to us of course the parents were deceived they are mostly a purblind race and hemgupt showing great favour to his worthless soninlaw exclaimed remain with us my son and be happy  for two or three months the hunchback lived quietly with his wife treating her kindly and even affectionately but this did not last long he made acquaintance with a band of thieves and arranged his plans with them  after a time his wife one night came to sleep by his side having put on all her jewels at midnight when he saw that she was fast asleep he struck her with a knife so that she died then he admitted his accomplices who savagely murdered hemgupt and his wife and with their assistance he carried off any valuable article upon which he could lay his hands the ferocious wretch as he passed my cage he looked at it and thought whether he had time to wring my neck the barking of a dog saved my life but my mistress my poor ratnawatiah me ah me   queen said the jay in deepest grief all this have i seen with mine own eyes and have heard with mine own ears it affected me in early life and gave me a dislike for the society of the other sex with due respect to you i have resolved to remain an old maid let your majesty reflect what crime had my poor mistress committed a male is of the same disposition as a highway robber and she who forms friendship with such an one cradles upon her bosom a black and venomous snake  sir parrot said the jay turning to her wooer i have spoken i have nothing more to say but that you hethings are all a treacherous selfish wicked race created for the express purpose of working our worldly woe and  when a female o my king asserts that she has nothing more to say but broke in churaman the parrot with a loud dogmatical voice i know that what she has said merely whets her tongue for what she is about to say this person has surely spoken long enough and drearily enough  tell me then o parrot said the king what faults there may be in the other sex  i will relate quoth churaman an occurrence which in my early youth determined me to live and to die an old bachelor  when quite a young bird and before my schooling began i was caught in the land of malaya and was sold to a very rich merchant called sagardati a widower with one daughter the lady jayashri as her father spent all his days and half his nights in his countinghouse conning his ledgers and scolding his writers that young woman had more liberty than is generally allowed to those of her age and a mighty bad use she made of it  o king men commit two capital mistakes in rearing the domestic calamity and these are overvigilance and undervigilance some parents never lose sight of their daughters suspect them of all evil intentions and are silly enough to show their suspicions which is an incentive to evildoing for the weakminded things do naturally say i will be wicked at once what do i now but suffer all the pains and penalties of badness without enjoying its pleasures and so they are guilty of many evil actions for however vigilant fathers and mothers may be the daughter can always blind their eyes  on the other hand many parents take no trouble whatever with their charges they allow them to sit in idleness the origin of badness they permit them to communicate with the wicked and they give them liberty which breeds opportunity thus they also falling into the snares of the unrighteous who are ever a more painstaking race than the righteous are guilty of many evil actions  what then must wise parents do the wise will study the characters of their children and modify their treatment accordingly if a daughter be naturally good she will be treated with a prudent confidence if she be vicious an apparent trust will be reposed in her but her father and mother will secretly ever be upon their guard the oneidead    all this parrotprate i suppose is only intended to vex me cried the warrior king who always considered himself and very naturally a person of such consequence as ever to be uppermost in the thoughts and minds of others if thou must tell a tale then tell one vampire or else be silent as i am sick to the death of thy psychics  it is well o warrior king resumed the baital  after that churaman the parrot had given the young raja ram a golden mine full of good advice about the management of daughters he proceeded to describe jayashri  she was tall stout and well made of lymphatic temperament and yet strong passions her fine large eyes had heavy and rather full eyelids which are to be avoided her hands were symmetrical without being small and the palms were ever warm and damp though her lips were good her mouth was somewhat underhung and her voice was so deep that at times it sounded like that of a man her hair was smooth as the kokilas plume and her complexion was that of the young jasmine and these were the points at which most persons looked altogether she was neither handsome nor ugly which is an excellent thing in woman sita the goddessfn77 was lovely to excess therefore she was carried away by a demon raja bali was exceedingly generous and he emptied his treasury in this way exaggeration even of good is exceedingly bad  yet must i confess continued the parrot that as a rule the beautiful woman is more virtuous than the ugly the former is often tempted but her vanity and conceit enable her to resist by the selfpromise that she shall be tempted again and again on the other hand the ugly woman must tempt instead of being tempted and she must yield because her vanity and conceit are gratified by yielding not by resisting  ho there broke in the jay contemptuously what woman cannot win the hearts of the silly things called men is it not said that a pigfaced female who dwells in landanpur has a lover  i was about to remark my king said the parrot somewhat nettled if the aged virgin had not interrupted me that as ugly women are more vicious than handsome women so they are most successful we love the pretty we adore the plain is a true saying amongst the worldly wise and why do we adore the plain because they seem to think less of themselves than of usa vital condition of adoration  jayashri made some conquests by the portion of good looks which she possessed more by her impudence and most by her fathers reputation for riches she was truly shameless and never allowed herself fewer than half a dozen admirers at the time her chief amusement was to appoint interviews with them successively at intervals so short that she was obliged to hurry away one in order to make room for another and when a lover happened to be jealous or ventured in any way to criticize her arrangements she replied at once by showing him the door answer unanswerable  when jayashri had reached the ripe age of thirteen the son of a merchant who was her fathers gossip and neighbour returned home after a long sojourn in far lands whither he had travelled in the search of wealth the poor wretch whose name bythebye was shridat gift of fortune had loved her in her childhood and he came back as men are apt to do after absence from familiar scenes painfully full of affection for house and home and all belonging to it from his cross stingy old uncle to the snarling superannuated beast of a watchdog he viewed all with eyes of love and melting heart he could not see that his idol was greatly changed and nowise for the better that her nose was broader and more clublike her eyelids fatter and thicker her under lip more prominent her voice harsher and her manner coarser he did not notice that she was an adept in judging of mens dress and that she looked with admiration upon all swordsmen especially upon those who fought upon horses and elephants the charm of memory the curious faculty of making past time present caused all he viewed to be enchanting to him  having obtained her fathers permission shridat applied for betrothal to jayashri who with peculiar boldness had resolved that no suitor should come to her through her parent and she after leading him on by all the coquetries of which she was a mistress refused to marry him saying that she liked him as a friend but would hate him as a husband  you see my king there are three several states of feeling with which women regard their masters and these are love hate and indifference of all love is the weakest and the most transient because the essentially unstable creatures naturally fall out of it as readily as they fall into it hate being a sister excitement will easily become if a man has wit enough to effect the change love and hatelove may perhaps last a little longer than lovelove also man has the occupation the excitement and the pleasure of bringing about the change as regards the neutral state that poet was not happy in his ideas who sang                  wheneer indifference appears or scorn                then man despair then hapless lover mourn  for a man versed in the lila shastrafn78 can soon turn a womans indifference into hate which i have shown is as easily permuted to love in which predicament it is the old thing over again and it ends in the pure asatfn79 or nonentity  which of these two birds the jay or the parrot had dipped deeper into human nature mighty king vikram asked the demon in a wheedling tone of voice  the trap was this time set too openly even for the royal personage to fall into it he hurried on calling to his son and not answering a word the vampire therefore resumed the thread of his story at the place where he had broken it off  shridat was in despair when he heard the resolve of his idol he thought of drowning himself of throwing himself down from the summit of mount girnarfn80 of becoming a religious beggar in short of a multitude of follies but he refrained from all such heroic remedies for despair having rightly judged when he became somewhat calmer that they would not be likely to further his suit he discovered that patience is a virtue and he resolved impatiently enough to practice it and by perseverance he succeeded the worse for him how vain are men to wish how wise is the deity who is deaf to their wishes  jayashri for potent reasons best known to herself was married to shridat six months after his return home he was in raptures he called himself the happiest man in existence he thanked and sacrificed to the bhagwan for listening to his prayers he recalled to mind with thrilling heart the long years which he had spent in hopeless exile from all that was dear to him his sadness and anxiety his hopes and joys his toils and troubles his loyal love and his vows to heaven for the happiness of his idol and for the furtherance of his fondest desires  for truly he loved her continued the parrot and there is something holy in such love it becomes not only a faith but the best of faithsan abnegation of self which emancipates the spirit from its straightest and earthliest bondage the i the first step in the regions of heaven a homage rendered through the creature to the creator a devotion solid practical ardent not as worship mostly is a cold and lifeless abstraction a merging of human nature into one far nobler and higher the spiritual existence of the supernal world for perfect love is perfect happiness and the only perfection of man and what is a demon but a being without love and what makes mans love truly divine is the fact that it is bestowed upon such a thing as woman  and now raja vikram said the vampire speaking in his proper person i have given you madanmanjari the jays and churaman the parrots definitions of the tender passion or rather their descriptions of its effects kindly observe that i am far from accepting either one or the other love is according to me somewhat akin to mania a temporary condition of selfishness a transient confusion of identity it enables man to predicate of others who are his other selves that which he is ashamed to say about his real self i will suppose the beloved object to be ugly stupid vicious perverse selfish low minded or the reverse man finds it charming by the same rule that makes his faults and foibles dearer to him than all the virtues and good qualities of his neighbours ye call love a spell an alchemy a deity why because it deifies self by gratifying all mans pride mans vanity and mans conceit under the mask of complete unegotism who is not in heaven when he is talking of himself and prithee of what else consists all the talk of lovers  it is astonishing that the warrior king allowed this speech to last as long as it did he hated nothing so fiercely now that he was in middleage as any long mention of the handsome godfn81 having vainly endeavoured to stop by angry mutterings the course of the baitals eloquence he stepped out so vigorously and so rudely shook that inveterate talker that the latter once or twice nearly bit off the tip of his tongue then the vampire became silent and vikram relapsed into a walk which allowed the tale to be resumed  jayashri immediately conceived a strong dislike for her husband and simultaneously a fierce affection for a reprobate who before had been indifferent to her the more lovingly shridat behaved to her the more vexed end annoyed she was when her friends talked to her she turned up her nose raising her eyebrows in token of displeasure and remained silent when her husband spoke words of affection to her she found them disagreeable and turning away her face reclined on the bed then he brought dresses and ornaments of various kinds and presented them to her saying wear these whereupon she would become more angry knit her brows turn her face away and in an audible whisper call him fool all day she stayed out of the house saying to her companions sisters my youth is passing away and i have not up to the present time tasted any of this worlds pleasures then she would ascend to the balcony peep through the lattice and seeing the reprobate going along she would cry to her friend bring that person to me all night she tossed and turned from side to side reflecting in her heart i am puzzled in my mind what i shall say and whither i shall go i have forgotten sleep hunger and thirst neither heat nor cold is refreshing to me  at last unable any longer to support the separation from her reprobate paramour whom she adored she resolved to fly with him on one occasion when she thought that her husband was fast asleep she rose up quietly and leaving him made her way fearlessly in the dark night to her lovers abode a footpad who saw her on the way thought to himself where can this woman clothed in jewels be going alone at midnight and thus he followed her unseen and watched her  when jayashri reached the intended place she went into the house and found her lover lying at the door he was dead having been stabbed by the footpad but she thinking that he had according to custom drunk intoxicating hemp sat upon the floor and raising his head placed it tenderly in her lap then burning with the fire of separation from him she began to kiss his cheeks and to fondle and caress him with the utmost freedom and affection  by chance a pisach evil spirit was seated in a large figtreefn82 opposite the house and it occurred to him when beholding this scene that he might amuse himself in a characteristic way he therefore hopped down from his branch vivified the body and began to return the womans caresses but as jayashri bent down to kiss his lips he caught the end of her nose in his teeth and bit it clean off he then issued from the corpse and returned to the branch where he had been sitting  jayashri was in despair she did not however lose her presence of mind but sat down and proceeded to take thought and when she had matured her plan she arose dripping with blood and walked straight home to her husbands house on entering his room she clapped her hand to her nose and began to gnash her teeth and to shriek so violently that all the members of the family were alarmed the neighbours also collected in numbers at the door and as it was bolted inside they broke it open and rushed in carrying lights there they saw the wife sitting upon the ground with her face mutilated and the husband standing over her apparently trying to appease her  o ignorant criminal shameless pitiless wretch cried the people especially the women why hast thou cut off her nose she not having offended in any way  poor shridat seeing at once the trick which had been played upon him thought to himself one should put no confidence in a changeful mind a black serpent or an armed enemy and one should dread a womans doings what cannot a poet describe what is there that a saint jogi does not know what nonsense will not a drunken man talk what limit is there to a womans guile true it is that the gods know nothing of the defects of a horse of the thundering of clouds of a womans deeds or of a mans future fortunes how then can we know he could do nothing but weep and swear by the herb basil by his cattle by his grain by a piece of gold and by all that is holy that he had not committed the crime  in the meanwhile the old merchant jayashris father ran off and laid a complaint before the kotwal and the footmen of the police magistrate were immediately sent to apprehend the husband and to carry him bound before the judge the latter after due examination laid the affair before the king an example happening to be necessary at the time the king resolved to punish the offence with severity and he summoned the husband and wife to the court  when the merchants daughter was asked to give an account of what had happened she pointed out the state of her nose and said maharaj why inquire of me concerning what is so manifest the king then turned to the husband and bade him state his defence he said i know nothing of it and in the face of the strongest evidence he persisted in denying his guilt  thereupon the king who had vainly threatened to cut off shridats right hand infuriated by his refusing to confess and to beg for mercy exclaimed how must i punish such a wretch as thou art the unfortunate man answered whatever your majesty may consider just that be pleased to do thereupon the king cried away with him and impale him and the people hearing the command prepared to obey it  before shridat had left the court the footpad who had been looking on and who saw that an innocent man was about to be unjustly punished raised a cry for justice and pushing through the crowd resolved to make himself heard he thus addressed the throne great king the cherishing of the good and the punishment of the bad is the invariable duty of kings the ruler having caused him to approach asked him who he was and he replied boldly  maharaj i am a thief and this man is innocent and his blood is about to be shed unjustly your majesty has not done what is right in this affair thereupon the king charged him to tell the truth according to his religion and the thief related explicitly the whole circumstances omitting of course the murder  go ye said the king to his messengers and look in the mouth of the womans lover who has fallen dead if the nose be there found then has this thiefwitness told the truth and the husband is a guiltless man  the nose was presently produced in court and shridat escaped the stake the king caused the wicked jayashris face to be smeared with oily soot and her head and eyebrows to be shaved thus blackened and disfigured she was mounted upon a little raggedlimbed ass and was led around the market and the streets after which she was banished for ever from the city the husband and the thief were then dismissed with betel and other gifts together with much sage advice which neither of them wanted  my king resumed the misogyne parrot of such excellencies as these are women composed it is said that wet cloth will extinguish fire and bad food will destroy strength a degenerate son ruins a family and when a friend is in wrath he takes away life but a woman is an inflicter of grief in love and in hate whatever she does turns out to be for our ill truly the deity has created woman a strange being in this world and again the beauty of the nightingale is its song science is the beauty of an ugly man forgiveness is the beauty of a devotee and the beauty of a woman is virtuebut where shall we find it and again among the sages narudu among the beasts the jackal among the birds the crow among men the barber and in this world womanis the most crafty  what i have told thee my king i have seen with mine own eyes and i have heard with mine own ears at the time i was young but the event so affected me that i have ever since held female kind to be a walking pest a twolegged plague whose mission on earth like flies and other vermin is only to prevent our being too happy o why do not children and young parrots sprout in crops from the groundfrom budding trees or vinestocks  i was thinking sire said the young dharma dhwaj to the warrior king his father what women would say of us if they could compose sanskrit verses  then keep your thoughts to yourself replied the raja nettled at his son daring to say a word in favour of the sex you always take the part of wickedness and depravity   permit me your majesty interrupted the baital to conclude my tale  when madanmanjari the jay and churaman the parrot had given these illustrations of their belief they began to wrangle and words ran high the former insisted that females are the salt of the earth speaking i presume figuratively the latter went so far as to assert that the opposite sex have no souls and that their brains are in a rudimental and inchoate state of development thereupon he was tartly taken to task by his masters bride the beautiful chandravati who told him that those only have a bad opinion of women who have associated with none but the vicious and the low and that he should be ashamed to abuse feminine parrots because his mother had been one  this was truly logical  on the other hand the jay was sternly reproved for her mutinous and treasonable assertions by the husband of her mistress raja ram who although still a bridegroom had not forgotten the gallant rule of his syntax                  the masculine is more worthy than the feminine  till madanmanjari burst into tears and declared that her life was not worth having and raja ram looked at her as if he could have wrung her neck  in short raja vikram all the four lost their tempers and with them what little wits they had two of them were but birds and the others seem not to have been much better being young ignorant inexperienced and lately married how then could they decide so difficult a question as that of the relative wickedness and villany of men and women had your majesty been there the knot of uncertainty would soon have been undone by the trenchant edge of your wit and wisdom your knowledge and experience you have of course long since made up your mind upon the subject  dharma dhwaj would have prevented his fathers reply but the youth had been twice reprehended in the course of this tale and he thought it wisest to let things take their own way  women quoth the raja oracularly are worse than we are a man however depraved he may be ever retains some notion of right and wrong but a woman does not she has no such regard whatever  the beautiful bangalah rani for instance said the baital with a demonaic sneer  at the mention of a word the uttering of which was punishable by extirpation of the tongue raja vikrams brain whirled with rage he staggered in the violence of his passion and putting forth both hands to break his fall he dropped the bundle from his back then the baital disentangling himself and laughing lustily ran off towards the tree as fast as his thin brown legs would carry him but his activity availed him little  the king puffing with fury followed him at the top of his speed and caught him by his tail before he reached the sirastree hurled him backwards with force put foot upon his chest and after shaking out the cloth rolled him up in it with extreme violence bumped his back half a dozen times against the stony ground and finally with a jerk threw him on his shoulder as he had done before  the young prince afraid to accompany his father whilst he was pursuing the fiend followed slowly in the rear and did not join him for some minutes  but when matters were in their normal state the vampire who had endured with exemplary patience the penalty of his impudence began in honeyed accents  listen o warrior king whilst thy servant recounts unto thee another true tale            the vampires third story            of a highminded family  in the venerable city of bardwan o warrior king quoth the vampire during the reign of the mighty rupsen flourished one rajeshwar a rajput warrior of distinguished fame by his valour and conduct he had risen from the lowest ranks of the army to command it as its captain and arrived at that dignity he did not put a stop to all improvements like other chiefs who rejoice to rest and return thanks on the contrary he became such a reformer that to some extent he remodelled the art of war  instead of attending to rules and regulations drawn up in their studies by pandits and brahmans he consulted chiefly his own experience and judgment he threw aside the systematic plans of campaigns laid down in the shastras or books of the ancients and he acted upon the spur of the moment he displayed a skill in the choice of ground in the use of light troops and in securing his own supplies whilst he cut off those of the enemy which kartikaya himself god of war might have envied finding that the bows of his troops were clumsy and slow to use he had them all changed before compelled so to do by defeat he also gave his attention to the sword handles which cramped the mens grasp but which having been used for eighteen hundred years were considered perfect weapons and having organized a special corps of warriors using fire arrows he soon brought it to such perfection that by using it against the elephants of his enemies he gained many a campaign  one instance of his superior judgment i am about to quote to thee o vikram after which i return to my tale for thou art truly a warrior king very likely to imitate the innovations of the great general rajeshwar  a grunt from the monarch was the result of the vampires sneer  he found his masters armies recruited from northern hindustan and officered by kshatriya warriors who grew great only because they grew old and  fat thus the energy and talent of the younger men were wasted in troubles and disorders whilst the seniors were often so ancient that they could not mount their chargers unaided nor when they were mounted could they see anything a dozen yards before them but they had served in a certain obsolete campaign and until rajeshwar gave them pensions and dismissals they claimed a right to take first part in all campaigns present and future the commanderinchief refused to use any captain who could not stand steady on his legs or endure the sun for a whole day when a soldier distinguished himself in action he raised him to the powers and privileges of the warrior caste and whereas it had been the habit to lavish circles and bars of silver and other metals upon all those who had joined in the war whether they had sat behind a heap of sand or had been foremost to attack the foe he broke through the pernicious custom and he rendered the honour valuable by conferring it only upon the deserving i need hardly say that in an inordinately short space of time his army beat every king and general that opposed it  one day the great commanderinchief was seated in a certain room near the threshold of his gate when the voices of a number of people outside were heard rajeshwar asked who is at the door and what is the meaning of the noise i hear the porter replied it is a fine thing your honour has asked many persons come sitting at the door of the rich for the purpose of obtaining a livelihood and wealth when they meet together they talk of various things it is these very people who are now making this noise  rajeshwar on hearing this remained silent  in the meantime a traveller a rajput birbal by name hoping to obtain employment came from the southern quarter to the palace of the chief the porter having listened to his story made the circumstance known to his master saying o chief an armed man has arrived here hoping to obtain employment and is standing at the door if i receive a command he shall be brought into your honours presence  bring him in cried the commanderinchief  the porter brought him in and rajeshwar inquired o rajput who and what art thou  birbal submitted that he was a person of distinguished fame for the use of weapons and that his name for fidelity and valour had gone forth to the utmost ends of bharatkandhafn83  the chief was well accustomed to this style of self introduction and its only effect upon his mind was a wish to shame the man by showing him that he had not the least knowledge of weapons he therefore bade him bare his blade and perform some feat  birbal at once drew his good sword guessing the thoughts which were hovering about the chiefs mind he put forth his left hand extending the forefinger upwards waved his blade like the arm of a demon round his head and with a dexterous stroke so shaved off a bit of nail that it fell to the ground and not a drop of blood appeared upon the fingertip  live for ever exclaimed rajeshwar in admiration he then addressed to the recruit a few questions concerning the art of war or rather concerning his peculiar views of it to all of which birbal answered with a spirit and a judgment which convinced the hearer that he was no common sworder  whereupon rajeshwar bore off the new man at arms to the palace of the king rupsen and recommended that he should be engaged without delay  the king being a man of few words and many ideas after hearing his commanderinchief asked o rajput what shall i give thee for thy daily expenditure  give me a thousand ounces of gold daily said birbal and then i shall have wherewithal to live on  hast thou an army with thee exclaimed the king in the greatest astonishment  i have not responded the rajput somewhat stiffly i have first a wife second a son third a daughter fourth myself there is no fifth person with me  all the people of the court on hearing this turned aside their heads to laugh and even the women who were peeping at the scene covered their mouths with their veils the rajput was then dismissed the presence  it is however noticeable amongst you humans that the world often takes you at your own valuation set a high price upon yourselves and each man shall say to his neighbour in this man there must be something tell everyone that you are brave clever generous or even handsome and after a time they will begin to believe you and when thus you have attained success it will be harder to unconvince them than it was to convince them thus    listen not to him sirrah cried raja vikram to dharma dhwaj the young prince who had fallen a little way behind and was giving ear attentively to the vampires ethics listen to him not and tell me villain with these ignoble principles of thine what will become of modesty humility selfsacrifice and a host of other guna or good qualities which  which are good qualities  i know not rejoined the baital neither do i care but my habitually inspiriting a succession of human bodies has taught me one fact the wise man knows himself and is therefore neither unduly humble nor elated because he had no more to do with making himself than with the cut of his cloak or with the fitness of his loincloth but the fool either loses his head by comparing himself with still greater fools or is prostrated when he finds himself inferior to other and lesser fools this shyness he calls modesty humility and so forth now whenever entering a corpse whether it be of man woman or child i feel peculiarly modest i know that my tenement lately belonged to some conceited ass and   wouldst thou have me bump thy back against the ground asked raja vikram angrily  the baital muttered some reply scarcely intelligible about his having this time stumbled upon a metaphysical thread of ideas and then continued his story  now rupsen the king began by inquiring of himself why the rajput had rated his services so highly then he reflected that if this recruit had asked so much money it must have been for some reason which would afterwards become apparent next he hoped that if he gave him so much his generosity might some day turn out to his own advantage finally with this idea in his mind he summoned birbal and the steward of his household and said to the latter give this rajput a thousand ounces of gold daily from our treasury  it is related that birbal made the best possible use of his wealth he used every morning to divide it into two portions one of which was distributed to brahmans and parohitasfn84 of the remaining moiety having made two parts he gave one as alms to pilgrims to bairagis or vishnus mendicants and to sanyasis or worshippers of shiva whose bodies smeared with ashes were hardly covered with a narrow cotton cloth and a rope about their loins and whose heads of artificial hair clotted like a rope besieged his gate with the remaining fourth having caused food to be prepared he regaled the poor while he himself and his family ate what was left every evening arming himself with sword and buckler he took up his position as guard at the royal bedside and walked round it all night sword in hand if the king chanced to wake and asked who was present birbal immediately gave reply that birbal is here whatever command you give that he will obey and oftentimes rupsen gave him unusual commands for it is said to try thy servant bid him do things in season and out of season if he obey thee willingly know him to be useful if he reply dismiss him at once thus is a servant tried even as a wife by the poverty of her husband and brethren and friends by asking their aid  in such manner through desire of money birbal remained on guard all night and whether eating drinking sleeping sitting going or wandering about during the twentyfour hours he held his master in watchful remembrance this indeed is the custom if a man sell another the latter is sold but a servant by doing service sells himself and when a man has become dependent how can he be happy certain it is that however intelligent clever or learned a man may be yet while he is in his masters presence he remains silent as a dumb man and struck with dread only while he is away from his lord can he be at ease hence learned men say that to do service aright is harder than any religious study  on one occasion it is related that there happened to be heard at nighttime the wailing of a woman in a neighbouring cemetery the king on hearing it called out who is in waiting  i am here replied birbal what command is there  go spoke the king to the place whence proceeds this sound of womans wail and having inquired the cause of her grief return quickly  on receiving this order the rajput went to obey it and the king unseen by him and attired in a black dress followed for the purpose of observing his courage  presently birbal arrived at the cemetery and what sees he there a beautiful woman of a light yellow colour loaded with jewels from head to foot holding a horn in her right and a necklace in her left hand sometimes she danced sometimes she jumped and sometimes she ran about there was not a tear in her eye but beating her head and making lamentable cries she kept dashing herself on the ground  seeing her condition and not recognizing the goddess born of sea foam and whom all the host of heaven lovedfn85 birbal inquired why art thou thus beating thyself and crying out who art thou and what grief is upon thee  i am the royalluck she replied  for what reason asked birbal art thou weeping  the goddess then began to relate her position to the rajput she said with tears in the kings palace shudra or low caste acts are done and hence misfortune will certainly fall upon it and i shall forsake it after a month has passed the king having endured excessive affliction will die in grief for this i weep i have brought much happiness to the kings house and hence i am full of regret that this my prediction cannot in any way prove untrue  is there asked birbal any remedy for this trouble so that the king may be preserved and live a hundred years  yes said the goddess there is about eight miles to the east thou wilt find a temple dedicated to my terrible sister devi offer to her thy sons head cut off with thine own hand and the reign of thy king shall endure for an age so saying rajlakshmi disappeared  birbal answered not a word but with hurried steps he turned towards his home the king still in black so as not to be seen followed him closely and observed and listened to everything he did  the rajput went straight to his wife awakened her and related to her everything that had happened the wise have said she alone deserves the name of wife who always receives her husband with affectionate and submissive words when she heard the circumstances she at once aroused her son and her daughter also awoke then birbal told them all that they must follow him to the temple of devi in the wood  on the way the rajput said to his wife if thou wilt give up thy son willingly i will sacrifice him for our masters sake to devi the destroyer  she replied father and mother son and daughter brother and relative have i now none you are everything to me it is written in the scripture that a wife is not made pure by gifts to priests nor by performing religious rites her virtue consists in waiting upon her husband in obeying him and in loving him  yea though he be lame maimed in the hands dumb deaf blind one eyed leprous or humpbacked it is a true saying that a son under ones authority a body free from sickness a desire to acquire knowledge an intelligent friend and an obedient wife whoever holds these five will find them bestowers of happiness and dispellers of affliction an unwilling servant a parsimonious king an insincere friend and a wife not under control such things are disturbers of ease and givers of trouble  then the good wife turned to her son and said child by the gift of thy head the kings life may be spared and the kingdom remain unshaken  mother replied that excellent youth in my opinion we should hasten this matter firstly i must obey your command secondly i must promote the interests of my master thirdly if this body be of any use to a goddess nothing better can be done with it in this world  excuse me raja vikram said the baital interrupting himself if i repeat these fair discourses at full length it is interesting to hear a young person whose throat is about to be cut talk so like a doctor of laws  then the youth thus addressed his sire father whoever can be of use to his master the life of that man in this world has been lived to good purpose and by reason of his usefulness he will be rewarded in other worlds  his sister however exclaimed if a mother should give poison to her daughter and a father sell his son and a king seize the entire property of his subjects where then could one look for protection but they heeded her not and continued talking as they journeyed towards the temple of devi  the king all the while secretly following them  presently they reached the temple a single room surrounded by a spacious paved area in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people before the image there were pools of blood where victims had lately been slaughtered in the sanctum was devi a large black figure with ten arms with a spear in one of her right hands she pierced the giant mahisha and with one of her left hands she held the tail of a serpent and the hair of the giant whose breast the serpent was biting her other arms were all raised above her head and were filled with different instruments of war against her right leg leaned a lion  then birbal joined his hands in prayer and with hindu mildness thus addressed the awful goddess o mother let the kings life be prolonged for a thousand years by the sacrifice of my son o devi mother destroy destroy his enemies kill kill reduce them to ashes drive them away devour them devour them cut them in two drink drink their blood destroy them root and branch with thy thunderbolt spear scymitar discus or rope annihilate them spheng spheng  the rajput having caused his son to kneel before the goddess struck him so violent a blow that his head rolled upon the ground he then threw the sword down when his daughter frantic with grief snatched it up and struck her neck with such force that her head separated from her body fell in her turn the mother unable to survive the loss of her children seized the weapon and succeeded in decapitating herself birbal beholding all this slaughter thus reflected my children are dead why now should i remain in servitude and upon whom shall i bestow the gold i receive from the king he then gave himself so deep a wound in the neck that his head also separated from his body  rupsen the king seeing these four heads on the ground said in his heart for my sake has the family of birbal been destroyed kingly power for the purpose of upholding which the destruction of a whole household is necessary is a mere curse and to carry on government in this manner is not just he then took up the sword and was about to slay himself when the destroying goddess probably satisfied with bloodshed stayed his hand bidding him at the same time ask any boon he pleased  the generous monarch begged thereupon that his faithful servant might be restored to life together with all his highminded family and the goddess devi in the twinkling of an eye fetched from patala the regions below the earth a vase full of amrita the water of immortality sprinkled it upon the dead and raised them all as before after which the whole party walked leisurely home and in due time the king divided his throne with his friend birbal  having stopped for a moment the baital proceeded to remark in a sententious tone happy the servant who grudges not his own life to save that of his master and happy thrice happy the master who can annihilate all greedy longing for existence and worldly prosperity raja i have to ask thee one searching question  of these five who was the greatest fool  demon exclaimed the great vikram all whose cherished feelings about fidelity and family affection obedience and highmindedness were outraged by this vampire view of the question if thou meanest by the greatest fool the noblest mind i reply without hesitating rupsen the king  why prithee asked the baital  because dull demon said the king birbal was bound to offer up his life for a master who treated him so generously the son could not disobey his father and the women naturally and instinctively killed themselves because the example was set to them but rupsen the king gave up his throne for the sake of his retainer and valued not a straw his life and his high inducements to live for this reason i think him the most meritorious  surely mighty vikram laughed the vampire you will be tired of ever clambering up yon tall tree even had you the legs and arms of hanumanfn86 himself  and so saying he disappeared from the cloth although it had been placed upon the ground  but the poor baital had little reason to congratulate himself on the success of his escape in a short time he was again bundled into the cloth with the usual want of ceremony and he revenged himself by telling another true story           the vampires fourth story                               of a woman who told the truth  listen great king again began the baital  an unimportant baniyafn87 trader hiranyadatt had a daughter whose name was madansena sundari the beautiful army of cupid her face was like the moon her hair like the clouds her eyes like those of a muskrat her eyebrows like a bent bow her nose like a parrots bill her neck like that of a dove her teeth like pomegranate grains the red colour of her lips like that of a gourd her waist lithe and bending like the pards her hands and feet like softest blossoms her complexion like the jasminein fact day by day the splendour of her youth increased  when she had arrived at maturity her father and mother began often to resolve in their minds the subject of her marriage and the people of all that country side ruled by birbar king of madanpur bruited it abroad that in the house of hiranyadatt had been born a daughter by whose beauty gods men and munis sages were fascinated  thereupon many causing their portraits to be painted sent them by messengers to hiranyadatt the baniya who showed them all to his daughter but she was capricious as beauties sometimes are and when her father said make choice of a husband thyself she told him that none pleased her and moreover she begged of him to find her a husband who possessed good looks good qualities and good sense  at length when some days had passed four suitors came from four different countries the father told them that he must have from each some indication that he possessed the required qualities that he was pleased with their looks but that they must satisfy him about their knowledge  i have the first said a perfect acquaintance with the shastras or scriptures in science there is none to rival me as for my handsome mien it may plainly be seen by you  the second exclaimed my attainments are unique in the knowledge of archery i am acquainted with the art of discharging arrows and killing anything which though not seen is heard and my fine proportions are plainly visible to you  the third continued i understand the language of land and water animals of birds and of beasts and i have no equal in strength of my comeliness you yourself may judge  i have the knowledge quoth the fourth how to make a certain cloth which can be sold for five rubies having sold it i give the proceeds of one ruby to a brahman of the second i make an offering to a deity a third i wear on my own person a fourth i keep for my wife and having sold the fifth i spend it in giving feasts this is my knowledge and none other is acquainted with it my good looks are apparent  the father hearing these speeches began to reflect it is said that excess in anything is not good sitafn88 was very lovely but the demon ravana carried her away and bali king of mahabahpur gave much alms but at length he became poorfn89 my daughter is too fair to remain a maiden to which of these shall i give her  so saying hiranyadatt went to his daughter explained the qualities of the four suitors and asked to which shall i give thee on hearing these words she was abashed and hanging down her head knew not what to reply  then the baniya having reflected said to himself he who is acquainted with the shastras is a brahman he who could shoot an arrow at the sound was a kshatriya or warrior and he who made the cloth was a shudra or servile but the youth who understands the language of birds is of our own caste to him therefore will i marry her and accordingly he proceeded with the betrothal of his daughter  meanwhile madansena went one day during the spring season into the garden for a stroll it happened just before she came out that somdatt the son of the merchant dharmdatt had gone for pleasure into the forest and was returning through the same garden to his home  he was fascinated at the sight of the maiden and said to his friend brother if i can obtain her my life will be prosperous and if i do not obtain her my living in the world will be in vain  having thus spoken and becoming restless from the fear of separation he involuntarily drew near to her and seizing her hand said  if thou wilt not form an affection for me i will throw away my life on thy account  be pleased not to do this she replied it will be sinful and it will involve me in the guilt and punishment of shedding blood hence i shall be miserable in this world and in that to be  thy blandishments he replied have pierced my heart and the consuming thought of parting from thee has burnt up my body and memory and understanding have been destroyed by this pain and from excess of love i have no sense of right or wrong but if thou wilt make me a promise i will live again  she replied truly the kali yug iron age has commenced since which time falsehood has increased in the world and truth has diminished people talk smoothly with their tongues but nourish deceit in their hearts religion is destroyed crime has increased and the earth has begun to give little fruit kings levy fines brahmans have waxed covetous the son obeys not his sires commands brother distrusts brother friendship has departed from amongst friends sincerity has left masters servants have given up service man has abandoned manliness and woman has abandoned modesty five days hence my marriage is to be but if thou slay not thyself i will visit thee first and after that i will remain with my husband  having given this promise and having sworn by the ganges she returned home the merchants son also went his way  presently the marriage ceremonies came on and hiranyadatt the baniya expended a lakh of rupees in feasts and presents to the bridegroom the bodies of the twain were anointed with turmeric the bride was made to hold in her hand the iron box for eye paint and the youth a pair of betel scissors during the night before the wedding there was loud and shrill music the heads and limbs of the young couple were rubbed with an ointment of oil and the bridegrooms head was duly shaved the wedding procession was very grand the streets were a blaze of flambeaux and torches carried in the hand fireworks by the ton were discharged as the people passed elephants camels and horses richly caparisoned were placed in convenient situations and before the procession had reached the house of the bride half a dozen wicked boys and bad young men were killed or woundedfn90 after the marriage formulas were repeated the baniya gave a feast or supper and the food was so excellent that all sat down quietly no one uttered a complaint or brought dishonour on the brides family or cut with scissors the garments of his neighbour  the ceremony thus happily concluded the husband brought madansena home to his own house after some days the wife of her husbands youngest brother and also the wife of his eldest brother led her at night by force to her bridegroom and seated her on a bed ornamented with flowers  as her husband proceeded to take her hand she jerked it away and at once openly told him all that she had promised to somdatt on condition of his not killing himself  all things rejoined the bridegroom hearing her words have their sense ascertained by speech in speech they have their basis and from speech they proceed consequently a falsifier of speech falsifies everything if truly you are desirous of going to him go  receiving her husbands permission she arose and went off to the young merchants house in full dress upon the road a thief saw her and in high good humour came up and asked    whither goest thou at midnight in such darkness having put on all these fine clothes and ornaments  she replied that she was going to the house of her beloved  and who here said the thief is thy protector  kama deva she replied the beautiful youth who by his fiery arrows wounds with love the hearts of the inhabitants of the three worlds ratipati the husband of ratifn91 accompanied by the kokila birdfn92 the humming bee and gentle breezes she then told to the thief the whole story adding    destroy not my jewels i give thee a promise before i go that on my return thou shalt have all these ornaments  hearing this the thief thought to himself that it would be useless now to destroy her jewels when she had promised to give them to him presently of her own good will he therefore let her go and sat down and thus soliloquized  to me it is astonishing that he who sustained me in my mothers womb should take no care of me now that i have been born and am able to enjoy the good things of this world i know not whether he is asleep or dead and i would rather swallow poison than ask man for money or favour for these six things tend to lower a man  friendship with the perfidious causeless laughter altercation with women serving an unworthy master riding an ass and speaking any language but sanskrit and these five things the deity writes on our fate at the hour of birth first age secondly action thirdly wealth fourthly science fifthly fame i have now done a good deed and as long as a mans virtue is in the ascendant all people becoming his servants obey him but when virtuous deeds diminish even his friends become inimical to him  meanwhile madansena had reached the place where somdatt the young trader had fallen asleep  she awoke him suddenly and he springing up in alarm quickly asked her art thou the daughter of a deity or of a saint or of a serpent tell me truly who art thou and whence hast thou come  she replied i am human madansena the daughter of the baniya hiranyadatt dost thou not remember taking my hand in that grove and declaring that thou wouldst slay thyself if i did not swear to visit thee first and after that remain with my husband  hast thou he inquired told all this to thy husband or not  she replied i have told him everything and he thoroughly understanding the whole affair gave me permission  this matter exclaimed somdatt in a melancholy voice is like pearls without a suitable dress or food without clarified butterfn93 or singing without melody they are all alike unnatural in the same way unclean clothes will mar beauty bad food will undermine strength a wicked wife will worry her husband to death a disreputable son will ruin his family an enraged demon will kill and a woman whether she love or hate will be a source of pain for there are few things which a woman will not do she never brings to her tongue what is in her heart she never speaks out what is on her tongue and she never tells what she is doing truly the deity has created woman a strange creature in this world he concluded with these words return thou home with another mans wife i have no concern  madansena rose and departed on her way she met the thief who hearing her tale gave her great praise and let her go unplunderedfn94  she then went to her husband and related the whole matter to him but he had ceased to love her and he said neither a king nor a minister nor a wife nor a persons hair nor his nails look well out of their places and the beauty of the kokila is its note of an ugly man knowledge of a devotee forgiveness and of a woman her chastity  the vampire having narrated thus far suddenly asked the king of these three whose virtue was the greatest  vikram who had been greatly edified by the tale forgot himself and ejaculated the thiefs  and pray why asked the baital  because the hero explained when her husband saw that she loved another man however purely he ceased to feel affection for her somdatt let her go unharmed for fear of being punished by the king but there was no reason why the thief should fear the law and dismiss her therefore he was the best  hi hi hi laughed the demon spitefully here then ends my story  upon which escaping as before from the cloth in which he was slung behind the rajas back the baital disappeared through the darkness of the night leaving father and son looking at each other in dismay  son dharma dhwaj quoth the great vikram the next time when that villain vampire asks me a question i allow thee to take the liberty of pinching my arm even before i have had time to answer his questions in this way we shall never of a truth end our task  your words be upon my head sire replied the young prince but he expected no good from his fathers new plan as arrived under the sirestree he heard the baital laughing with all his might  surely he is laughing at our beards sire said the beardless prince who hated to be laughed at like a young person  let them laugh that win fiercely cried raja vikram who hated to be laughed at like an elderly person                                     the vampire lost no time in opening a fresh story           the vampires  fifth story       of the thief who laughed and wept  your majesty quoth the demon with unusual politeness  there is a country called  malaya on the western coast of the  land of bharatyou see that i am particular in specifying  the placeand in it was a city known as chandrodaya  whose king was named randhir  this raja like most others of his semideified order had been in youth what is called a sarvarasifn95 that is he ate and drank and listened to music and looked at dancers and made love much more than he studied reflected prayed or conversed with the wise  after the age of thirty he began to reform and he brought such zeal to the good cause that in an incredibly short space of time he came to be accounted and quoted as the paragon of correct rajas this was very praiseworthy many of brahmas viceregents on earth be it observed have loved food and drink and music and dancing and the worship of kama to the end of their days  amongst his officers was gunshankar a magistrate of police who curious to say was as honest as he was just he administered equity with as much care before as after dinner he took no bribes even in the matter of advancing his family he was rather merciful than otherwise to the poor and he never punished the rich ostentatiously in order to display his and his laws disrespect for persons  besides which when sitting on the carpet of justice he did not as some kotwals do use rough or angry language to those who cannot reply nor did he take offence when none was intended  all the people of the city chandrodaya in the province of malaya on the western coast of bharatland loved and esteemed this excellent magistrate which did not however prevent thefts being committed so frequently and so regularly that no one felt his property secure at last the merchants who had suffered most from these depredations went in a body before gunshankar and said to him  o flower of the law robbers have exercised great tyranny upon us so great indeed that we can no longer stay in this city  then the magistrate replied what has happened has happened but in future you shall be free from annoyance i will make due preparation for these thieves  thus saying gunshankar called together his various delegates and directed them to increase the number of their people he pointed out to them how they should keep watch by night besides which he ordered them to open registers of all arrivals and departures to make themselves acquainted by means of spies with the movements of every suspected person in the city and to raise a body of paggis trackers who could follow the footprints of thieves even when they wore thieving shoesfn96 till they came up with and arrested them and lastly he gave the patrols full power whenever they might catch a robber in the act to slay him without asking questions  people in numbers began to mount guard throughout the city every night but notwithstanding this robberies continued to be committed after a time all the merchants having again met together went before the magistrate and said o incarnation of justice you have changed your officers you have hired watchmen and you have established patrols nevertheless the thieves have not diminished and plundering is ever taking place  thereupon gunshankar carried them to the palace and made them lay their petition at the feet of the king randhir that raja having consoled them sent them home saying be ye of good cheer i will tonight adopt a new plan which with the blessing of the bhagwan shall free ye from further anxiety  observe o vikram that randhir was one of those concerning whom the poet sang                the unwise run from one end to the other  not content with becoming highly respectable correct and even unimpeachable in point of character he reformed even his reformation and he did much more than he was required to do  when canopus began to sparkle gaily in the southern skies the king arose and prepared for a nights work he disguised his face by smearing it with a certain paint by twirling his moustachios up to his eyes by parting his beard upon his chin and conducting the two ends towards his ears and by tightly tying a hair from a horses tail over his nose so as quite to change its shape he then wrapped himself in a coarse outer garment girt his loins buckled on his sword drew his shield upon his arm and without saying a word to those within the palace he went out into the streets alone and on foot  it was dark and raja randhir walked through the silent city for nearly an hour without meeting anyone as however he passed through a back street in the merchants quarter he saw what appeared to be a homeless dog lying at the foot of a housewall he approached it and up leaped a human figure whilst a loud voice cried who art thou  randhir replied i am a thief who art thou  and i also am a thief rejoined the other much pleased at hearing this come then and let us make together but what art thou a highloper or a lullypriggerfn97  a little more ceremony between coves in the lorstfn98 whispered the king speaking as a flash man were not out of place but look sharp mind old oliverfn99 or the lambskin manfn100 will have the pull of us and as sure as eggs is eggs we shall be scragged as soon as laggedfn101  well keep your red ragfn102 quiet grumbled the other and let us be working  then the pair king and thief began work in right earnest the gang seemed to swarm in the street they were drinking spirits slaying victims rubbing their bodies with oil daubing their eyes with lampblack and repeating incantations to enable them to see in the darkness others were practicing the lessons of the god with the golden spearfn103 and carrying out the four modes of breaching a house 1 picking out burnt bricks  2cutting through unbaked ones when old when softened by recent damp by exposure to the sun or by saline exudations  3 throwing water on a mud wall and 4 boring through one of wood the sons of skanda were making breaches in the shape of lotus blossoms the sun the new moon the lake and the water jar and they seemed to be anointed with magic unguents so that no eye could behold no weapon harm them  at length having filled his bag with costly plunder the thief said to the king now my rummy cove well be off to the flash ken where the lads and the morts are waiting to wet their whistles  randhir who as a king was perfectly familiar with thieves latin took heart and resolved to hunt out the secrets of the den on the way his companion perfectly satisfied with the importance which the new cove had attached to a ratholefn104 and convinced that he was a true robber taught him the whistle the word and the sign peculiar to the gang and promised him that he should smack the litfn105 that night before turning in  so saying the thief rapped twice at the city gate which was at once opened to him and preceding his accomplice led the way to a rock about two kos four miles distant from the walls before entering the dark forest at the foot of the eminence the robber stood still for a moment and whistled twice through his fingers with a shrill scream that rang through the silent glades after a few minutes the signal was answered by the hooting of an owl which the robber acknowledged by shrieking like a jackal thereupon half a dozen armed men arose from their crouching places in the grass and one advanced towards the new comers to receive the sign it was given and they both passed on whilst the guard sank as it were into the bowels of the earth all these things randhir carefully remarked besides which he neglected not to take note of all the distinguishable objects that lay on the road and when he entered the wood he scratched with his dagger all the tree trunks within reach  after a sharp walk the pair reached a high perpendicular sheet  of rock rising abruptly from a clear space in the jungle and profusely printed over with vermilion hands the thief having walked up to it and made his obeisance stooped to the ground and removed a bunch of grass the two then raised by their united efforts a heavy trap door through which poured a stream of light whilst a confused hubbub of voices was heard below  this is the ken said the robber preparing to descend a thin ladder of bamboo follow me and he disappeared with his bag of valuables  the king did as he was bid and the pair entered together a large hall or rather a cave which presented a singular spectacle  it was lighted up by links fixed to the sombre walls which threw a smoky glare over the place and the contrast after the deep darkness reminded randhir of his mothers descriptions of patalpuri the infernal city carpets of every kind from the choicest tapestry to the coarsest rug were spread upon the ground and were strewed with bags wallets weapons heaps of booty drinking cups and all the materials of debauchery  passing through this cave the thief led randhir into another which was full of thieves preparing for the pleasures of the night some were changing garments ragged and dirtied by creeping through gaps in the houses others were washing the blood from their hands and feet these combed out their long dishevelled dusty hair those anointed their skins with perfumed cocoanut oil there were all manner of murderers present a villanous collection of kartikeyas and bhawanisfn106 crew there were stabbers with their poniards hung to lanyards lashed round their naked waists dhaturiya poisonersfn107 distinguished by the little bag slung under the left arm and phansigarsfn108 wearing their fatal kerchiefs round their necks and randhir had reason to thank the good deed in the last life that had sent him there in such strict disguise for amongst the robbers he found as might be expected a number of his own people spies and watchmen guards and patrols  the thief whose importance of manner now showed him to be the chief of the gang was greeted with applause as he entered the robing room and he bade all make salam to the new companion a number of questions concerning the success of the nights work was quickly put and answered  then the company having got ready for the revel flocked into the first cave there they sat down each in his own place and began to eat and drink and make merry  after some hours the flaring torches began to burn out and drowsiness to overpower the strongest heads most of the robbers rolled themselves up in the rugs and covering their heads went to sleep a few still sat with their backs to the wall nodding drowsily or leaning on one side and too stupefied with opium and hemp to make any exertion  at that moment a servant woman whom the king saw for the first time came into the cave and looking at him exclaimed o raja how came you with these wicked men do you run away as fast as you can or they will surely kill you when they awake  i do not know the way in which direction am i to go  asked randhir  the woman then showed him the road he threaded the confused mass of snorers treading with the foot of a tigercat found the ladder raised the trapdoor by exerting all his strength and breathed once more the open air of heaven and before plunging into the depths of the wood he again marked the place where the entrance lay and carefully replaced the bunch of grass  hardly had raja randhir returned to the palace and removed the traces of his nights occupation when he received a second deputation of the merchants complaining bitterly and with the longest faces about their fresh misfortunes  o pearl of equity said the men of money but yesterday you consoled us with the promise of some contrivance by the blessing of which our houses and coffers would be safe from theft whereas our goods have never yet suffered so severely as during the last twelve hours  again randhir dismissed them swearing that this time he would either die or destroy the wretches who had been guilty of such violence  then having mentally prepared his measures the raja warned a company of archers to hold themselves in readiness for secret service and as each one of his own people returned from the robbers cave he had him privily arrested and put to deathbecause the deceased it is said do not like baitals tell tales about nightfall when he thought that the thieves having finished their work of  plunder would meet together as usual for wassail and debauchery he armed himself marched out his men and led them to the rock in the jungle  but the robbers aroused by the disappearance of the new companion had made enquiries and had gained intelligence of the impending danger they feared to flee during the daytime lest being tracked they should be discovered and destroyed in detail when night came they hesitated to disperse from the certainty that they would be captured in the morning then their captain who throughout had been of one opinion proposed to them that they should resist  and promised them success if  they would hear his words the gang  respected him for he was known to be brave they all listened to his advice and they promised to be obedient  as young night began to cast transparent shade upon the jungle ground the chief of the thieves mustered his men inspected their bows and arrows gave them encouraging words and led them forth from the cave having placed them in ambush he climbed the rock to espy the movements of the enemy whilst others applied their noses and ears to the level ground presently the moon shone full upon randhir and his band of archers who were advancing quickly and carelessly for they expected to catch the robbers in their cave the captain allowed them to march nearly through the line of ambush then he gave the signal and at that moment the thieves rising suddenly from the bush fell upon the royal troops and drove them back in confusion  the king also fled when the chief of the robbers shouted out hola thou a rajput and running away from combat randhir hearing this halted and the two confronting each other bared their blades and began to do battle with prodigious fury  the king was cunning of fence and so was the thief they opened the duel as skilful swordsmen should by bending almost double skipping in a circle each keeping his eye well fixed upon the other with frowning brows and contemptuous lips at the same time executing divers gambados and measured leaps springing forward like frogs and backward like monkeys and beating time with their sabres upon their shields which rattled like drums  then randhir suddenly facing his antagonist cut at his legs with a loud cry but the thief sprang in the air and the blade whistled harmlessly under him next moment the robber chiefs sword thrice whirled round his head descended like lightning in a slanting direction towards the kings left shoulder the latter however received it upon his target and escaped all hurt though he staggered with the violence of the blow  and thus they continued attacking each other parrying and replying till their breath failed them and their hands and wrists were numbed and cramped with fatigue they were so well matched in courage strength and address that neither obtained the least advantage till the robbers right foot catching a stone slid from under him and thus he fell to the ground at the mercy of his enemy the thieves fled and the raja himself on his prize tied his hands behind him and brought him back to the city at the point of his good sword  the next morning randhir visited his prisoner whom he caused to be bathed and washed and covered with fine clothes he then had him mounted on a camel and sent him on a circuit of the city accompanied by a crier proclaiming aloud who hears who hears who hears the king commands this is the thief who has robbed and plundered the city of chandrodaya let all men therefore assemble themselves together this evening in the open space outside the gate leading towards the sea and let them behold the penalty of evil deeds and learn to be wise  randhir had condemned the thief to be crucifiedfn109 nailed and tied with his hands and feet stretched out at full length in an erect posture until death everything he wished to eat was ordered to him in order to prolong life and misery and when death should draw near melted gold was to be poured down his throat till it should burst from his neck and other parts of his body  in the evening the thief was led out for execution and by chance the procession passed close to the house of a wealthy landowner he had a favourite daughter named shobhani who was in the flower of her youth and very lovely every day she improved and every moment added to her grace and beauty the girl had been carefully kept out of sight of mankind never being allowed outside the high walls of the garden because her nurse a wise woman much trusted in the neighbourhood had at the hour of death given a solemn warning to her parents the prediction was that the maiden should be the admiration of the city and should die a sati widowfn110 before becoming a wife from that hour shobhani was kept as a pearl in its casket by her father who had vowed never to survive her and had even fixed upon the place and style of his suicide  but the shaft of fatefn111 strikes down the vulture sailing above the clouds and follows the worm into the bowels of the earth and pierces the fish at the bottom of the oceanhow then can mortal man expect to escape it as the robber chief mounted upon the camel was passing to the cross under the old householders windows a fire breaking out in the womens apartments drove the inmates into the rooms looking upon the street  the hum of many voices arose from the solid pavement of heads this is the thief who has been robbing the whole city let him tremble now for randhir will surely crucify him  in beauty and bravery of bearing as in strength and courage no man in chandrodaya surpassed the robber who being magnificently dressed looked despite his disgraceful cavalcade like the son of a king he sat with an unmoved countenance hardly hearing in his pride the scoffs of the mob calm and steady when the whole city was frenzied with anxiety because of him but as he heard the word tremble his lips quivered his eyes flashed fire and deep lines gathered between his eyebrows  shobhani started with a scream from the casement behind which she had hid herself gazing with an intense womanly curiosity into the thoroughfare the robbers face was upon a level with and not half a dozen feet from her pale cheeks she marked his handsome features and his look of wrath made her quiver as if it had been a flash of lightning then she broke away from the fascination of his youth and beauty and ran breathless to her father saying  go this moment and get that thief released  the old housekeeper replied that thief has been pilfering and plundering the whole city and by his means the kings archers were defeated why then at my request should our most gracious raja randhir release him  shobhani almost beside herself exclaimed if by giving up your whole property you can induce the raja to release him then instantly so do if he does not come to me i must give up my life  the maiden then covered her head with her veil and sat down in the deepest despair whilst her father hearing her words burst into a cry of grief and hastened to present himself before the raja he cried out  o great king be pleased to receive four lakhs of rupees and to release this thief  but the king replied he has been robbing the whole city and by reason of him my guards have been destroyed i cannot by any means release him  then the old householder finding as he had expected the raja inexorable and not to be moved either by tears or bribes or by the cruel fate of the girl returned home with fire in his heart and addressed her   daughter i have said and done all that is possible but it avails me nought with the king now then we die  in the mean time the guards having led the thief all round the city took him outside the gates and made him stand near the cross then the messengers of death arrived from the palace and the executioners began to nail his limbs he bore the agony with the fortitude of the brave but when he heard what had been done by the old householders daughter he raised his voice and wept bitterly as though his heart had been bursting and almost with the same breath he laughed heartily as at a feast all were startled by his merriment coming as it did at a time when the iron was piercing his flesh no man could see any reason for it  when he died shobhani who was married to him in the  spirit recited to herself these sayings  there are thirtyfive millions of hairs on the human body the woman who ascends the pile with her husband will remain so many years in heaven as the snakecatcher draws the serpent from his hole so she rescuing her husband from hell rejoices with him aye though he may have sunk to a  region of torment be restrained in dreadful bonds have reached the place of anguish be exhausted of strength and afflicted and tortured for his crimes no other effectual duty is known for virtuous women at any time after the death of their lords except casting themselves into the same fire as long as a woman in her successive transmigrations shall decline burning herself like a faithful wife in the same fire  with her deceased lord so long shall she not be exempted  from springing again to life in the body of some female animal  therefore the beautiful shobhani virgin and wife resolved to burn herself and to make the next life of the thief certain she showed her courage by thrusting her finger into a torch flame till it became a cinder and she solemnly bathed in the nearest stream  a hole was dug in the ground and upon a bed of green treetrunks were heaped hemp pitch faggots and clarified butter to form the funeral pyre the dead body anointed bathed and dressed in new clothes was then laid upon the heap which was some two feet high shobhani prayed that as long as fourteen indras reign or as many years as there are hairs in her head she might abide in heaven with her husband and be waited upon by the heavenly dancers she then presented her ornaments and little gifts of corn to her friends tied some cotton round both wrists put two new combs in her hair painted her forehead and tied up in the end of her bodycloth clean parched ricefn112 and cowrieshells these she gave to the bystanders as she walked seven times round the funeral pyre upon which lay the body she then ascended the heap of wood sat down upon it and taking the thiefs head in her lap without cords or levers or upper layer or faggots she ordered the pile to be lighted the crowd standing around set fire to it in several places drummed their drums blew their conchs and raised a loud cry of hari bol hari bol fn113 straw was thrown on and pitch and clarified butter were freely poured out but shobhanis was a sahamaran a blessed easy death no part of her body was seen to move after the pyre was lightedin fact she seemed to die before the flame touched her  by the blessing of his daughters decease the old householder beheaded himselffn114 he caused an instrument to be made in the shape of a halfmoon with an edge like a razor and fitting the back of his neck at both ends of it as at the beam of a balance chains were fastened he sat down with eyes closed he was rubbed with the purifying clay of the holy river vaituranifn115 and he repeated the proper incantations then placing his feet upon the extremities of the chains he suddenly jerked up his neck and his severed head rolled from his body upon the ground what a happy death was this  the baital was silent as if meditating on the fortunate transmigration which the old householder had thus secured  but what could the thief have been laughing at sire asked the young prince dharma dhwaj of his father  at the prodigious folly of the girl my son replied the warrior king thoughtlessly  i am indebted once more to your majesty burst out the baital for releasing me from this unpleasant position but the rajas penetration is again at fault not to leave your royal son and heir labouring under a false impression before going i will explain why the brave thief burst into tears and why he laughed at such a moment  he wept when he reflected that he could not requite her kindness in being willing to give up everything she had in the world to save his life and this thought deeply grieved him  then it struck him as being passing strange that she had begun to love him when the last sand of his life was well nigh run out that wondrous are the ways of the revolving heavens which bestow wealth upon the niggard that cannot use it wisdom upon the bad man who will misuse it a beautiful wife upon the fool who cannot protect her and fertilizing showers upon the stony hills and thinking over these things the gallant and beautiful thief laughed aloud  before returning to my sirestree continued the vampire as i am about to do in virtue of your majestys unintelligent reply i may remark that men may laugh and cry or may cry and laugh about everything in this world from their neighbours deaths which as a general rule in no wise concern them to their own latter ends which do concern them exceedingly for my part i am in the habit of laughing at everything because it animates the brain stimulates the lungs beautifies the countenance andfor the moment goodbye raja vikram  the warrior king being forewarned this time shifted the bundle containing the baital from his back to under his arm where he pressed it with all his might  this proceeding however did not prevent the vampire from slipping back to his tree and leaving an empty cloth with the raja  presently the demon was trussed up as usual a voice sounded behind vikram and the loquacious thing again began to talk            the vampires sixth story   in which three men dispute about a woman  on the lovely banks of jumnas stream there was a city known as dharmasthalthe place of duty and therein dwelt a certain brahman called keshav he was a very pious man in the constant habit of performing penance and worship upon the river sidi he modelled his own clay images instead of buying them from others he painted holy stones red at the top and made to them offerings of flowers fruit water sweetmeats and fried peas he had become a learned man somewhat late in life having until twenty years old neglected his reading and addicted himself to worshipping the beautiful youth kamadevafn116 and rati his wife accompanied by the cuckoo the hummingbee and sweet breezes  one day his parents having rebuked him sharply for his ungovernable conduct keshav wandered to a neighbouring hamlet and hid himself in the tall figtree which shadowed a celebrated image of panchananfn117 presently an evil thought arose in his head he defiled the god and threw him into the nearest tank  the next morning when the person arrived whose livelihood depended on the image he discovered that his god was gone he returned into the village distracted and all was soon in an uproar about the lost deity  in the midst of this confusion the parents of keshav arrived seeking for their son and a man in the crowd declared that he had seen a young man sitting in panchanans tree but what had become of the god he knew not  the runaway at length appeared and the suspicions of the villagers fell upon him as the stealer of panchanan he confessed the fact pointed out the place where he had thrown the stone and added that he had polluted the god all hands and eyes were raised in amazement at this atrocious crime and every one present declared that panchanan would certainly punish the daring insult by immediate death keshav was dreadfully frightened he began to obey his parents from that very hour and applied to his studies so sedulously that he soon became the most learned man of his country  now keshav the brahman had a daughter whose name was the madhumalati or sweet jasmine she was very beautiful whence did the gods procure the materials to form so exquisite a face they took a portion of the most excellent part of the moon to form that beautiful face does any one seek a proof of this let him look at the empty places left in the moon her eyes resembled the fullblown blue nymphaea her arms the charming stalk of the lotus her flowing tresses the thick darkness of night  when this lovely person arrived at a marriageable age her mother father and brother all three became very anxious about her for the wise have said a daughter nubile but without a husband is ever a calamity hanging over a house and kings women and climbing plants love those who are near them also who is there that has not suffered from the sex for a woman cannot be kept in due subjection either by gifts or kindness or correct conduct or the greatest services or the laws of morality or by the terror of punishment for she cannot discriminate between good and evil   it so happened that one day keshav the brahman went to the marriage of a certain customer of hisfn118 and his son repaired to the house of a spiritual preceptor in order to read during their absence a young man came to the house when the sweet jasmines mother inferring his good qualities from his good looks said to him i will give to thee my daughter in marriage the father also had promised his daughter to a brahman youth whom he had met at the house of his employer and the brother likewise had betrothed his sister to a fellow student at the place where he had gone to read  after some days father and son came home accompanied by these two suitors and in the house a third was already seated the name of the first was tribikram of the second baman and of the third madhusadan the three were equal in mind and body in knowledge and in age  then the father looking upon them said to himself ho there is one bride and three bridegrooms to whom shall i give and to whom shall i not give we three have pledged our word to these three a strange circumstance has occurred what must we do   he then proposed to them a trial of wisdom and made them agree that he who should quote the most excellent saying of the wise should become his daughters husband  quoth tribikram courage is tried in war integrity in the payment of debt and interest friendship in distress and the faithfulness of a wife in the day of poverty   baman proceeded that woman is destitute of virtue who in her fathers house is not in subjection who wanders to feasts and amusements who throws off her veil in the presence of men who remains as a guest in the houses of strangers who is much devoted to sleep who drinks inebriating beverages and who delights in distance from her husband   let none pursued madhusadan confide in the sea nor in whatever has claws or horns or who carries deadly weapons neither in a woman nor in a king   whilst the brahman was doubting which to prefer and rather inclining to the latter sentiment a serpent bit the beautiful girl and in a few hours she died  stunned by this awful sudden death the father and the three suitors sat for a time motionless they then arose used great exertions and brought all kinds of sorcerers wise men and women who charm away poisons by incantations these having seen the girl said she cannot return to life the first declared a person always dies who has been bitten by a snake on the fifth sixth eighth ninth and fourteenth days of the lunar month the second asserted one who has been bitten on a saturday or a tuesday does not survive the third opined poison infused during certain six lunar mansions cannot be got under quoth the fourth one who has been bitten in any organ of sense the lower lip the cheek the neck or the stomach cannot escape death the fifth said in this case even brahma the creator could not restore lifeof what account then are we do you perform the funeral rites we will depart   thus saying the sorcerers went their way the mourning father took up his daughters corpse and caused it to be burnt in the place where dead bodies are usually burnt and returned to his house  after that the three young men said to one another we must now seek happiness elsewhere and what better can we do than obey the words of indra the god of air who spake thus    for a man who does not travel about there is no felicity and a good man who stays at home is a bad man indra is the friend of him who travels travel   a travellers legs are like blossoming branches and he himself grows and gathers the fruit all his wrongs vanish destroyed by his exertion on the roadside travel   the fortune of a man who sits sits also it rises when he rises it sleeps when he sleeps it moves well when he moves travel   a man who sleeps is like the iron age a man who awakes is like the bronze age a man who rises up is like the silver age a man who travels is like the golden age travel   a traveller finds honey a traveller finds sweet figs look at the happiness of the sun who travailing never tires travel   before parting they divided the relics of the beloved one and then they went their way  tribikram having separated and tied up the burnt bones became one of the vaisheshikas in those days a powerful sect he solemnly forswore the eight great crimes namely feeding at night slaying any animal eating the fruit of trees that give milk or pumpkins or young bamboos tasting honey or flesh plundering the wealth of others taking by force a married woman eating flowers butter or cheese and worshipping the gods of other religions he learned that the highest act of virtue is to abstain from doing injury to sentient creatures that crime does not justify the destruction of life and that kings as the administrators of criminal justice are the greatest of sinners he professed the five vows of total abstinence from falsehood eating flesh or fish theft drinking spirits and marriage he bound himself to possess nothing beyond a white loincloth a towel to wipe the mouth a beggars dish and a brush of woollen threads to sweep the ground for fear of treading on insects and he was ordered to fear secular affairs the miseries of a future state the receiving from others more than the food of a day at once all accidents provisions if connected with the destruction of animal life death and disgrace also to please all and to obtain compassion from all  he attempted to banish his love he said to himself surely it was owing only to my pride and selfishness that i ever looked upon a woman as capable of affording happiness and i thought ah ah thine eyes roll about like the tail of the waterwagtail thy lips resemble the ripe fruit thy bosom is like the lotus bud thy form is resplendent as gold melted in a crucible the moon wanes through desire to imitate the shadow of thy face thou resemblest the pleasurehouse of cupid the happiness of all time is concentrated in thee a touch from thee would surely give life to a dead image at thy approach a living admirer would be changed by joy into a lifeless stone obtaining thee i can face all the horrors of war and were i pierced by showers of arrows one glance of thee would heal all my wounds   my mind is now averted from the world seeing her i say is this the form by which men are bewitched this is a basket covered with skin it contains bones flesh blood and impurities the stupid creature who is captivated by thisis there a cannibal feeding in currim a greater cannibal than he these persons call a thing made up of impure matter a face and drink its charms as a drunkard swallows the inebriating liquor from his cup the blind infatuated beings why should i be pleased or displeased with this body composed of flesh and blood it is my duty to seek him who is the lord of this body and to disregard everything which gives rise either to pleasure or to pain  baman the second suitor tied up a bundle of his beloved ones ashes and followedsomewhat prematurelythe precepts of the great lawgiver manu when the father of a family perceives his muscles becoming flaccid and his hair grey and sees the child of his child let him then take refuge in a forest let him take up his consecrated fire and all his domestic implements for making oblations to it and departing from the town to the lonely wood let him dwell in it with complete power over his organs of sense and of action with many sorts of pure food such as holy sages used to eat with green herbs roots and fruit let him perform the five great sacraments introducing them with due ceremonies let him wear a black antelopehide or a vesture of bark let him bathe evening and morning let him suffer the hair of his head his beard and his nails to grow continually let him slide backwards and forwards on the ground or let him stand a whole day on tiptoe or let him continue in motion rising and sitting alternately but at sunrise at noon and at sunset let him go to the waters and bathe in the hot season let him sit exposed to five fires four blazing around him with the sun above in the rains let him stand uncovered without even a mantle where the clouds pour the heaviest showers in the cold season let him wear damp clothes and let him increase by degrees the austerity of his devotions then having reposited his holy fires as the law directs in his mind let him live without external fire without a mansion wholly silent feeding on roots and fruit   meanwhile madhusadan the third having taken a wallet and neckband became a jogi and began to wander far and wide living on nothing but chaff and practicing his devotions in order to see brahma he attended to the following duties 1 hearing 2 meditation 3 fixing the mind 4 absorbing the mind he combated the three evils restlessness injuriousness voluptuousness by settling the deity in his spirit by subjecting his senses and by destroying desire thus he would do away with the illusion maya which conceals all true knowledge he repeated the name of the deity till it appeared to him in the form of a dry light or glory though connected with the affairs of life that is with affairs belonging to a body containing blood bones and impurities to organs which are blind palsied and full of weakness and error to a mind filled with thirst hunger sorrow infatuation to confirmed habits and to the fruits of former births still he strove not to view these things as realities he made a companion of a dog honouring it with his own food so as the better to think on spirit he practiced all the five operations connected with the vital air or air collected in the body he attended much to pranayama or the gradual suppression of breathing and he secured fixedness of mind as follows by placing his sight and thoughts on the tip of his nose he perceived smell on the tip of his tongue he realized taste on the root of his tongue he knew sound and so forth he practiced the eightyfour asana or postures raising his hand to the wonders of the heavens till he felt no longer the inconveniences of heat or cold hunger or thirst he particularly preferred the padma or lotusposture which consists of bringing the feet to the sides holding the right in the left hand and the left in the right in the work of suppressing his breath he permitted its respiration to reach at furthest twelve fingers breadth and gradually diminished the distance from his nostrils till he could confine it to the length of twelve fingers from his nose and even after restraining it for some time he would draw it from no greater distance than from his heart as respects time he began by retaining inspiration for twentysix seconds and he enlarged this period gradually till he became perfect he sat crosslegged closing with his fingers all the avenues of inspiration and he practiced prityahara or the power of restraining the members of the body and mind with meditation and concentration to which there are four enemies viz a sleepy heart human passions a confused mind and attachment to anything but the one brahma he also cultivated yama that is inoffensiveness truth honesty the forsaking of all evil in the world and the refusal of gifts except for sacrifice and nihama ie purity relative to the use of water after defilement pleasure in everything whether in prosperity or adversity renouncing food when hungry and keeping down the body thus delivered from these four enemies of the flesh he resembled the unruffled flame of the lamp and by brahmagnana or meditating on the deity placing his mind on the sun moon fire or any other luminous body or within his heart or at the bottom of his throat or in the centre of his skull he was enabled to ascend from gross images of omnipotence to the works and the divine wisdom of the glorious original  one day madhusadan the jogi went to a certain house for food and the householder having seen him began to say be so good as to take your food here this day the visitor sat down and when the victuals were ready the host caused his feet and hands to be washed and leading him to the chauka or square place upon which meals are served seated him and sat by him and he quoted the scripture no guest must be dismissed in the evening by a housekeeper he is sent by the returning sun and whether he come in fit season or unseasonably he must not sojourn in the house without entertainment let me not eat any delicate food without asking my guest to partake of it the satisfaction of a guest will assuredly bring the housekeeper wealth reputation long life and a place in heaven   the householders wife then came to serve up the food rice and split peas oil and spices all cooked in a new earthen pot with pure firewood part of the meal was served and the rest remained to be served when the womans little child began to cry aloud and to catch hold of its mothers dress she endeavoured to release herself but the boy would not let go and the more she coaxed the more he cried and was obstinate on this the mother became angry took up the boy and threw him upon the fire which instantly burnt him to ashes  madhusadan the jogi seeing this rose up without eating the master of the house said to him why eatest thou not he replied i am  atithi that is to say to be entertained at your house but how can one eat under the roof of a person who has committed such a rakshasalike devilish deed is it not said he who does not govern his passions lives in vain a foolish king a person puffed up with riches and a weak child desire that which cannot be procured also a king destroys his enemies even when flying and the touch of an elephant as well as the breath of a serpent are fatal but the wicked destroy even while laughing  hearing this the householder smiled presently he arose and went to another part of the tenement and brought back with him a book treating on sanjivnividya or the science of restoring the dead to life this he had taken from its hidden place two beams almost touching one another with the ends in the opposite wall the precious volume was in single leaves some six inches broad by treble that length and the paper was stained with yellow orpiment and the juice of tamarind seeds to keep away insects  the householder opened the cloth containing the book untied the flat boards at the top and bottom and took out from it a charm having repeated this mantra with many ceremonies he at once restored the child to life saying of all precious things knowledge is the most valuable other riches may be stolen or diminished by expenditure but knowledge is immortal and the greater the expenditure the greater the increase it can be shared with none and it defies the power of the thief   the jogi seeing this marvel took thought in his heart if i could obtain that book i would restore my beloved to life and give up this course of uncomfortable postures and difficulty of breathing with this resolution he sat down to his food and remained in the house  at length night came and after a time all having eaten supper and gone to their sleepingplaces lay down the jogi also went to rest in one part of the house but did not allow sleep to close his eyes when he thought that a fourth part of the hours of darkness had sped and that all were deep in slumber then he got up very quietly and going into the room of the master of the house he took down the book from the beamends and went his ways  madhusadan the jogi went straight to the place where the beautiful sweet jasmine had been burned there he found his two rivals sitting talking together and comparing experiences they recognized him at once and cried aloud to him brother thou also hast been wandering over the world tell us thishast thou learned anything which can profit us he replied i have learned the science of restoring the dead to life upon which they both exclaimed if thou hast really learned such knowledge restore our beloved to life   madhusadan proceeded to make his incantations despite terrible sights in the air the cries of jackals owls crows cats asses vultures dogs and lizards and the wrath of innumerable invisible beings such as messengers of yama pluto ghosts devils demons imps fiends devas succubi and others all the three lovers drawing blood from their own bodies offered it to the goddess chandi repeating the following incantation hail supreme delusion hail goddess of the universe hail thou who fulfillest the desires of all may i presume to offer thee the blood of my body and wilt thou deign to accept it and be propitious towards me  they then made a burntoffering of their flesh and each one prayed grant me o goddess to see the maiden alive again in proportion to the fervency with which i present thee with mine own flesh invoking thee to be propitious to me salutation to thee again and again under the mysterious syllables any any  then they made a heap of the bones and the ashes which had been carefully kept by tribikram and baman as the jogi madhusadan proceeded with his incantation a white vapour arose from the ground and gradually condensing assumed a perispiritual form the fluid envelope of the soul the three spectators felt their blood freeze as the bones and the ashes were gradually absorbed into the before shadowy shape and they were restored to themselves only when the maiden madhuvati begged to be taken home to her mother  then kama god of love blinded them and they began fiercely to quarrel about who should have the beautiful maid each wanted to be her sole master tribikram declared the bones to be the great fact of the incantation baman swore by the ashes and madhusadan laughed them both to scorn no one could decide the dispute the wisest doctors were all nonplussed and as for the rajawell we do not go for wit or wisdom to kings i wonder if the great raja vikram could decide which person the woman belonged to  to baman the man who kept her ashes fellow exclaimed the hero not a little offended by the free remarks of the fiend  yet rejoined the baital impudently if tribikram had not preserved her bones how could she have been restored to life and if madhusadan had not learned the science of restoring the dead to life how could she have been revivified at least so it seems to me but perhaps your royal wisdom may explain  devil said the king angrily tribikram who preserved her bones by that act placed himself in the position of her son therefore he could not marry her madhusadan who restoring her to life gave her life was evidently a father to her he could not then become her husband therefore she was the wife of baman who had collected her ashes   i am happy to see o king exclaimed the vampire that in spite of my presentiments we are not to part company just yet these little trips i hold to be like lovers quarrels the prelude to closer union with your leave we will still practice a little suspension   and so saying the baital again ascended the tree and was suspended there  would it not be better thought the monarch after recapturing and shouldering the fugitive for me to sit down this time and listen to the fellows story perhaps the double exercise of walking and thinking confuses me   with this idea vikram placed his bundle upon the ground well tied up with turband and waistband then he seated himself crosslegged before it and bade his son do the same  the vampire strongly objected to this measure as it was contrary he asserted to the covenant between him and the raja vikram replied by citing the very words of the agreement proving that there was no allusion to walking or sitting  then the baital became sulky and swore that he would not utter another word but he too was bound by the chain of destiny presently he opened his lips with the normal prelude that he was about to tell a true tale           the vampires seventh story  showing the exceeding folly of many wise fools  the baital resumed  of all the learned brahmans in the learnedest university of gaur bengal none was so celebrated as vishnu swami he could write verse as well as prose in dead languages not very correctly but still better than all his fellowswhich constituted him a distinguished writer he had history theosophy and the four vedas of scriptures at his fingers ends he was skilled in the argute science of nyasa or disputation his mind was a mine of pauranic or cosmogonicotraditional lore handed down from the ancient fathers to the modern fathers and he had written bulky commentaries exhausting all that tongue of man has to say upon the obscure text of some old philosopher whose works upon ethics poetry and rhetoric were supposed by the sages of gaur to contain the germs of everything knowable his fame went over all the country yea from country to country he was a sea of excellent qualities the father and mother of brahmans cows and women and the horror of loose persons cutthroats courtiers and courtesans as a benefactor he was equal to karna most liberal of heroes in regard to truth he was equal to the veracious king yudhishtira  true he was sometimes at a loss to spell a common word in his mother tongue and whilst he knew to a fingerbreadth how many palms and paces the sun the moon and all the stars are distant from the earth he would have been puzzled to tell you where the region called yavanafn119 lies whilst he could enumerate in strict chronological succession every important event that happened five or six million years before he was born he was profoundly ignorant of those that occurred in his own day and once he asked a friend seriously if a cat let loose in the jungle would not in time become a tiger  yet did all the members of alma mater kasi panditsfn120 as well as students look with awe upon vishnu swamis livid cheeks and lacklustre eyes grimed hands and soiled cottons  now it so happened that this wise and pious brahmanic peer had four sons whom he brought up in the strictest and most serious way they were taught to repeat their prayers long before they understood a word of them and when they reached the age of fourfn121 they had read a variety of hymns and spiritual songs then they were set to learn by heart precepts that inculcate sacred duties and arguments relating to theology abstract and concrete  their father who was also their tutor sedulously cultivated as all the best works upon education advise their implicit obedience humble respect warm attachment and the virtues and sentiments generally he praised them secretly and reprehended them openly to exercise their humility he derided their looks and dressed them coarsely to preserve them from vanity and conceit whenever they anticipated a treat he punctually disappointed them to teach them selfdenial often when he had promised them a present he would revoke not break his word in order that discipline might have a name and habitat in his household and knowing by experience how much stronger than love is fear he frequently threatened browbeat and overawed them with the rod and the tongue with the terrors of this world and with the horrors of the next that they might be kept in the right way by dread of falling into the bottomless pits that bound it on both sides  at the age of six they were transferred to the chatushpatifn122 or school every morning the teacher and his pupils assembled in the hut where the different classes were called up by turns they laboured till noon and were allowed only two hours a moiety of the usual time for bathing eating sleep and worship which took up half the period at 3 pm they resumed their labours repeating to the tutor what they had learned by heart and listening to the meaning of it this lasted till twilight they then worshipped ate and drank for an hour after which came a return of study repeating the days lessons till 10 pm  in their rare days of easefor the learned priest mindful of the words of the wise did not wish to dull them by everlasting work they were enjoined to disport themselves with the gravity and the decorum that befit young samditats not to engage in night frolics not to use free jests or light expressions not to draw pictures on the walls not to eat honey flesh and sweet substances turned acid not to talk to little girls at the wellside on no account to wear sandals carry an umbrella or handle a die even for love and by no means to steal their neighbours mangoes  as they advanced in years their attention during work time was unremittingly directed to the vedas wordly studies were almost excluded or to speak more correctly whenever wordly studies were brought upon the carpet they were so evil entreated that they well nigh lost all form and feature history became the annals of india on brahminical principles opposed to the buddhistical geography the lands of the vedas none other being deemed worthy of notice and law the institutes of manu then almost obsolete despite their exceeding sanctity  but jatuharinifn123 had evidently changed these children before they were born and shanifn124 must have been in the ninth mansion when they came to light  each youth as he attained the mature age of twelve was formally entered at the university of kasi where without loss of time the first became a gambler the second a confirmed libertine the third a thief and the fourth a high buddhist or in other words an utter atheist  here king vikram frowned at his son a hint that he had better not behave himself as the children of highly moral and religious parents usually do the young prince understood him and briefly remarking that such things were common in distinguished brahman families asked the baital what he meant by the word atheist  of a truth answered the vampire it is most difficult to explain the sages assign to it three or four several meanings first one who denies that the gods exist secondly one who owns that the gods exist but denies that they busy themselves with human affairs and thirdly one who believes in the gods and in their providence but also believes that they are easily to be set aside similarly some atheists derive all things from dead and unintelligent matter others from matter living and energetic but without sense or will others from matter with forms and qualities generable and conceptible and others from a plastic and methodical nature thus the vishnu swamis of the world have invested the subject with some confusion the simple that is to say the mass of mortality have confounded that confusion by reproachfully applying the word atheist to those whose opinions differ materially from their own  but i being at present perhaps happily for myself a vampire and having just now none of these human or inhuman ideas meant simply to say that the pious priests fourth son being great at second and small in the matter of first causes adopted to their fullest extent the doctrines of the philosophical buddhasfn125 nothing according to him exists but the five elements earth water fire air or wind and vacuum and from the last proceeded the penultimate and so forth with the sage patanjali he held the universe to have the power of perpetual progressionfn126 he called that matra matter which is an eternal and infinite principle beginningless and endless organization intelligence and design he opined are inherent in matter as growth is in a tree he did not believe in soul or spirit because it could not be detected in the body and because it was a departure from physiological analogy the idea i am according to him was not the identification of spirit with matter but a product of the mutation of matter in this cloudlike errorformed world he believed in substance sat and scoffed at unsubstance asat he asserted the subtlety and globularity of atoms which are uncreate he made mind and intellect a mere secretion of the brain or rather words expressing not a thing but a state of things reason was to him developed instinct and life an element of the atmosphere affecting certain organisms he held good and evil to be merely geographical and chronological expressions and he opined that what is called evil is mostly an active and transitive form of good law was his great creator of all things but he refused a creator of law because such a creator would require another creator and so on in a quasiinterminable series up to absurdity this reduced his law to a manner of haphazard to those who arguing against it asked him their favourite question how often might a man after he had jumbled a set of letters in a bag fling them out upon the ground before they would fall into an exact poem he replied that the calculation was beyond his arithmetic but that the man had only to jumble and fling long enough inevitably to arrive at that end he rejected the necessity as well as the existence of revelation and he did not credit the miracles of krishna because according to him nature never suspends her laws and moreover he had never seen aught supernatural he ridiculed the idea of mahapralaya or the great destruction for as the world had no beginning so it will have no end he objected to absorption facetiously observing with the sage jamadagni that it was pleasant to eat sweetmeats but that for his part he did not wish to become the sweetmeat itself he would not believe that vishnu had formed the universe out of the wax in his ears he positively asserted that trees are not bodies in which the consequences of merit and demerit are received nor would he conclude that to men were attached rewards and punishments from all eternity he made light of the sanskara or sacrament he admitted satwa raja and tamafn127 but only as properties of matter he acknowledged gross matter sthulasharir and atomic matter shukshmasharir but not lingasharir or the archetype of bodies to doubt all things was the foundation of his theory and to scoff at all who would not doubt was the cornerstone of his practice in debate he preferred logical and mathematical grounds requiring a categorical because in answer to his why he was full of morality and natural religion which some say is no religion at all he gained the name of atheist by declaring with gotama that there are innumerable worlds that the earth has nothing beneath it but the circumambient air and that the core of the globe is incandescent and he was called a practical atheista worse form apparentlyfor supporting the following dogma that though creation may attest that a creator has been it supplies no evidence to prove that a creator still exists on which occasion shiromani a nonplussed theologian asked him by whom and for what purpose werst thou sent on earth the youth scoffed at the word sent and replied not being thy supreme intelligence or infinite nihility i am unable to explain the phenomenon upon which he quoted                 how sunk in darkness gaur must be                whose guide is blind shiromani  at length it so happened that the four young men having frequently been surprised in flagrant delict were summoned to the dread presence of the university gurusfn128 who addressed them as follows  there are four different characters in the world he who perfectly obeys the commands he who practices the commands but follows evil he who does neither good nor evil and he who does nothing but evil the third character it is observed is also an offender for he neglects that which he ought to observe but ye all belong to the fourth category   then turning to the elder they said  in works written upon the subject of government it is advised cut off the gamblers nose and ears hold up his name to public contempt and drive him out of the country that he may thus become an example to others for they who play must more often lose than win and losing they must either pay or not pay in the latter case they forfeit caste in the former they utterly reduce themselves and though a gamblers wife and children are in the house do not consider them to be so since it is not known when they will be lostfn129 thus he is left in a state of perfect nottwoness solitude and he will be reborn in hell o young man thou hast set a bad example to others therefore shalt thou immediately exchange this university for a country life  then they spoke to the second offender thus   the wise shun woman who can fascinate a man in the twinkling of an eye but the foolish conceiving an affection for her forfeit in the pursuit of pleasure their truthfulness reputation and good disposition their way of life and mode of thought their vows and their religion and to such the advice of their spiritual teachers comes amiss whilst they make others as bad as themselves for it is said he who has lost all sense of shame fears not to disgrace another and there is the proverb a wild cat that devours its own young is not likely to let a rat escape  therefore must thou too o young man quit this seat of learning with all possible expedition  the young man proceeded to justify himself by quotations from the lilashastra his textbook by citing such lines as                 fortune favours folly and force  and by advising the elderly professors to improve their skill in the peace and war of love but they drove him out with execrations  as sagely and as solemnly did the pandits and the gurus reprove the thief and the atheist but they did not dispense the words of wisdom in equal proportions they warned the former that petty larceny is punishable with fine theft on a larger scale with mutilation of the hand and robbery when detected in the act with loss of lifefn130 that for cutting purses or for snatching them out of a mans waistclothfn131 the first penalty is chopping off the fingers the second is the loss of the hand and the third is death then they call him a dishonour to the college and they said thou art as a woman the greatest of plunderers other robbers purloin property which is worthless thou stealest the best they plunder in the night thou in the day and so forth they told him that he was a fellow who had read his chauriya vidya to more purpose then his ritualfn132 and they drove him from the door as he in his shamelessness began to quote texts about the four approved ways of housebreaking namely picking out burnt bricks cutting through unbaked bricks throwing water on a mud wall and boring one of wood with a centrebit  but they spent six mortal hours in convicting the atheist whose abominations they refuted by every possible argumentation by inference by comparison and by sounds by sruti and smriti ie revelational and traditional rational and evidential physical and metaphysical analytical and synthetical philosophical and philological historical and so forth but they found all their endeavours vain for it is said a man who has lost all shame who can talk without sense and who tries to cheat his opponent will never get tired and will never be put down he declared that a nonad was far more probable than a monad the active principle or the duad the passive principle or matter he compared their faith with a bubble in the water of which we can never predicate that it does exist or it does not it is he said unreal as when the thirsty mistakes the meadow mist for a pool of water he proved the eternity of soundfn133 he impudently recounted and justified all the villanies of the vamachari or lefthanded sects he told them that they had taken up an asss load of religion and had better apply to honest industry he fell foul of the gods accused yama of kicking his own mother indra of tempting the wife of his spiritual guide and shiva of associating with low women thus he said no one can respect them do not we say when it thunders awfully the rascally gods are dying and when it is too wet these villain gods are sending too much rain briefly the young brahman replied to and harangued them all so impertinently if not pertinently that they waxing angry fell upon him with their staves and drove him out of assembly  then the four thriftless youths returned home to their father who in his just indignation had urged their disgrace upon the pandits and gurus otherwise these dignitaries would never have resorted to such extreme measures with so distinguished a house he took the opportunity of turning them out upon the world until such time as they might be able to show substantial signs of reform for he said those who have read science in their boyhood and who in youth agitated by evil passions have remained in the insolence of ignorance feel regret in their old age and are consumed by the fire of avarice in order to supply them with a motive for the task proposed he stopped their monthly allowance but he added if they would repair to the neighbouring university of jayasthal and there show themselves something better than a disgrace to their family he would direct their maternal uncle to supply them with all the necessaries of food and raiment  in vain the youths attempted with sighs and tears and threats of suicide to soften the paternal heart he was inexorable for two reasons in the first place after wondering away the wonder with which he regarded his own failure he felt that a stigma now attached to the name of the pious and learned vishnu swami whose lectures upon management during teens and whose brahman young mans own book had become standard works secondly from a sense of duty he determined to omit nothing that might tend to reclaim the reprobates as regards the monthly allowance being stopped the reverend man had become every year a little fonder of his purse he had hoped that his sons would have qualified themselves to take pupils and thus achieve for themselves as he phrased it a genteel independence whilst they openly derided the career calling it an admirable provision for the more indigent members of the middle classes for which reason he referred them to their maternal uncle a man of known and remarkable penuriousness  the four neerdoweals foreseeing what awaited them at jayasthal deferred it as a last resource determining first to see a little life and to push their way in the world before condemning themselves to the tribulations of reform  they tried to live without a monthly allowance and notably they failed it was squeezing as men say oil from sand the gambler having no capital and worse still no credit lost two or three suvernasfn134 at play and could not pay them in consequence of which he was soundly beaten with ironshod staves and was nearly compelled by the keeper of the hell to sell himself into slavery thus he became disgusted and telling his brethren that they would find him at jayasthal he departed with the intention of studying wisdom  a month afterwards came the libertines turn to be disappointed he could no longer afford fine new clothes even a wellwashed coat was beyond his means he had reckoned upon his handsome face and he had matured a plan for laying various elderly conquests under contribution judge therefore his disgust when all the women high and low rich and poor old and young ugly and beautifulseeing the end of his waistcloth thrown empty over his shoulder passed him in the streets without even deigning a look the very shopkeepers wives who once had adored his mustachio and had never ceased talking of his elegant gait despised him and the wealthy old person who formerly supplied his small feet with the choicest slippers left him to starve upon which he also in a state of repentance followed his brother to acquire knowledge  am i not quoth the thief to himself a cat in climbing a deer in running a snake in twisting a hawk in pouncing a dog in scentingkeen as a hare tenacious as a wolf strong as a liona lamp in the night a horse on a plain a mule on a stony path a boat in the water a rock on landfn135 the reply to his own questions was of course affirmative but despite all these fine qualities and notwithstanding his scrupulous strictness in invocating the housebreaking tool and in devoting a due portion of his gains to the gods of plunderfn136 he was caught in a storeroom by the proprietor who inexorably handed him over to justice as he belonged to the priestly castefn137 the fine imposed upon him was heavy he could not pay it and therefore he was thrown into a dungeon where he remained for some time but at last he escaped from jail when he made his parting bow to kartikeyafn138 stole a blanket from one of the guards and set out for jayasthal cursing his old profession  the atheist also found himself in a position that deprived him of all his pleasures he delighted in afterdinner controversies and in bringing the light troops of his wit to bear upon the unwieldy masses of lore and logic opposed to him by polemical brahmans who out of respect for his father did not lay an action against him for overpowering them in theological disputationfn139 in the strange city to which he had removed no one knew the son of vishnu swami and no one cared to invite him to the house once he attempted his usual trick upon a knot of sages who sitting round a tank were recreating themselves with quoting mystical sanskrit shlokasfn140 of abominable longwindedness the result was his being obliged to ply his heels vigorously in flight from the justly incensed literati to whom he had said tush and pish at least a dozen times in as many minutes he therefore also followed the example of his brethren and started for jayasthal with all possible expedition  arrived at the house of their maternal uncle the young men as by one assent began to attempt the unloosening of his pursestrings signally failing in this and in other notable schemes they determined to lay in that stock of facts and useful knowledge which might reconcile them with their father and restore them to that happy life at gaur which they then despised and which now brought tears into their eyes  then they debated with one another what they should study                                     that branch of the preternatural popularly called white magic found with them favour                                     they chose a guru or teacher strictly according to the orders of their faith a wise man of honourable family and affable demeanour who was not a glutton nor leprous nor blind of one eye nor blind of both eyes nor very short nor suffering from whitlowsfn141 asthma or other disease nor noisy and talkative nor with any defect about the fingers and toes nor subject to his wife                                      a grand discovery had been lately made by a certain physiologicophilosophico psychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian in investigating the vestiges of creation the cause of causes the effect of effects and the original origin of that matra matter which some regard as an entity others as a nonentity others selfexistent others merely specious and therefore unexistent he became convinced that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself after inhabiting a garret and diving into the depths of his self consciousness for a few score years he was able to produce such complex globule in triturated and roasted flint by means ofi will not say what happily for creation in general the discovery died a natural death some centuries ago an edifying spectacle indeed for the world to see a cross old man sitting amongst his gallipots and crucibles creating animalculae providing the corpses of birds beasts and fishes with what is vulgarly called life and supplying to epigenesis all the latest improvements  in those days the invention being a novelty engrossed the thoughts of the universal learned who were in a fever of excitement about it some believed in it so implicity that they saw in every experiment a hundred things which they did not see others were so sceptical and contradictory that they would not preceive what they did see those blended with each fact their own deductions whilst these span round every reality the web of their own prejudices curious to say the jayasthalians amongst whom the luminous science arose hailed it with delight whilst the gaurians derided its claim to be considered an important addition to human knowledge  let me try to remember a few of their words  unfortunate human nature wrote the wise of gaur against the wise of jayasthal wanted no crowning indignity but this you had already proved that the body is made of the basest element earth you had argued away the immovability the ubiquity the permanency the eternity and the divinity of the soul for is not your favourite axiom  it is the nature of limbs which thinketh in man the immortal mind is according to you an ignoble viscus the godlike gift of reason is the instinct of a dog somewhat highly developed still you left us something to hope still you allowed us one boast still life was a thread connecting us with the giver of life but now with an impious hand in blasphemous rage ye have rent asunder that last frail tie and so forth  welcome thrice welcome this latest and most admirable development of human wisdom wrote the sage jayasthalians against the sage gaurians which has assigned to man his proper state and status and station in the magnificent scale of being we have not created the facts which we have investigated and which we now proudly publish we have proved materialism to be natures own system but our philosophy of matter cannot overturn any truth because if erroneous it will necessarily sink into oblivion if real it will tend only to instruct and to enlighten the world wise are ye in your generation o ye sages of gaur yet withal wondrous illogical and much of this kind  concerning all which mighty king i as a vampire have only to remark that those two learned bodies like your rajaships nine gems of science were in the habit of talking most about what they least understood  the four young men applied the whole force of their talents to mastering the difficulties of the lifegiving process and in due time their industry obtained its reward  then they determined to return home as with beating hearts they approached the old city their birthplace and gazed with moistened eyes upon its tall spires and grim pagodas its verdant meads and venerable groves they saw a kanjarfn142 who having tied up in a bundle the skin and bones of a tiger which he had found dead was about to go on his way then said the thief to the gambler take we these remains with us and by means of them prove the truth of our science before the people of gaur to the offence of their nosesfn143 being now possessed of knowledge they resolved to apply it to its proper purpose namely power over the property of others accordingly the wencher the gambler and the atheist kept the kanjar in conversation whilst the thief vivified a shank bone and the bone thereupon stood upright and hopped about in so grotesque and wonderful a way that the man being frightened fled as if i had been close behind him  vishnu swami had lately written a very learned commentary on the mystical words of lokakshi  the scriptures are at variancethe tradition is at variance he who gives a meaning of his own quoting the vedas is no philosopher  true philosophy through ignorance is concealed as in the fissures of a rock  but the way of the great onethat is to be followed  and the success of his book had quite effaced from the brahman mind the holy mans failure in bringing up his children he followed up this by adding to his essay on education a twentieth tome containing recipes for the reformation of prodigals  the learned and reverend father received his sons with open arms he had heard from his brotherinlaw that the youths were qualified to support themselves and when informed that they wished to make a public experiment of their science he exerted himself despite his disbelief in it to forward their views  the pandits and gurus were long before they would consent to attend what they considered dealings with yama the devil in consequence however of vishnu swamis name and importunity at length on a certain day all the pious learned and reverend tutors teachers professors prolocutors pastors spiritual fathers poets philosophers mathematicians schoolmasters pedagogues bearleaders institutors gerundgrinders preceptors dominies brushers coryphaei drynurses coaches mentors monitors lecturers prelectors fellows and heads of houses at the university at gaur met together in a large garden where they usually diverted themselves out of hours with balltossing pigeontumbling and kiteflying  presently the four young men carrying their bundle of bones and the other requisites stepped forward walking slowly with eyes downcast like shrinking cattle for it is said the brahman must not run even when it rains  after pronouncing an impromptu speech composed for them by their father and so stuffed with erudition that even the writer hardly understood it they announced their wish to prove by ocular demonstration the truth of a science upon which their shortsighted rivals of jayasthal had cast cold water but which they remarked in the eloquent peroration of their discourse the sages of gaur had welcomed with that wise and catholic spirit of inquiry which had ever characterized their distinguished body  huge words involved sentences and the highflown compliment exceedingly undeserved obscured i suppose the bright wits of the intellectual convocation which really began to think that their liberality of opinion deserved all praise  none objected to what was being prepared except one of the heads of houses his appeal was generally scouted because his sanskrit style was vulgarly intelligible and he had the bad name of being a practical man the metaphysician rashik lall sneered to vaiswata the poet who passed on the look to the theophilosopher vardhaman haridatt the antiquarian whispered the metaphysician vasudeva who burst into a loud laugh whilst narayan jagasharma and devaswami all very learned in the vedas opened their eyes and stared at him with wellsimulated astonishment so he being offended said nothing more but arose and walked home  a great crowd gathered round the four young men and their father as opening the bundle that contained the tigers remains they prepared for their task  one of the operators spread the bones upon the ground and fixed each one into its proper socket not forgetting even the teeth and tusks  the second connected by means of a marvellous unguent the skeleton with the muscles and heart of an elephant which he had procured for the purpose  the third drew from his pouch the brain and eyes of a large tomcat which he carefully fitted into the animals skull and then covered the body with the hide of a young rhinoceros  then the fourththe atheistwho had been directing the operation produced a globule having another globule within itself and as the crowd pressed on them craning their necks breathless with anxiety he placed the principle of organic life in the tigers body with such effect that the monster immediately heaved its chest breathed agitated its limbs opened its eyes jumped to its feet shook itself glared around and began to gnash its teeth and lick its chops lashing the while its ribs with its tail  the sages sprang back and the beast sprang forward with a roar like thunder during elephantatimefn144 it flew at the nearest of the spectators flung vishnu swami to the ground and clawed his four sons then not even stopping to drink their blood it hurried after the flying herd of wise men jostling and tumbling stumbling and catching at one anothers long robes they rushed in hottest haste towards the garden gate but the beast having the muscles of an elephant as well as the bones of a tiger made a few bounds of eighty or ninety feet each easily distanced them and took away all chance of escape to be brief as the monster was frightfully hungry after its long fast and as the imprudent young men had furnished it with admirable implements of destruction it did not cease its work till one hundred and twentyone learned and highly distinguished pandits and gurus lay upon the ground chawed clawed sucked dry and in most cases stonedead amongst them i need hardly say were the sage vishnu swami and his four sons  having told this story the vampire hung silent for a time presently he resumed  now heed my words raja vikram i am about to ask thee which of all those learned men was the most finished fool the answer is easily found yet it must be distasteful to thee therefore mortify thy vanity as soon as possible or i shall be talking and thou wilt be walking through this livelong night to scanty purpose remember science without understanding is of little use indeed understanding is superior to science and those devoid of understanding perish as did the persons who revivified the tiger before this i warned thee to beware of thyself and of thine own conceit here then is an opportunity for selfdisciplinewhich of all those learned men was the greatest fool  the warrior king mistook the kind of mortification imposed upon him and pondered over the uncomfortable nature of the replyin the presence of his son  again the baital taunted him  the greatest fool of all at last said vikram in slow and by no means willing accents was the father is it not said there is no fool like an old fool  gramercy cried the vampire bursting out into a discordant laugh i now return to my tree by this head i never before heard a father so readily condemn a father with these words he disappeared slipping out of the bundle  the raja scolded his son a little for want of obedience and said that he had always thought more highly of his acutenessnever could have believed that he would have been taken in by so shallow a trick dharma dhwaj answered not a word to this but promised to be wiser another time  then they returned to the tree and did what they had so often done before  and as before the baital held his tongue for a time presently he began as follows           the vampires eighth story     of the use and misuse of magic pills  the lady chandraprabha daughter of the raja subichar was a particularly beautiful girl and marriageable withal one day as vasanta the spring began to assert its reign over the world animate and inanimate she went accompanied by her young friends and companions to stroll about her fathers pleasuregarden  the fair troop wandered through sombre groves where the dark tamaletree entwined its branches with the pale green foliage of the nim and the pippals domes of quivering leaves contrasted with the columnar aisles of the banyan fig they admired the old monarchs of the forest bearded to the waist with hangings of moss the flowing creepers delicately climbing from the lower branches to the topmost shoots and the cordage of llianas stretching from trunk to trunk like bridges for the monkeys to pass over then they issued into a clear space dotted with asokas bearing rich crimson fiowers cliterias of azure blue madhavis exhibiting petals virgin white as the snows on himalaya and jasmines raining showers of perfumed blossoms upon the grateful earth they could not sufficiently praise the tall and graceful stem of the arrowy areca contrasting with the solid pyramid of the cypress and the more masculine stature of the palm now they lingered in the trellised walks closely covered over with vines and creepers then they stopped to gather the golden bloom weighing down the mango boughs and to smell the highlyscented flowers that hung from the green fretwork of the chambela  it was spring i have said the air was still except when broken by the hum of the large black bramra bee as he plied his task amidst the red and orange flowers of the dak and by the gushings of many waters that made music as they coursed down their stuccoed channels between borders of many coloured poppies and beds of various flowers from time to time the dulcet note of the kokila bird and the hoarse plaint of the turtledove deep hid in her leafy bower attracted every ear and thrilled every heart the south windbreeze of the southfn145 the friend of love and spring blew with a voluptuous warmth for rain clouds canopied the earth and the breath of the narcissus the rose and the citron teemed with a languid fragrance  the charms of the season affected all the damsels they amused themselves in their privacy with pelting blossoms at one another running races down the smooth broad alleys mounting the silken swings that hung between the orange trees embracing one another and at times trying to push the butt of the party into the fishpond perhaps the liveliest of all was the lady chandraprabha who on account of her rank could pelt and push all the others without fear of being pelted and pushed in return  it so happened before the attendants had had time to secure privacy for the princess and her women that manaswi a very handsome youth a brahmans son had wandered without malicious intention into the garden fatigued with walking and finding a cool shady place beneath a tree he had lain down there and had gone to sleep and had not been observed by any of the kings people he was still sleeping when the princess and her companions were playing together  presently chandraprabha weary of sport left her friends and singing a lively air tripped up the stairs leading to the summerhouse aroused by the sound of her advancing footsteps manaswi sat up and the princess seeing a strange man started but their eyes had met and both were subdued by lovelove vulgarly called love at first sight  nonsense exclaimed the warrior king testily i can never believe in that freak of kama deva he spoke feelingly for the thing had happened to himself more than once and on no occasion had it turned out well  but there is such a thing o raja as love at first sight objected the baital speaking dogmatically  then perhaps thou canst account for it dead one growled the monarch surlily  i have no reason to do so o vikram retorted the vampire when you men have already done it listen then to the words of the wise in the olden time one of your great philosophers invented a fluid pervading all matter strongly selfrepulsive like the steam of a brass pot and widely spreading like the breath of scandal the repulsiveness however according to that wise man is greatly modified by its second property namely an energetic attraction or adhesion to all material bodies thus every substance contains a part more or less of this fluid pervading it throughout and strongly bound to each component atom he called it ambericity for the best of reasons as it has no connection with amber and he described it as an imponderable which meaning that it could not be weighed gives a very accurate and satisfactory idea of its nature  now said that philosopher whenever two bodies containing that unweighable substance in unequal proportions happen to meet a current of imponderable passes from one to the other producing a kind of attraction and tending to adhere the operation takes place instantaneously when the force is strong and much condensed thus the vulgar who call things after their effects and not from their causes term the action of this imponderable love at first sight the wise define it to be a phenomenon of ambericity as regards my own opinion about the matter i have long ago told it to you o vikram silliness  either hold your tongue fellow or go on with your story cried the raja wearied out by so many words that had no manner of sense  well the effect of the first glance was that manaswi the brahmans son fell back in a swoon and remained senseless upon the ground where he had been sitting and the rajas daughter began to tremble upon her feet and presently dropped unconscious upon the floor of the summerhouse shortly after this she was found by her companions and attendants who quickly taking her up in their arms and supporting her into a litter conveyed her home  manaswi the brahmans son was so completely overcome that he lay there dead to everything just then the learned deeply read and purblind pandits muldev and shashi by name strayed into the garden and stumbled upon the body  friend said muldev how came this youth thus to fall senseless on the ground  man replied shashi doubtless some damsel has shot forth the arrows of her glances from the bow of her eyebrows and thence he has become insensible  we must lift him up then said muldev the benevolent  what need is there to raise him asked shashi the misanthrope by way of reply  muldev however would not listen to these words he ran to the pond hard by soaked the end of his waistcloth in water sprinkled it over the young brahman raised him from the ground and placed him sitting against the wall and perceiving when he came to himself that his sickness was rather of the soul than of the body the old men asked him how he came to be in that plight  we should tell our griefs answered manaswi only to those who will relieve us what is the use of communicating them to those who when they have heard cannot help us what is to be gained by the empty pity or by the useless condolence of men in general  the pandits however by friendly looks and words presently persuaded him to break silence when he said a certain princess entered this summerhouse and from the sight of her i have fallen into this state if i can obtain her i shall live if not i must die  come with me young man said muldev the benevolent i will use every endeavour to obtain her and if i do not succeed i will make thee wealthy and independent of the world  manaswi rejoined the deity in his beneficence has created many jewels in this world but the pearl woman is chiefest of all and for her sake only does man desire wealth what are riches to one who has abandoned his wife what are they who do not possess beautiful wives they are but beings inferior to the beasts wealth is the fruit of virtue ease of wealth a wife of ease and where no wife is how can there be happiness and the enamoured youth rambled on in this way curious to us raja vikram but perhaps natural enough in a brahmans son suffering under that endemic maladydetermination to marry  whatever thou mayest desire said muldev shall by the blessing of heaven be given to thee  manaswi implored him saying most pathetically o pandit bestow then that damsel upon me  muldev promised to do so and having comforted the youth led him to his own house then he welcomed him politely seated him upon the carpet and left him for a few minutes promising him to return when he reappeared he held in his hand two little balls or pills and showing them to manaswi he explained their virtues as follows  there is in our house an hereditary secret by means of which i try to promote the weal of humanity but in all cases my success depends mainly upon the purity and the heartwholeness of those that seek my aid if thou place this in thy mouth thou shalt be changed into a damsel twelve years old and when thou withdrawest it again thou shalt again recover thine original form beware however that thou use the power for none but a good purpose otherwise some great calamity will befall thee therefore take counsel of thyself before undertaking this trial  what lover o warrior king vikram would have hesitated under such circumstances to assure the pandit that he was the most innocent earnest and wellintentioned being in the three worlds  the brahmans son at least lost no time in so doing hence the simpleminded philosopher put one of the pills into the young mans mouth warning him on no account to swallow it and took the other into his own mouth upon which manaswi became a sprightly young maid and muldev was changed to a reverend and decrepid senior not fewer than eighty years old  thus transformed the twain walked up to the palace of the raja subichar and stood for a while to admire the gate then passing through seven courts beautiful as the paradise of indra they entered unannounced as became the priestly dignity a hall where surrounded by his courtiers sat the ruler the latter seeing the holy brahman under his roof rose up made the customary humble salutation and taking their right hands led what appeared to be the father and daughter to appropriate seats upon which muldev having recited a verse bestowed upon the raja a blessing whose beauty has been diffused over all creation  may that deityfn146 who as a mannikin deceived the great king bali who as a hero with a monkeyhost bridged the salt sea who as a shepherd lifted up the mountain gobarddhan in the palm of his hand and by it saved the cowherds and cowherdesses from the thunders of heavenmay that deity be thy protector  having heard and marvelled at this display of eloquence the raja inquired whence hath your holiness come  my country replied muldev is on the northern side of the great mother ganges and there too my dwelling is i travelled to a distant land and having found in this maiden a worthy wife for my son i straightway returned homewards meanwhile a famine had laid waste our village and my wife and my son have fled i know not where encumbered with this damsel how can i wander about seeking them hearing the name of a pious and generous ruler i said to myself  i will leave her under his charge until my return be pleased to take great care of her  for a minute the raja sat thoughtful and silent he was highly pleased with the brahmans perfect compliment but he could not hide from himself that he was placed between two difficulties one the charge of a beautiful young girl with pouting lips soft speech and roguish eyes the other a priestly curse upon himself and his kingdom he thought however refusal the more dangerous so he raised his face and exclaimed o produce of brahmas headfn147 i will do what your highness has desired of me  upon which the brahman after delivering a benediction of adieu almost as beautiful and spiritstirring as that with which he had presented himself took the betelfn148 and went his ways  then the raja sent for his daughter chandraprabha and said to her this is the affianced bride of a young brahman and she has been trusted to my protection for a time by her fatherinlaw take her therefore into the inner rooms treat her with the utmost regard and never allow her to be separated from thee day or night asleep or awake eating or drinking at home or abroad  chandraprabha took the hand of sitaas manaswi had pleased to call himselfand led the way to her own apartment once the seat of joy and pleasure the rooms now wore a desolate and melancholy look the windows were darkened the attendants moved noiselessly over the carpets as if their footsteps would cause headache and there was a faint scent of some drug much used in cases of deliquium the apartments were handsome but the only ornament in the room where they sat was a large bunch of withered flowers in an arched recess and these though possibly interesting to some one were not likely to find favour as a decoration in the eyes of everybody  the rajas daughter paid the greatest attention and talked with unusual vivacity to the brahmans daughterinlaw either because she had roguish eyes or from some presentiment of what was to occur whichever you please raja vikram and it is no matter which still sita could not help perceiving that there was a shade of sorrow upon the forehead of her fair new friend and so when they retired to rest she asked the cause of it  then chandraprabha related to her the sad tale one day in the spring season as i was strolling in the garden along with my companions i beheld a very handsome brahman and our eyes having met he became unconscious and i also was insensible my companions seeing my condition brought me home and therefore i know neither his name nor his abode his beautiful form is impressed upon my memory i have now no desire to eat or to drink and from this distress my colour has become pale and my body is thus emaciated and the beautiful princess sighed a sigh that was musical and melancholy and concluded by predicting for herselfas persons similarly placed often doa sudden and untimely end about the beginning of the next month  what wilt thou give me asked the brahmans daughterinlaw demurely if i show thee thy beloved at this very moment  the rajas daughter answered i will ever be the lowest of thy slaves standing before thee with joined hands  upon which sita removed the pill from her mouth and instantly having become manaswi put it carefully away in a little bag hung round his neck at this sight chandraprabha felt abashed and hung down her head in beautiful confusion to describe  i will have no descriptions vampire cried the great vikram jerking the bag up and down as if he were sweating gold in it the fewer of thy descriptions the better for us all  briefly resumed the demon manaswi reflected upon the eight forms of marriageviz bramhalagan when a girl is given to a brahman or man of superior caste without reward daiva when she is presented as a gift or fee to the officiating priest at the close of a sacrifice arsha when two cows are received by the girls father in exchange for the bridefn149 prajapatya when the girl is given at the request of a brahman and the father says to his daughter and her to betrothed go fulfil the duties of religion asura when money is received by the father in exchange for the bride rakshasha when she is captured in war or when her bridegroom overcomes his rival paisacha when the girl is taken away from her fathers house by craft and eighthly gandharvalagan or the marriage that takes place by mutual consentfn150  manaswi preferred the latter especially as by her rank and age the princess was entitled to call upon her father for the lakshmi swayambara wedding in which she would have chosen her own husband and thus it is that rama arjuna krishna nala and others were proposed to by the princesses whom they married  for five months after these nuptials manaswi never stirred out of the palace but remained there by day a woman and a man by night the consequence was that hei call him he for whether manaswi or sita his mind ever remained masculinepresently found himself in a fair way to become a father  now one would imagine that a change of sex every twentyfour hours would be variety enough to satisfy even a man manaswi however was not contented he began to pine for more liberty and to find fault with his wife for not taking him out into the world and you might have supposed that a young person who from love at first sight had fallen senseless upon the steps of a summerhouse and who had devoted herself to a sudden and untimely end because she was separated from her lover would have repressed her yawns and little irritable words even for a year after having converted him into a husband but no chandraprabha soon felt as tired of seeing manaswi and nothing but manaswi as manaswi was weary of seeing chandraprabha and nothing but chandraprabha often she had been on the point of proposing visits and outofdoor excursions but when at last the idea was first suggested by her husband she at once became an injured woman she hinted how foolish it was for married people to imprison themselves and to quarrel all day when manaswi remonstrated saying that he wanted nothing better than to appear before the world with her as his wife but that he really did not know what her father might do to him she threw out a cutting sarcasm upon his effeminate appearance during the hours of light she then told him of an unfortunate young woman in an old nursery tale who had unconsciously married a fiend that became a fine handsome man at night when no eye could see him and utter ugliness by day when good looks show to advantage and lastly when inveighing against the changeableness fickleness and infidelity of mankind she quoted the words of the poet                 out upon change it tires the heart                       and weighs the noble spirit down                a vain vain world indeed thou art                       that can such vile condition own                the veil hath fallen from my eyes                       i cannot love where i despise  you can easily o king vikram continue for yourself and conclude this lecture which i leave unfinished on account of its length  chandraprabha and sita who called each other the zodiacal twins and laughter lightfn151 and allconsenters easily persuaded the old raja that their health would be further improved by air exercise and distractions subichar being delighted with the change that had taken place in a daughter whom he loved and whom he had feared to lose told them to do as they pleased they began a new life in which short trips and visits baths and dances music parties drives in bullock chariots and water excursions succeeded one another  it so happened that one day the raja went with his whole family to a wedding feast in the house of his grand treasurer where the latters son saw manaswi in the beautiful shape of sita this was a third case of love at first sight for the young man immediately said to a particular friend if i obtain that girl i shall live if not i shall abandon life  in the meantime the king having enjoyed the feast came back to his palace with his whole family the condition of the treasurers son however became very distressing and through separation from his beloved he gave up eating and drinking the particular friend had kept the secret for some days though burning to tell it at length he found an excuse for himself in the sad state of his friend and he immediately went and divulged all that he knew to the treasurer after this he felt relieved  the minister repaired to the court and laid his case before the king saying great raja through the love of that brahmans daughterinlaw my sons state is very bad he has given up eating and drinking in fact he is consumed by the fire of separation if now your majesty could show compassion and bestow the girl upon him his life would be saved if not  fool cried the raja who hearing these words had waxed very wroth it is not right for kings to do injustice listen when a person puts any one in charge of a protector how can the latter give away his trust without consulting the person that trusted him and yet this is what you wish me to do  the treasurer knew that the raja could not govern his realm without him and he was well acquainted with his masters character he said to himself this will not last long but he remained dumb simulating hopelessness and hanging down his head whilst subichar alternately scolded and coaxed abused and flattered him in order to open his lips then with tears in his eyes he muttered a request to take leave and as he passed through the palace gates he said aloud with a resolute air it will cost me but ten days of fasting  the treasurer having returned home collected all his attendants and went straightway to his sons room seeing the youth still stretched upon his sleepingmat and very yellow for the want of food he took his hand and said in a whisper meant to be audible alas poor son i can do nothing but perish with thee  the servants hearing this threat slipped one by one out of the room and each went to tell his friend that the grand treasurer had resolved to live no longer after which they went back to the house to see if their master intended to keep his word and curious to know if he did intend to die how where and when it was to be and they were not disappointed i do not mean that the wished their lord to die as he was a good master to them but still there was an excitement in the thing  raja vikram could not refrain from showing his anger at the insult thus cast by the baital upon human nature the wretch however pretending not to notice it went on without interrupting himself  which somehow or other pleased them  when the treasurer had spent three days without touching bread or water all the cabinet council met and determined to retire from business unless the raja yielded to their solicitations the treasurer was their working man besides which said the cabinet council if a certain person gets into the habit of refusing us what is to be the end of it and what is the use of being cabinet councillors any longer  early on the next morning the ministers went in a body before the raja and humbly represented that the treasurers son is at the point of death the effect of a full heart and an empty stomach should he die the father who has not eaten or drunk during the last three days the raja trembled to hear the intelligence though he knew it his father we say cannot be saved if the father dies the affairs of the kingdom come to ruinis he not the grand treasurer it is already said that half the accounts have been gnawed by white ants and that some pernicious substance in the ink has eaten jagged holes through the paper so that the other half of the accounts is illegible it were best sire that you agree to what we represent  the white ants and corrosive ink were too strong for the rajas determination still wishing to save appearances he replied with much firmness that he knew the value of the treasurer and his son that he would do much to save them but that he had passed his royal word and had undertaken a trust that he would rather die a dozen deaths than break his promise or not discharge his duty faithfully that mans condition in this world is to depart from it none remaining in it that one comes and that one goes none knowing when or where but that eternity is eternity for happiness or misery and much of the same nature not very novel and not perhaps quite to the purpose but edifying to those who knew what lay behind the speakers words  the ministers did not know their lords character so well as the grand treasurer and they were more impressed by his firm demeanour and the number of his words than he wished them to be after allowing his speech to settle in their minds he did away with a great part of its effect by declaring that such were the sentiments and the principleswhen a man talks of his principles o vikram ask thyself the reason whyinstilled into his youthful mind by the most honourable of fathers and the most virtuous of mothers at the same time that he was by no means obstinate or proof against conviction in token whereof he graciously permitted the councillors to convince him that it was his royal duty to break his word and betray his trust and to give away another mans wife  pray do not lose your temper o warrior king subichar although a raja was a weak man and you know or you ought to know that the wicked may be wise in their generation but the weak never can  well the ministers hearing their lords last words took courage and proceeded to work upon his mind by the figure of speech popularly called rigmarole they said great king that old brahman has been gone many days and has not returned he is probably dead and burnt it is therefore right that by giving to the grand treasurers son his daughterinlaw who is only affianced not fairly married you should establish your government firmly and even if he should return bestow villages and wealth upon him and if he be not then content provide another and a more beautiful wife for his son and dismiss him a person should be sacrificed for the sake of a family a family for a city a city for a country and a country for a king  subichar having heard them dismissed them with the remark that as so much was to be said on both sides he must employ the night in thinking over the matter and that he would on the next day favour them with his decision the cabinet councillors knew by this that he meant that he would go and consult his wives they retired contented convinced that every voice would be in favour of a wedding and that the young girl with so good an offer would not sacrifice the present to the future  that evening the treasurer and his son supped together  the first words uttered by raja subichar when he entered his daughters apartment were an order addressed to sita go thou at once to the house of my treasurers son  now as chandraprabha and manaswi were generally scolding each other chandraprabha and sita were hardly on speaking terms when they heard the rajas order for their separation they were  delighted cried dharma dhwaj who for some reason took the greatest interest in the narrative  overwhelmed with grief thou most guileless yuva raja young prince ejaculated the vampire  raja vikram reproved his son for talking about thing of which he knew nothing and the baital resumed  they turned pale and wept and they wrung their hands and they begged and argued and refused obedience in fact they did everything to make the king revoke his order  the virtue of a woman quoth sita is destroyed through too much beauty the religion of a brahman is impaired by serving kings a cow is spoiled by distant pasturage wealth is lost by committing injustice and prosperity departs from the house where promises are not kept  the raja highly applauded the sentiment but was firm as a rock upon the subject of sita marrying the treasurers son  chandraprabha observed that her royal father usually so conscientious must now be acting from interested motives and that when selfishness sways a man right becomes left and left becomes right as in the reflection of a mirror  subichar approved of the comparison he was not quite so resolved but he showed no symptoms of changing his mind  then the brahmans daughterinlaw with the view of gaining timea famous stratagem amongst femininessaid to the raja great king if you are determined upon giving me to the grand treasurers son exact from him the promise that he will do what i bid him only on this condition will i ever enter his house  speak then asked the king what will he have to do  she replied i am of the brahman or priestly caste he is the son of a kshatriya or warrior the law directs that before we twain can wed he should perform yatra pilgrimage to all the holy places  thou hast spoken vedatruth girl answered the raja not sorry to have found so good a pretext for temporizing and at the same time to preserve his character for firmness resolution determination  that night manaswi and chandraprabha instead of scolding each other congratulated themselves upon having escaped an imminent dangerwhich they did not escape  in the morning subichar sent for his ministers including his grand treasurer and his lovesick son and told them how well and wisely the brahmans daughterinlaw had spoken upon the subject of the marriage all of them approved of the condition but the young man ventured to suggest that while he was apilgrimaging the maiden should reside under his fathers roof as he and his father showed a disposition to continue their fasts in case of the small favour not being granted the raja though very loath to separate his beloved daughter and her dear friend was driven to do it and sita was carried off weeping bitterly to the treasurers palace that dignitary solemnly committed her to the charge of his third and youngest wife the lady subhagyasundari who was about her own age and said you must both live together without any kind of wrangling or contention and do not go into other peoples houses and the grand treasurers son went off to perform his pilgrimages  it is no less sad than true raja vikram that in less than six days the disconsolate sita waxed weary of being sita took the ball out of her mouth and became manaswi alas for the infidelity of mankind but it is gratifying to reflect that he met with the punishment with which the pandit muldev had threatened him one night the magic pill slipped down his throat when morning dawned being unable to change himself into sita manaswi was obliged to escape through a window from the lady subhagyasundaris room he sprained his ankle with the leap and he lay for a time upon the groundwhere i leave him whilst convenient to me  when muldev quitted the presence of subichar he resumed his old shape and returning to his brother pandit shashi told him what he had done whereupon shashi the misanthrope looked black and used hard words and told his friend that good nature and softheartedness had caused him to commit a very bad actiona grievous sin incensed at this charge the philanthropic muldev became angry and said i have warned the youth about his purity what harm can come of it  thou hast retorted shashi with irritating coolness placed a sharp weapon in a fools hand  i have not cried muldev indignantly  therefore drawled the malevolent you are answerable for all the mischief he does with it and mischief assuredly he will do  he will not by brahma exclaimed muldev  he will by vishnu said shashi with an amiability produced by having completely upset his friends temper and if within the coming six months he does not disgrace himself thou shalt have the whole of my bookcase but if he does the philanthropic muldev will use all his skill and ingenuity in procuring the daughter of raja subichar as a wife for his faithful friend shashi  having made this covenant they both agreed not to speak of the matter till the autumn  the appointed time drawing near the pandits began to make inquiries about the effect of the magic pills presently they found out that sita alias manaswi had one night mysteriously disappeared from the grand treasurers house and had not been heard of since that time this together with certain other things that transpired presently convinced muldev who had cooled down in six months that his friend had won the wager he prepared to make honourable payment by handing a pill to old shashi who at once became a stout handsome young brahman some twenty years old next putting a pill into his own mouth he resumed the shape and form under which he had first appeared before raja subichar and leaning upon his staff he led the way to the palace  the king in great confusion at once recognized the old priest and guessed the errand upon which he and the youth were come however he saluted them and offered them seats and receiving their blessings he began to make inquiries about their health and welfare at last he mustered courage to ask the old brahman where he had been living for so long a time  great king replied the priest i went to seek after my son and having found him i bring him to your majesty give him his wife and i will take them both home with me  raja subichar prevaricated not a little but presently being hard pushed he related everything that had happened  what is this that you have done cried muldev simulating excessive anger and astonishment why have you given my sons wife in marriage to another man you have done what you wished and now therefore receive my shrap curse  the poor raja in great trepidation said o vivinity be not thus angry i will do whatever you bid me  said muldev if through dread of my excommunication you will freely give whatever i demand of you then marry your daughter chandraprabha to this my son on this condition i forgive you to me now a necklace of pearls and a venomous krishna cobra capella the most powerful enemy and the kindest friend the most precious gem and a clod of earth the softest bed and the hardest stone a blade of grass and the loveliest womanare precisely the same all i desire is that in some holy place repeating the name of god i may soon end my days  subichar terrified by this additional show of sanctity at once summoned an astrologer and fixed upon the auspicious moment and lunar influence he did not consult the princess and had he done so she would not have resisted his wishes chandraprabha had heard of sitas escape from the treasurers house and she had on the subject her own suspicions besides which she looked forward to a certain event and she was by no means sure that her royal father approved of the gandharba form of marriageat least for his daughter thus the brahmans son receiving in due time the princess and her dowry took leave of the king and returned to his own village  hardly however had chandraprabha been married to shashi the pandit when manaswi went to him and began to wrangle and said give me my wife he had recovered from the effects of his fall and having lost her he therefore loved hervery dearly  but shashi proved by reference to the astrologers priests and ten persons as witnesses that he had duly wedded her and brought her to his home therefore said he she is my spouse  manaswi swore by all holy things that he had been legally married to her and that he was the father of her child that was about to be how then continued he can she be thy spouse he would have summoned muldev as a witness but that worthy after remonstrating with him disappeared he called upon chandraprabha to confirm his statement but she put on an innocent face and indignantly denied ever having seen the man  still continued the baital many people believed manaswis story as it was marvellous and incredible even to the present day there are many who decidedly think him legally married to the daughter of raja subichar  then they are pestilent fellows cried the warrior king vikram who hated nothing more than clandestine and runaway matches no one knew that the villain manaswi was the father of her child whereas the pandit shashi married her lawfully before witnesses and with all the ceremoniesfn152 she therefore remains his wife and the child will perform the funeral obsequies for him and offer water to the manes of his pitris ancestors at least so say law and justice  which justice is often unjust enough cried the vampire and ply thy legs mighty raja let me see if thou canst reach the sirestree before i do                                   the next story o raja vikram is remarkably interesting            the vampires ninth story                        showing that a mans wife belongs not to his body but to his                    head  far and wide through the lovely land overrun by the arya from the western highlands spread the fame of unmadini the beautiful daughter of haridas the brahman in the numberless odes sonnets and acrostics addressed to her by a hundred pandits and poets her charms were sung with prodigious triteness her presence was compared to light shining in a dark house her face to the full moon her complexion to the yellow champaka flower her curls to female snakes her eyes to those of the deer her eyebrows to bent bows her teeth to strings of little opals her feet to rubies and red gemsfn153 and her gait to that of the wild goose and none forgot to say that her voice affected the author like the song of the kokila bird sounding from the shadowy brake when the breeze blows coolly or that the fairy beings of indras heaven would have shrunk away abashed at her loveliness  but raja vikram all the poets failed to win the fair unmadinis love to praise the beauty of a beauty is not to praise her extol her wit and talents which has the zest of novelty then you may succeed for the same reason read inversely the plainer and cleverer is the bosom you would fire the more personal you must be upon the subject of its grace and loveliness flattery you know is ever the match which kindles the flame of love true it is that some by roughness of demeanour and bluntness in speech contrasting with those whom they call the herd have the art to succeed in the service of the bodyless godfn154 but even they must  the young prince dharma dhwaj could not help laughing at the thought of how this must sound in his fathers ear and the raja hearing the illtimed merriment sternly ordered the baital to cease his immoralities and to continue his story  thus the lovely unmadini conceiving an extreme contempt for poets and literati one day told her father who greatly loved her that her husband must be a fine young man who never wrote verses withal she insisted strongly on mental qualities and science being a person of moderate mind and an adorer of talent when not perverted to poetry  as you may imagine raja vikram all the beautys bosom friends seeing her refuse so many good offers confidently predicted that she would pass through the jungle and content herself with a bad stick or that she would lead ringtailed apes in patala  at length when some time had elapsed four suitors appeared from four different countries all of them claiming equal excellence in youth and beauty strength and understanding and after paying their respects to haridas and telling him their wishes they were directed to come early on the next morning and to enter upon the first ordealan intellectual conversation  this they did  foolish the man quoth the young mahasani that seeks permanence in this worldfrail as the stem of the plantaintree transient as the ocean foam  all that is high shall presently fall all that is low must finally perish  unwillingly do the manes of the dead taste the tears shed by their kinsmen then wail not but perform the funeral obsequies with diligence  what illomened fellow is this quoth the fair unmadini who was sitting behind her curtain besides he has dared to quote poetry there was little chance of success for that suitor  she is called a good woman and a woman of pure descent quoth the second suitor who serves him to whom her father and mother have given her and it is written in the scriptures that a woman who in the lifetime of her husband becoming a devotee engages in fasting and in austere devotion shortens his days and hereafter falls into the fire for it is said                 a womans bliss is found not in the smile                 of father mother friend nor in herself                 her husband is her only portion here                 her heaven hereafter  the word serve which might mean obey was peculiarly disagreeable to the fair ones ears and she did not admire the check so soon placed upon her devotion or the decided language and manner of the youth she therefore mentally resolved never again to see that person whom she determined to be stupid as an elephant  a mother said gunakar the third candidate protects her son in babyhood and a father when his offspring is growing up but the man of warrior descent defends his brethren at all times such is the custom of the world and such is my state i dwell on the heads of the strong  therefore those assembled together looked with great respect upon the man of valour  devasharma the fourth suitor contented himself with listening to the others who fancied that he was overawed by their cleverness and when it came to his turn he simply remarked silence is better than speech being further pressed he said a wise man will not proclaim his age nor a deception practiced upon himself nor his riches nor the loss of riches nor family faults nor incantations nor conjugal love nor medicinal prescriptions nor religious duties nor gifts nor reproach nor the infidelity of his wife  thus ended the first trial the master of the house dismissed the two former speakers with many polite expressions and some trifling presents then having given betel to them scented their garments with attar and sprinkled rosewater over their heads he accompanied them to the door showing much regret the two latter speakers he begged to come on the next day  gunakar and devasharma did not fail when they entered the assemblyroom and took the seats pointed out to them the father said be ye pleased to explain and make manifest the effects of your mental qualities so shall i judge of them  i have made said gunakar a fourwheeled carriage in which the power resides to carry you in a moment wherever you may purpose to go  i have such power over the angel of death said devasharma that i can at all times raise a corpse and enable my friends to do the same  now tell me by thy brains o warrior king vikram which of these two youths was the fitter husband for the maid  either the raja could not answer the question or perhaps he would not being determined to break the spell which had already kept him walking to and fro for so many hours then the baital who had paused to let his royal carrier commit himself seeing that the attempt had failed proceeded without making any further comment  the beautiful unmadini was brought out but she hung down her head and made no reply yet she took care to move both her eyes in the direction of devasharma whereupon haridas quoting the proverb that pearls string with pearls formally betrothed to him his daughter the soldier suitor twisted the ends of his mustachios into his eyes which were red with wrath and fumbled with his fingers about the hilt of his sword but he was a man of noble birth and presently his anger passed away  mahasani the poet however being a shameless personand when can we be safe from suchforced himself into the assembly and began to rage and to storm and to quote proverbs in a loud tone of voice he remarked that in this world women are a mine of grief a poisonous root the abode of solicitude the destroyers of resolution the occasioners of fascination and the plunderers of all virtuous qualities from the daughter he passed to the father and after saying hard things of him as a mahabrahmanfn155 who took cows and gold and worshipped a monkey he fell with a sweeping censure upon all priests and sons of priests more especially devasharma as the bystanders remonstrated with him he became more violent and when haridas who was a weak man appeared terrified by his voice look and gesture he swore a solemn oath that despite all the betrothals in the world unless unmadini became his wife he would commit suicide and as a demon haunt the house and injure the inmates  gunakar the soldier exhorted this shameless poet to slay himself at once and to go where he pleased but as haridas reproved the warrior for inhumanity mahasani nerved by spite love rage and perversity to an heroic death drew a noose from his bosom rushed out of the house and suspended himself to the nearest tree  and true enough as the midnight gong struck he appeared in the form of a gigantic and malignant rakshasa fiend dreadfully frightened the household of haridas and carried off the lovely unmadini leaving word that she was to he found on the topmost peak of himalaya  the unhappy father hastened to the house where devasharma lived there weeping bitterly and wringing his hands in despair he told the terrible tale and besought his intended soninlaw to be up and doing  the young brahman at once sought his late rival and asked his aid this the soldier granted at once although he had been nettled at being conquered in love by a priestling  the carriage was at once made ready and the suitors set out bidding the father be of good cheer and that before sunset he should embrace his daughter they then entered the vehicle gunakar with cabalistic words caused it to rise high in the air and devasharma put to flight the demon by reciting the sacred versefn156 let us meditate on the supreme splendour or adorable light of that divine ruler the sun who may illuminate our understandings venerable men guided by the intelligence salute the divine sun sarvitri with oblations and praise om  then they returned with the girl to the house and haridas blessed them praising the sun aloud in the joy of his heart lest other accidents might happen he chose an auspicious planetary conjunction and at a fortunate moment rubbed turmeric upon his daughters hands  the wedding was splendid and broke the hearts of twentyfour rivals in due time devasharma asked leave from his fatherinlaw to revisit his home and to carry with him his bride this request being granted he set out accompanied by gunakar the soldier who swore not to leave the couple before seeing them safe under their own rooftree  it so happened that their road lay over the summits of the wild vindhya hills where dangers of all kinds are as thick as shells upon the shore of the deep here were rocks and jagged precipices making the travellers brain whirl when he looked into them there impetuous torrents roared and flashed down their beds of black stone threatening destruction to those who would cross them now the path was lost in the matted thorny underwood and the pitchy shades of the jungle deep and dark as the valley of death then the thundercloud licked the earth with its fiery tongue and its voice shook the crags and filled their hollow caves at times the sun was so hot that wild birds fell dead from the air and at every moment the wayfarers heard the trumpeting of giant elephants the fierce howling of the tiger the grisly laugh of the foul hyaena and the whimpering of the wild dogs as they coursed by on the tracks of their prey  yet sustained by the fivearmed godfn157 the little party passed safely through all these dangers they had almost emerged from the damp glooms of the forest into the open plains which skirt the southern base of the hills when one night the fair unmadini saw a terrible vision  she beheld herself wading through a sluggish pool of muddy water which rippled curdling as she stepped into it and which as she advanced darkened with the slime raised by her feet she was bearing in her arms the semblance of a sick child which struggled convulsively and filled the air with dismal wails these cries seemed to be answered by a multitude of other children some bloated like toads others mere skeletons lying upon the bank or floating upon the thick brown waters of the pond and all seemed to address their cries to her as if she were the cause of their weeping nor could all her efforts quiet or console them for a moment  when the bride awoke she related all the particulars of her illomened vision to her husband and the latter after a short pause informed her and his friend that a terrible calamity was about to befall them he then drew from his travelling wallet a skein of thread this he divided into three parts one for each and told his companions that in case of grievous bodily injury the bit of thread wound round the wounded part would instantly make it whole after which he taught them the mantrafn158 or mystical word by which the lives of men are restored to their bodies even when they have taken their allotted places amongst the stars and which for evident reasons i do not want to repeat it concluded however with the three vyahritis or sacred syllables bhuh bhuvah svar  raja vikram was perhaps a little disappointed by this declaration he made no remark however and the baital thus pursued  as devasharma foretold an accident of a terrible nature did occur on the evening of that day as they emerged upon the plain they were attacked by the kiratas or savage tribes of the mountainfn159 a small black wiry figure armed with a bow and little cane arrows stood in their way signifying by gestures that they must halt and lay down their arms as they continued to advance he began to speak with a shrill chattering like the note of an affrighted bird his restless red eyes glared with rage and he waved his weapon furiously round his head then from the rocks and thickets on both sides of the path poured a shower of shafts upon the three strangers  the unequal combat did not last long gunakar the soldier wielded his strong right arm with fatal effect and struck down some threescore of the foes but new swarms came on like angry hornets buzzing round the destroyer of their nests and when he fell devasharma who had left him for a moment to hide his beautiful wife in the hollow of a tree returned and stood fighting over the body of his friend till he also overpowered by numbers was thrown to the ground then the wild men drawing their knives cut off the heads of their helpless enemies stripped their bodies of all their ornaments and departed leaving the woman unharmed for good luck  when unmadini who had been more dead than alive during the affray found silence succeed to the horrid din of shrieks and shouts she ventured to creep out of her refuge in the hollow tree and what does she behold her husband and his friend are lying upon the ground with their heads at a short distance from their bodies she sat down and wept bitterly  presently remembering the lesson which she had learned that very morning she drew forth from her bosom the bit of thread and proceeded to use it she approached the heads to the bodies and tied some of the magic string round each neck but the shades of evening were fast deepening and in her agitation confusion and terror she made a curious mistake by applying the heads to the wrong trunks after which she again sat down and having recited her prayers she pronounced as her husband had taught her the lifegiving incantation  in a moment the dead men were made alive they opened their eyes shook themselves sat up and handled their limbs as if to feel that all was right but something or other appeared to them all wrong they placed their palms upon their foreheads and looked downwards and started to their feet and began to stare at their hands and legs upon which they scrutinized the very scanty articles of dress which the wild men had left upon them and lastly one began to eye the other with curious puzzled looks  the wife attributing their gestures to the confusion which one might expect to find in the brains of men who have just undergone so great a trial as amputation of the head must be stood before them for a moment or two she then with a cry of gladness flew to the bosom of the individual who was as she supposed her husband he repulsed her telling her that she was mistaken then blushing deeply in spite of her other emotions she threw both her beautiful arms round the neck of the person who must be she naturally concluded the right man to her utter confusion he also shrank back from her embrace  then a horrid thought flashed across her mind she perceived her fatal mistake and her heart almost ceased to beat  this is thy wife cried the brahmans head that had been fastened to the soldiers body  no she is thy wife replied the soldiers head which had been placed upon the brahmans body  then she is my wife rejoined the first compound creature  by no means she is my wife cried the second  what then am i asked devasharmagunakar  what do you think i am answered gunakardevasharma with another question  unmadini shall be mine quoth the head  you lie she shall be mine shouted the body  holy yamafn160 hear the villain exclaimed both of them at the same moment                                                       in short having thus begun they continued to quarrel violently each one declaring that the beautiful unmadini belonged to him and to him only how to settle their dispute brahma the lord of creatures only knows i do not except by cutting off their heads once more and by putting them in their proper places and i am quite sure o raja vikram that thy wits are quite unfit to answer the question to which of these two is the beautiful unmadini wife it is even saidamongst us baitals that when this pair of halfhusbands appeared in the presence of the just king a terrible confusion arose each head declaiming all the sins and peccadilloes which its body had committed and that yama the holy ruler himself hit his forefinger with vexationfn161  here the young prince dharma dhwaj burst out laughing at the ridiculous idea of the wrong heads and the warrior king who like singleminded fathers in general was ever in the idea that his son had a velleity for deriding and otherwise vexing him began a severe course of reproof he reminded the prince of the common saying that merriment without cause degrades a man in the opinion of his fellows and indulged him with a quotation extensively used by grave fathers namely that the loud laugh bespeaks a vacant mind after which he proceeded with much pompousness to pronounce the following opinion  it is said in the shastras  your majesty need hardly display so much erudition doubtless it comes from the lips of jayudeva or some other one of your nine gems of science who know much more about their songs and their stanzas than they do about their scriptures insolently interrupted the baital who never lost an opportunity of carping at those reverend men  it is said in the shastras continued raja vikram sternly after hesitating whether he should or should not administer a corporeal correction to the vampire that mother gangafn162 is the queen amongst rivers and the mountain sumerufn163 is the monarch among mountains and the tree kalpavrikshafn164 is the king of all trees and the head of man is the best and most excellent of limbs and thus according to this reason the wife belonged to him whose noblest position claimed her  the next thing your majesty will do i suppose continued the baital with a sneer is to support the opinions of the digambara who maintains that the soul is exceedingly rarefied confined to one place and of equal dimensions with the body or the fancies of that worthy philosopher jaimani who conceiving soul and mind and matter to be things purely synonymous asserts outwardly and writes in his books that the brain is the organ of the mind which is acted upon by the immortal soul but who inwardly and verily believes that the brain is the mind and consequently that the brain is the soul or spirit or whatever you please to call it in fact that soul is a natural faculty of the body a pretty doctrine indeed for a brahman to hold you might as well agree with me at once that the soul of man resides when at home either in a vein in the breast or in the pit of his stomach or that half of it is in a mans brain and the other or reasoning half is in his heart an organ of his body  what has all this string of words to do with the matter vampire asked raja vikram angrily  only said the demon laughing that in my opinion as opposed to the shastras and to raja vikram that the beautiful unmadini belonged not to the head part but to the body part because the latter has an immortal soul in the pit of its stomach whereas the former is a box of bone more or less thick and contains brains which are of much the same consistence as those of a calf  villain exclaimed the raja does not the soul or conscious life enter the body through the sagittal suture and lodge in the brain thence to contemplate through the same opening the divine perfections  i must however bid you farewell for the moment o warrior king sakadhipativikramadityalfn165 i feel a sudden and ardent desire to change this cramped position for one more natural to me  the warrior monarch had so far committed himself that he could not prevent the vampire from flitting but he lost no more time in following him than a grain of mustard in its fall stays on a cows horn and when he had thrown him over his shoulder the king desired him of his own accord to begin a new tale  o my left eyelid flutters exclaimed the baital in despair my heart throbs my sight is dim surely now beginneth the end it is as vidhata hath written on my foreheadhow can it be otherwisefn166 still listen o mighty raja whilst i recount to you a true story and saraswatifn167 sit on my tongue        the vampires tenth storyfn168  of the marvellous delicacy of three queens  the baital said o king in the gaur country vardhman by name there is a city and one called gunshekhar was the raja of that land his minister was one abhaichand a jain by whose teachings the king also came into the jain faith  the worship of shiva and of vishnu gifts of cows gifts of lands gifts of rice balls gaming and spiritdrinking all these he prohibited in the city no man could get leave to do them and as for bones into the ganges no man was allowed to throw them and in these matters the minister having taken orders from the king caused a proclamation to be made about the city saying whoever these acts shall do the raja having confiscated will punish him and banish him from the city  now one day the diwanfn169 began to say to the raja o great king to the decisions of the faith be pleased to give ear whosoever takes the life of another his life also in the future birth is taken this very sin causes him to be born again and again upon earth and to die and thus he ever continues to be born again and to die hence for one who has found entrance into this world to cultivate religion is right and proper be pleased to behold by love by wrath by pain by desire and by fascination overpowered the gods brahma vishnu and mahadeva shiva in various ways upon the earth are ever becoming incarnate far better than they is the cow who is free from passion enmity drunkenness anger covetousness and inordinate affection who supports mankind and whose progeny in many ways give ease and solace to the creatures of the world these deities and sages munis believe in the cowfn170  for such reason to believe in the gods is not good upon this earth be pleased to believe in the cow it is our duty to protect the life of everyone beginning from the elephant through ants beasts and birds up to man in the world righteousness equal to that there is none those who eating the flesh of other creatures increase their own flesh shall in the fulness of time assuredly obtain the fruition of narak fn17l hence for a man it is proper to attend to the conversation of life they who understand not the pain of other creatures and who continue to slay and to devour them last but few days in the land and return to mundane existence maimed limping oneeyed blind dwarfed hunchbacked and imperfect in such wise just as they consume the bodies of beasts and of birds even so they end by spoiling their own bodies from drinking spirits also the great sin arises hence the consuming of spirits and flesh is not advisable  the minister having in this manner explained to the king the sentiments of his own mind so brought him over to the jain faith that whatever he said so the king did thus in brahmans in jogis in janganis in sevras in sannyasisfn172 and in religious mendicants no man believed and according to this creed the rule was carried on  now one day being in the power of death raja gunshekhar died then his son dharmadhwaj sat upon the carpet throne and began to rule presently he caused the minister abhaichand to be seized had his head shaved all but seven locks of hair ordered his face to be blackened and mounting him on an ass with drums beaten had him led all about the city and drove him from the kingdom from that time he carried on his rule free from all anxiety  it so happened that in the season of spring the king dharmadhwaj taking his queens with him went for a stroll in the garden where there was a large tank with lotuses blooming within it the raja admiring its beauty took off his clothes and went down to bathe  after plucking a flower and coming to the bank he was going to give it into the hands of one of his queens when it slipped from his fingers fell upon her foot and broke it with the blow then the raja being alarmed at once came out of the tank and began to apply remedies to her  hereupon night came on and the moon shone brightly the falling of its rays on the body of the second queen formed blisters and suddenly from a distance the sound of a wooden pestle came out of a householders dwelling when the third queen fainted away with a severe pain in the head  having spoken thus much the baital said o my king of these three which is the most delicate the raja answered she indeed is the most delicate who fainted in consequence of the headache the baital hearing this speech went and hung himself from the very same tree and the raja having gone there and taken him down and fastened him in the bundle and placed him on his shoulder carried him away          the vampires eleventh story           which puzzles raja vikram  there is a queer time coming o raja vikrama queer time coming said the vampire a queer time coming elderly people like you talk abundantly about the good old days that were and about the degeneracy of the days that are i wonder what you would say if you could but look forward a few hundred years  brahmans shall disgrace themselves by becoming soldiers and being killed and serviles shudras shall dishonour themselves by wearing the thread of the twiceborn and by refusing to be slaves in fact society shall be all mouth and mixed castesfn173 the courts of justice shall be disused the great works of peace shall no longer be undertaken wars shall last six weeks and their causes shall be clean forgotten the useful arts and great sciences shall die starved there shall be no gems of science there shall be a hospital for destitute kings those at least who do not lose their heads and no vikrama  a severe shaking stayed for a moment the vampires tongue  he presently resumed briefly building tanks feeding brahmans lying when one ought to lie suicide the burning of widows and the burying of live children shall become utterly unfashionable  the consequence of this singular degeneracy o mighty vikram will be that strangers shall dwell beneath the roof tree in bharat khanda india and impure barbarians shall call the land their own they come from a wonderful country and i am most surprised that they bear it the sky which ought to be gold and blue is there grey a kind of dark white the sun looks deadly pale and the moon as if he were deadfn174 the sea when not dirty green glistens with yellowish foam and as you approach the shore tall ghastly cliffs like the skeletons of giants stand up to receive or ready to repel during the greater part of the suns dakhshanayan southern declination the country is covered with a sort of cold white stuff which dazzles the eyes and at such times the air is obscured with what appears to be a shower of white feathers or flocks of cotton at other seasons there is a pale glare produced by the mist clouds which spread themselves over the lower firmament even the faces of the people are white the men are white when not painted blue the women are whiter and the children are whitest these indeed often have white hair  truly exclaimed dharma dhwaj says the proverb whoso seeth the world telleth many a lie  at present resumed the vampire not heeding the interruption they run about naked in the woods being merely hindu outcastes presently they will change the wonderful white pariahs they will eat all food indifferently domestic fowls onions hogs fed in the street donkeys horses hares and most horrible the flesh of the sacred cow they will imbibe what resembles meat of colocynth mixed with water producing a curious frothy liquid and a fiery stuff which burns the mouth for their milk will be mostly chalk and pulp of brains they will ignore the sweet juices of fruits and sugarcane and as for the pure element they will drink it but only as medicine they will shave their beards instead of their heads and stand upright when they should sit down and squat upon a wooden frame instead of a carpet and appear in red and black like the children of yamafn175 they will never offer sacrifices to the manes of ancestors leaving them after their death to fry in the hottest of places yet will they perpetually quarrel and fight about their faith for their tempers are fierce and they would burst if they could not harm one another even now the children who amuse themselves with making puddings on the shore that is to say heaping up the sand always end their little games with punching which means shutting the hand and striking one anothers heads and it is soon found that the children are the fathers of the men  these wonderful white outcastes will often be ruled by female chiefs and it is likely that the habit of prostrating themselves before a woman who has not the power of cutting off a single head may account for their unusual degeneracy and uncleanness they will consider no occupation so noble as running after a jackal they will dance for themselves holding on to strange women and they will take a pride in playing upon instruments like young music girls  the women of course relying upon the aid of the female chieftains will soon emancipate themselves from the rules of modesty they will eat with their husbands and with other men and yawn and sit carelessly before them showing the backs of their heads they will impudently quote the words by confinement at home even under affectionate and observant guardians women are not secure but those are really safe who are guarded by their own inclinations  as the poet sang                 woman obeys one only word her heart  they will not allow their husbands to have more than one wife and even the single wife will not be his slave when he needs her services busying herself in the collection of wealth in ceremonial purification and feminine duty in the preparation of daily food and in the superintendence of household utensils what said rama of sita his wife if i chanced to be angry she bore my impatience like the patient earth without a murmur in the hour of necessity she cherished me as a mother does her child in the moments of repose she was a lover to me in times of gladness she was to me as a friend and it is said a religious wife assists her husband in his worship with a spirit as devout as his own she gives her whole mind to make him happy she is as faithful to him as a shadow to the body and she esteems him whether poor or rich good or bad handsome or deformed in his absence or his sickness she renounces every gratification at his death she dies with him and he enjoys heaven as the fruit of her virtuous deeds whereas if she be guilty of many wicked actions and he should die first he must suffer much for the demerits of his wife  but these women will talk aloud and scold as the braying ass and make the house a scene of variance like the snake with the ichneumon the owl with the crow for they have no fear of losing their noses or parting with their ears they will o my mother converse with strange men and take their hands they will receive presents from them and worst of all they will show their white faces openly without the least sense of shame they will ride publicly in chariots and mount horses whose points they pride themselves upon knowing and eat and drink in crowded places their husbands looking on the while and perhaps even leading them through the streets and she will be deemed the pinnacle of the pagoda of perfection that most excels in wit and shamelessness and who can turn to water the livers of most men they will dance and sing instead of minding their children and when these grow up they will send them out of the house to shift for themselves and care little if they never see them againfn176 but the greatest sin of all will be this when widowed they will ever be on the lookout for a second husband and instances will be known of women fearlessly marrying three four and five timesfn177 you would think that all this licence satisfies them but no the more they have the more their weak minds covet the men have admitted them to an equality they will aim at an absolute superiority and claim respect and homage they will eternally raise tempests about their rights and if anyone should venture to chastise them as they deserve they would call him a coward and run off to the judge  the men will i say be as wonderful about their women as about all other matters the sage of bharat khanda guards the frail sex strictly knowing its frailty and avoids teaching it to read and write which it will assuredly use for a bad purpose for women are ever subject to the godfn178 with the sugarcane bow and string of bees and arrows tipped with heating blossoms and to him they will ever surrender man dhan tanmind wealth and body when by exceeding cunning all human precautions have been made vain the wise man bows to fate and he forgets or he tries to forget the past whereas this race of white pariahs will purposely lead their women into every kind of temptation and when an accident occurs they will rage at and accuse them killing ten thousand with a word and cause an uproar and talk scandal and be scandalized and go before the magistrate and make all the evil as public as possible one would think they had in every way done their duty to their women  and when all this change shall have come over them they will feel restless and take flight and fall like locusts upon the aryavartta land of india starving in their own country they will find enough to eat here and to carry away also they will be mischievous as the saw with which ornamentmakers trim their shells and cut ascending as well as descending to cultivate their friendship will be like making a gap in the water and their partisans will ever fare worse than their foes they will be selfish as crows which though they eat every kind of flesh will not permit other birds to devour that of the crow  in the beginning they will hire a shop near the mouth of mother ganges and they will sell lead and bullion fine and coarse woollen cloths and all the materials for intoxication then they will begin to send for soldiers beyond the sea and to enlist warriors in zambudwipa india they will from shopkeepers become soldiers they will beat and be beaten they will win and lose but the power of their star and the enchantments of their queen kompani a daina or witch who can draw the blood out of a man and slay him with a look will turn everything to their good presently the noise of their armies shall be as the roaring of the sea the dazzling of their arms shall blind the eyes like lightning their battlefields shall be as the dissolution of the world and the slaughterground shall resemble a garden of plantain trees after a storm at length they shall spread like the march of a host of ants over the land they will swear dehar gangafn179 and they hate nothing so much as being compelled to destroy an army to take and loot a city or to add a rich slip of territory to their rule and yet they will go on killing and capturing and adding region to region till the abode of snow himalaya confines them to the north the sindhunaddi incus to the west and elsewhere the sea even in this too they will demean themselves as lords and masters scarcely allowing poor samudradevtafn180 to rule his own waves  raja vikram was in a silent mood otherwise he would not have allowed such illomened discourse to pass uninterrupted then the baital who in vain had often paused to give the royal carrier a chance of asking him a curious question continued his recital in a dissonant and dissatisfied tone of voice  by my feet and your headfn181 o warrior king it will fare badly in those days for the rajas of hindustan when the redcoated men of shakafn182 shall come amongst them listen to my words  in the vindhya mountain there will be a city named dharmapur whose king will be called mahabul he will be a mighty warrior wellskilled in the dhanurveda art of warfn183 and will always lead his own armies to the field he will duly regard all the omens such as a storm at the beginning of the march an earthquake the implements of war dropping from the hands of the soldiery screaming vultures passing over or walking near the army the clouds and the suns rays waxing red thunder in a clear sky the moon appearing small as a star the dropping of blood from the clouds the falling of lightning bolts darkness filling the four quarters of the heavens a corpse or a pan of water being carried to the right of the army the sight of a female beggar with dishevelled hair dressed in red and preceding the vanguard the starting of the flesh over the left ribs of the commanderinchief and the weeping or turning back of the horses when urged forward  he will encourage his men to single combats and will carefully train them to gymnastics many of the wrestlers and boxers will be so strong that they will often beat all the extremities of the antagonist into his body or break his back or rend him into two pieces he will promise heaven to those who shall die in the front of battle and he will have them taught certain dreadful expressions of abuse to be interchanged with the enemy when commencing the contest honours will be conferred on those who never turn their backs in an engagement who manifest a contempt of death who despise fatigue as well as the most formidable enemies who shall be found invincible in every combat and who display a courage which increases before danger like the glory of the sun advancing to his meridian splendour  but king mahabul will be attacked by the white pariahs who as usual will employ against him gold fire and steel with gold they will win over his best men and persuade them openly to desert when the army is drawn out for battle they will use the terrible fire weaponfn184 large and small tubes which discharge flame and smoke and bullets as big as those hurled by the bow of bharatafn185 and instead of using swords and shields they will fix daggers to the end of their tubes and thrust with them like lances  mahabul distinguished by valour and military skill will march out of his city to meet the white foe in front will be the ensigns bells cowstails and flags the latter painted with the bird garurafn186 the bull of shiva the bauhinia tree the monkeygod hanuman the lion and the tiger the fish an almsdish and seven palmtrees then will come the footmen armed with firetubes swords and shields spears and daggers clubs and bludgeons they will be followed by fighting men on horses and oxen on camels and elephants the musicians the watercarriers and lastly the stores on carriages will bring up the rear  the white outcastes will come forward in a long thin red thread and vomiting fire like the jwalamukhifn187 king mahabul will receive them with his troops formed in a circle another division will be in the shape of a halfmoon a third like a cloud whilst others shall represent a lion a tiger a carriage a lily a giant and a bull but as the elephants will all turn round when they feel the fire and trample upon their own men and as the cavalry defiling in front of the host will openly gallop away mahabul being thus without resource will enter his palanquin and accompanied by his queen and their only daughter will escape at nighttime into the forest  the unfortunate three will be deserted by their small party and live for a time on jungle food fruits and roots they will even be compelled to eat game after some days they will come in sight of a village which mahabul will enter to obtain victuals there the wild bhils famous for long years will come up and surrounding the party will bid the raja throw down his arms thereupon mahabul skilful in aiming twanging and wielding the bow on all sides so as to keep off the bolts of the enemy will discharge his bolts so rapidly that one will drive forward another and none of the barbarians will be able to approach but he will have failed to bring his quiver containing an inexhaustible store of arms some of which pointed with diamonds shall have the faculty of returning again to their case after they have done their duty the conflict will continue three hours and many of the bhils will be slain at length a shaft will cleave the kings skull he will fall dead and one of the wild men will come up and cut off his head  when the queen and the princess shall have seen that mahabul fell dead they will return to the forest weeping and beating their bosoms they will thus escape the bhils and after journeying on for four miles at length they will sit down wearied and revolve many thoughts in their minds  they are very lovely continued the vampire as i see them with the eye of clearseeing what beautiful hair it hangs down like the tail of the cow of tartary or like the thatch of a house it is shining as oil dark as the clouds black as blackness itself what charming faces likest to waterlilies with eyes as the stones in unripe mangos noses resembling the beaks of parrots teeth like pearls set in corals ears like those of the redthroated vulture and mouths like the water of life what excellent forms breasts like boxes containing essences the unopened fruit of plantains or a couple of crabs loins the width of a span like the middle of the viol legs like the trunk of an elephant and feet like the yellow lotus  and a fearful place is that jungle a dense dark mass of thorny shrubs and ropy creepers and tall canes and tangled brake and gigantic gnarled trees which groan wildly in the night winds embrace but a wilder horror urges the unhappy women on they fear the polluting touch of the bhils once more they rise and plunge deeper into its gloomy depths  the day dawns the white pariahs have done their usual work they have cut off the hands of some the feet and heads of others whilst many they have crushed into shapeless masses or scattered in pieces upon the ground the field is strewed with corpses the river runs red so that the dogs and jackals swim in blood the birds of prey sitting on the branches drink mans life from the stream and enjoy the sickening smell of burnt flesh  such will be the scenes acted in the fair land of bharat  perchance two white outcastes father and son who with a party of men are scouring the forest and slaying everything fall upon the path which the women have taken shortly before their attention is attracted by footprints leading towards a place full of tigers leopards bears wolves and wild dogs and they are utterly confounded when after inspection they discover the sex of the wanderers  how is it shall say the father that the footprints of mortals are seen in this part of the forest  the son shall reply sir these are the marks of womens feet a mans foot would not be so small  it is passing strange shall rejoin the elder white pariah but thou speakest truth certainly such a soft and delicate foot cannot belong to anyone but a woman  they have only just left the track shall continue the son and look this is the step of a married woman see how she treads on the inside of her sole because of the bending of her ankles and the younger white outcaste shall point to the queens footprints  come let us search the forest for them shall cry the father what an opportunity of finding wives fortune has thrown in our hands but no thou art in error he shall continue after examining the track pointed out by his son in supposing this to be the sign of a matron look at the other it is much longer the toes have scarcely touched the ground whereas the marks of the heels are deep of a truth this must be the married woman and the elder white outcaste shall point to the footprints of the princess  then shall reply the son who admires the shorter foot let us first seek them and when we find them give to me her who has the short feet and take the other to wife thyself  having made this agreement they shall proceed on their way and presently they shall find the women lying on the earth half dead with fatigue and fear their legs and feet are scratched and torn by brambles their ornaments have fallen off and their garments are in strips the two white outcastes find little difficulty the first surprise over in persuading the unhappy women to follow them home and with great delight conformably to their arrangement each takes up his prize on his horse and rides back to the tents the son takes the queen and the father the princess  in due time two marriages come to pass the father according to agreement espouses the long foot and the son takes to wife the short foot and after the usual interval the elder white outcaste who had married the daughter rejoices at the birth of a boy and the younger white outcaste who had married the mother is gladdened by the sight of a girl  now then by my feet and your head o warrior king vikram answer me one question what relationship will there be between the children of the two white pariahs  vikrams brow waxed black as a charcoalburners when he again heard the most irreverent oath ever proposed to mortal king the question presently attracted his attention and he turned over the baitals words in his head confusing the ties of filiality brotherhood and relationship and connection in general  hem said the warrior king at last perplexed and remembering in his perplexity that he had better hold his tongueahem  i think your majesty spoke  asked the vampire in an inquisitive and insinuating tone of voice  hem ejaculated the monarch  the baital held his peace for a few minutes coughing once or twice impatiently he suspected that the extraordinary nature of this last tale combined with the use of the future tense had given rise to a taciturnity so unexpected in the warrior king he therefore asked if vikram the brave would not like to hear another little anecdote  this time the king did not even say hem having walked at an unusually rapid pace he distinguished at a distance the fire kindled by the devotee and he hurried towards it with an effort which left him no breath wherewith to speak even had he been so inclined  since your majesty is so completely dumbfoundered by it perhaps this acute young prince may be able to answer my question insinuated the baital after a few minutes of anxious suspense  but dharma dhwaj answered not a syllable                   conclusion  at raja vikrams silence the baital was greatly surprised and he praised the royal courage and resolution to the skies still he did not give up the contest at once  allow me great king pursued the demon in a dry tone of voice to wish you joy after so many failures you have at length succeeded in repressing your loquacity i will not stop to enquire whether it was humility and selfrestraint which prevented your answering my last question or whether rajait was mere ignorance and inability of course i suspect the latter but to say the truth your condescension in at last taking a vampires advice flatters me so much that i will not look too narrowly into cause or motive  raja vikram winced but maintained a stubborn silence squeezing his lips lest they should open involuntarily  now however your majesty has mortified we will suppose a somewhat exacting vanity i also will in my turn forego the pleasure which i had anticipated in seeing you a corpse and in entering your royal body for a short time just to know how queer it must feel to be a king and what is more i will now perform my original promise and you shall derive from me a benefit which none but myself can bestow first however allow me to ask you will you let me have a little more air  dharma dhwaj pulled his fathers sleeve but this time raja vikram required no reminder wild horses or the executioners saw beginning at the shoulder would not have drawn a word from him observing his obstinate silence the baital with an ominous smile continued  now give ear o warrior king to what i am about to tell thee and bear in mind the giants saying a man is justified in killing one who has a design to kill him the young merchant mal deo who placed such magnificent presents at your royal feet and shantashil the devotee saint who works his spells incantations and magical rites in a cemetery on the banks of the godaveri river are as thou knowest one personthe terrible jogi whose wrath your father aroused in his folly and whose revenge your blood alone can satisfy with regard to myself the oilmans son the same jogi fearing lest i might interfere with his projects of universal dominion slew me by the power of his penance and has kept me suspended a trap for you head downwards from the sirestree  that jogi it was you now know who sent you to fetch me back to him on your back and when you cast me at his feet he will return thanks to you and praise your valour perseverance and resolution to the skies i warn you to beware he will lead you to the shrine of durga and when he has finished his adoration he will say to you o great king salute my deity with the eightlimbed reverence   here the vampire whispered for a time and in a low tone lest some listening goblin might carry his words if spoken out loud to the ears of the devotee shantashil  at the end of the monologue a rustling sound was heard it proceeded from the baital who was disengaging himself from the dead body in the bundle and the burden became sensibly lighter upon the monarchs back  the departing baital however did not forget to bid farewell to the warrior king and to his son he complimented the former for the last time in his own way upon the royal humility and the prodigious selfmortification which he had displayedqualities he remarked which never failed to ensure the proprietors success in all the worlds  raja vikram stepped out joyfully and soon reached the burning ground there he found the jogi dressed in his usual habit a deerskin thrown over his back and twisted reeds instead of a garment hanging round his loins the hair had fallen from his limbs and his skin was bleached ghastly white by exposure to the elements a fire seemed to proceed from his mouth and the matted locks dropping from his head to the ground were changed by the rays of the sun to the colour of gold or saffron he had the beard of a goat and the ornaments of a king his shoulders were high and his arms long reaching to his knees his nails grew to such a length as to curl round the ends of his fingers and his feet resembled those of a tiger he was drumming upon a skull and incessantly exclaiming ho kali ho durga ho devi  as before strange beings were holding their carnival in the jogis presence monstrous asuras giant goblins stood grimly gazing upon the scene with fixed eyes and motionless features rakshasas and messengers of yama fierce and hideous assumed at pleasure the shapes of foul and ferocious beasts nagas and bhutas partly human and partly bestial disported themselves in throngs about the upper air and were dimly seen in the faint light of the dawn mighty daityas brambadaityas and pretas the size of a mans thumb or dried up like leaves and pisachas of terrible power guarded the place there were enormous goats vivified by the spirits of those who had slain brahmans things with the bodies of men and the faces of horses camels and monkeys hideous worms containing the souls of those priests who had drunk spirituous liquors men with one leg and one ear and mischievous bloodsucking demons who in life had stolen church property there were vultures wretches that had violated the beds of their spiritual fathers restless ghosts that had loved lowcaste women shades for whom funeral rites had not been performed and who could not cross the dread vaitarani streamfn188 and vital souls fresh from the horrors of tamisra or utter darkness and the usipatra vana or the swordleaved forest pale spirits alayas gumas baitals and yakshasfn189 beings of a base and vulgar order glided over the ground amongst corpses and skeletons animated by female fiends dakinis yoginis hakinis and shankinis which were dancing in frightful revelry the air was filled with supernatural sights and sounds cries of owls and jackals cats and crows dogs asses and vultures high above which rose the clashing of the bones with which the jogi sat drumming upon the skull before him and tending a huge cauldron of oil whose smoke was of blue fire but as he raised his long lank arm silverwhite with ashes the demons fled and a momentary silence succeeded to their uproar the tigers ceased to roar and the elephants to scream the bears raised their snouts from their foul banquets and the wolves dropped from their jaws the remnants of human flesh and when they disappeared the hooting of the owl and ghastly ha ha of the curlew and the howling of the jackal died away in the far distance leaving a silence still more oppressive  as raja vikram entered the burningground the hollow sound of solitude alone met his ear sadly wailed the wet autumnal blast the tall gaunt trees groaned aloud and bowed and trembled like slaves bending before their masters huge purple clouds and patches and lines of glaring white mist coursed furiously across the black expanse of firmament discharging threads and chains and lozenges and balls of white and blue purple and pink lightning followed by the deafening crash and roll of thunder the dreadful roaring of the mighty wind and the torrents of plashing rain at times was heard in the distance the dull gurgling of the swollen river interrupted by explosions as slips of earthbank fell headlong into the stream but once more the jogi raised his arm and all was still nature lay breathless as if awaiting the effect of his tremendous spells  the warrior king drew near the terrible man unstrung his bundle from his back untwisted the portion which he held threw open the cloth and exposed to shantashils glittering eyes the corpse which had now recovered its proper formthat of a young child seeing it the devotee was highly pleased and thanked vikram the brave extolling his courage and daring above any monarch that had yet lived after which he repeated certain charms facing towards the south awakened the dead body and placed it in a sitting position he then in its presence sacrificed to his goddess the white onefn190 all that he had ready by his sidebetel leaf and flowers sandal wood and unbroken rice fruits perfumes and the flesh of man untouched by steel lastly he half filled his skull with burning embers blew upon them till they shot forth tongues of crimson light serving as a lamp and motioning the raja and his son to follow him led the way to a little fane of the destroying deity erected in a dark clump of wood outside and close to the burning ground  they passed through the quadrangular outer court of the temple whose piazza was hung with deep shadefn191 in silence they circumambulated the small central shrine and whenever shantashil directed raja vikram entered the sabha or vestibule and struck three times upon the gong which gave forth a loud and warning sound  they then passed over the threshold and looked into the gloomy inner depths there stood smashanakalifn192 the goddess in her most horrid form she was a naked and very black woman with halfsevered head partly cut and partly painted resting on her shoulder and her tongue lolled out from her wide yawning mouthfn193 her eyes were red like those of a drunkard and her eyebrows were of the same colour her thick coarse hair hung like a mantle to her heels she was robed in an elephants hide dried and withered confined at the waist with a belt composed of the hands of the giants whom she had slain in war two dead bodies formed her earrings and her necklace was of bleached skulls her four arms supported a scimitar a noose a trident and a ponderous mace she stood with one leg on the breast of her husband shiva and she rested the other on his thigh before the idol lay the utensils of worship namely dishes for the offerings lamps jugs incense copper cups conches and gongs and all of them smelt of blood  as raja vikram and his son stood gazing upon the hideous spectacle the devotee stooped down to place his skulllamp upon the ground and drew from out his ochrecoloured cloth a sharp sword which he hid behind his back  prosperity to thine and thy sons for ever and ever o mighty vikram exclaimed shantashil after he had muttered a prayer before the image verily thou hast right royally redeemed thy pledge and by the virtue of thy presence all my wishes shall presently be accomplished behold the sun is about to drive his car over the eastern hills and our task now ends do thou reverence before this my deity worshipping the earth through thy nose and so prostrating thyself that thy eight limbs may touch the groundfn194 thus shall thy glory and splendour be great the eight powersfn195 and the nine treasures shall be thine and prosperity shall ever remain under thy rooftree  raja vikram hearing these words recalled suddenly to mind all that the vampire had whispered to him he brought his joined hands open up to his forehead caused his two thumbs to touch his brow several times and replied with the greatest humility  o pious person i am a king ignorant of the way to do such obeisance thou art a spiritual preceptor be pleased to teach me and i will do even as thou desirest  then the jogi being a cunning man fell into his own net as he bent him down to salute the goddess vikram drawing his sword struck him upon the neck so violent a blow that his head rolled from his body upon the ground at the same moment dharma dhwaj seizing his fathers arm pulled him out of the way in time to escape being crushed by the image which fell with the sound of thunder upon the floor of the temple  a small thin voice in the upper air was heard to cry a man is justified in killing one who has the desire to kill him then glad shouts of triumph and victory were heard in all directions they proceeded from the celestial choristers the heavenly dancers the mistresses of the gods and the nymphs of indras paradise who left their beds of gold and precious stones their seats glorious as the meridian sun their canals of crystal water their perfumed groves and their gardens where the wind ever blows in softest breezes to applaud the valour and good fortune of the warrior king  at last the brilliant god indra himself with the thousand eyes rising from the shade of the parigat tree the fragrance of whose flowers fills the heavens appeared in his car drawn by yellow steeds and cleaving the thick vapours which surround the earth whilst his attendants sounded the heavenly drums and rained a shower of blossoms and perfumesbade the vikramajit the brave ask a boon  the raja joined his hands and respectfully replied  o mighty ruler of the lower firmament let this my history become famous throughout the world  it is well rejoined the god as long as the sun and moon endure and the sky looks down upon the ground so long shall this thy adventure be remembered over all the earth meanwhile rule thou mankind  thus saying indra retired to the delicious amrawatifn196 vikram took up the corpses and threw them into the cauldron which shantashil had been tending at once two heroes started into life and vikram said to them when i call you come  with these mysterious words the king followed by his son returned to the palace unmolested as the vampire had predicted everything was prosperous to him and he presently obtained the remarkable titles sakaro or foe of the sakas and sakadhipativikramaditya  and when after a long and happy life spent in bringing the world under the shadow of one umbrella and in ruling it free from care the warrior king vikram entered the gloomy realms of yama from whom for mortals there is no escape he left behind him a name that endured amongst men like the odour of the flower whose memory remains long after its form has mingled with the
