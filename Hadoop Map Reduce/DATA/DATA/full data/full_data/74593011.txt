trippe     preface   it is a strong proof of the diffusive tendency of every thing in this country that america never yet collected a fleet nothing is wanting to this display of power but the will but a fleet requires only one commander and a feeling is fast spreading in the country that we ought to be all commanders unless the spirit of unconstitutional innovation and usurpation that is now so prevalent at washington be controlled we may expect to hear of proposals to send a committee of congress to sea in command of a squadron we sincerely hope that their first experiment may be made on the coast of africa  it has been said of napoleon that he never could be made to understand why his fleets did not obey his orders with the same accuracy as to time and place as his corps darm√©e he made no allowances for the winds and currents and least of all did he comprehend that all important circumstance that the efficiency of a fleet is necessarily confined to the rate of sailing of the dullest of its ships more may be expected from a squadron of ten sail all of which shall be average vessels in this respect than from the same number of vessels of which one half are fast and the remainder dull one brigade can march as fast as another but it is not so with vessels the efficiency of a marine therefore depends rather on its working qualities than on its number of ships  perhaps the best fleet that ever sailed under the english flag was that with which nelson fought the battle of the nile it consisted of twelve or thirteen small seventyfours each of approved qualities and commanded by an officer of known merit in all respects it was efficient and reliable with such men as hallowell hood trowbridge foley ball and others and with such ships the great spirit of nelson was satisfied he knew that whatever seamen could do his comparatively little force could achieve when his enemy was discovered at anchor though night was approaching and his vessels were a good deal scattered he at once determined to put the qualities we have mentioned to the highest proof and to attack this was done without any other order of battle than that which directed each commander to get as close alongside of an enemy as possible the best proof of the high confidence he had in his ships and in their commanders  it is now known that all the early accounts of the manoeuvring at the nile and of nelsons reasoning on the subject of anchoring inside and of doubling on his enemies is pure fiction the life by southey in all that relates to this feature of the day is pure fiction as indeed are other portions of the work of scarcely less importance this fact came to the writer through the late commodore charles valentine morris from sir alexander ball in the early part of the century in that day it would not have done to proclaim it so tenacious is public opinion of its errors but since that time naval officers of rank have written on the subject and stripped the nile trafalgar c of their poetry to give the world plain nautical and probable accounts of both those great achievements the truth as relates to both battles was just as little like the previously published accounts as well could be  nelson knew the great superiority of the english seamen their facility in repairing damages and most of all the high advantage possessed by the fleets of his country in the exercise of the assumed right to impress a practice that put not only the best seamen of his own country but those of the whole world more or less at his mercy his great merit at the nile was in the just appreciation of these advantages and in the extraordinary decision which led him to go into action just at nightfall rather than give his enemy time to prepare to meet the shock  it is now known that the french were taken in a great measure by surprise a large portion of their crews were on shore and did not get off to their ships at all and there was scarce a vessel that did not clear the decks by tumbling the messchests bags c into the inside batteries rendering them in a measure useless when the english doubled on their line  it was this doubling on the french line by anchoring inside and putting two ships upon one that gave nelson so high a reputation as a tactician the merit of this manoeuvre belongs exclusively to one of his captains as the fleet went in without any order keeping as much to windward as the shoals would permit nelson ordered the vanguard hoveto to take a pilot out of a fisherman this enabled foley hood and one or two more to pass that fast ship it was at this critical moment that the thought occurred to foley we think this was the officer to pass the head of the french line keep dead away and anchor inside others followed completely placing their enemies between two fires sir samuel hood anchored his ship the zealous on the inner bow of the most weatherly french ship where he poured his fire into virtually an unresisting enemy notwithstanding the great skill manifested by the english in their mode of attack this was the only twodecked ship in the english fleet that was able to make sail on the following morning  had nelson led in upon an american fleet as he did upon the french at the nile he would have seen reason to repent the boldness of the experiment something like it was attempted on lake champlain though on a greatly diminished scale and the english were virtually defeated before they anchored  the reader who feels an interest in such subjects will probably detect the secret process of the mind by which some of the foregoing facts have insinuated themselves into this fiction     the two admirals     chapter i                      then if he were my brothers     my brother might not claim him nor your father     being none of his refuse him this concludes     my mothers son did get your fathers heir     your fathers heir must have your fathers land           king john   the events we are about to relate occurred near the middle of the last century previously even to that struggle which it is the fashion of america to call the old french war the opening scene of our tale however must be sought in the other hemisphere and on the coast of the mother country in the middle of the eighteenth century the american colonies were models of loyalty the very war to which there has just been allusion causing the great expenditure that induced the ministry to have recourse to the system of taxation which terminated in the revolution the family quarrel had not yet commenced intensely occupied with the conflict which terminated not more gloriously for the british arms than advantageously for the british american possessions the inhabitants of the provinces were perhaps never better disposed to the metropolitan state than at the very period of which we are about to write all their early predilections seemed to be gaining strength instead of becoming weaker and as in nature the calm is known to succeed the tempest the blind attachment of the colony to the parent country was but a precursor of the alienation and violent disunion that were so soon to follow  although the superiority of the english seamen was well established in the conflicts that took place between the years 1740 and that of 1763 the naval warfare of the period by no means possessed the very decided character with which it became stamped a quarter of a century later in our own times the british marine appears to have improved in quality as its enemies deteriorated in the year 1812 however greek met greek when of a verity came the tug of war the great change that came over the other navies of europe was merely a consequence of the revolutions which drove experienced men into exile and which by rendering armies allimportant even to the existence of the different states threw nautical enterprises into the shade and gave an engrossing direction to courage and talent in another quarter while france was struggling first for independence and next for the mastery of the continent a marine was a secondary object for vienna berlin and moscow were as easily entered without as with its aid to these and other similar causes must be referred the explanation of the seeming invincibility of the english arms at sea during the late great conflicts of europe an invincibility that was more apparent than real however as many wellestablished defeats were even then intermingled with her thousand victories  from the time when her numbers could furnish succour of this nature down to the day of separation america had her full share in the exploits of the english marine the gentry of the colonies willingly placed their sons in the royal navy and many a bit of square bunting has been flying at the royal mastheads of kings ships in the nineteenth century as the distinguishing symbols of flagofficers who had to look for their birthplaces among ourselves in the course of a chequered life in which we have been brought in collision with as great a diversity of rank professions and characters as often falls to the lot of any one individual we have been thrown into contact with no less than eight english admirals of american birth while it has never yet been our good fortune to meet with a countryman who has had this rank bestowed on him by his own government on one occasion an englishman who had filled the highest civil office connected with the marine of his nation observed to us that the only man he then knew in the british navy in whom he should feel an entire confidence in entrusting an important command was one of these translated admirals and the thought unavoidably passed through our mind that this favourite commander had done well in adhering to the conventional instead of clinging to his natural allegiance inasmuch as he might have toiled for half a century in the service of his native land and been rewarded with a rank that would merely put him on a level with a colonel in the army how much longer this shortsighted policy and grievous injustice are to continue no man can say but it is safe to believe that it is to last until some legislator of influence learns the simple truth that the fancied reluctance of popular constituencies to do right oftener exists in the apprehensions of their representatives than in realitybut to our tale  england enjoys a widespread reputation for her fogs but little do they know how much a fog may add to natural scenery who never witnessed its magical effects as it has caused a beautiful landscape to coquette with the eye in playful and capricious changes our opening scene is in one of these much derided fogs though let it always be remembered it was a fog of june and not of november on a high headland of the coast of devonshire stood a little stationhouse which had been erected with a view to communicate by signals with the shipping that sometimes lay at anchor in an adjacent roadstead a little inland was a village or hamlet that it suits our purposes to call wychecombe and at no great distance from the hamlet itself surrounded by a small park stood a house of the age of henry vii which was the abode of sir wycherly wychecombe a baronet of the creation of king james i and the possessor of an improveable estate of some three or four thousand a year which had been transmitted to him through a line of ancestors that ascended as far back as the times of the plantagenets neither wychecombe nor the headland nor the anchorage was a place of note for much larger and more favoured hamlets villages and towns lay scattered about that fine portion of england much better roadsteads and bays could generally be used by the coming or the parting vessel and far more important signalstations were to be met with all along that coast nevertheless the roadstead was entered when calms or adverse winds rendered it expedient the hamlet had its conveniences and like most english hamlets its beauties and the hall and park were not without their claims to state and rural magnificence a century since whatever the table of precedency or blackstone may say an english baronet particularly one of the date of 1611 was a much greater personage than he is today and an estate of ¬£4000 a year more especially if not rackrented was of an extent and necessarily of a local consequence equal to one of near or quite three times the same amount in our own day sir wycherly however enjoyed an advantage that was of still greater importance and which was more common in 1745 than at the present moment he had no rival within fifteen miles of him and the nearest potentate was a nobleman of a rank and fortune that put all competition out of the question one who dwelt in courts the favourite of kings leaving the baronet as it might be in undisturbed enjoyment of all the local homage sir wycherly had once been a member of parliament and only once in his youth he had been a foxhunter and a small property in yorkshire had long been in the family as a sort of foothold on such enjoyments but having broken a leg in one of his leaps he had taken refuge against ennui by sitting a single session in the house of commons as the member of a borough that lay adjacent to his huntingbox this session sufficed for his whole life the good baronet having taken the matter so literally as to make it a point to be present at all the sittings a sort of tax on his time which as it came wholly unaccompanied by profit was very likely soon to tire out the patience of an old foxhunter after resigning his seat he retired altogether to wychecombe where he passed the last fifty years extolling england and most especially that part of it in which his own estates lay in abusing the french with occasional inuendoes against spain and holland and in eating and drinking he had never travelled for though englishmen of his station often did visit the continent a century ago they oftener did not it was the courtly and the noble who then chiefly took this means of improving their minds and manners a class to which a baronet by no means necessarily belonged to conclude sir wycherly was now eightyfour hale hearty and a bachelor he had been born the oldest of five brothers the cadets taking refuse as usual in the inns of court the church the army and the navy and precisely in the order named the lawyer had actually risen to be a judge by the style and appellation of baron wychecombe had three illegitimate children by his housekeeper and died leaving to the eldest thereof all his professional earnings after buying commissions for the two younger in the army the divine broke his neck while yet a curate in a foxhunt dying unmarried and so far as is generally known childless this was sir wycherlys favourite brother who he was accustomed to say lost his life in setting an example of fieldsports to his parishioners the soldier was fairly killed in battle before he was twenty and the name of the sailor suddenly disappeared from the list of his majestys lieutenants about half a century before the time when our tale opens by shipwreck between the sailor and the head of the family however there had been no great sympathy in consequence as it was rumoured of a certain beautys preference for the latter though this preference produced no suites inasmuch as the lady died a maid mr gregory wychecombe the lieutenant in question was what is termed a wild boy and it was the general impression when his parents sent him to sea that the ocean would now meet with its match the hopes of the family centred in the judge after the death of the curate and it was a great cause of regret to those who took an interest in its perpetuity and renown that this dignitary did not marry since the premature death of all the other sons had left the hall park and goodly farms without any known legal heir in a word this branch of the family of wychecombe would be extinct when sir wycherly died and the entail become useless not a female inheritor even or a male inheritor through females could be traced and it had become imperative on sir wycherly to make a will lest the property should go off the lord knew where or what was worse it should escheat it is true tom wychecombe the judges eldest son often gave dark hints about a secret and a timely marriage between his parents a fact that would have superseded the necessity for all devises as the property was strictly tied up so far as the lineal descendants of a certain old sir wycherly were concerned but the present sir wycherly had seen his brother in his last illness on which occasion the following conversation had taken place  and now brother thomas said the baronet in a friendly and consoling manner having as one may say prepared your soul for heaven by these prayers and admissions of your sins a word may be prudently said concerning the affairs of this world you know i am childlessthat is to say  i understand you wycherly interrupted the dying man youre a bachelor  thats it thomas and bachelors ought not to have children had our poor brother james escaped that mishap he might have been sitting at your bedside at this moment and he could have told us all about it st james i used to call him and well did he deserve the name  st james the least then it must have been wycherly  its a dreadful thing to have no heir thomas did you ever know a case in your practice in which another estate was left so completely without an heir as this of ours  it does not often happen brother heirs are usually more abundant than estates  so i thought will the king get the title as well as the estate brother if it should escheat as you call it  being the fountain of honour he will be rather indifferent about the baronetcy  i should care less if it went to the next sovereign who is english born wychecombe has always belonged to englishmen  that it has and ever will i trust you have only to select an heir when i am gone and by making a will with proper devises the property will not escheat be careful to use the full terms of perpetuity  every thing was so comfortable brother while you were in health said sir wycherly fidgeting you were my natural heir  heir of entail interrupted the judge  well well heir at all events and that was a prodigious comfort to a man like myself who has a sort of religious scruples about making a will i have heard it whispered that you were actually married to martha in which case tom might drop into our shoes so readily without any more signing and sealing  a filius nullius returned the other too conscientious to lend himself to a deception of that nature  why brother tom often seems to me to favour such an idea himself  no wonder wycherly for the idea would greatly favour him tom and his brothers are all filii nullorum god forgive me for that same wrong  i wonder neither charles nor gregory thought of marrying before they lost their lives for their king and country put in sir wycherly in an upbraiding tone as if he thought his penniless brethren had done him an injury in neglecting to supply him with an heir though he had been so forgetful himself of the same great duty i did think of bringing in a bill for providing heirs for unmarried persons without the trouble and responsibility of making wills  that would have been a great improvement on the law of descentsi hope you wouldnt have overlooked the ancestors  not ieverybody would have got his rights they tell me poor charles never spoke after he was shot but i dare say did we know the truth he regretted sincerely that he never married  there for once wycherly i think you are likely to be wrong a femme sole without food is rather a helpless sort of a person  well well i wish he had married what would it have been to me had he left a dozen widows  it might have raised some awkward questions as to dowry and if each left a son the title and estates would have been worse off than they are at present without widows or legitimate children  any thing would be better than having no heir i believe im the first baronet of wychecombe who has been obliged to make a will  quite likely returned the brother drily i remember to have got nothing from the last one in that way charles and gregory fared no better never mind wycherly you behaved like a father to us all  i dont mind signing cheques in the least but wills have an irreligious appearance in my eyes there are a good many wychecombes in england i wonder some of them are not of our family they tell me a hundredth cousin is just as good an heir as a firstborn son  failing nearer of kin but we have no hundredth cousins of the whole blood  there are the wychecombes of surrey brother thomas  descended from a bastard of the second baronet and out of the line of descent altogether  but the wychecombes of hertfordshire i have always heard were of our family and legitimate  true as regards matrimonyrather too much of it by the way they branched off in 1487 long before the creation and have nothing to do with the entail the first of their line coming from old sir michael wychecombe kt and sheriff of devonshire by his second wife margery while we are derived from the same male ancestor through wycherly the only son by joan the first wife wycherly and michael the son of michael and margery were of the halfblood as respects each other and could not be heirs of blood what was true of the ancestors is true of the descendants  but we came of the same ancestor and the estate is far older than 1487  quite true brother nevertheless the halfblood cant take so says the perfection of human reason  i never could understand these niceties of the law said sir wycherly sighing but i suppose they are all right there are so many wychecombes scattered about england that i should think some one among them all might be my heir  every man of them bears a bar in his arms or is of the halfblood  you are quite sure brother that tom is a filius nullus for the baronet had forgotten most of the little latin he ever knew and translated this legal phrase into no son  filius nullius sir wycherly the son of nobody your reading would literally make tom nobody whereas he is only the son of nobody  but brother he is your son and as like you as two hounds of the same litter  i am nullus in the eye of the law as regards poor tom who until he marries and has children of his own is altogether without legal kindred nor do i know that legitimacy would make tom any better for he is presuming and confident enough for the heir apparent to the throne as it is  well theres this young sailor who has been so much at the station lately since he was left ashore for the cure of his wounds tis a most gallant lad and the first lord has sent him a commission as a reward for his good conduct in cutting out the frenchman i look upon him as a credit to the name and i make no question he is some way or other of our family  does he claim to be so asked the judge a little quickly for he distrusted men in general and thought from all he had heard that some attempt might have been made to practise on his brothers simplicity i thought you told me that he came from the american colonies  so he does hes a native of virginia as was his father before him  a convict perhaps or a servant quite likely who has found the name of his former master more to his liking than his own such things are common they tell me beyond seas  yes if he were anything but an american i might wish he were my heir returned sir wycherly in a melancholy tone but it would be worse than to let the lands escheat as you call it to place an american in possession of wychecombe the manors have always had english owners down to the present moment thank god  should they have any other it will be your own fault wycherly when i am dead and that will happen ere many weeks the human being will not be living who can take that property after your demise in any other manner than by escheat or by devise there will then be neither heir of entail nor heir at law and you may make whom you please master of wychecombe provided he be not an alien  not an american i suppose brother an american is an alien of course  humphwhy not in law whatever he may be according to our english notions harkee brother wycherly ive never asked you or wished you to leave the estate to tom or his younger brothers for one and all are filii nullorumas i term em though my brother record will have it it ought to be filii nullius as well as filius nullius let that be as it may no bastard should lord it at wychecombe and rather than the king should get the lands to bestow on some favourite i would give it to the halfblood  can that be done without making a will brother thomas  it cannot sir wycherly nor with a will so long as an heir of entail can be found  is there no way of making tom a filius somebody so that he can succeed  not under our laws by the civil law such a thing might have been done and by the scotch law but not under the perfection of reason  i wish you knew this young virginian the lad bears both of my names wycherly wychecombe  he is not a filius wycherlyis he baronet  fie upon thee brother thomas do you think i have less candour than thyself that i would not acknowledge my own flesh and blood i never saw the youngster until within the last six months when he was landed from the roadstead and brought to wychecombe to be cured of his wounds nor ever heard of him before when they told me his name was wycherly wychecombe i could do no less than call and see him the poor fellow lay at deaths door for a fortnight and it was while we had little or no hope of saving him that i got the few family anecdotes from him now that would be good evidence in law i believe thomas  for certain things had the lad really died surviving he must be heard on his voire dire and under oath but what was his tale  a very short one he told me his father was a wycherly wychecombe and that his grandfather had been a virginia planter this was all he seemed to know of his ancestry  and probably all there was of them my tom is not the filius nullius that has been among us and this grandfather if he has not actually stolen the name has got it by these doubtful means as for the wycherly it should pass for nothing learning that there is a line of baronets of this name every pretender to the family would be apt to call a son wycherly  the line will shortly be ended brother returned sir wycherly sighing i wish you might be mistaken and after all tom shouldnt prove to be that filius you call him  mr baron wychecombe as much from esprit de corps as from moral principle was a man of strict integrity in all things that related to meum and tuum he was particularly rigid in his notions concerning the transmission of real estate and the rights of primogeniture the world had taken little interest in the private history of a lawyer and his sons having been born before his elevation to the bench he passed with the public for a widower with a family of promising boys not one in a hundred of his acquaintances even suspected the fact and nothing would have been easier for him than to have imposed on his brother by inducing him to make a will under some legal mystification or other and to have caused tom wychecombe to succeed to the property in question by an indisputable title there would have been no great difficulty even in his sons assuming and maintaining his right to the baronetcy inasmuch as there would be no competitor and the crown officers were not particularly rigid in inquiring into the claims of those who assumed a title that brought with it no political privileges still he was far from indulging in any such project to him it appeared that the wychecombe estate ought to go with the principles that usually governed such matters and although he submitted to the dictum of the common law as regarded the provision which excluded the halfblood from inheriting with the deference of an english commonlaw lawyer he saw and felt that failing the direct line wychecombe ought to revert to the descendants of sir michael by his second son for the plain reason that they were just as much derived from the person who had acquired the estate as his brother wycherly and himself had there been descendants of females even to interfere no such opinion would have existed but as between an escheat or a devise in favour of a filius nillius or of the descendant of a filius nullius the halfblood possessed every possible advantage in his legal eyes legitimacy was everything although he had not hesitated to be the means of bringing into the world seven illegitimate children that being the precise number martha had the credit of having borne him though three only survived after reflecting a moment therefore he turned to the baronet and addressed him more seriously than he had yet done in the present dialogue first taking a draught of cordial to give him strength for the occasion  listen to me brother wycherly said the judge with a gravity that at once caught the attention of the other you know something of the family history and i need do no more than allude to it our ancestors were the knightly possessors of wychecombe centuries before king james established the rank of baronet when our greatgrandfather sir wycherly accepted the patent of 1611 he scarcely did himself honour for by aspiring higher he might have got a peerage however a baronet he became and for the first time since wychecombe was wychecombe the estate was entailed to do credit to the new rank now the first sir wycherly had three sons and no daughter each of these sons succeeded the two eldest as bachelors and the youngest was our grandfather sir thomas the fourth baronet left an only child wycherly our father sir wycherly our father had five sons wycherly his successor yourself and the sixth baronet myself james charles and gregory james broke his neck at your side the two last lost their lives in the kings service unmarried and neither you nor i have entered into the holy state of matrimony i cannot survive a month and the hopes of perpetuating the direct line of the family rests with yourself this accounts for all the descendants of sir wycherly the first baronet and it also settles the question of heirs of entail of whom there are none after myself to go back beyond the time of king james i twice did the elder lines of the wychecombes fail between the reign of king richard ii and king henry vii when sir michael succeeded now in each of these cases the law disposed of the succession the youngest branches of the family in both instances getting the estate it follows that agreeably to legal decisions had at the time when the facts must have been known that the wychecombes were reduced to these younger lines sir michael had two wives from the first we are derivedfrom the last the wychecombes of hertfordshiresince known as baronets of that county by the style and title of sir reginald wychecombe of wychecomberegis herts  the present sir reginald can have no claim being of the halfblood put in sir wycherly with a brevity of manner that denoted feeling the halfblood is as bad as a nullius as you call tom  not quite a person of the halfblood may be as legitimate as the kings majesty whereas a nullius is of no blood now suppose for a moment sir wycherly that you had been a son by a first wife and i had been a son by a secondwould there have been no relationship between us  what a question tom to put to your own brother  but i should not be your own brother my good sir only your half brother of the half and not of the whole blood  what of thatwhat of thatyour father would have been my fatherwe would have had the same namethe same family historythe same family feelingspoh pohwe should have been both wychecombes exactly as we are today  quite true and yet i could not have been your heir nor you mine the estate would escheat to the king hanoverian or scotchman before it came to me indeed to me it could never come  thomas you are trifling with my ignorance and making matters worse than they really are certainly as long as you lived you would be my heir  very true as to the ¬£20000 in the funds but not as to the baronetcy and wychecombe so far as the two last are concerned i am heir of blood and of entail of the body of sir wycherly wychecombe the first baronet and the maker of the entail  had there been no entail and had i died a child who would have succeeded our father supposing there had been two mothers  i as the next surviving son  therei knew it must be so exclaimed sir wycherly in triumph and all this time you have been joking with me  not so fast brother of minenot so fast i should be of the whole blood as respected our father and all the wychecombes that have gone before him but of the halfblood as respected you from our father i might have taken as his heiratlaw but from you never having been of the halfblood  i would have made a will in that case thomas and left you every farthing said sir wycherly with feeling  that is just what i wish you to do with sir reginald wychecombe you must take him a filius nullius in the person of my son tom a stranger or let the property escheat for we are so peculiarly placed as not to have a known relative by either the male or female lines the maternal ancestors being just as barren of heirs as the paternal our good mother was the natural daughter of the third earl of prolific our grandmother was the last of her race so far as human ken can discover our greatgrandmother is said to have had semiroyal blood in her veins without the aid of the church and beyond that it would be hopeless to attempt tracing consanguinity on that side of the house no wycherly it is sir reginald who has the best right to the land tom or one of his brothers an utter stranger or his majesty follow remember that estates of ¬£4000 a year dont often escheat nowadays  if youll draw up a will brother ill leave it all to tom cried the baronet with sudden energy nothing need be said about the nullius and when im gone hell step quietly into my place  nature triumphed a moment in the bosom of the father but habit and the stern sense of right soon overcame the feeling perhaps certain doubts and a knowledge of his sons real character contributed their share towards the reply  it ought not to be sir wycherly returned the judge musing tom has no right to wychecombe and sir reginald has the best moral right possible though the law cuts him off had sir michael made the entail instead of our greatgrandfather he would have come in as a matter of course  i never liked sir reginald wychecombe said the baronet stubbornly  what of thathe will not trouble you while living and when dead it will be all the same comecomei will draw the will myself leaving blanks for the name and when it is once done you will sign it cheerfully it is the last legal act i shall ever perform and it will be a suitable one death being constantly before me  this ended the dialogue the will was drawn according to promise sir wycherly took it to his room to read carefully inserted the name of tom wychecombe in all the blank spaces brought it back duly executed the instrument in his brothers presence and then gave the paper to his nephew to preserve with a strong injunction on him to keep the secret until the instrument should have force by his own death mr baron wychecombe died in six weeks and the baronet returned to his residence a sincere mourner for the loss of an only brother a more unfortunate selection of an heir could not have been made as tom wychecombe was in reality the son of a barrister in the temple the fancied likeness to the reputed father existing only in the imagination of his credulous uncle     chapter ii                              how fearful     and dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low     the crows and choughs that wing the midway air     show scarce so gross as beetles halfway down     hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade           king lear   this digression on the family of wychecombe has led us far from the signalstation the headland and the fog with which the tale opened the little dwelling connected with the station stood at a short distance from the staff sheltered by the formation of the ground from the bleak winds of the channel and fairly embowered in shrubs and flowers it was a humble cottage that had been ornamented with more taste than was usual in england at that day its whitened walls thatched roof picketed garden and trellised porch bespoke care and a mental improvement in the inmates that were scarcely to be expected in persons so humbly employed as the keeper of the signalstaff and his family all near the house too was in the same excellent condition for while the headland itself lay in common this portion of it was enclosed in two or three pretty little fields that were grazed by a single horse and a couple of cows there were no hedges however the thorn not growing willingly in a situation so exposed but the fields were divided by fences neatly enough made of wood that declared its own origin having in fact been part of the timbers and planks of a wreck as the whole was whitewashed it had a rustic and in a climate where the sun is seldom oppressive by no means a disagreeable appearance  the scene with which we desire to commence the tale opens about seven oclock on a july morning on a bench at the foot of the signalstaff was seated one of a frame that was naturally large and robust but which was sensibly beginning to give way either by age or disease a glance at the red bloated face would suffice to tell a medical man that the habits had more to do with the growing failure of the system than any natural derangement of the physical organs the face too was singularly manly and had once been handsome even nay it was not altogether without claims to be so considered still though intemperance was making sad inroads on its comeliness this person was about fifty years old and his air as well as his attire denoted a mariner not a common seaman nor yet altogether an officer but one of those of a middle station who in navies used to form a class by themselves being of a rank that entitled them to the honours of the quarterdeck though out of the regular line of promotion in a word he wore the unpretending uniform of a master a century ago the dress of the english naval officer was exceedingly simple though more appropriate to the profession perhaps than the more showy attire that has since been introduced epaulettes were not used by any and the anchor button with the tint that is called navy blue and which is meant to represent the deep hue of the ocean with white facings composed the principal peculiarities of the dress the person introduced to the reader whose name was dutton and who was simply the officer in charge of the signalstation had a certain neatness about his wellworn uniform his linen and all of his attire which showed that some person more interested in such matters than one of his habits was likely to be had the care of his wardrobe in this respect indeed his appearance was unexceptionable and there was an air about the whole man which showed that nature if not education had intended him for something far better than the being he actually was  dutton was waiting at that early hour to ascertain as the veil of mist was raised from the face of the sea whether a sail might be in sight that required of him the execution of any of his simple functions that some one was near by on the headland too was quite evident by the occasional interchange of speech though no person but himself was visible the direction of the sounds would seem to indicate that a man was actually over the brow of the cliff perhaps a hundred feet removed from the seat occupied by the master  recollect the sailors maxim mr wychecombe called out dutton in a warning voice one hand for the king and the other for self those cliffs are ticklish places and really it does seem a little unnatural that a seafaring person like yourself should have so great a passion for flowers as to risk his neck in order to make a posy  never fear for me mr dutton answered a full manly voice that one could have sworn issued from the chest of youth never fear for me we sailors are used to hanging in the air  ay with good threestranded ropes to hold on by young gentleman now his majestys government has just made you an officer there is a sort of obligation to take care of your life in order that it may be used and at need given away in his service  quite truequite true mr duttonso true i wonder you think it necessary to remind me of it i am very grateful to his majestys government and  while speaking the voice seemed to descend getting at each instant less and less distinct until in the end it became quite inaudible dutton looked uneasy for at that instant a noise was heard and then it was quite clear some heavy object was falling down the face of the cliff now it was that the mariner felt the want of good nerves and experienced the sense of humiliation which accompanied the consciousness of having destroyed them by his excesses he trembled in every limb and for the moment was actually unable to rise a light step at his side however drew a glance in that direction and his eye fell on the form of a lovely girl of nineteen his own daughter mildred  i heard you calling to some one father said the latter looking wistfully but distrustfully at her parent as if wondering at his yielding to his infirmity so early in the day can i be of service to you  poor wychecombe exclaimed dutton he went over the cliff in search of a nosegay to offer to yourself andandi feargreatly fear  what father demanded mildred in a voice of horror the rich color disappearing from a face which it left of the hue of death nononohe cannot have fallen  dutton bent his head down drew a long breath and then seemed to gain more command of his nerves he was about to rise when the sound of a horses feet was heard and then sir wycherly wychecombe mounted on a quiet pony rode slowly up to the signalstaff it was a common thing for the baronet to appear on the cliffs early in the morning but it was not usual for him to come unattended the instant her eyes fell on the fine form of the venerable old man mildred who seemed to know him well and to use the familiarity of one confident of being a favourite exclaimed  oh sir wycherly how fortunatewhere is richard  good morrow my pretty milly answered the baronet cheerfully fortunate or not here i am and not a bit flattered that your first question should be after the groom instead of his master i have sent dick on a message to the vicars now my poor brother the judge is dead and gone i find mr rotherham more and more necessary to me  oh dear sir wycherlymr wychecombelieutenant wychecombe i meanthe young officer from virginiahe who was so desperately woundedin whose recovery we all took so deep an interest  wellwhat of him childyou surely do not mean to put him on a level with mr rotherham in the way of religious consolationand as for anything else there is no consanguinity between the wychecombes of virginia and my family he may be a filius nullius of the wychecombes of wychecomberegis herts but has no connection with those of wychecombehall devonshire  theretherethe cliffthe cliff added mildred unable for the moment to be more explicit  as the girl pointed towards the precipice and looked the very image of horror the goodhearted old baronet began to get some glimpses of the truth and by means of a few words with dutton soon knew quite as much as his two companions descending from his pony with surprising activity for one of his years sir wycherly was soon on his feet and a sort of confused consultation between the three succeeded neither liked to approach the cliff which was nearly perpendicular at the extremity of the headland and was always a trial to the nerves of those who shrunk from standing on the verge of precipices they stood like persons paralyzed until dutton ashamed of his weakness and recalling the thousand lessons in coolness and courage he had received in his own manly profession made a movement towards advancing to the edge of the cliff in order to ascertain the real state of the case the blood returned to the cheeks of mildred too and she again found a portion of her natural spirit raising her courage  stop father she said hastily you are infirm and are in a tremour at this moment my head is steadierlet me go to the verge of the hill and learn what has happened  this was uttered with a forced calmness that deceived her auditors both of whom the one from age and the other from shattered nerves were certainly in no condition to assume the same office it required the allseeing eye which alone can scan the heart to read all the agonized suspense with which that young and beautiful creature approached the spot where she might command a view of the whole of the side of the fearful declivity from its giddy summit to the base where it was washed by the sea the latter indeed could not literally be seen from above the waves having so far undermined the cliff as to leave a projection that concealed the point where the rocks and the water came absolutely in contact the upper portion of the weatherworn rocks falling a little inwards so as to leave a ragged surface that was sufficiently broken to contain patches of earth and verdure sprinkled with the flowers peculiar to such an exposure the fog also intercepted the sight giving to the descent the appearance of a fathomless abyss had the life of the most indifferent person been in jeopardy under the circumstances named mildred would have been filled with deep awe but a gush of tender sensations which had hitherto been pent up in the sacred privacy of her virgin affections struggled with natural horror as she trod lightly on the very verge of the declivity and cast a timid but eager glance beneath then she recoiled a step raised her hands in alarm and hid her face as if to shut out some frightful spectacle  by this time duttons practical knowledge and recollection had returned as is common with seamen whose minds contain vivid pictures of the intricate tracery of their vessels rigging in the darkest nights his thoughts had flashed athwart all the probable circumstances and presented a just image of the facts  the boy could not be seen had he absolutely fallen and were there no fog for the cliff tumbles home sir wycherly he said eagerly unconsciously using a familiar nautical phrase to express his meaning he must be clinging to the side of the precipice and that too above the swell of the rocks  stimulated by a common feeling the two men now advanced hastily to the brow of the hill and there indeed as with mildred herself a single look sufficed to tell them the whole truth young wychecombe in leaning forward to pluck a flower had pressed so hard upon the bit of rock on which a foot rested as to cause it to break thereby losing his balance a presence of mind that amounted almost to inspiration and a high resolution alone saved him from being dashed to pieces perceiving the rock to give way he threw himself forward and alighted on a narrow shelf a few feet beneath the place where he had just stood and at least ten feet removed from it laterally the shelf on which he alighted was ragged and but two or three feet wide it would have afforded only a check to his fall had there not fortunately been some shrubs among the rocks above it by these shrubs the young man caught actually swinging off in the air under the impetus of his leap happily the shrubs were too well rooted to give way and swinging himself round with the address of a sailor the youthful lieutenant was immediately on his feet in comparative safety the silence that succeeded was the consequence of the shock he felt in finding him so suddenly thrown into this perilous situation the summit of the cliff was now about six fathoms above his head and the shelf on which he stood impended over a portion of the cliff that was absolutely perpendicular and which might be said to be out of the line of those projections along which he had so lately been idly gathering flowers it was physically impossible for any human being to extricate himself from such a situation without assistance this wychecombe understood at a glance and he had passed the few minutes that intervened between his fall and the appearance of the party above him in devising the means necessary to his liberation as it was few men unaccustomed to the giddy elevations of the mast could have mustered a sufficient command of nerve to maintain a position on the ledge where he stood even he could not have continued there without steadying his form by the aid of the bushes  as soon as the baronet and dutton got a glimpse of the perilous position of young wychecombe each recoiled in horror from the sight as if fearful of being precipitated on top of him both then actually lay down on the grass and approached the edge of the cliff again in that humble attitude even trembling as they lay at length with their chins projecting over the rocks staring downwards at the victim the young man could see nothing of all this for as he stood with his back against the cliff he had not room to turn with safety or even to look upwards mildred however seemed to lose all sense of self and of danger in view of the extremity in which the youth beneath was placed she stood on the very verge of the precipice and looked down with steadiness and impunity that would have been utterly impossible for her to attain under less exciting circumstances even allowing the young man to catch a glimpse of her rich locks as they hung about her beautiful face  for gods sake mildred called out the youth keep further from the cliffi see you and we can now hear each other without so much risk  what can we do to rescue you wychecombe eagerly asked the girl tell me i entreat you for sir wycherly and my father are both unnerved  blessed creature and you are mindful of my danger but be not uneasy mildred do as i tell you and all will yet be well i hope you hear and understand what i say dearest girl  perfectly returned mildred nearly choked by the effort to be calm i hear every syllablespeak on  go you then to the signalhalyardslet one end fly loose and pull upon the other until the whole line has come downwhen that is done return here and i will tell you morebut for heavens sake keep farther from the cliff  the thought that the rope small and frail as it seemed might be of use flashed on the brain of the girl and in a moment she was at the staff time and again when liquor incapacitated her father to perform his duty had mildred benton and hoisted the signals for him and thus happily she was expert in the use of the halyards in a minute she had unrove them and the long line lay in a little pile at her feet  tis done wycherly she said again looking over the cliff shall i throw you down one end of the ropebut alas i have not strength to raise you and sir wycherly and father seem unable to assist me  do not hurry yourself mildred and all will be well go and put one end of the line around the signalstaff then put the two ends together tie them in a knot and drop them down over my head be careful not to come too near the cliff for  the last injunction was useless mildred having flown to execute her commission her quick mind readily comprehended what was expected of her and her nimble fingers soon performed their task tying a knot in the ends of the line she did as desired and the small rope was soon dangling within reach of wychecombes arm it is not easy to make a landsman understand the confidence which a sailor feels in a rope place but a frail and rotten piece of twisted hemp in his hand and he will risk his person in situations from which he would otherwise recoil in dread accustomed to hang suspended in the air with ropes only for his foothold or with ropes to grasp with his hand his eye gets an intuitive knowledge of what will sustain him and he unhesitatingly trusts his person to a few seemingly slight strands that to one unpractised appear wholly unworthy of his confidence signalhalyards are ropes smaller than the little finger of a man of any size but they are usually made with care and every ropeyarn tells wychecombe too was aware that these particular halyards were new for he had assisted in reeving them himself only the week before it was owing to this circumstance that they were long enough to reach him a large allowance for wear and tear having been made in cutting them from the coil as it was the ends dropped some twenty feet below the ledge on which he stood  all safe now mildred cried the young man in a voice of exultation the moment his hand caught the two ends of the line which he immediately passed around his body beneath the arms as a precaution against accidents all safe now dearest girl have no further concern about me  mildred drew back for worlds could not have tempted her to witness the desperate effort that she knew must follow by this time sir wycherly who had been an interested witness of all that passed found his voice and assumed the office of director  stop my young namesake he eagerly cried when he found that the sailor was about to make an effort to drag his own body up the cliff stop that will never do let dutton and me do that much for you at least we have seen all that has passed and are now able to do something  nono sir wycherlyon no account touch the halyards by hauling them over the top of the rocks you will probably cut them or part them and then im lost without hope  oh sir wycherly said mildred earnestly clasping her hands together as if to enforce the request with prayer do notdo not touch the line  we had better let the lad manage the matter in his own way put in dutton he is active resolute and a seaman and will do better for himself than i fear we can do for him he has got a turn round his body and is tolerably safe against any slip or mishap  as the words were uttered the whole three drew back a short distance and watched the result in intense anxiety dutton however so far recollected himself as to take an end of the old halyards which were kept in a chest at the foot of the staff and to make an attempt to stopper together the two parts of the little rope on which the youth depended for should one of the parts of it break without this precaution there was nothing to prevent the halyards from running round the staff and destroying the hold the size of the halyards rendered this expedient very difficult of attainment but enough was done to give the arrangement a little more of the air of security all this time young wychecombe was making his own preparations on the ledge and quite out of view but the tension on the halyards soon announced that his weight was now pendent from them mildreds heart seemed ready to leap from her mouth as she noted each jerk on the lines and her father watched every new pull as if he expected the next moment would produce the final catastrophe it required a prodigious effort in the young man to raise his own weight for such a distance by lines so small had the rope been of any size the achievement would have been trifling for one of the frame and habits of the sailor more especially as he could slightly avail himself of his feet by pressing them against the rocks but as it was he felt as if he were dragging the mountain up after him at length his head appeared a few inches above the rocks but with his feet pressed against the cliff and his body inclining outward at an angle of fortyfive degrees  help himhelp him father exclaimed mildred covering her face with her hands to exclude the sight of wychecombes desperate struggles if he fall now he will be destroyed oh save him save him sir wycherly  but neither of those to whom she appealed could be of any use the nervous trembling again came over the father and as for the baronet age and inexperience rendered him helpless  have you no rope mr dutton to throw over my shoulders cried wychecombe suspending his exertions in pure exhaustion still keeping all he had gained with his head projecting outward over the abyss beneath and his face turned towards heaven throw a rope over my shoulders and drag my body in to the cliff  dutton showed an eager desire to comply but his nerves had not yet been excited by the usual potations and his hands shook in a way to render it questionable whether he could perform even this simple service but for his daughter indeed he would hardly have set about it intelligently mildred accustomed to using the signalhalyards procured the old line and handed it to her father who discovered some of his professional knowledge in his manner of using it doubling the halyards twice he threw the bight over wychecombes shoulders and aided by mildred endeavoured to draw the body of the young man upwards and towards the cliff but their united strength was unequal to the task and wearied with holding on and indeed unable to support his own weight any longer by so small a rope wychecombe felt compelled to suffer his feet to drop beneath him and slid down again upon the ledge here even his vigorous frame shook with its prodigious exertions and he was compelled to seat himself on the shelf and rest with his back against the cliff to recover his selfcommand and strength mildred uttered a faint shriek as he disappeared but was too much horrorstricken to approach the verge of the precipice to ascertain his fate  be composed milly said her father he is safe as you may see by the halyards and to say the truth the stuff holds on well so long as the line proves true the boy cant fall he has taken a double turn with the end of it round his body make your mind easy girl for i feel better now and see my way clear dont be uneasy sir wycherly well have the lad safe on terra firma again in ten minutes i scarce know what has come over me this morning but ive not had the command of my limbs as in common it cannot be fright for ive seen too many men in danger to be disabled by that and i think milly it must be the rheumatism of which ive so often spoken and which ive inherited from my poor mother dear old soul do you know sir wycherly that rheumatism can be inherited like gout  i dare say it mayi dare say it may duttonbut never mind the disease now get my young namesake back here on the grass and i will hear all about it i would give the world that i had not sent dick to mr rotherhams this morning cant we contrive to make the pony pull the boy up  the traces are hardly strong enough for such work sir wycherly have a little patience and i will manage the whole thing shipshape and brister fashion as we say at sea halloo there master wychecombeanswer my hail and i will soon get you into deep water  im safe on the ledge returned the voice of wychecombe from below i wish you would look to the signalhalyards and see they do not chafe against the rocks mr dutton  all right sir all right slack up if you please and let me have all the line you can without casting off from your body keep fast the end for fear of accidents  in an instant the halyards slackened and dutton who by this time had gained his selfcommand though still weak and unnerved by the habits of the last fifteen years forced the bight along the edge of the cliff until he had brought it over a projection of the rocks where it fastened itself this arrangement caused the line to lead down to the part of the cliffs from which the young man had fallen and where it was by no means difficult for a steady head and active limbs to move about and pluck flowers it consequently remained for wychecombe merely to regain a footing on that part of the hillside to ascend to the summit without difficulty it is true he was now below the point from which he had fallen but by swinging himself off laterally or even by springing aided by the line it was not a difficult achievement to reach it and he no sooner understood the nature of the change that had been made than he set about attempting it the confident manner of dutton encouraged both the baronet and mildred and they drew to the cliff again standing near the verge though on the part where the rocks might be descended with less apprehension of consequences  as soon as wychecombe had made all his preparations he stood on the end of the ledge tightened the line looked carefully for a foothold on the other side of the chasm and made his leap as a matter of course the body of the young man swung readily across the space until the line became perpendicular and then he found a surface so broken as to render his ascent by no means difficult aided as he was by the halyards scrambling upwards he soon rejected the aid of the line and sprang upon the headland at the same instant mildred fell senseless on the grass     chapter iii      i want a heroan uncommon want        when every year and month send forth a new one     till after cloying the gazelles with cant        the age discovers he is not the true one           byron   in consequence of the unsteadiness of the fathers nerves the duty of raising mildred in his arms and of carrying her to the cottage devolved on the young man this he did with a readiness and concern which proved how deep an interest he took in her situation and with a power of arm which showed that his strength was increased rather than lessened by the condition into which she had fallen so rapid was his movement that no one saw the kiss he impressed on the palid cheek of the sweet girl or the tender pressure with which he grasped the lifeless form by the time he reached the door the motion and air had begun to revive her and wychecombe committed her to the care of her alarmed mother with a few hurried words of explanation he did not leave the house however for a quarter of an hour except to call out to dutton that mildred was reviving and that he need be under no uneasiness on her account why he remained so long we leave the reader to imagine for the girl had been immediately taken to her own little chamber and he saw her no more for several hours  when our young sailor came out upon the headland again he found the party near the flagstaff increased to four dick the groom had returned from his errand and tom wychecombe the intended heir of the baronet was also there in mourning for his reputed father the judge this young man had become a frequent visiter to the station of late affecting to imbibe his uncles taste for sea air and a view of the ocean there had been several meetings between himself and his namesake and each interview was becoming less amicable than the preceding for a reason that was sufficiently known to the parties when they met on the present occasion therefore the bows they exchanged were haughty and distant and the glances cast at each other might have been termed hostile were it not that a sinister irony was blended with that of tom wychecombe still the feelings that were uppermost did not prevent the latter from speaking in an apparently friendly manner  they tell me mr wychecombe observed the judges heir for this tom wychecombe might legally claim to be they tell me mr wychecombe that you have been taking a lesson in your trade this morning by swinging over the cliffs at the end of a rope now that is an exploit more to the taste of an american than to that of an englishman i should think but i dare say one is compelled to do many things in the colonies that we never dream of at home  this was said with seeming indifference though with great art sir wycherlys principal weakness was an overweening and an ignorant admiration of his own country and all it contained he was also strongly addicted to that feeling of contempt for the dependencies of the empire which seems to be inseparable from the political connection between the people of the metropolitan country and their colonies there must be entire equality for perfect respect in any situation in life and as a rule men always appropriate to their own shares any admitted superiority that may happen to exist on the part of the communities to which they belong it is on this principle that the tenant of a cockloft in paris or london is so apt to feel a high claim to superiority over the occupant of a comfortable abode in a village as between england and her north american colonies in particular this feeling was stronger than is the case usually on account of the early democratical tendencies of the latter not that these tendencies had already become the subject of political jealousies but that they left social impressions which were singularly adapted to bringing the colonists into contempt among a people predominant for their own factitious habits and who are so strongly inclined to view everything even to principles through the medium of arbitrary conventional customs it must be confessed that the americans in the middle of the eighteenth century were an exceedingly provincial and in many particulars a narrowminded people as well in their opinions as in their habits nor is the reproach altogether removed at the present day but the country from which they are derived had not then made the vast strides in civilization for which it has latterly become so distinguished the indifference too with which all europe regarded the whole american continent and to which england herself though she possessed so large a stake on this side of the atlantic formed no material exception constantly led that quarter of the world into profound mistakes in all its reasoning that was connected with this quarter of the world and aided in producing the state of feeling to which we have alluded sir wycherly felt and reasoned on the subject of america much as the great bulk of his countrymen felt and reasoned in 1745 the exceptions existing only among the enlightened and those whose particular duties rendered more correct knowledge necessary and not always among them it is said that the english minister conceived the idea of taxing america from the circumstance of seeing a wealthy virginian lose a large sum at play a sort of argumentum ad hominem that brought with it a very dangerous conclusion to apply to the sort of people with whom he had to deal let this be as it might there is no more question that at the period of our tale the profoundest ignorance concerning america existed generally in the mother country than there is that the profoundest respect existed in america for nearly every thing english truth compels us to add that in despite of all that has passed the cisatlantic portion of the weakness has longest endured the assaults of time and of an increased intercourse  young wycherly as is ever the case was keenly alive to any insinuations that might be supposed to reflect on the portion of the empire of which he was a native he considered himself an englishman it is true was thoroughly loyal and was every way disposed to sustain the honour and interests of the seat of authority but when questions were raised between europe and america he was an american as in america itself he regarded himself as purely a virginian in contradistinction to all the other colonies he understood the intended sarcasm of tom wychecombe but smothered his resentment out of respect to the baronet and perhaps a little influenced by the feelings in which he had been so lately indulging  those gentlemen who are disposed to fancy such things of the colonies would do well to visit that part of the world he answered calmly before they express their opinions too loudly lest they should say something that future observation might make them wish to recall  true my young friendquite true put in the baronet with the kindest possible intentions true as gospel we never know any thing of matters about which we know nothing that we old men must admit master dutton and i should think tom must see its force it would be unreasonable to expect to find every thing as comfortable in america as we have it here in england nor do i suppose the americans in general would be as likely to get over a cliff as an englishman however there are exceptions to all general rules as my poor brother james used to say when he saw occasion to find fault with the sermon of a prelate i believe you did not know my poor brother dutton he must have been killed about the time you were bornst james i used to call him although my brother thomas the judge that was toms father theresaid he was st james the less  i believe the rev mr wychecombe was dead before i was of an age to remember his virtues sir wycherly said dutton respectfully though i have often heard my own father speak of all your honoured family  yes your father dutton was the attorney of the next town and we all knew him well you have done quite right to come back among us to spend the close of your own days a man is never as well off as when he is thriving in his native soil more especially when that soil is old england and devonshire you are not one of us young gentleman though your name happens to be wychecombe but then we are none of us accountable for our own births or birthplaces  this truism which is in the mouths of thousands while it is in the hearts of scarcely any was well meant by sir wycherly however plainly expressed it merely drew from the youth the simple answer thathe was born in the colonies and had colonists for his parents a fact that the others had heard already some ten or a dozen times  it is a little singular mr wychecombe that you should bear both of my names and yet be no relative continued the baronet now wycherly came into our family from old sir hildebrand wycherly who was slain at bosworth field and whose only daughter my ancestor and toms ancestor there married since that day wycherly has been a favourite name among us i do not think that the wychecombes of herts ever thought of calling a son wycherly although as my poor brother the judge used to say they were related but of the halfblood only i suppose your father taught you what is meant by being of the halfblood thomas  tom wychecombes face became the colour of scarlet and he cast an uneasy glance at all present expecting in particular to meet with a look of exultation in the eyes of the lieutenant he was greatly relieved however at finding that neither of the three meant or understood more than was simply expressed as for his uncle he had not the smallest intention of making any allusion to the peculiarity of his nephews birth and the other two in common with the world supposed the reputed heir to be legitimate gathering courage from the looks of those around him tom answered with a steadiness that prevented his agitation from being detected  certainly my dear sir my excellent parent forgot nothing that he thought might be useful to me in maintaining my rights and the honour of the family hereafter i very well understand that the wychecombes of hertfordshire have no claims on us nor indeed any wychecombe who is not descended from my respectable grandfather the late sir wycherly  he must have been an early instead of a late sir wycherly rather mr thomas put in dutton laughing at his own conceit for i can remember no other than the honourable baronet before us in the last fifty years  quite true duttonvery true rejoined the person last alluded to as true as that time and tide wait for no man we understand the meaning of such things on the coast here it was half a century last october since i succeeded my respected parent but it will not be another half century before some one will succeed me  sir wycherly was a hale hearty man for his years but he had no unmanly dread of his end still he felt it could not be very distant having already numbered fourscore and four years nevertheless there were certain phrases of usage that dutton did not see fit to forget on such an occasion and he answered accordingly turning to look at and admire the still ruddy countenance of the baronet by way of giving emphasis to his words  you will yet see half of us into our graves sir wycherly he said and still remain an active man though i dare say another half century will bring most of us up even mr thomas here and your young namesake can hardly hope to run out more line than that well as for myself i only desire to live through this war that i may again see his majestys arms triumphant though they do tell me that we are in for a good thirty years struggle wars have lasted as long as that sir wycherly and i dont see why this may not as well as another  very true dutton it is not only possible but probable and i trust both you and i may live to see our flowerhunter here a postcaptain at leastthough it would be wishing almost too much to expect to see him an admiral there has been one admiral of the name and i confess i should like to see another  has not mr thomas a brother in the service demanded the master i had thought that my lord the judge had given us one of his young gentlemen  he thought of it but the army got both of the boys as it turned out gregory was to be the midshipman my poor brother intending him for a sailor from the first and so giving him the name that was once borne by the unfortunate relative we lost by shipwreck i wished him to call one of the lads james after st james but somehow i never could persuade thomas to see all the excellence of that pious young man  dutton was a little embarrassed for st james had left any thing but a godly savour behind him and he was about to fabricate a tolerably bold assertion to the contrary rather than incur the risk of offending the lord of the manor when luckily a change in the state of the fog afforded him a favourable opportunity of bringing about an apposite change in the subject during the whole of the morning the sea had been invisible from the headland a dense body of vapour resting on it far as eye could reach veiling the whole expanse with a single white cloud the lighter portions of the vapour had at first floated around the headland which could not have been seen at any material distance but all had been gradually settling down into a single mass that now rose within twenty feet of the summit of the cliffs the hour was still quite early but the sun was gaining force and it speedily drank up all the lighter particles of the mist leaving a clear bright atmosphere above the feathery bank through which objects might be seen for miles there was what seamen call a fanning breeze or just wind enough to cause the light sails of a ship to swell and collapse under the double influence of the air and the motion of the hull imitating in a slight degree the vibrations of that familiar appliance of the female toilet duttons eye had caught a glance of the loftiest sail of a vessel above the fog going through this very movement and it afforded him the release he desired by enabling him to draw the attention of his companions to the same object  see sir wycherlysee mr wychecombe he cried eagerly pointing in the direction of the sail yonder is some of the kings canvass coming into our roadstead or i am no judge of the set of a manofwars royal it is a large bit of cloth too mr lieutenant for a sail so lofty  it is a twodeckers royal master dutton returned the young sailor and now you see the fore and main separately as the ship keeps away  well put in sir wycherly in a resigned manner here have i lived fourscore years on this coast and for the life of me i have never been able to tell a foreroyal from a backroyal or a mizzen headstay from a head mizzenstay they are the most puzzling things imaginable and now i cannot discover how you know that yonder sail which i see plain enough is a royal any more than that it is a jib  dutton and the lieutenant smiled but sir wycherlys simplicity had a cast of truth and nature about it that deterred most people from wishing to ridicule him then the rank fortune and local interest of the baronet counted for a good deal on all such occasions  here is another fellow farther east cried dutton still pointing with a finger and every inch as big as his consort ah it does my eyes good to see our roadstead come into notice in this manner after all i have said and done in its behalfbut who have we herea brother chip by his appearance i dare say some idler who has been sent ashore with despatches  there is another fellow further east and every inch as big as his consort said wychecombe as we shall call our lieutenant in order to distinguish him from tom of the same name repeating the very words of dutton with an application and readiness that almost amounted to wit pointing in his turn at two strangers who were ascending to the station by a path that led from the beach certainly both these gentlemen are in his majestys service and they have probably just landed from the ships in the offing  the truth of this conjecture was apparent to dutton at a glance as the strangers joined each other the one last seen proceeded in advance and there was something in his years the confident manner in which he approached and his general appearance that induced both the sailors to believe he might be the commander of one of the ships that had just come in view  goodmorrow gentlemen commenced this person as soon as near enough to salute the party at the foot of the flagstaff goodmorrow to ye all im glad to meet you for its but a jacobs ladder this path of yours through the ravine in the cliffs hey why atwood looking around him at the sea of vapour in surprise what the devil has become of the fleet  it is lost in the fog sir we are above it here when more on a level with the ships we could see or fancy we saw more of them than we do now  here are the upper sails of two heavy ships sir observed wychecombe pointing in the direction of the vessels already seen ay and yonder are two morenothing but the royals are visible  two morei left eleven twodeckers three frigates a sloop and a cutter in sight when i got into the boat you might have covered em all with a pockethandkerchief hey atwood  they were certainly in close order sir but ill not take it on myself to say quite as near together as that  ay youre a dissenter by trade and never will believe in a miracle sharp work gentlemen to get up such a hill as this after fifty  it is indeed sir answered sir wycherly kindly will you do us the favour to take a seat among us and rest yourself after so violent an exertion the cliff is hard enough to ascend even when one keeps the path though here is a young gentleman who had a fancy just now to go down it without a path and that too merely that a pretty girl might have a nosegay on her breakfasttable  the stranger looked intently at sir wycherly for a moment then glanced his eye at the groom and the pony after which he took a survey of tom wychecombe the lieutenant and the master he was a man accustomed to look about him and he understood by that rapid glance the characters of all he surveyed with perhaps the exception of that of tom wychecombe and even of that he formed a tolerably shrewd conjecture sir wycherly he immediately set down as the squire of the adjacent estate duttons situation he hit exactly conceiving him to be a wornout master who was employed to keep the signalstation while he understood wychecombe by his undress and air to be a sealieutenant in the kings service tom wychecombe he thought it quite likely might be the son and heir of the lord of the manor both being in mourning though he decided in his own mind that there was not the smallest family likeness between them bowing with the courtesy of a man who knew how to acknowledge a civility he took the proffered seat at sir wycherlys side without farther ceremony  we must carry the young fellow to sea with us sir rejoined the stranger and that will cure him of looking for flowers in such ticklish places his majesty has need of us all in this war and i trust young gentleman you have not been long ashore among the girls  only long enough to make a cure of a pretty smart hurt received in cutting out a lugger from the opposite coast answered wychecombe with sufficient modesty and yet with sufficient spirit  luggerha what atwood you surely do not mean young gentleman la voltigeuse  that was the name of the craft sirwe found her in the roads of groix  and then ive the pleasure of seeing mr wychecombe the young officer who led in that gallant attack  this was said with a most flattering warmth of manner the stranger even rising and removing his hat as he uttered the words with a heartiness that showed how much his feelings were in unison with what he said  i am mr wychecombe sir answered the other blushing to the temples and returning the salute though i had not the honour of leading one of the lieutenants of our ship being in another boat  yesi know all thatbut he was beaten off while you boarded and did the work what have my lords commissioners done in the matter  all that is necessary so far as i am concerned sir i do assure you having sent me a commission the very next week i only wish they had been equally generous to mr walton who received a severe wound also and behaved as well as man could behave  that would not be so wise mr wychecombe since it would be rewarding a failure returned the stranger coldly success is all in all in war ah there the fellows begin to show themselves atwood  this remark drew all eyes again towards the sea where a sight now presented itself that was really worthy of a passing notice the vapour appeared to have become packed into a mass of some eighty or a hundred feet in height leaving a perfectly clear atmosphere above it in the clear air were visible the upper spars and canvass of the entire fleet mentioned by the stranger sixteen sail in all there were the eleven twodeckers and the three frigates rising in pyramids of canvass still fanning in towards the anchorage which in that roadstead was within pistolshot of the shore while the royals and upper part of the topgallant sails of the sloop seemed to stand on the surface of the fog like a monument after a moments pause wychecombe discovered even the head of the cutters royalmast with the pennant lazily fluttering ahead of it partly concealed in vapour the fog seemed to settle instead of rising though it evidently rolled along the face of the waters putting the whole scene in motion it was not long ere the tops of the ships of the line became visible and then living beings were for the first time seen in the moving masses  i suppose we offer just such a sight to the topmen of the ships as they offer to us observed the stranger they must see this headland and flagstaff mr wychecombe and there can be no danger of their standing in too far  i should think not sir certainly the men aloft can see the cliffs above the fog as we see the vessels spars ha mr dutton there is a rearadmirals flag flying on board the ship farthest to the eastward  so i see sir and by looking at the third vessel on the western side of the line you will find a bit of square bunting at the fore which will tell you there is a viceadmiral beneath it  quite true exclaimed wychecombe who was ever enthusiastic on matters relating to his profession a viceadmiral of the red too which is the next step to being a full admiral this must be the fleet of sir digby downes  no young gentleman returned the stranger who perceived by the glance of the others eye that a question was indirectly put to himself it is the southern squadron and the viceadmirals flag you see belongs to sir gervaise oakes admiral bluewater is on board the ship that carries a flag at the mizzen  those two officers always go together sir wycherly added the young man whenever we hear the name of sir gervaise that of bluewater is certain to accompany it such a union in service is delightful to witness  well may they go in company mr wychecombe returned the stranger betraying a little emotion oakes and bluewater were reefers together under old breasthook in the mermaid and when the first was made a lieutenant into the squid the last followed as a mate oakes was first of the briton in her action with the spanish frigates and bluewater third for that affair oakes got a sloop and his friend went with him as his first the next year they had the luck to capture a heavier ship than their own when for the first time in their service the two young men were separated oakes getting a frigate and bluewater getting the squid still they cruised in company until the senior was sent in command of a flying squadron with a broad pennant when the junior who by this time was post received his old messmate on board his own frigate in that manner they served together down to the hour when the first hoisted his flag from that time the two old seamen have never been parted bluewater acting as the admirals captain until he got the square bunting himself the viceadmiral has never led the van of a fleet that the rearadmiral did not lead the reardivision and now that sir gervaise is a commanderinchief you see his friend dick bluewater is cruising in his company  while the stranger was giving this account of the two admirals in a halfserious halfjocular manner the eyes of his companions were on him he was a middlesized redfaced man with an aquiline nose a lightblue animated eye and a mouth which denoted more of the habits and care of refinement than either his dress or his ordinary careless mien a great deal is said about the aristocracy of the ears and the hands and the feet but of all the features or other appliances of the human frame the mouth and the nose have the greatest influence in producing an impression of gentility this was peculiarly the case with the stranger whose beak like that of an ancient galley gave the promise of a stately movement and whose beautiful teeth and winning smile often relieved the expression of a countenance that was not unfrequently stern as he ceased speaking dutton rose in a studied manner raised his hat entirely from his head bowed his body nearly to a right angle and said  unless my memory is treacherous i believe i have the honor to see rearadmiral bluewater himself i was a mate in the medway when he commanded the chloe and unless fiveandtwenty years have made more changes than i think probable he is now on this hill  your memory is a bad one mr dutton and your hill has on it a much worse man in all respects than admiral bluewater they say that man and wife from living together and thinking alike having the same affections loving the same objects or sometimes hating them get in time to look alike hey atwood it may be that i am growing like bluewater on the same principle but this is the first time i ever heard the thing suggested i am sir gervaise oakes at your service sir  the bow of dutton was now much lower than before while young wychecombe uncovered himself and sir wycherly arose and paid his compliments cordially introducing himself and offering the admiral and all his officers the hospitality of the hall  ay this is straightforward and hearty and in the good old english manner exclaimed the admiral when he had returned the salutes and cordially thanked the baronet one might land in scotland now anywhere between the tweed and john agroats house and not be asked so much as to eat an oaten cake hey atwoodalways excepting the mountain dew  you will have your fling at my poor countrymen sir gervaise and so there is no more to be said on the subject returned the secretary for such was the rank of the admirals companion i might feel hurt at times did i not know that you get as many scotsmen about you in your own ship as you can and that a fleet is all the better in your judgment for having every other captain from the land o cakes  did you ever hear the like of that sir wycherly because i stick to a man i like he accuses me of having a predilection for his whole country heres atwood now he was my clerk when in a sloop and he has followed me to the plantagenet and because i do not throw him overboard he wishes to make it appear half scotland is in her hold  well there are the surgeon the purser one of the mates one of the marine officers and the fourth lieutenant to keep me company sir gervaise answered the secretary smiling like one accustomed to his superiors jokes and who cared very little about them when you send us all back to scotland im thinking there will be many a good vacancy to fill  the scotch make themselves very useful sir gervaise put in sir wycherly by way of smoothing the matter over and now we have a brunswick prince on the throne we englishmen have less jealousy of them than formerly i am sure i should be happy to see all the gentlemen mentioned by mr atwood at wychecombe hall  there youre all well berthed while the fleet lies in these roads sir wycherly in the name of scotland i thank you but what an extrornary for so admirals pronounced the word a hundred years ago scene this is hey atwood many a time have i seen the hulls of ships when their spars were hid in the fog but i do not remember ever to have seen before sixteen sets of masts and sails moving about on vapour without a single hull to uphold them the tops of all the twodecked ships are as plainly to be seen as if the air were without a particle of vapour while all below the catharpings is hid in a cloud as thick as the smoke of battle i do not half like bluewaters standing in so far perhaps mr dutton they cannot see the cliffs for i assure you we did not until quite close under them we went altogether by the lead the masters feeling their way like so many blind beggars  we always keep that ninepounder loaded sir gervaise returned the master in order to warn vessels when they are getting near enough in and if mr wychecombe who is younger than i will run to the house and light this match i will prime and we may give em warning where they are in less than a minute  the admiral gave a ready assent to this proposition and the respective parties immediately set about putting it in execution wychecombe hastened to the house to light the match glad of an opportunity to inquire after mildred while dutton produced a priminghorn from a sort of armchest that stood near the gun and put the latter in a condition to be discharged the young man was absent but a minute and when all was ready he turned towards the admiral in order to get the signal to proceed  let em have it mr wychecombe cried sir gervaise smiling it will wake bluewater up perhaps he may favour us with a broadside by way of retort  the match was applied and the report of the gun succeeded then followed a pause of more than a minute when the fog lifted around the c√¶sar the ship that wore a rearadmirals flag a flash like lightning was seen glancing in the mist and then came the bellowing of a piece of heavy ordnance almost at the same instant three little flags appeared at the masthead of the c√¶sar for previously to quitting his own ship sir gervaise had sent a message to his friend requesting him to take care of the fleet this was the signal to anchor the effect of all this as seen from the height was exceedingly striking as yet not a single hull had become visible the fog remaining packed upon the water in a way to conceal even the lower yards of the twodeckers all above was bright distinct and so near as almost to render it possible to distinguish persons there every thing was vivid while a sort of supernatural mystery veiled all beneath each ship had an officer aloft to look out for signals and no sooner had the c√¶sar opened her three little flags which had long been suspended in black balls in readiness for this service than the answers were seen floating at the masthead of each of the vessels then commenced a spectacle still more curious than that which those on the cliff had so long been regarding with interest ropes began to move and the sails were drawn up in festoons apparently without the agency of hands cut off from a seeming communication with the ocean or the hulls the spars of the different ships appeared to be instinct with life each machine playing its own part independently of the others but all having the same object in view in a very few minutes the canvass was hauled up and the whole fleet was swinging to the anchors presently head after head was thrown out of the fog the upper yards were alive with men and the sails were handed next came the squaring of the yards though this was imperfectly done and a good deal by guesswork the men came down and there lay a noble fleet at anchor with nothing visible to those on the cliffs but their tophamper and upper spars  sir gervaise oakes had been so much struck and amused with a sight that to him happened to be entirely novel that he did not speak during the whole process of anchoring indeed many a man might pass his life at sea and never witness such a scene but those who have know that it is one of the most beautiful and striking spectacles connected with the wonders of the great deep  by this time the sun had got so high as to begin to stir the fog and streams of vapour were shooting up from the beach like smoke rising from coalpits the wind increased too and rolled the vapour before it and in less than ten minutes the veil was removed ship after ship coming out in plain view until the entire fleet was seen riding in the roadstead in its naked and distinct proportions  now bluewater is a happy fellow exclaimed sir gervaise he sees his great enemy the land and knows how to deal with it  i thought the french were the great and natural enemies of every british sailor observed sir wycherly simply but quite to the point  humtheres truth in that too but the land is an enemy to be feared while the frenchman is nothey atwood  it was indeed a goodly sight to view the fine fleet that now lay anchored beneath the cliffs of wychecombe sir gervaise oakes was in that period considered a successful naval commander and was a favourite both at the admiralty and with the nation his popularity extended to the most distant colonies of england in nearly all of which he had served with zeal and credit but we are not writing of an age of nautical wonders like that which succeeded at the close of the century the french and dutch and even the spaniards were then all formidable as naval powers for revolutions and changes had not destroyed their maritime corps nor had the consequent naval ascendency of england annihilated their navigation the two great causes of the subsequent apparent invincibility of the latter power battles at sea in that day were warmly contested and were frequently fruitless more especially when fleets were brought in opposition the single combats were usually more decisive though the absolute success of the british flag was far from being as much a matter of course as it subsequently became in a word the science of naval warfare had not made those great strides which marked the career of england in the end nor had it retrograded among her enemies to the point which appears to have rendered their defeat nearly certain still sir gervaise was a successful officer having captured several single ships in bloody encounters and having actually led fleets with credit in four or five of the great battles of the times besides being second and third in command on various similar occasions his own ship was certain to be engaged let what would happen to the others equally as captains and as flagofficers the nation had become familiar with the names of oakes and bluewater as men ever to be found sustaining each other in the thickest of the fight it may be well to add here that both these favourite seamen were men of family or at least what was considered men of family among the mere gentry of england sir gervaise being a baronet by inheritance while his friend actually belonged to one of those naval lines which furnishes admirals for generations his father having worn a white flag at the main and his grandfather having been actually ennobled for his services dying viceadmiral of england these fortuitous circumstances perhaps rendered both so much the greater favourites at court     chapter iv          all with you except three     on duty and our leader israel     who is expected momently           marino faliero   as his fleet was safely anchored and that too in beautiful order in spite of the fog sir gervaise oakes showed a disposition to pursue what are termed ulterior views  this has been a fine sightcertainly a very fine sight such as an old seaman loves but there must be an end to it he said you will excuse me sir wycherly but the movements of a fleet always have interest in my eyes and it is seldom that i get such a birdseye view of those of my own no wonder it has made me a somewhat unreflecting intruder  make no apologies sir gervaise i beg of you for none are needed on any account though this headland does belong to the wychecombe property it is fairly leased to the crown and none have a better right to occupy it than his majestys servants the hall is a little more private it is true but even that has no door that will close upon our gallant naval defenders it is but a short walk and nothing will make me happier than to show you the way to my poor dwelling and to see you as much at home under its roof as you could be in the cabin of the plantagenet  if any thing could make me as much at home in a house as in a ship it would be so hearty a welcome and i intend to accept your hospitality in the very spirit in which it is offered atwood and i have landed to send off some important despatches to the first lord and we will thank you for putting us in the way of doing it in the safest and most expeditious manner curiosity and surprise have already occasioned the loss of half an hour while a soldier or a sailor should never lose half a minute  is a courier who knows the country well needed sir gervaise the lieutenant demanded modestly though with an interest that showed he was influenced only by zeal for the service  the admiral looked at him intently for a moment and seemed pleased with the hint implied in the question  can you ride asked sir gervaise smiling i could have brought halfadozen youngsters ashore with me but besides the doubts about getting a horsea chaise i take it is out of the question herei was afraid the lads might disgrace themselves on horseback  this must be said in pleasantry sir gervaise returned wychecombe he would be a strange virginian at least who does not know how to ride  and a strange englishman too bluewater would say and yet i never see the fellow straddle a horse that i do not wish it were a studdingsailboom run out to leeward we sailors fancy we ride mr wychecombe but it is some such fancy as a marine has for the foretopmastcrosstrees can a horse be had to go as far as the nearest postoffice that sends off a daily mail  that can it sir gervaise put in sir wycherly here is dick mounted on as good a hunter as is to be found in england and ill answer for my young namesakes willingness to put the animals mettle to the proof our little mail has just left wychecombe for the next twentyfour hours but by pushing the beast there will be time to reach the high road in season for the great london mail which passes the nearest markettown at noon it is but a gallop of ten miles and back and that ill answer for mr wychecombes ability to do and to join us at dinner by four  young wychecombe expressing his readiness to perform all this and even more at need the arrangement was soon made dick was dismounted the lieutenant got his despatches and his instructions took his leave and had galloped out of sight in the next five minutes the admiral then declared himself at liberty for the day accepting the invitation of sir wycherly to breakfast and dine at the hall in the same spirit of frankness as that in which it had been given sir wycherly was so spirited as to refuse the aid of his pony but insisted on walking through the village and park to his dwelling though the distance was more than a mile just as they were quitting the signalstation the old man took the admiral aside and in an earnest but respectful manner disburthened his mind to the following effect  sir gervaise he said i am no sailor as you know and least of all do i bear his majestys commission in the navy though i am in the county commission as a justice of the peace so if i make any little mistake you will have the goodness to overlook it for i know that the etiquette of the quarterdeck is a very serious matter and is not to be trifled withbut here is dutton as good a fellow in his way as liveshis father was a sort of a gentleman too having been the attorney of the neighbourhood and the old man was accustomed to dine with me forty years ago  i believe i understand you sir wycherly interrupted the admiral and i thank you for the attention you wish to pay my prejudices but you are master of wychecombe and i should feel myself a troublesome intruder indeed did you not ask whom you please to dine at your own table  thats not quite it sir gervaise though you have not gone far wide of the mark dutton is only a master you know and it seems that a master on board ship is a very different thing from a master on shore so dutton himself has often told me  ay dutton is right enough as regards a kings ship though the two offices are pretty much the same when other craft are alluded to but my dear sir wycherly an admiral is not disgraced by keeping company with a boatswain if the latter is an honest man it is true we have our customs and what we call our quarterdeck and forward officers which is court end and city on board ship but a master belongs to the first and the master of the plantagenet sandy mcyarn dines with me once a month as regularly as he enters a new word at the top of his logbook i beg therefore you will extend your hospitality to whom you pleaseor the admiral hesitated as he cast a goodnatured glance at the master who stood still uncovered waiting for his superior to move away or perhaps sir wycherly you would permit me to ask a friend to make one of our party  thats just it sir gervaise returned the kindhearted baronet and dutton will be one of the happiest fellows in devonshire i wish we could have mrs dutton and milly and then the table would look what my poor brother jamesst james i used to call himwhat the rev james wychecombe was accustomed to term mathematical he said a table should have all its sides and angles duly filled james was a most agreeable companion sir gervaise and in divinity he would not have turned his back on one of the apostles i do verily believe  the admiral bowed and turning to the master he invited him to be of the party at the hall in the manner which one long accustomed to render his civilities agreeable by a sort of professional offhanded way well knew how to assume  sir wycherly has insisted that i shall consider his table as set in my own cabin he continued and i know of no better manner of proving my gratitude than by taking him at his word and filling it with guests that will be agreeable to us both i believe there is a mrs dutton and a missaaa  milly put in the baronet eagerly miss mildred duttonthe daughter of our good friend dutton here and a young lady who would do credit to the gayest drawingroom in london  you perceive sir that our kind host anticipates the wishes of an old bachelor as it might be by instinct and desires the company of the ladies also miss mildred will at least have two young men to do homage to her beauty and three old ones to sigh in the distancehey atwood  mildred as sir wycherly knows sir has been a little disturbed this morning returned dutton putting on his best manner for the occasion but i feel no doubt will be too grateful for this honour not to exert herself to make a suitable return as for my wife gentlemen  and what is to prevent mrs dutton from being one of the party interrupted sir wycherly as he observed the husband to hesitate she sometimes favours me with her company  i rather think she will today sir wycherly if mildred is well enough to go the good woman seldom lets her daughter stray far from her apronstrings she keeps her as i tell her within the sweep of her own hawse sir gervaise  so much the wiser she master dutton returned the admiral pointedly the best pilot for a young woman is a good mother and now you have a fleet in your roadstead i need not tell a seaman of your experience that you are on pilotgroundhey atwood  here the parties separated dutton remaining uncovered until his superior had turned the corner of his little cottage and was fairly out of sight then the master entered his dwelling to prepare his wife and daughter for the honours they had in perspective before he executed this duty however the unfortunate man opened what he called a lockerwhat a housewife would term a cupboardand fortified his nerves with a strong draught of pure nantes a liquor that no hostilities customhouse duties or national antipathies has ever been able to bring into general disrepute in the british islands in the mean time the party of the two baronets pursued its way towards the hall  the village or hamlet of wychecombe lay about halfway between the station and the residence of the lord of the manor it was an exceedingly rural and retired collection of mean houses possessing neither physician apothecary nor attorney to give it importance a small inn two or three shops of the humblest kind and some twenty cottages of labourers and mechanics composed the place which at that early day had not even a chapel or a conventicle dissent not having made much progress then in england the parish church one of the old edifices of the time of the henrys stood quite alone in a field more than a mile from the place and the vicarage a respectable abode was just on the edge of the park fully half a mile more distant in short wychecombe was one of those places which was so far on the decline that few or no traces of any little importance it may have once possessed were any longer to be discovered and it had sunk entirely into a hamlet that owed its allowed claims to be marked on the maps and to be noted in the gazetteers altogether to its antiquity and the name it had given to one of the oldest knightly families in england  no wonder then that the arrival of a fleet under the head produced a great excitement in the little village the anchorage was excellent so far as the bottom was concerned but it could scarcely be called a roadstead in any other point of view since there was shelter against no wind but that which blew directly off shore which happened to be a wind that did not prevail in that part of the island occasionally a small cruiser would cometo in the offing and a few frigates had lain at single anchors in the roads for a tide or so in waiting for a change of weather but this was the first fleet that had been known to moor under the cliffs within the memory of man the fog had prevented the honest villagers from ascertaining the unexpected honour that had been done them until the reports of the two guns reached their ears when the important intelligence spread with due rapidity over the entire adjacent country although wychecombe did not lie in actual view of the sea by the time the party of sir wycherly entered the hamlet its little street was already crowded with visiters from the fleet every vessel having sent at least one boat ashore and many of them some three or four captains and gunroom stewards midshipmens foragers loblolly boys and other similar harpies were out in scores for this was a part of the world in which bumboats were unknown and if the mountain would not come to mahomet mahomet must fain go to the mountain half an hour had sufficed to exhaust all the unsophisticated simplicity of the hamlet and milk eggs fresh butter softtommy vegetables and such fruits as were ripe had already risen quite one hundred per cent in the market  sir gervaise had called his force the southern squadron from the circumstance of its having been cruising in the bay of biscay for the last six months this was a wild winterstation the danger from the elements greatly surpassing any that could well be anticipated from the enemy the duty notwithstanding had been well and closely performed several west india and one valuable east india convoy having been effectually protected as well as a few straggling frigates of the enemy picked up but the service had been excessively laborious to all engaged in it and replete with privations most of those who now landed had not trod terra firma for half a year and it was not wonderful that all the officers whose duties did not confine them to the vessels gladly seized the occasion to feast their senses with the verdure and odours of their native island quite a hundred guests of this character were also pouring into the street of wychecombe or spreading themselves among the surrounding farmhouses flirting with the awkward and blushing girls and keeping an eye at the same time to the main chance of the messtable  our boys have already found out your village sir wycherly in spite of the fog the viceadmiral remarked goodhumouredly as he cast his eyes around at the movement of the street and the locusts of egypt will not come nearer to breeding a famine one would think there was a great dinner in petto in every cabin of the fleet by the number of the captains stewards that are ashore hey atwood i have seen nine of the harpies myself and the other seven cant be far off  here is galleygo sir gervaise returned the secretary smiling though he can scarcely be called a captains steward having the honour to serve a viceadmiral and a commanderinchief  ay but we feed the whole fleet at times and have some excuse for being a little exactingharkee galleygoget a horsecart and push off at once four or five miles further into the country you might as well expect to find real pearls in fishes eyes as hope to pick up any thing nice among so many gunroom and cockpit boys i dine ashore today but captain greenly is fond of muttonchops youll remember  this was said kindly and in the manner of a man accustomed to treat his domestics with the familiarity of humble friends galleygo was as unpromising a looking butler as any gentleman ashore would be at all likely to tolerate but he had been with his present master and in his present capacity ever since the latter had commanded a sloop of war all his youth had been passed as a topman and he was really a prime seaman but accident having temporarily placed him in his present station captain oakes was so much pleased with his attention to his duty and particularly with his order that he ever afterwards retained him in his cabin notwithstanding the strong desire the honest fellow himself had felt to remain aloft time and familiarity at length reconciled the steward to his station though he did not formally accept it until a clear agreement had been made that he was not to be considered an idler on any occasion that called for the services of the best men in this manner david for such was his christian name had become a sort of nondescript on board of a manofwar being foremost in all the cuttings out a captain of a gun and was frequently seen on a yard in moments of difficulty just to keep his hand in as he expressed it while he descended to the duties of the cabin in peaceable times and good weather near thirty years had he thus been halfsteward halfseaman when afloat while on land he was rather a counsellor and minister of the closet than a servant for out of a ship he was utterly useless though he never left his master for a week at a time ashore or afloat the name of galleygo was a sobriquet conferred by his brother topmen but had been so generally used that for the last twenty years most of his shipmates believed it to be his patronymic when this compound of cabin and forecastle received the order just related he touched the lock of hair on his forehead a ceremony he always used before he spoke to sir gervaise the hat being removed at some three or four yards distance and made his customary answer of  ayaysiryour honour has been a young gentleman yourself and knows what a young gentlemans stomach gets to be ater a six months fast in the bay of biscay and a young gentlemans boys stomach too i always thinks theres but a small chance for us sir when i sees six or eight of them light cruisers in my neighbourhood theyre sommat like the sloops and cutters of a fleet which picks up all the prizes  quite true master galleygo but if the light cruisers get the prizes you should recollect that the admiral always has his share of the prizemoney  yes sir i knows we has our share but thats accordin to law and because the commanders of the light craft cant help it let em once get the law on their side and not a hapence would bless our pockets no sir what we gets we gets by the law and as there is no law to fetch up young gentlemen or their boys that pays as they goes we never gets any thing they or their boys puts hands on  i dare say you are right david as you always are it wouldnt be a bad thing to have an act of parliament to give an admiral his twentieth in the reefers foragings the old fellows would sometimes get back some of their own poultry and fruit in that way hey atwood  the secretary smiled his assent and then sir gervaise apologized to his host repeated the order to the steward and the party proceeded  this fellow of mine sir wycherly is no respecter of persons beyond the etiquette of a manofwar the admiral continued by way of further excuse i believe his majesty himself would be favoured with an essay on some part of the economy of the cabin were galleygo to get an opportunity of speaking his mind to him nor is the fool without his expectations of some day enjoying this privilege for the last lime i went to court i found honest david rigged from stem to stern in a full suit of claret and steel under the idea that he was to sail in company with me as he called it with or without signal  there was nothing surprising in that sir gervaise observed the secretary galleygo has sailed in company with you so long and to so many strange lands has been through so many dangers at your side and has got so completely to consider himself as part of the family that it was the most natural thing in the world he should expect to go to court with you  true enough the fellow would face the devil at my side and i dont see why he should hesitate to face the king i sometimes call him lady oakes sir wycherly for he appears to think he has a right of dower or to some other lawyerlike claim on my estate and as for the fleet he always speaks of that as if we commanded it in common i wonder how bluewater tolerates the blackguard for he never scruples to allude to him as under our orders if any thing should befal me dick and david would have a civil war for the succession hey atwood  i think military subordination would bring galleygo to his senses sir gervaise should such an unfortunate accident occurwhich heaven avert for many years to come there is admiral bluewater coming up the street at this very moment sir  at this sudden announcement the whole party turned to look in the direction intimated by the secretary it was by this time at one end of the short street and all saw a man just entering the other who in his walk air attire and manner formed a striking contrast to the active merry bustling youthful young sailors who thronged the hamlet in person admiral bluewater was exceedingly tall and exceedingly thin like most seamen who have that physical formation he stooped a circumstance that gave his years a greater apparent command over his frame than they possessed in reality while this bend in his figure deprived it in a great measure of the sturdy martial air that his superior presented to the observer it lent to his carriage a quiet and dignity that it might otherwise have wanted certainly were this officer attired like an ordinary civilian no one would have taken him for one of englands bravest and most efficient seacaptains he would have passed rather as some thoughtful welleducated and refined gentleman of retired habits diffident of himself and a stranger to ambition he wore an undress rearadmirals uniform as a matter of course but he wore it carelessly as if from a sense of duty only or conscious that no arrangement could give him a military air still all about his person was faultlessly neat and perfectly respectable in a word no one but a man accustomed to the sea were it not for his uniform would suspect the rearadmiral of being a sailor and even the seaman himself might be often puzzled to detect any other signs of the profession about him than were to be found in a face which fair gentlemanly handsome and even courtly as it was in expression and outline wore the tint that exposure invariably stamps on the mariners countenance here however his unseamanlike character ceased admiral oakes had often declared that dick bluewater knew more about a ship than any man in england and as for a fleet his mode of manoeuvring one had got to be standard in the service  as soon as sir gervaise recognised his friend he expressed a wish to wait for him which was courteously converted by sir wycherly into a proposition to return and meet him so abstracted was admiral bluewater however that he did not see the party that was approaching him until he was fairly accosted by sir gervaise who led the advance by a few yards  goodday to you bluewater commenced the latter in his familiar offhand way im glad you have torn yourself away from your ship though i must say the manner in which you cameto in that fog was more like instinct than any thing human i determined to tell you as much the moment we met for i dont think there is a ship half her length out of mathematical order notwithstanding the tide runs here like a racehorse  that is owing to your captains sir gervaise returned the other observing the respect of manner that the inferior never loses with his superior on service and in a navy let their relative rank and intimacy be what they may on all other occasions good captains make handy ships our gentlemen have now been together so long that they understand each others movements and every vessel in the fleet has her character as well as her commander  very true admiral bluewater and yet there is not another officer in his majestys service that could have brought a fleet to anchor in so much order and in such a fog and i ask your leave sir most particularly to thank you for the lesson you have given not only to the captains but to the commanderinchief i presume i may admire that which i cannot exactly imitate  the rearadmiral merely smiled and touched his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment but he made no direct answer in words by this time sir wycherly and the others had approached and the customary introductions took place sir wycherly now pressed his new acquaintance to join his guests with so much heartiness that there was no such thing as refusing  since you and sir gervaise both insist on it so earnestly sir wycherly returned the rearadmiral i must consent but as it is contrary to our practice when on foreign serviceand i call this roadstead a foreign station as to any thing we know about itas it is contrary to our practice for both flagofficers to sleep out of the fleet i shall claim the privilege to be allowed to go off to my ship before midnight i think the weather looks settled sir gervaise and we may trust that many hours without apprehension  poohpoohbluewater you are always fancying the ships in a gale and clawing off a leeshore put your heart at rest and let us go and take a comfortable dinner with sir wycherly who has a london paper i dare to say that may let us into some of the secrets of state are there any tidings from our people in flanders  things remain pretty much as they have been returned sir wycherly since that last terrible affair in which the duke got the better of the french ati never can remember an outlandish name but it sounds something like a christian baptism if my poor brother st james were living now he could tell us all about it  christian baptism thats an odd allusion for a field of battle the armies cant have got to jerusalem hey atwood  i rather think sir gervaise the secretary coolly remarked that sir wycherly wychecombe refers to the battle that took place last springit was fought at fontsomething and a font certainly has something to do with christian baptism  thats itthats it cried sir wycherly with some eagerness fonteno√Ø was the name of the place where the duke would have carried all before him and brought marshal saxe and all his frogeaters prisoners to england had our dutch and german allies behaved better than they did so it is with poor old england gentlemen whatever she gains her allies always lose for herthe germans or the colonists are constantly getting us into trouble  both sir gervaise and his friend were practical men and well knew that they never fought the dutch or the french without meeting with something that was pretty nearly their match they had no faith in general national superiority the courtsmartial that so often succeeded general actions had taught them that there were all degrees of spirit as well as all degrees of a want of spirit and they knew too much to be the dupes of flourishes of the pen or of vapid declamation at dinnerspeeches and in the house of commons men well led and commanded they had ascertained by experience were worth twice as much as the same men when ill led and ill commanded and they were not to be told that the moral tone of an army or a fleet from which all its success was derived depended more on the conventional feeling that had been got up through moral agencies than on birthplace origin or colour each glanced his eye significantly at the other and a sarcastic smile passed over the face of sir gervaise though his friend maintained his customary appearance of gravity  i believe le grand monarque and marshal saxe give a different account of that matter sir wycherly drily observed the former and it may be well to remember that there are two sides to every story whatever may be said of dettingen i fancy history will set down fonteno√Ø as any thing but a feather in his royal highness cap  you surely do not consider it possible for the french arms to overthrow a british army sir gervaise oakes exclaimed the simpleminded provincialfor such was sir wycherly wychecombe though he had sat in parliament had four thousand a year and was one of the oldest families in englandit sounds like treason to admit the possibility of such a thing  god bless us my dear sir i am as far from supposing any such thing as the duke of cumberland himself who by the way has as much english blood in his veins as the baltic may have of the water of the mediterraneanhey atwood by the way sir wycherly i must ask a little tenderness of you in behalf of my friend the secretary here who has a national weakness in favour of the pretender and all of the clan stuart  i hope noti sincerely hope not sir gervaise exclaimed sir wycherly with a warmth that was not entirely free from alarm his own loyalty to the new house being altogether without reproach mr atwood has the air of a gentleman of too good principles not to see on which side real religious and political liberty lie i am sure you are pleased to be jocular sir gervaise the very circumstance that he is in your company is a pledge of his loyalty  well well sir wycherly i would not give you a false idea of my friend atwood if possible and so i may as well confess that while his scotch blood inclines him to toryism his english reason makes him a whig if charles stuart never gets the throne until stephen atwood helps him to a seat on it he may take leave of ambition for ever  i thought as much sir gervaisei thought your secretary could never lean to the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance thats a principle which would hardly suit sailors admiral bluewater  admiral bluewaters line full blue eye lighted with an expression approaching irony but he made no other answer than a slight inclination of the head in point of fact he was a jacobite though no one was acquainted with the circumstance but his immediate commanding officer as a seaman he was called on only to serve his country and as often happens to military men he was willing to do this under any superior whom circumstances might place over his head let his private sentiments be what they might during the civil war of 1715 he was too young in years and too low in rank to render his opinions of much importance and kept on foreign stations his services could only affect the general interests of the nation without producing any influence on the contest at home since that period nothing had occurred to require one whose duty kept him on the ocean to come to a very positive decision between the two masters that claimed his allegiance sir gervaise had always been able to persuade him that he was sustaining the honour and interests of his country and that ought to be sufficient to a patriot let who would rule notwithstanding this wide difference in political feeling between the two admiralssir gervaise being as decided a whig as his friend was a torytheir personal harmony had been without a shade as to confidence the superior knew the inferior so well that he believed the surest way to prevent his taking sides openly with the jacobites or of doing them secret service was to put it in his power to commit a great breach of trust so long as faith were put in his integrity sir gervaise felt certain his friend bluewater might be relied on and he also knew that should the moment ever come when the other really intended to abandon the service of the house of hanover he would frankly throw up his employments and join the hostile standard without profiting in any manner by the trusts he had previously enjoyed it is also necessary that the reader should understand that admiral bluewater had never communicated his political opinions to any person but his friend the pretender and his counsellors being as ignorant of them as george ii and his ministers the only practical effect therefore that they had ever produced was to induce him to decline separate commands several of which had been offered to him one quite equal to that enjoyed by sir gervaise oakes himself  no the latter answered to sir wycherlys remark though the grave thoughtful expression of his face showed how little his feelings chimed in at the moment with the ironical language of his tongue nosir wycherly a manofwars man in particular has not the slightest idea of passive obedience and nonresistancethat is a doctrine which is intelligible only to papists and tories bluewater is in a brown study thinking no doubt of the manner in which he intends to lead down on monsieur de gravelin should we ever have the luck to meet that gentleman again so we will if its agreeable to all parties change the subject  with all my heart sir gervaise answered the baronet cordially and after all there is little use in discussing the affair of the pretender any longer for he appears to be quite out of mens minds since that last failure of king louis xv  yes norris rather crushed the young viper in its shell and we may consider the thing at an end  so my late brother baron wychecombe always treated it sir gervaise he once assured me that the twelve judges were clearly against the claim and that the stuarts had nothing to expect from them  did he tell you sir on what ground these learned gentlemen had come to this decision quietly asked admiral bluewater  he did indeed for he knew my strong desire to make out a good case against the tories so well that he laid all the law before me i am a bad hand however to repeat even what i hear though my poor brother the late rev james wychecombest james as i used to call himcould go over a discourse half an hour long and not miss a word thomas and james appear to have run away with the memories of the rest of the family nevertheless i recollect it all depended on an act of parliament which is supreme and the house of hanover reigning by an act of parliament no court could set aside the claim  very clearly explained sir continued bluewater and you will permit me to say that there was no necessity for an apology on account of the memory your brother however might not have exactly explained what an act of parliament is king lords and commons are all necessary to an act of parliament  certainlywe all know that my dear admiral we poor fellows ashore here as well as you mariners at sea the hanoverian succession had all three to authorize it  had it a king  a king out of disputeor what we bachelors ought to consider as much better it had a queen queen anne approved of the act and that made it an act of parliament i assure you i learned a good deal of law in the barons visits to wychecombe and in the pleasant hours we used to chat together in his chambers  and who signed the act of parliament that made anne a queen or did she ascend the throne by regular succession both mary and anne were sovereigns by acts of parliament and we must look back until we get the approval of a prince who took the crown by legal descent  comecome bluewater put in sir gervaise gravely we may persuade sir wycherly in this manner that he has a couple of furious jacobites in company the stuarts were dethroned by a revolution which is a law of nature and enacted by god and which of course overshadows all other laws when it gets into the ascendant as it clearly has done in this case i take it sir wycherly these are your parkgates and that yonder is the hall  this remark changed the discourse and the whole party proceeded towards the house discussing the beauty of its position its history and its advantages until they reached its door     chapter v      monarch and ministers are awful names     whoever wear them challenge our devoir           young   our plan does not require an elaborate description of the residence of sir wycherly the house had been neither priory abbey nor castle but it was erected as a dwelling for himself and his posterity by a sir michael wychecombe two or three centuries before and had been kept in good serviceable condition ever since it had the usual long narrow windows a suitable hall wainscoted rooms battlemented walls and turreted angles it was neither large nor small handsome nor ugly grand nor mean but it was quaint respectable in appearance and comfortable as an abode  the admirals were put each in possession of bedchambers and dressingrooms as soon as they arrived and atwood was berthed not far from his commandingofficer in readiness for service if required sir wycherly was naturally hospitable but his retired situation had given him a zest for company that greatly increased the inborn disposition sir gervaise it was understood was to pass the night with him and he entertained strong hopes of including his friend in the same arrangement beds were ordered too for dutton his wife and daughter and his namesake the lieutenant was expected also to sleep under his roof that night  the day passed in the customary manner the party having breakfasted and then separated to attend to their several occupations agreeably to the usages of all country houses in all parts of the world and we believe in all time sir gervaise who had sent a messenger off to the plantagenet for certain papers spent the morning in writing admiral bluewater walked in the park by himself atwood was occupied with his superior sir wycherly rode among his labourers and tom wychecombe took a rod and pretended to go forth to fish though he actually held his way back to the headland lingering in and around the cottage until it was time to return home at the proper hour sir wycherly sent his chariot for the ladies and a few minutes before the appointed moment the party began to assemble in the drawingroom  when sir wycherly appeared he found the duttons already in possession with tom doing the honours of the house of the sailingmaster and his daughter it is unnecessary to say more than that the former was in his best uniforman exceedingly plain one as was then the case with the whole naval wardrobeand that the last had recovered from her illness as was evident by the bloom that the sensitive blushes constantly cast athwart her lovely face her attire was exactly what it ought to have been neat simple and becoming in honour of the host she wore her best but this was what became her station though a little jewelry that rather surpassed what might have been expected in a girl of her rank of life threw around her person an air of modest elegance mrs dutton was a plain matronly womanthe daughter of a landsteward of a nobleman in the same countywith an air of great mental suffering from griefs she had never yet exposed to the heartless sympathy of the world  the baronet was so much in the habit of seeing his humble neighbours that an intimacy had grown up between them sir wycherly who was anything but an acute observer felt an interest in the melancholylooking and almost heartbroken mother without knowing why or certainly without suspecting the real character of her habitual sadness while mildreds youth and beauty had not failed of producing the customary effect of making a friend of the old bachelor he shook hands all round therefore with great cordiality expressing his joy at meeting mrs dutton and congratulating the daughter on her complete recovery  i see tom has been attentive to his duty he added while ive been detained by a silly fellow about a complaint against a poacher my namesake young wycherly has not got back yet though it is quite two hours past his time and mr atwood tells me the admiral is a little uneasy about his despatches i tell him mr wycherly wychecombe though i have not the honour of ranking him among my relatives and he is only a virginian by birth is a young man to be relied on and that the despatches are safe let what may detain the courier  and why should not a virginian be every way as trustworthy and prompt as an englishman sir wycherly asked mrs dutton he is an englishman merely separated from us by the water  this was said mildly or in the manner of one accustomed to speak under a rebuked feeling but it was said earnestly and perhaps a little reproachfully while the speakers eye glanced with natural interest towards the beautiful face of her daughter  why not sure enough my dear mrs dutton echoed the baronet they are englishmen like ourselves only born out of the realm as it might be and no doubt a little different on that account they are fellowsubjects mrs dutton and that is a great deal then they are miracles of loyalty there being scarcely a jacobite as they tell me in all the colonies  mr wycherly wychecombe is a very respectable young gentleman said dutton and i hear he is a prime seaman for his years he has not the honour of being related to this distinguished family like mr thomas here it is true but he is likely to make a name for himself should he get a ship and do as handsome things in her as he has done already his majesty would probably knight him and then we should have two sir wycherly wychecombes  i hope noti hope not exclaimed the baronet i think there must be a law against that as it is i shall be obliged to put bart after my name as my worthy grandfather used to do in order to prevent confusion but england cant bear two sir wycherlys any more than the world can bear two suns is not that your opinion miss mildred  the baronet had laughed at his own allusion showing he spoke half jocularly but as his question was put in too direct a manner to escape general attention the confused girl was obliged to answer  i dare say mr wychecombe will never reach a rank high enough to cause any such difficulty she said and it was said in all sincerity for unconsciously perhaps she secretly hoped that no difference so wide might ever be created between the youth and herself if he should i suppose his rights would be as good as anothers and he must keep his name  in such a case which is improbable enough as miss mildred has so well observed put in tom wychecombe we should have to submit to the knighthood for that comes from the king who might knight a chimneysweep if he see fit but a question might be raised as to the name it is bad enough as it is but if it really got to be two sir wycherlys i think my dear uncle would be wrong to submit to such an invasion of what one might call his individuality without making some inquiry as to the right of the gentleman to one or both his names the result might show that the king had made a sir something nobody  the sneer and spite with which this was uttered were too marked to escape notice and both dutton and his wife felt it would be unpleasant to mingle farther in the discourse still the last submissive rebuked and heartbroken as she was felt a glow on her own pale cheek as she saw the colour mount in the face of mildred and she detected the strong impulses that urged the generous girl herself to answer  we have now known mr wychecombe several months observed mildred fastening her full blue eye calmly on toms sinisterlooking face and we have never known any thing to cause us to think he would bear a nameor namesthat he does not at least think he has a right to  this was said gently but so distinctly that every word entered fairly into tom wychecombes soul who threw a quick suspicious glance at the lovely speaker as if to ascertain how far she intended any allusion to himself meeting with no other expression than that of generous interest he recovered his selfcommand and made his reply with sufficient coolness  upon my word mrs dutton he cried laughing we young men will all of us have to get over the cliff and hang dangling at the end of a rope in order to awaken an interest in miss mildred to defend us when our backs are turned so eloquentand most especially so lovely so charming an advocate is almost certain of success and my uncle and myself must admit the absent gentlemans right to our name though heaven be praised he has not yet got either the title or the estate  i hope i have said nothing sir wycherly to displease you returned mildred with emphasis though her face was a thousand times handsomer than ever with the blushes that suffused it nothing would pain me more than to suppose i had done so improper a thing i merely meant that we cannot believe mr wycherly wychecombe would willingly take a name he had no right to  my little dear said the baronet taking the hand of the distressed girl and kissing her cheek as he had often done before with fatherly tenderness it is not an easy matter for you to offend me and im sure the young fellow is quite welcome to both my names if you wish him to have em  and i merely meant miss mildred resumed tom who feared he might have gone too far that the young gentlemanquite without any fault of his ownis probably ignorant how he came by two names that have so long pertained to the head of an ancient and honourable family there is many a young man born who is worthy of being an earl but whom the law considers here tom paused to choose terms suitable for his auditor when the baronet added  a filius nulliusthats the phrase tomi had it from your own fathers mouth  tom wychecombe started and looked furtively around him as if to ascertain who suspected the truth then he continued anxious to regain the ground he feared he had lost in mildreds favour  filius nullius means miss mildred exactly what i wish to express a family without any legal origin they tell me however that in the colonies nothing is more common than for people to take the names of the great families at home and after a while they fancy themselves related  i never heard mr wycherly wychecombe say a word to lead us to suppose that he was in any manner connected with this family sir returned mildred calmly but quite distinctly  did you ever hear him say he was not miss mildred  i cannot say i ever did mr wychecombe it is a subject that has seldom been introduced in my hearing  but it has often been introduced in his i declare sir wycherly it has struck me as singular that while you and i have so very frequently stated in the presence of this gentleman that our families are in no way connected he has never in any manner not even by a nod or a look of approbation assented to what he must certainly know to be the case but i suppose like a true colonist he was unwilling to give up his hold on the old stock  here the entrance of sir gervaise oakes changed the discourse the viceadmiral joined the party in good spirits as is apt to be the case with men who have been much occupied with affairs of moment and who meet relaxation with a consciousness of having done their duty  if one could take with him to sea the comforts of such a house as this sir wycherly and such handsome faces as your own young lady cried sir gervaise cheerfully after he had made his salutations there would be an end of our exclusiveness for every petit ma√Ætre of paris and london would turn sailor as a matter of course six months in the bay of biscay gives an old fellow like myself a keen relish for these enjoyments as hunger makes any meat palatable though i am far very far indeed from putting this house or this company on a level with an indifferent feast even for an epicure  such as it is sir gervaise the first is quite at your service in all things rejoined the host and the last will do all in its power to make itself agreeable  ahhere comes bluewater to echo all i have said and feel i am telling sir wycherly and the ladies of the satisfaction we grampuses experience when we get berthed under such a roof as this with womans sweet face to throw a gleam of happiness around her  admiral bluewater had already saluted the mother but when his eye fell on the face and person of mildred it was riveted for an instant with an earnestness and intentness of surprise and admiration that all noted though no one saw fit to comment on it  sir gervaise is so established an admirer of the sex said the rearadmiral recovering himself after a pause that i am never astonished at any of his raptures salt water has the usual effect on him however for i have now known him longer than he might wish to be reminded of and yet the only mistress who can keep him true is his ship  and to that i believe i may be said to be constant i dont know how it is with you sir wycherly but every thing i am accustomed to i like now here i have sailed with both these gentlemen until i should as soon think of going to sea without a binnacle as to go to sea without em bothhey atwood then as to the ship my flag has been flying in the plantagenet these ten years and i cant bear to give the old craft up though bluewater here would have turned her over to an inferior after three years service i tell all the young men they dont stay long enough in any one vessel to find out her good qualities i never was in a slow ship yet  for the simple reason that you never get into a fast one that you do not wear her fairly out before you give her up the plantagenet sir wycherly is the fastest twodecker in his majestys service and the viceadmiral knows it too well to let any of us get foot in her while her timbers will hang together  let it be so if you will it only shows sir wycherly that i do not choose my friends for their bad qualities but allow me to ask young lady if you happen to know a certain mr wycherly wychecombea namesake but no relative i understand of our respectable hostand one who holds a commission in his majestys service  certainly sir gervaise answered mildred dropping her eyes to the floor and trembling though she scarce knew why mr wychecombe has been about here now for some months and we all know something of him  then perhaps you can tell me whether he is generally a loiterer on duty i do not inquire whether he is a laggard in his duty to you but whether mounted on a good hunter he could get over twenty miles in eight or ten hours for instance  i think sir wycherly would tell you that he could sir  he may be a wychecombe sir wycherly but he is no plantagenet in the way of sailing surely the young gentleman ought to have returned some hours since  its quite surprising to me that he is not back before this returned the kindhearted baronet he is active and understands himself and there is not a better horseman in the countyis there miss mildred  mildred did not think it necessary to reply to this direct appeal but spite of the manner in which she had been endeavouring to school her feelings since the accident on the cliff she could not prevent the deadly paleness that dread of some accident had produced or the rush of colour to her cheeks that followed from the unexpected question of sir wycherly turning to conceal her confusion she met the eye of tom wychecombe riveted on her face with an expression so sinister that it caused her to tremble fortunately at this moment sir gervaise turned away and drawing near his friend on the other side of the large apartment he said in an under tone  luckily atwood has brought ashore a duplicate of my despatches bluewater and if this dilatory gentleman does not return by the time we have dined i will send off a second courier the intelligence is too important to be trifled with and after having brought the fleet north to be in readiness to serve the state in this emergency it would be rare folly to leave the ministry in ignorance of the reasons why i have done it  nevertheless they would be almost as wellinformed as i am myself returned the rearadmiral with a little point but quite without any bitterness of manner the only advantage i have over them is that i do know where the fleet is which is more than the first lord can boast of  truei had forgot my friendbut you must feel that there is a subject on which i had better not consult you i have received some important intelligence that my duty as a commanderinchief renders it necessary i shouldkeep to myself  sir gervaise laughed as he concluded though he seemed vexed and embarrassed admiral bluewater betrayed neither chagrin nor disappointment but strong nearly ungovernable curiosity a feeling from which he was singularly exempt in general glowed in his eyes and lighted his whole countenance still habitual submission to his superior and the selfcommand of discipline enabled him to wait for any thing more that his friend might communicate at this moment the door opened and wycherly entered the room in the state in which he had just dismounted it was necessary to throw but a single glance at his hurried manner and general appearance to know that he had something of importance to communicate and sir gervaise made a sign for him not to speak  this is public service sir wycherly said the viceadmiral and i hope you will excuse us for a few minutes i beg this good company will be seated at table as soon as dinner is served and that you will treat us as old friendsas i should treat you if we were on board the plantagenet admiral bluewater will you be of our conference  nothing more was said until the two admirals and the young lieutenant were in the dressingroom of sir gervaise oakes then the latter turned and addressed wycherly with the manner of a superior  i should have met you with a reproof for this delay young gentleman he commenced did i not suspect from your appearance that something of moment has occurred to produce it had the mail passed the markettown before you reached it sir  it had not admiral oakes and i have the satisfaction of knowing that your despatches are now several hours on their way to london i reached the office just in season to see them mailed  humph on board the plantagenet it is the custom for an officer to report any important duty done as soon as it is in a condition to be thus laid before the superior  i presume that is the usage in all his majestys ships sir gervaise oakes but i have been taught that a proper discretion when it does not interfere with positive orders and sometimes when it does is a surer sign of a useful officer than even the most slavish attention to rules  that is a just distinction young gentleman though safer in the hands of a captain perhaps than in those of a lieutenant returned the viceadmiral glancing at his friend though he secretly admired the youths spirit discretion is a comparative term meaning different things with different persons may i presume to ask what mr wycherly wychecombe calls discretion in the present instance  you have every right sir to know and i only wanted your permission to tell my whole story while waiting to see the london mail start with your despatches and to rest my horse a postchaise arrived that was carrying a gentleman who is suspected of being a jacobite to his countryseat some thirty miles further west this gentleman held a secret conference with another person of the same way of thinking as himself and there was so much running and sending of messages that i could not avoid suspecting something was in the wind going to the stable to look after sir wycherlys hunter for i knew how much he values the animal i found one of the strangers servants in discourse with the ostler the latter told me when the chaise had gone that great tidings had reached exeter before the travellers quitted the town these tidings he described as news that charley was no longer over the water it was useless sir gervaise to question one so stupid and at the inn though all observed the manner of the traveller and his visiter no one could tell me any thing positive under the circumstances therefore i threw myself into the return chaise and went as far as fowey where i met the important intelligence that prince charles has actually landed and is at this moment up in scotland  the pretender is then really once more among us exclaimed sir gervaise like one who had half suspected the truth  not the pretender sir gervaise as i understand the news but his young son prince charles edward one much more likely to give the kingdom trouble the fact is certain i believe and as it struck me that it might be important to the commander of so fine a fleet as this which lies under wychecombe head to know it i lost no time in getting back with the intelligence  you have done well young gentleman and have proved that discretion is quite as useful and respectable in a lieutenant as it can possibly prove to be in a full admiral of the white go now and make yourself fit to take a seat by the side of one of the sweetest girls in england where i shall expect to see you in fifteen minutes well bluewater he continued as soon as the door closed on wycherly this is news of a certainty  it is indeed and i take it to be the news or connected with the news that you have sent to the first lord in the late despatches it has not taken you altogether by surprise if the truth were said  it has not i confess you know what excellent intelligence we have had the past season from the bordeaux agent he sent me off such proofs of this intended expedition that i thought it advisable to bring the fleet north on the strength of it that the ships might be used as the exigency should require  thank god it is a long way to scotland and it is not probable we can reach the coast of that country until all is over i wish we had inquired of this young man with what sort of and how large a naval force the prince was accompanied with shall i send for him that we may put the question  it is better that you remain passive admiral bluewater i now promise you that you shall learn all i hear and that under the circumstances i think ought to content you  the two admirals now separated though neither returned to the company for some little time the intelligence they had just learned was too important to be lightly received and each of these veteran seamen paced his room for near a quarter of an hour reflecting on what might be the probable consequences to the country and to himself sir gervaise oakes expected some event of this nature and was less taken by surprise than his friend still he viewed the crisis as exceedingly serious and as one likely to destroy the prosperity of the nation as well as the peace of families there was then in england as there is today and as there probably will be throughout all time two parties one of which clung to the past with its hereditary and exclusive privileges while the other looked more towards change for anticipated advantages and created honours religion in that age was made the stalkinghorse of politicians as is liberty on one side and order on the other in our own times and men just as blindly as vehemently and as regardlessly of principle submitted to party in the middle of the eighteenth century as we know they do in the middle of the nineteenth the mode of acting was a little changed and the watchwords and rallying points were not exactly the same it is true but in all that relates to ignorant confidence ferocious denunciation and selfishness but half concealed under the cloak of patriotism the england of the original whigs and tories was the england of conservatism and reform and the america of 1776 the america of 1841  still thousands always act in political struggles with the fairest intentions though they act in bitter opposition to each other when prejudice becomes the stimulant of ignorance no other result may be hoped for and the experience of the world in the management of human affairs has left the upright and intelligent but one conclusion as the reward of all the pains and penalties with which political revolutions have been effectedthe conviction that no institutions can be invented which a short working does not show will be perverted from their original intention by the ingenuity of those entrusted with power in a word the physical constitution of man does not more infallibly tend to decrepitude and imbecility imperiously requiring a new being and a new existence to fulfil the objects of his creation than the moral constitutions which are the fruits of his wisdom contain the seeds of abuses and decay that human selfishness will be as certain to cultivate as human indulgence is to aid the course of nature in hastening the approaches of death thus while on the one hand there exists the constant incentive of abuses and hopes to induce us to wish for modifications of the social structure on the other there stands the experience of ages to demonstrate their insufficiency to produce the happiness we aim at if the world advances in civilization and humanity it is because knowledge will produce its fruits in every soil and under every condition of cultivation and improvement  both sir gervaise oakes and admiral bluewater believed themselves to be purely governed by principles in submitting to the bias that each felt towards the conflicting claims of the houses of brunswick and stuart perhaps no two men in england were in fact less influenced by motives that they ought to feel ashamed to own and yet as has been seen while they thought so much alike on most other things on this they were diametrically opposed to each other during the many years of arduous and delicate duties that they had served together jealousy distrust and discontent had been equally strangers to their bosoms for each had ever felt the assurance that his own honour happiness and interests were as much ruling motives with his friend as they could well be with himself their lives had been constant scenes of mutual but unpretending kindnesses and this under circumstances that naturally awakened all the most generous and manly sentiments of their natures when young men their laughing messmates had nicknamed them pylades and orestes and later in life on account of their cruising so much in company they were generally known in the navy as the twin captains on several occasions had they fought enemies frigates and captured them on these occasions as a matter of course the senior of the two became most known to the nation but sir gervaise had made the most generous efforts to give his junior a full share of the credit while captain bluewater never spoke of the affairs without mentioning them as victories of the commodore in a word on all occasions and under all circumstances it appeared to be the aim of these generousminded and gallant seamen to serve each other nor was this attempted with any effort or striving for effect all that was said or done coming naturally and spontaneously from the heart but for the first time in their lives events had now occurred which threatened a jarring of the feelings between them if they did not lead to acts which must inevitably place them in open and declared hostility to each other no wonder then that both looked at the future with gloomy forebodings and a distrust which if it did not render them unhappy at least produced uneasiness     chapter vi      the circle formd we sit in silent state     like figures drawn upon a dialplate     yes maam and no maam uttered softly show     every five minutes how the minutes go           cowper   it is scarcely necessary to tell the reader that england as regarded material civilization was a very different country a hundred years since from what it is today we are writing of an age of heavy wagons coaches and six postchaises and four and not of an era of macadamroads or of cars flying along by steam a man may now post down to a countryhouse some sixty or eighty miles to dinner and this too by the aid of only a pair of horses but in 1745 such an engagement would have required at least a start on the previous day and in many parts of the island it would have been safer to have taken two days grace scotland was then farther from devonshire in effect than geneva is now and news travelled slowly and with the usual exaggerations and uncertainties of delay it was no wonder then that a jacobite who was posting off to his countryhousethe focus of an english landlords influence and authorityfilled with intelligence that had reached him through the activity of zealous political partisans preceded the more regular tidings of the mail by several hours the little that had escaped this individual or his servants rather for the gentleman was tolerably discreet himself confiding in only one or two particular friends at each relay had not got out to the world either very fully or very clearly wycherly had used intelligence in making his inquiries and he had observed an officers prudence in keeping his news for the ears of his superior alone when sir gervaise joined the party in the drawingroom therefore he saw that sir wycherly knew nothing of what had occurred at the north and he intended the glance which he directed at the lieutenant to convey a hearty approval of his discretion this forbearance did more to raise the young officer in the opinion of the practised and thoughtful admiral than the gallantry with which the youth had so recently purchased his commission for while many were brave few had the selfcommand and prudence under circumstances like the present that alone can make a man safe in the management of important public interests the approbation that sir gervaise felt and which he desired to manifest for wycherlys prudence was altogether a principle however since there existed no sufficient reason for keeping the secret from as confirmed a whig as his host on the contrary the sooner those opinions which both of them would be apt to term sound were promulgated in the neighbourhood the better it might prove for the good cause the viceadmiral therefore determined to communicate himself as soon as the party was seated at table the very secret which he so much commended the youth for keeping admiral bluewater joining the company at this instant sir wycherly led mrs dutton to the table no alteration had taken place among the guests except that sir gervaise wore the red riband a change in his dress that his friend considered to be openly hoisting the standard of the house of hanover  one would not think sir wycherly commenced the viceadmiral glancing his eyes around him as soon as all were sealed that this good company has taken its place at your hospitable table in the midst of a threatened civil war if not of an actual revolution  every hand was arrested and every eye turned towards the speaker even admiral bluewater earnestly regarding his friend anxious to know what would come next  i believe my household is in due subjection answered sir wycherly gazing to the right and left as if he expected to see his butler heading a revolt and i fancy the only change we shall see today will be the removal of the courses and the appearance of their successors  ay so says the hearty comfortable devonshire baronet while seated at his own board favoured by abundance and warm friends but it would seem the snake was only scotched not killed  sir gervaise oaken has grown figurative with his snakes and scotchings observed the rearadmiral a little drily  it is scotching as you say with so much emphasis bluewater i suppose sir wycherlyi suppose mr dutton and you my pretty young ladyi presume all of you have heard of such a person as the pretendersome of you may possibly have seen him  sir wycherly now dropt his knife and fork and sat gazing at the speaker in amazement to him the christian religion the liberties of the subjectmore especially of the baronet and lord of the manor who had four thousand a yearand the protestant succession all seemed to be in sudden danger  i always told my brother the judgemr baron wychecombe who is dead and gonethat what between the french that rogue the pope and the spurious offspring of king james ii we should yet see troublesome times in england and now sir my predictions are verified  not as to england yet my good sir of scotland i have not quite so good news to tell you as your namesake here brings us the tidings that the son of the pretender has landed in that kingdom and is rallying the clans he has come unattended by any frenchmen it would seem and has thrown himself altogether on the misguided nobles and followers of his house  tis at least a chivalrous and princely act exclaimed admiral bluewater  yesinasmuch as it is a heedless and mad one england is not to be conquered by a rabble of halfdressed scotchmen  true but england may be conquered by england notwithstanding  sir gervaise now chose to remain silent for never before had bluewater come so near betraying his political bias in the presence of third persons this pause enabled sir wycherly to find his voice  let me see tom said the baronet fifteen and ten are twentyfive and ten are thirty and ten are fortyfiveit is just thirty years since the jacobites were up before it would seem that half a human life is not sufficient to fill the cravings of a scotchmans maw for english gold  twice thirty years would hardly quell the promptings of a noble spirit when his notions of justice showed him the way to the english throne observed bluewater coolly for my part i like the spirit of this young prince for he who nobly dares nobly deserves what say you my beautiful neighbour  if you mean to address me sir by that compliment answered mildred modestly but with the emphasis that the gentlest of her sex are apt to use when they feel strongly i must be suffered to say that i hope every englishman will dare as nobly and deserve as well in defence of his liberties  comecome bluewater interrupted sir gervaise with a gravity that almost amounted to reproof i cannot permit such innuendoes before one so young and unpractised the young lady might really suppose that his majestys fleet was entrusted to men unworthy to enjoy his confidence by the cool way in which you carry on the joke i propose now sir wycherly that we eat our dinner in peace and say no more about this mad expedition until the cloth is drawn at least its a long road to scotland and there is little danger that this adventurer will find his way into devonshire before the nuts are placed before us  it would be nuts to us if he did sir gervaise put in tom wycherly laughing heartily at his own wit my uncle would enjoy nothing more than to see the spurious sovereign on his own estate here and in the hands of his own tenants i think sir that wychecombe and one or two of the adjoining manors would dispose of him  that might depend on circumstances the admiral answered a little drily these scots have such a thing as a claymore and are desperate fellows they tell me at a charge the very fact of arming a soldier with a short sword shows a most bloodyminded disposition  you forget sir gervaise that we have our cornish hug here in the west of england and i will put our fellows against any scotch regiment that ever charged an enemy  tom laughed again at his own allusion to a proverbial mode of grappling familiar to the adjoining county  this is all very well mr thomas wychecombe so long as devonshire is in the west of england and scotland lies north of the tweed sir wycherly might as well leave the matter in the hands of the duke and his regulars if it were only in the way of letting every man follow his own trade  it strikes me as so singularly insolent in a baseborn boy like this pretending to the english crown that i can barely speak of him with patience we all know that his father was a changeling and the son of a changeling can have no more right than the father himself i do not remember what the law terms such pretenders but i dare say it is something sufficiently odious  filius nullius thomas said sir wycherly with a little eagerness to show his learning thats the very phrase i have it from the first authority my late brother baron wychecombe giving it to me with his own mouth on an occasion that called for an understanding of such matters the judge was a most accurate lawyer particularly in all that related to names and ill engage if he were living at this moment he would tell you the legal appellation of a changeling ought to be filius nullius  in spite of his native impudence and an innate determination to make his way in the world without much regard to truth tom wychecombe felt his cheek burn so much at this innocent allusion of his reputed uncle that he was actually obliged to turn away his face in order to conceal his confusion had any moral delinquency of his own been implicated in the remark he might have found means to steel himself against its consequences but as is only too often the case he was far more ashamed of a misfortune over which he had no possible control than he would have been of a crime for which he was strictly responsible in morals sir gervaise smiled at sir wycherlys knowledge of law terms not to say of latin and turning goodhumouredly to his friend the rearadmiral anxious to reestablish friendly relations with him he said with wellconcealed irony  sir wycherly must be right bluewater a changeling is nobodythat is to say he is not the body he pretends to be which is substantially being nobodyand the son of nobody is clearly a filius nullius and now having settled what may be called the law of the case i demand a truce until we get our nutsfor as to mr thomas wychecombes having his nut to crack at least today i take it there are too many loyal subjects in the north  when men know each other as well as was the case with our two admirals there are a thousand secret means of annoyance as well as of establishing amity admiral bluewater was well aware that sir gervaise was greatly superior to the vulgar whig notion of the day which believed in the fabricated tale of the pretenders spurious birth and the secret and ironical allusion he had made to his impression on that subject acted as oil to his own chafed spirit disposing him to moderation this had been the intention of the other and the smiles they exchanged sufficiently proved that their usual mental intercourse was temporarily restored at least  deference to his guests made sir wycherly consent to change the subject though he was a little mystified with the obvious reluctance of the two admirals to speak of an enterprise that ought to be uppermost according to his notion of the matter in every englishmans mind tom had received a rebuke that kept him silent during the rest of the dinner while the others were content to eat and drink as if nothing had happened  it is seldom that a party takes its seat at table without some secret manoeuvring as to the neighbourhood when the claims of rank and character do not interfere with personal wishes sir wycherly had placed sir gervaise on his right and mrs dutton on his left but admiral bluewater had escaped from his control and taken his seat next to mildred who had been placed by tom wychecombe close to himself at the foot of the table wycherly occupied the seat opposite and this compelled dutton and mr rotherham the vicar to fill the other two chairs the good baronet had made a wry face at seeing a rearadmiral so unworthily bestowed but sir gervaise assuring him that his friend was never so happy as when in the service of beauty he was fain to submit to the arrangement  that admiral bluewater was struck with mildreds beauty and pleased with her natural and feminine manner one altogether superior to what might have been expected from her station in life was very apparent to all at table though it was quite impossible to mistake his parental and frank air for any other admiration than that which was suitable to the difference in years and in unison with their respective conditions and experience mrs dutton so far from taking the alarm at the rearadmirals attentions felt gratification in observing them and perhaps she experienced a secret pride in the consciousness of their being so well merited it has been said already that she was herself the daughter of a landsteward of a nobleman in an adjoining county but it may be well to add here that she had been so great a favourite with the daughters of her fathers employer as to have been admitted in a measure to their society and to have enjoyed some of the advantages of their education lady wilmeter the mother of the young ladies to whom she was admitted as a sort of humble companion had formed the opinion it might be an advantage to the girl to educate her for a governess little conceiving in her own situation that she was preparing a course of life for martha ray for such was mrs duttons maiden name that was perhaps the least enviable of all the careers that a virtuous and intelligent female can run this was as education and governesses were appreciated a century ago the world with all its faults and sophisms having unquestionably made a vast stride towards real civilization and moral truths in a thousand important interests since that time nevertheless the education was received together with a good many tastes and sentiments and opinions which it may well be questioned whether they contributed most to the happiness or unhappiness of the pupil in her future life frank dutton then a handsome though far from polished young sealieutenant interfered with the arrangement by making martha ray his wife when she was twoandtwenty this match was suitable in all respects with the important exception of the educations and characters of the parties still as a woman may well be more refined and in some things even more intelligent than her husband and as sailors in the commencement of the eighteenth century formed a class of society much more distinct than they do today there would have been nothing absolutely incompatible with the future wellbeing of the young couple had each pursued his or her own career in a manner suitable to their respective duties young dutton took away his bride with the two thousand pounds she had received from her father and for a long time he was seen no more in his native county after an absence of some twenty years however he returned broken in constitution and degraded in rank mrs dutton brought with her one child the beautiful girl introduced to the reader and to whom she was studiously imparting all she had herself acquired in the adventitious manner mentioned such were the means by which mildred like her mother had been educated above her condition in life and it had been remarked that though mrs dutton had probably no cause to felicitate herself on the possession of manners and sentiments that met with so little sympathy or appreciation in her actual situation she assiduously cultivated the same manners and opinions in her daughter frequently manifesting a sort of sickly fastidiousness on the subject of mildreds deportment and tastes it is probable the girl owed her improvement in both however more to the circumstance of her being left so much alone with her mother than to any positive lessons she received the influence of example for years producing its usual effects  no one in wychecombe positively knew the history of duttons professional degradation he had never risen higher than to be a lieutenant and from this station he had fallen by the sentence of a courtmartial his restoration to the service in the humbler and almost hopeless rank of a master was believed to have been brought about by mrs duttons influence with the present lord wilmeter who was the brother of her youthful companions that the husband had wasted his means was as certain as that his habits on the score of temperance at least were bad and that his wife if not positively brokenhearted was an unhappy woman one to be pitied and admired sir wycherly was little addicted to analysis but he could not fail to discover the superiority of the wife and daughter over the husband and father and it is due to his young namesake to add that his obvious admiration of mildred was quite as much owing to her mind deportment character and tastes as to her exceeding personal charms  this little digression may perhaps in the readers eyes excuse the interest admiral bluewater took in our heroine with the indulgence of years and station and the tact of a man of the world he succeeded in drawing mildred out without alarming her timidity and he was surprised at discovering the delicacy of her sentiments and the accuracy of her knowledge he was too conversant with society and had too much good taste to make any deliberate parade of opinions but in the quiet manner that is so easy to those who are accustomed to deal with truths and tastes as familiar things he succeeded in inducing her to answer his own remarks to sympathize with his feelings to laugh when he laughed and to assume a look of disapproval when he felt that disapprobation was just to all this wycherly was a delighted witness and in some respects he participated in the conversation for there was evidently no wish on the part of the rearadmiral to monopolize his beautiful companion to himself perhaps the position of the young man directly opposite to her aided in inducing mildred to bestow so many grateful looks and sweet smiles on the older officer for she could not glance across the table without meeting the admiring gaze of wycherly fastened on her own blushing face  it is certain if our heroine did not during this repast make a conquest of admiral bluewater in the ordinary meaning of the term that she made him a friend sir gervaise even was struck with the singular and devoted manner in which his old messmate gave all his attention to the beautiful girl at his side and once or twice he caught himself conjecturing whether it were possible that one as practised as sensible and as much accustomed to the beauties of the court as bluewater had actually been caught by the pretty face of a country girl when so well turned of fifty himself then discarding the notion as preposterous he gave his attention to the discourse of sir wycherly a dissertation on rabbits and rabbitwarrens in this manner the dinner passed away  mrs dutton asked her hosts permission to retire with her daughter at the earliest moment permitted by propriety in quitting the room she cast an anxious glance at the face of her husband which was already becoming flushed with his frequent applications of port and spite of an effort to look smiling and cheerful her lips quivered and by the time she and mildred reached the drawingroom tears were fast falling down her cheeks no explanation was asked or needed by the daughter who threw herself into her mothers arms and for several minutes they wept together in silence never had mrs dutton spoken even to mildred of the besetting and degrading vice of her husband but it had been impossible to conceal its painful consequences from the world much less from one who lived in the bosom of her family on that failing which the wife treated so tenderly the daughter of course could not touch but the silent communion of tears had got to be so sweet to both that within the last year it was of very frequent occurrence  really mildred said the mother at length after having succeeded in suppressing her emotion and in drying her eyes while she smiled fondly in the face of the lovely and affectionate girl this admiral bluewater is getting to be so particular i hardly know how to treat the matter  oh mother he is a delightful old gentleman and he is so gentle while he is so frank that he wins your confidence almost before you know it i wonder if he could have been serious in what he said about the noble daring and noble deserving of prince edward  that must pass for trifling of course the ministry would scarcely employ any but a true whig in command of a fleet i saw several of his family when a girl and have always heard them spoken of with esteem and respect lord bluewater this gentlemans cousin was very intimate with the present lord wilmeter and was often at the castle i remember to have heard that he had a disappointment in love when quite a young man and that he has ever since been considered a confirmed bachelor so you will take heed my love  the warning was unnecessary dear mother returned mildred laughing i could dote on the admiral as a father but must be excused from considering him young enough for a nearer tie  and yet he has the much admired profession mildred said the mother smiling fondly and yet a little archly i have often heard you speak of your passion for the sea  that was formerly mother when i spoke as a sailors daughter and as girls are apt to speak without much reflection i do not know that i think better of a seamans profession now than i do of any other i fear there is often much misery in store for soldiers and sailors wives  mrs duttons lip quivered again but hearing a foot at the door she made an effort to be composed just as admiral bluewater entered  i have run away from the bottle mrs dutton to join you and your fair daughter as i would run from an enemy of twice my force he said giving each lady a hand in a manner so friendly as to render the act more than gracious for it was kind oakes is bowsing out his jib with his brother baronet as we sailors say and i have hauled out of the line without a signal  i hope sir gervaise oakes does not consider it necessary to drink more wine than is good for the mind and body observed mrs dutton with a haste that she immediately regretted  not he gervaise oakes is as discreet a man in all that relates to the table as an anchorite and yet he has a faculty of seeming to drink that makes him a boon companion for a fourbottle man how the deuce he does it is more than i can tell you but he does it so well that he does not more thoroughly get the better of the kings enemies on the high seas than he floors his friends under the table sir wycherly has begun his libations in honour of the house of hanover and they will be likely to make a long sitting  mrs dutton sighed and walked away to a window to conceal the paleness of her cheeks admiral bluewater though perfectly abstemious himself regarded license with the bottle after dinner like most men of that age as a very venial weakness and he quietly took a seat by the side of mildred and began to converse  i hope young lady as a sailors child you feel an hereditary indulgence for a seamans gossip he said we who are so much shut up in our ships have a poverty of ideas on most subjects and as to always talking of the winds and waves that would fatigue even a poet  as a sailors daughter i honour my fathers calling sir and as an english girl i venerate the brave defenders of the island nor do i know that seamen have less to say than other men  i am glad to hear you confess this forshall i be frank with you and take a liberty that would better become a friend of a dozen years than an acquaintance of a dayand yet i know not why it is so my dear child but i feel as if i had long known you though i am certain we never met before  perhaps sir it is an omen that we are long to know each other in future said mildred with the winning confidence of unsuspecting and innocent girlhood i hope you will use no reserve  well then at the risk of making a sad blunder i will just say that my nephew tom is any thing but a prepossessing youth and that i hope all eyes regard him exactly as he appears to a sailor of fiftyfive  i cannot answer for more than those of a girl of nineteen admiral bluewater said mildred laughing but for her i think i may say that she does not look on him as either an adonis or a crichton  upon my soul i am right glad to hear this for the fellow has accidental advantages enough to render him formidable he is the heir to the baronetcy and this estate i believe  i presume he is sir wycherly has no other nephewor at least this is the eldest of three brothers i am toldand being childless himself it must be so my father tells me sir wycherly speaks of mr thomas wychecombe as his future heir  your fatheray fathers look on these matters with eyes very different from their daughters  there is one thing about seamen that renders them at least safe acquaintances said mildred smiling i mean their frankness  that is a failing of mine as i have heard but you will pardon an indiscretion that arises in the interest i feel in yourself the eldest of three brothersis the lieutenant then a younger son  he does not belong to the family at all i believe mildred answered colouring slightly in spite of a resolute determination to appear unconcerned mr wycherly wychecombe is no relative of our host i hear though he bears both of his names he is from the colonies born in virginia  he is a noble and a noblelooking fellow were i the baronet i would break the entail rather than the acres should go to that sinisterlooking nephew and bestow them on the namesake from virginia and not even a relative at all  that is what mr thomas wychecombe says and even sir wycherly confirms it i have never heard mr wycherly wychecombe speak on the subject himself  a weakness of poor human nature the lad finds an honourable ancient and affluent family here and has not the courage to declare his want of affinity to it happening to bear the same name  mildred hesitated about replying but a generous feeling got the better of her diffidence i have never seen any thing in the conduct of mr wycherly wychecombe to induce me to think that he feels any such weakness she said earnestly he seems rather to take pride in than to feel ashamed of his being a colonial and you know we in england hardly look on the people of the colonies as our equals  and have you young lady any of that overweening prejudice in favour of your own island  i hope not but i think most persons have mr wycherly wychecombe admits that virginia is inferior to england in a thousand things and yet he seems to take pride in his birthplace  every sentiment of this nature is to be traced to self we know that the fact is irretrievable and struggle to be proud of what we cannot help the turk will tell you he has the honour to be a native of stamboul the parisian will boast of his faubourg and the cockney exults in wapping personal conceit lies at the bottom of all for we fancy that places to which we belong are not places to be ashamed of  and yet i do not think mr wycherly at all remarkable for conceit on the contrary he is rather diffident and unassuming  this was said simply but so sincerely as to induce the listener to fasten his penetrating blue eye on the speaker who now first took the alarm and felt that she might have said too much at this moment the two young men entered and a servant appeared to request that admiral bluewater would do sir gervaise oakes the favour to join him in the dressingroom of the latter  tom wychecombe reported the condition of the dinnertable to be such as to render it desirable for all but three and fourbottle men to retire hanoverian toasts and sentiments were in the ascendant and there was every appearance that those who remained intended to make a night of it this was sad intelligence for mrs dutton who had come forward eagerly to hear the report but who now returned to the window apparently irresolute as to the course she ought to take as both the young men remained near mildred she had sufficient opportunity to come to her decision without interruption or hindrance     chapter vii                somewhat we will do     and look when i am king claim thou of me     the earldom of hereford and all the moveables     whereof the king my brother was possessed           richard iii   rearadmiral bluewater found sir gervaise oakes pacing a large dressingroom quarterdeck fashion with as much zeal as if just released from a long sitting on official duty in his own cabin as the two officers were perfectly familiar with each others personal habits neither deviated from his particular mode of indulging his ease but the last comer quietly took his seat in a large chair disposing of his person in a way to show he intended to consult his comfort let what would happen  bluewater commenced sir gervaise this is a very foolish affair of the pretenders son and can only lead to his destruction i look upon it as altogether unfortunate  that as it may terminate no man can tell what a day or an hour may bring forth i am sure such a rising was one of the last things i have been anticipating down yonder in the bay of biscay  i wish with all my heart we had never left it muttered sir gervaise so low that his companion did not hear him then he added in a louder tone our duty however is very simple we have only to obey orders and it seems that the young man has no naval force to sustain him we shall probably be sent to watch brest or lorient or some other port monsieur must be kept in let what will happen  i rather think it would be better to let him out our chances on the high seas being at least as good as his own i am no friend to blockades which strike me as an unenglish mode of carrying on a war  you are right enough dick in the main returned sir gervaise laughing  ay and on the main oakes i sincerely hope the first lord will not send a man like you who are every way so capable of giving an account of your enemy with plenty of searoom on duly so scurvy as a blockade  a man like me why a man like me in particular i trust i am to have the pleasure of admiral bluewaters company advice and assistance  an inferior never can know sir gervaise where it may suit the pleasure of his superiors to order him  that distinction of superior and inferior bluewater will one day lead you into a confounded scrape i fear if you consider charles stuart your sovereign it is not probable that orders issued by a servant of king george will be much respected i hope you will do nothing hastily or without consulting your oldest and truest friend  you know my sentiments and there is little use in dwelling on them now so long as the quarrel was between my own country and a foreign land i have been content to serve but when my lawful prince or his son and heir comes in this gallant and chivalrous manner throwing himself as it might be into the very arms of his subjects confiding all to their loyalty and spirit it makes such an appeal to every nobler feeling that the heart finds it difficult to repulse i could have joined norris with right good will in dispersing and destroying the armament that louis xv was sending against us in this very cause but here every thing is english and englishmen have the quarrel entirely to themselves i do not see how as a loyal subject of my hereditary prince i can well refrain from joining his standard  and would you dick bluewater who to my certain knowledge were sent on board ship at twelve years of age and who for more than forty years have been a manofwarsman body and soul would you now strip your old hulk of the seablue that has so long covered and become it rig yourself out like a soldier with a feather in your hatay de and a campkettle on your arm and follow a drummer like one of your kinsmen lord bluewaters fellows of the guardsfor of sailors your lawful prince as you call him hasnt enough to stopper his conscience or to whip the tail of his coat to keep it from being torn to tatters by the heather of scotland if you do follow the adventurer it must be in some such character since i question if he can muster a seaman to tell him the bearings of london from perth  when i join him he will be better off  and what could even you do alone among a parcel of scotchmen running about their hills under bare poles your signals will not manoeuvre regiments and as for manoeuvring in any other manner you know nothing nono stay where you are and help an old friend with knowledge that is useful to himi should be afraid to do a dashing thing unless i felt the certainty of having you in my van to strike the first blow or in my rear to bring me off handsomely  you would be afraid of nothing gervaise oakes whether i stood at your elbow or were off in scotland fear is not your failing though temerity may be  then i want your presence to keep me within the bounds of reason said sir gervaise stopping short in his walk and looking his friend smilingly in the face in some mode or other i always need your aid  i understand the meaning of your words sir gervaise and appreciate the feeling that dictates them you must have a perfect conviction that i will do nothing hastily and that i will betray no trust when i turn my back on king george it will be loyalty in one sense whatever he may think of it in another and when i join prince charles edward it will be with a conscience that he need not be ashamed to probe what names he bears they are the designations of ancient english sovereigns and ought of themselves to awaken the sensibilities of englishmen  ay charles in particular returned the viceadmiral with something like a sneer theres the second charles for instancest charles as our good host sir wycherly might call himhe is a pattern prince for englishmen to admire then his father was of the school of the starchamber martyrs  both were lineal descendants of the conqueror and of the saxon princes and both united the double titles to the throne in their sacred persons i have always considered charles ii as the victim of the rebellious conduct of his subjects rather than vicious he was driven abroad into a most corrupt state of society and was perverted by our wickedness as to the father he was the real st charles and a martyred saint he was dying for true religion as well as for his legal rights then the edwardsglorious fellowsremember that they were all but one plantagenets a name of itself to rouse an englishmans fire  and yet the only difference between the right of these very plantagenets to the throne and that of the reigning prince is that one produced a revolution by the strong hand and the other was produced by a revolution that came from the nation i do not know that your plantagenets ever did any thing for a navy the only real source of englands power and glory de dick if i think so much of your plantagenets after all  and yet the name of oakes is to be met with among their bravest knights and most faithful followers  the oakes like the pines have been timbers in every ship that has floated returned the viceadmiral halfunconscious himself of the pun he was making  for more than a minute sir gervaise continued his walk his head a little inclined forward like a man who pondered deeply on some matter of interest then suddenly stopping he turned towards his friend whom he regarded for near another minute ere he resumed the discourse  i wish i could fairly get you to exercise your excellent reason on this matter dick he said after the pause then i should be certain of having secured you on the side of liberty  admiral bluewater merely shook his head but he continued silent as if he deemed discussion altogether supererogatory during this pause a gentle tap at the door announced a visiter and at the request to enter atwood made his appearance he held in his hand a large package which bore on the envelope the usual stamp that indicated it was sent on public service  i beg pardon sir gervaise commenced the secretary who always proceeded at once to business when business was to be done but his majestys service will not admit of delay this packet has just come to hand by the arrival of an express which left the admiralty only yesterday noon  and how the devil did he know where to find me exclaimed the viceadmiral holding out a hand to receive the communication  it is all owing to this young lieutenants forethought in following up the jacobite intelligence to a markettown the courier was bound to falmouth as fast as posthorses could carry him when he heard luckily that the fleet lay at anchor under wychecombe head and quite as luckily he is an officer who had the intelligence to know that you would sooner get the despatches if he turned aside and came hither by land than if he went on to falmouth got aboard the sloop that was to sail with him for the bay of biscay and came round here by water  sir gervaise smiled at this sally which was one in keeping with all atwoods feelings for the secretary had matured a system of expresses which to his great mortification his patron laughed at and the admiralty entirely overlooked no time was lost however in the way of business the secretary having placed the candles on a table where sir gervaise took a chair and had already broken a seal the process of reading nevertheless was suddenly interrupted by the viceadmirals looking up and exclaiming  why you are not about to leave us bluewater  you may have private business with mr atwood sir gervaise and perhaps i had better retire  now it so happened that while sir gervaise oakes had never by look or syllable as he confidently believed betrayed the secret of his friends jacobite propensities atwood was perfectly aware of their existence nor had the latter obtained his knowledge by any unworthy means he had been neither an eavesdropper nor an inquirer into private communications as so often happens around the persons of men in high trusts all his knowledge having been obtained through native sagacity and unavoidable opportunities on the present occasion the secretary with the tact of a man of experience felt that his presence might be dispensed with and he cut short the discussion between the two admirals by a very timely remark of his own  i have left the letters uncopied sir gervaise he said and will go and finish them a message by lockerthis was sir gervaises bodyservantwill bring me back at a moments notice should you need me again tonight  that atwood has a surprising instinct for a scotchman exclaimed the viceadmiral as soon as the door was closed on the secretary he not only knows when he is wanted but when he is not wanted the last is an extraordinary attainment for one of his nation  and one that an englishman may do well to emulate returned bluewater it is possible my company may be dispensed with also just at this important moment  you are not so much afraid of the hanoverians dick as to run away from their handwriting are ye hawhats thisas i live a packet for yourself and directed to rearadmiral sir richard bluewater kb by the lord my old boy theyve given you the red riband at last this is an honour well earned and which may be fitly worn  tis rather unexpected i must own the letter however cannot be addressed to me as i am not a knight of the bath  this is rank nonsense open the packet at once or i will do it for you are there two dick bluewaters in the world or another rearadmiral of the same name  i would rather not receive a letter that does not strictly bear my address returned the other coldly  as ill be sworn this does but hand it to me since you are so scrupulous and i will do that small service for you  as this was said sir gervaise tore aside the seals and as he proceeded rather summarily a red riband was soon uncased and fell upon the carpet the other usual insignia of the bath made their appearance and a letter was found among them to explain the meaning of all every thing was in due form and went to acquaint rearadmiral bluewater that his majesty had been graciously pleased to confer on him one of the vacant red ribands of the day as a reward for his eminent services on different occasions there was even a short communication from the premier expressing the great satisfaction of the ministry in thus being able to second the royal pleasure with hearty good will  well what do you think of that richard bluewater asked sir gervaise triumphantly did i not always tell you that sooner or later it must come  it has come too late then coldly returned the other laying the riband jewels and letters quietly on the table this is an honour i can receive now only from my rightful prince none other can legally create a knight of the bath  and pray mr richard bluewater who made you a captain a commander a rearadmiral do you believe me an impostor because i wear this riband on authority no better than that of the house of hanover am i or am i not in your judgment a viceadmiral of the red  i make a great distinction oakes between rank in the navy and a mere personal dignity in the one case you serve your country and give quite as much as you receive whereas in the other it is a grace to confer consideration on the person honoured without such an equivalent as can find an apology for accepting a rank illegally conferred  the devil take your distinctions which would unsettle every thing and render the service a babel if i am a viceadmiral of the red i am a knight of the bath and if you are a rearadmiral of the white you are also a knight of that honourable order all comes from the same source of authority and the same fountain of honour  i do not view it thus our commissions are from the admiralty which represents the country but dignities come from the prince who happens to reign let his title be what it may  do you happen to think richard iii a usurper or a lawful prince  a usurper out of all question and a murderer to boot his name should be struck from the list of english kings i never hear it without execrating him and his deeds  poohpooh dick this is talking more like a poet than a seaman if only onehalf the sovereigns who deserve to be execrated had their names erased the list of even our english kings would be rather short and some countries would be without historical kings at all however much richard iii may deserve cashiering in this summary manner his peers and laws are just as good as any other princes peers and laws witness the duke of norfolk for instance  ay that cannot be helped by me but it is in my power to prevent richard bluewaters being made a knight or the bath by george ii and the power shall be used  it would seem not as he is already created and i dare to say gazetted  the oaths are not yet taken and it is at least an englishmans birthright to decline an honour if indeed this can be esteemed an honour at all  upon my word rearadmiral sir richard bluewater you are disposed to be complimentary tonight the unworthy knight present and all the rest of the order are infinitely indebted to you  your case and mine oakes are essentially different returned the other with some emotion in his voice and manner your riband was fairly won fighting the battles of england and can be worn with credit to yourself and to your country but these baubles are sent to me at a moment when a rising was foreseen and as a sop to keep me in goodhumour as well as to propitiate the whole bluewater interest  that is pure conjecture and i dare say will prove to be altogether a mistake here are the despatches to speak for themselves and as it is scarcely possible that the ministry should have known of this rash movement of the pretenders son more than a few days my life on it the dates will show that your riband was bestowed before the enterprise was even suspected  as sir gervaise commenced with his constitutional ardour to turn over the letters as soon as his mind was directed to this particular object admiral bluewater resumed his seat awaiting the result with not a little curiosity though at the same time with a smile of incredulity the examination disappointed sir gervaise oakes the dates proved that the ministers were better informed than he had supposed for it appeared they had been apprised about the time he was himself of the intended movement his orders were to bring the fleet north and in substance to do the very thing his own sagacity had dictated so far every thing was well and he could not entertain a doubt about receiving the hearty approbation of his superiors for the course he had taken but here his gratification ended for on looking at the dates of the different communications it was evident that the red riband was bestowed after the intelligence of the pretenders movement had reached london a private letter from a friend at the board of admiralty too spoke of his own probable promotion to the rank of admiral of the blue and mentioned several other similar preferments in a way to show that the government was fortifying itself in the present crisis as much as possible by favours this was a politic mode of procedure with ordinary men it is true but with officers of the elevation of mind and of the independence of character of our two admirals it was most likely to produce disgust  dn em dick cried sir gervaise as he threw down the last letter of the package with no little sign of feeling you might take st paul or even wychecombes dead brother st james the less and put him at court and he would come out a thorough blackguard in a week  that is not the common opinion concerning a court education quietly replied the friend most people fancying that the place gives refinement of manners if not of sentiment  pohpohyou and i have no need of a dictionary to understand each other i call a man who never trusts to a generous motivewho thinks it always necessary to bribe or cajolewho has no idea of any things being done without its direct quid pro quo a scurvy blackguard though he has the airs and graces of phil stanhope or chesterfield as he is now what do you think those chaps at the board talk of doing by way of clinching my loyalty at this blessed juncture  no doubt to get you raised to the peerage i see nothing so much out of the way in the thing you are of one of the oldest families of england and the sixth baronet by inheritance and have a noble landed estate which is none the worse for prizemoney sir gervaise oakes of bowldero would make a very suitable lord bowldero  if it were only that i shouldnt mind it for nothing is easier than to refuse a peerage ive done that twice already and can do it a third time at need but one cant very well refuse promotion in his regular profession and here just as a true gentleman would depend on the principles of an officer the hackneyed consciences of your courtiers have suggested the expediency of making gervaise oakes an admiral of the blue by way of sopme who was made viceadmiral of the red only six months since and who take an honest pride in boasting that every commission from the lowest to the highest has been fairly earned in battle  they think it a more delicate service perhaps for a gentleman to be true to the reigning house when so loud an appeal is made to his natural loyalty and therefore class the selfconquest with a victory at sea  they are so many courtlubbers and i should like to have an opportunity of speaking my mind to them ill not take the new commission for every one must see dick that it is a sop  ay thats just my notion too about the red riband and ill not take that you have had the riband these ten years have declined the peerage twice and their only chance is the promotion take it you ought and must however as it will be the means of pushing on some four or five poor devils who have been wedged up to honours in this manner ever since they were captains i am glad they do not talk of promoting me for i should hardly know how to refuse such a grace there is great virtue in parchment with all us military men  still it must be parchment fairly won i think you are wrong notwithstanding bluewater in talking of refusing the riband which is so justly your due for a dozen different acts there is not a man in the service who has been less rewarded for what he has done than yourself  i am sorry to hear you give this as your opinion for just at this moment i would rather think that i have no cause of complaint in this way against the reigning family or its ministers im sure i was posted when quite a young man and since that time no one has been lifted over my head  the viceadmiral looked intently at his friend for never before had he detected a feeling which betrayed as he fancied so settled a determination in him to quit the service of the powers that were acquainted from boyhood with all the workings of the others mind he perceived that the rearadmiral had been endeavouring to persuade himself that no selfish or unworthy motive could be assigned to an act which he felt to proceed from disinterested chivalry just as he himself broke out with his expression of an opinion that no officer had been less liberally rewarded for his professional services than his friend while there is no greater mystery to a selfish manager than a man of disinterested temperament they who feel and submit to generous impulses understand each other with an instinctive facility when any particular individual is prone to believe that there is a predominance of good over evil in the world he inhabits it is a sign of inexperience or of imbecility but when one acts and reasons as if all honour and virtue are extinct he furnishes the best possible argument against his own tendencies and character it has often been remarked that stronger friendships are made between those who have different personal peculiarities than between those whose sameness of feeling and impulses would be less likely to keep interest alive but in all cases of intimacies there must be great identity of principles and even of tastes in matters at all connected with motives in order to ensure respect among those whose standard of opinion is higher than common or sympathy among those with whom it is lower such was the fact as respected admirals oakes and bluewater no two men could be less alike in temperament or character physically and in some senses morally considered but when it came to principles or all those tastes or feelings that are allied to principles there was a strong native as well as acquired affinity this union of sentiment was increased by common habits and professional careers so long and so closely united as to be almost identical nothing was easier consequently than for sir gervaise oakes to comprehend the workings of admiral bluewaters mind as the latter endeavoured to believe he had been fairly treated by the existing government of course the reasoning which passed through the thoughts of sir gervaise on this occasion required much less time than we have taken to explain its nature and after regarding his friend intently as already related for a few seconds he answered as follows a good deal influenced unwittingly to himself with the wish to check the others jacobite propensities  i am sorry not to be able to agree with you dick he said with some warmth so far from thinking you well treated by any ministry these twenty years i think you have been very ill treated your rank you have beyond a question for of that no brave officer can well be deprived in a regulated service but have you had the commands to which you are entitledi was a commanderinchief when only a rearadmiral of the blue and then how long did i wear a broad pennant before i got a flag at all  you forget how much i have been with you when two serve together one must command and the other must obey so far from complaining of these hanoverian boards and first lords it seems to me that they have always kept in view the hollowness of their claims to the throne and have felt a desire to purchase honest men by their favours  you are the strangest fellow dick bluewater it has ever been my lot to fall in with de me if i believe you know always when you are ill treated there are a dozen men in service who have had separate commands and who are not half as well entitled to them as you are yourself  come come oakes this is getting to be puerile for two old fellows turned of fifty you very well know that i was offered just as good a fleet as this of your own with a choice of the whole list of flagofficers below me to pick a junior from and so well say no more about it as respects their red riband however it may go abegging for me  sir gervaise was about to answer in his former vein when a tap at the door announced the presence of another visiter this time the door opened on the person of galleygo who had been included in sir wycherlys hospitable plan of entertaining every soul who immediately belonged to the suite of sir gervaise  what the dl has brought you here exclaimed the viceadmiral a little warmly for he did not relish an interruption just at this moment recollect youre not on board the plantagenet but in the dwelling of a gentleman where there are both butler and housekeeper and who have no occasion for your advice or authority to keep things in order  well there sir gervaise i doesnt agree with you the least bit for i thinks as a ships stewardi mean a cabin steward and a good un of the qualitymight do a great deal of improvement in this very house the cook and i has had a particlar dialogue on them matters already and i mentioned to her the names of seven different dishes every one of which she quite as good as admitted to me was just the same as so much gospel to her  i shall have to quarantine this fellow in the long run bluewater i do believe if i were to take him to lambeth palace or even to st jamess hed thrust his oar into the archbishops benedictions or the queens caudlecup  well sir gervaise where would be the great harm if i did a man as knows the use of an oar may be trusted with one even in a church or an abbey when your honour comes to hear what the dishes was as sir wycherlys cook had never heard on youll think it as great a curosity as i do myself if i had just leave to name em over i think as both you gentlemen would look at it as remarkable  what are they galleygo inquired bluewater putting one of his long legs over an arm of the adjoining chair in order to indulge himself in a yarn with his friends steward with greater freedom for he greatly delighted in galleygos peculiarities seeing just enough of the fellow to find amusement without annoyance in them ill answer for sir gervaise who is always a little diffident about boasting of the superiority of a ship over a house  yes your honour that he isthat is just one of sir jarvys weak pints as a body might say now i never goes ashore without trimming sharp up and luffing athwart every persons hawse i fall in with which is as much as to tell em i belongs to a flagship and a racer and a craft as hasnt her equal on saltwater no disparagement to the bit of bunting at the mizzentopgallantmasthead of the c√¶sar or to the ship that carries it i hopes as we are so well acquainted admiral bluewater no offence will be taken  where none is meant none ought to be taken my friend now let us hear your billoffare  well sir the very first dish i mentioned to mrs larder sir wycherlys cook was lobscous and would you believe it gentlemen the poor woman had never heard of it i began with a light hand as it might be just not to overwhelm her with knowledge at a blow as sir jarvy captivated the french frigate with the upper tier of guns that he might take her alive like  and the lady knew nothing of a lobscousneither of its essence nor nature  theres no essences as is ever put in a lobscous besides potaties admiral bluewater thof we make em in the old planternautice for plantagenetin so liquorish a fashion you might well think they even had jamaiky in em no potaties is the essence of lobscous and a very good thing is a potatie sir jarvy when a ships company has been on salted oakum for a few months  well what was the next dish the good woman broke down under asked the rearadmiral fearful the master might order the servant to quit the room while he himself was anxious to get rid of any further political discussion  well sir she knowed no more of a chowder than if the sea wernt in the neighbourhood and there wernt such a thing as a fish in all england when i talked to her of a chowder she gave in like a spaniard at the fourth or fifth broadside  such ignorance is disgraceful and betokens a decline in civilization but you hoisted out more knowledge for her benefit galleygosmall doses of learning are poor things  yes your honour just like weak grogburning the priming without starting the shot to be sure i did admiral blue i just named to her burgoo and then i mentioned duff anglice dough to her but she denied that there was any such things in the cookerybook do you know sir jarvy as these here shore craft get their dinners as our master gets the sun all out of a book as it might be awful tidings too gentlemen about the pretenders son and i spose we shall have to take the fleet up into scotland as i fancy them ere sogers will not make much of a hand in settling law  and have you honoured us with a visit just to give us an essay on dishes and to tell us what you intend to do with the fleet demanded sir gervaise a little more sternly than he was accustomed to speak to the steward  lord bless you sir jarvy i didnt dream of one or tother as for telling you or admiral blue so the seamen used to call the second in rank here any thing about lobscous or chowder why it would be carrying coals to new market ive fed ye both with all such articles when ye was nothing but young gentlemen and when you was no longer young gentlemen too but a couple of sprightly luffs of nineteen and as for moving the fleet i know well enough that will never happen without our talking it over in the old planters cabin which is a much more natral place for such a discourse than any house in england  may i take the liberty of inquiring then what did bring you here  that you may with all my heart sir jarvy for i likes to answer your questions my errand is not to your honour this time though you are my master its no great matter after all being just to hand this bit of a letter over to admiral blue  and where did this letter come from and how did it happen to fall into your hands demanded bluewater looking at the superscription the writing of which he appeared to recognise  it hails from lunnun i hear and they tell me its to be a great secret that youve got it at all the history of the matter is just this an officer got in tonight with orders for us carrying sail as hard as his shay would bear it seems he fell in with master atwood as he made his landfall and being acquainted with that gentleman he just whipped out his orders and sent em off to the right man then he laid his course for the landing wishing to get aboard of the dublin to which he is ordered but falling in with our barge as i landed he wanted to know the whereaway of admiral blue here believing him to be afloat some un telling him as i was a friend and servant of both admirals as it might be he turned himself over to me for advice so i promised to deliver the letter as i had a thousand afore and knowed the way of doing such things and he gives me the letter under special orders like that is to say it was to be handed to the rearadmiral as it might be under the lee of the mizzenstaysail or in a private fashion well gentlemen you both knows i understand that too and so i undertook the job  and i have got to be so insignificant a person that i pass for no one in your discriminating mind master galleygo exclaimed the viceadmiral sharply i have suspected as much these fiveandtwenty years  lord bless you sir jarvy how flagofficers will make mistakes sometimes theyre mortal i says to the people of the galley and have their appetites false just like the young gentlemen when they get athwarthawse of a body i says now i count admiral blue and yourself pretty much as one man seeing that you keep few or no secrets from each other i knowd ye both as young gentlemen and then you loved one another like twins and then i knowd ye as luffs when yed walk the deck the whole watch spinning yarns and then i knowd ye as pillardees and arrestee though one pillow might have answered for both and as for arrest i never knowd either of ye to got into that scrape as for telling a secret to one ive always looked upon it as pretty much telling it to tother  the two admirals exchanged glances and the look of kindness that each met in the eyes of his friend removed every shadow that had been cast athwart their feelings by the previous discourse  that will do galleygo returned sir gervaise mildly youre a good fellow in the main though a villanously rough one  a little of old boreus sir jarvy interrupted the steward with a grim smile but it blows harder at sea than it does ashore these chaps on land arnt battened down and caulked for such weather as we sons of neptun is obligated to face  quite true and so goodnight admiral bluewater and myself wish to confer together for half an hour all that it is proper for you to know shall be communicated another time  goodnight and god bless your honour goodnight admiral blue we three is the men as can keep any secret as ever floated let it draw as much water as it pleases  sir gervaise oakes stopped in his walk and gazed at his friend with manifest interest as he perceived that admiral bluewater was running over his letter for the third time being now without a witness he did not hesitate to express his apprehensions  tis as i feared dick he cried that letter is from some prominent partisan of edward stuart  the rearadmiral turned his eyes on the face of his friend with an expression that was difficult to read and then he ran over the contents of the epistle for the fourth time  a set of precious rascals they are gervaise at length the rearadmiral exclaimed if the whole court was culled i question if enough honesty could be found to leaven one puritan scoundrel tell me if you know this hand oakes i question if you ever saw it before  the superscription of the letter was held out to sir gervaise who after a close examination declared himself unacquainted with the writing  i thought as much resumed bluewater carefully tearing the signature from the bottom of the page and burning it in a candle let this disgraceful part of the secret die at least the fellow who wrote this has put confidential at the top of his miserable scrawl and a most confident scoundrel he is for his pains however no man has a right to thrust himself in this rude manner between me and my oldest friend and least of all will i consent to keep this piece of treachery from your knowledge i do more than the rascal merits in concealing his name nevertheless i shall not deny myself the pleasure of sending him such an answer as he deserves read that oakes and then say if keelhauling would be too good for the writer  sir gervaise took the letter in silence though not without great surprise and began to peruse it as he proceeded the colour mounted to his temples and once he dropped his hand to cast a look of wonder and indignation towards his companion that the reader may see how much occasion there was for both these feelings we shall give the communication entire it was couched in the following words       dear admiral bluewater       our ancient friendship and i am proud to add affinity of blood      unite in inducing me to write a line at this interesting moment      of the result of this rash experiment of the pretenders son no      prudent man can entertain a doubt still the boy may give us some      trouble before he is disposed of altogether we look to all our      friends therefore for their most efficient exertions and most      prudent cooperation on you every reliance is placed and i      wish i could say as much for every flagofficer afloat some      distrustunmerited i sincerely hopeexists in a very high      quarter touching the loyalty of a certain commanderinchief who      is so completely under your observation that it is felt enough is      done in hinting the fact to one of your political tendencies the      king said this morning vell dere isht bluevater of him we      are shure asht of ter sun you stand excellently well there to      my great delight and i need only say be watchful and prompt       yours with the most sincere faith and attachment my dear      bluewater c c       rearadmiral bluewater       p si have just heard that they have sent you the red riband      the king himself was in this  when sir gervaise had perused this precious epistle to himself he read it slowly and in a steady clear voice aloud when he had ended he dropped the paper and stood gazing at his friend  one would think the fellow some exquisite satirist said bluewater laughing i am to be vigilant and see that you do not mutiny and run away with the fleet to the highlands one of these foggy mornings carry it up into scotland as galleygo has it now what is your opinion of that letter  that all courtiers are knaves and all princes ungrateful i should think my loyalty to the good cause if not to the man the last in england to be suspected  nor is it suspected in the smallest degree my life on it neither the reigning monarch nor his confidential servants are such arrant dunces as to be guilty of so much weakness no this masterly move is intended to secure me by creating a confidence that they think no generousminded man would betray it is a hook delicately baited to catch a gudgeon and not an order to watch a whale  can the scoundrels be so meannay dare they be so bold they must have known you would show me the letter  not theythey have reasoned on my course as they would on their own nothing catches a weak man sooner than a pretended confidence of this nature and i dare say this blackguard rates me just high enough to fancy i may be duped in this flimsy manner put your mind at rest king george knows he may confide in you while i think it probable i am distrusted  i hope dick you do not suspect my discretion my own secret would not be half so sacred to me  i know that full well of you i entertain no distrust either in heart or head of myself i am not quite so certain when we feel we do not always reason and there is as much feeling as any thing else in this matter  not a line is there in all my despatches that go to betray the slightest distrust of me or any one else you are spoken of but it is in a manner to gratify you rather than to alarm take and read them all i intended to show them to you as soon as we had got through with that cursed discussion  as sir gervaise concluded he threw the whole package of letters on the table before his friend  it will be time enough when you summon me regularly to a council of war returned bluewater laying the letters gently aside perhaps we had better sleep on this affair in the morning we shall meet with cooler heads and just as warm hearts  goodnight dick said sir gervaise holding out both hands for the other to shake as he passed him in quitting the room  goodnight gervaise let this miserable devil go overboard and think no more of him i have half a mind to ask you for a leave tomorrow just to run up to london and cut off his ears  sir gervaise laughed and nodded his head and the two friends parted with feelings as kind as ever had distinguished their remarkable career     chapter viii      look tot think ont i do not use to jest     thursday is near lay hand on heart advise     an you be mine ill give you to my friend     an you be not hang beg starve die i the streets           romeo and juliet   wychecombe hall had most of the peculiarities of a bachelors dwelling in its internal government nor was it in any manner behind or it might be better to say before the age in its modes and customs connected with jollifications when its master relaxed a little the servants quite uniformly imitated his example sir wycherly kept a plentiful table and the servants hall fared nearly as well as the diningroom the single article of wine excepted in lieu of the latter however was an unlimited allowance of doublebrewed ale and the difference in the potations was far more in the name than in the quality of the beverages the master drank port for in the middle of the last century few englishmen had better wineand port too that was by no means of a very remarkable delicacy but which like those who used it was rough honest and strong while the servant had his malt liquor of the very highest stamp and flavour between indifferent wine and excellent ale the distance is not interminable and sir wycherlys household was well aware of the fact having frequently instituted intelligent practical comparisons by means of which all but the butler and mrs larder had come to the conclusion to stand by the homebrewed  on the present occasion not a soul in the house was ignorant of the reason why the baronet was making a night of it every man woman and child in or about the hall was a devoted partisan of the house of hanover and as soon as it was understood that this feeling was to be manifested by drinking success to king george and god bless him on the one side and confusion to the pretender and his mad son on the other all under the roof entered into the duty with a zeal that might have seated a usurper on a throne if potations could do it  when admiral bluewater therefore left the chamber of his friend the signs of mirth and of a regular debauch were so very obvious that a little curiosity to watch the result and a disinclination to go off to his ship so soon united to induce him to descend into the rooms below with a view to get a more accurate knowledge of the condition of the household in crossing the great hall to enter the drawingroom he encountered galleygo when the following discourse took place  i should think the masteratarms has not done his duty and dowsed the glim below master steward said the rearadmiral in his quiet way as they met the laughing and singing and hiccupping are all upon a very liberal scale for a respectable countryhouse  galleygo touched the lock of hair on his forehead with one hand and gave his trowsers a slue with the other before he answered which he soon did however though with a voice a little thicker than was usual with him on account of his having added a draught or two to those he had taken previously to visiting sir gervaises dressingroom and which said additional draught or two had produced some such effect on his system as the fresh drop produces on the cup that is already full  thats just it admiral blue returned the steward in passing goodhumour though still sober enough to maintain the decencies after his own fashion thats just it your honour theyve passed the word below to let the lights stand for further orders and have turned the hands up for a frolic such ale as they has stowed in the lower hold of this house like leaguers in the groundtier it does a bodys heart good to conterplate all hands is bowsing out their jibs on it sir and the old hall will soon be carrying as much sail as she can stagger under its nothing but looseaway and sheethome  ay ay galleygo this may be well enough for the people of the household if sir wycherly allows it but it ill becomes the servants of guests to fall into this disorder if i find tom has done any thing amiss he will hear more of it and as your own master is not here to admonish you ill just take the liberty of doing it for him since i know it would mortify him exceedingly to learn that his steward had done any thing to disgrace himself  lord bless your dear soul admiral blue take just as many liberties as you think fit and ill never pocket one on em i knowd you when you was only a young gentleman and now youre a rear youre close on our heels and by the time we are a full admiral youll be something like a vice i looks upon you as bone of our bone and flesh of our fleshpillardees and arresteesand i no more minds a settingdown from your honour than i does from sir jarvy hisself  i believe that is true enough galleygo but take my advice and knock off with the ale for tonight can you tell me how the land lies with the rest of the company  you couldnt have asked a better person your honour as ive just been passing through all the rooms from a sort of habit i has sir for dye see i thought i was in the old planter and that it was my duty to overlook every thing as usual the last pull at the ale put that notion in my head but its gone now and i see how matters is yes sir the mainmast of a church isnt stiffer and more correctlike than my judgment is at this blessed moment sir wycherly guv me a glass of his blackstrap as i ran through the diningroom and told me to drink confusion to the pretender which i did with hearty goodwill but his liquor will no more lay alongside of the ale theyve down on the orlop than a frenchman will compare with an englishman whats your opinion admiral blue consarning this cruise of the pretenders son up in the highlands of scotland  bluewater gave a quick distrustful glance at the steward for he knew that the fellow was half his time in the outer cabin and pantries of the plantagenet and he could not tell how much of his many private dialogues with sir gervaise might have been overheard meeting with nothing but the unmeaning expression of one halfseasover his uneasiness instantly subsided  i think it a gallant enterprise galleygo he answered too manly even to feign what he did not believe but i fear as a cruise it will not bring much prizemoney you have forgotten you were about to tell me how the land lies sir wycherly mr dutton mr rotherham are still at the table i fancyare these all what have become of the two young gentlemen  theres none ashore sir said galleygo promptly accustomed to give that appellation only to midshipmen  i mean the two mr wychecombes one of whom i had forgot is actually an officer  yes sir and a most particlar fine officer he is as every body says well sir hes with the ladies while his namesake has gone back to the table and has put luff upon luff to fetch up leeway  and the ladieswhat have they done with themselves in this scene of noisy revelry  theyse in yonder stateroom your honour as soon as they found how the ship was heading like all womencraft they both makes for the best harbour they could run into yes theyse yonder  as galleygo pointed to the door of the room he meant bluewater proceeded towards it parting with the steward after a few more words of customary but very useless caution the tap of the admiral was answered by wycherly in person who opened the door and made way for his superior to enter with a respectful obeisance there was but a single candle in the little parlour in which the two females had taken refuge from the increasing noise of the debauch and this was due to a pious expedient of mildreds in extinguishing the others with a view to conceal the traces of tears that were still visible on her own and her mothers cheeks the rearadmiral was at first struck with this comparative obscurity but it soon appeared to him appropriate to the feelings of the party assembled in the room mrs dutton received him with the ease she had acquired in her early life and the meeting passed as a matter of course with persons temporarily residing under the same roof  our friends appear to be enjoying themselves said bluewater when a shout from the diningroom forced itself on the ears of all present the loyalty of sir wycherly seems to be of proof  oh admiral bluewater exclaimed the distressed wife feeling momentarily getting the better of discretion do youcan you call such a desecration of gods image enjoyment  not justly perhaps mrs dutton and yet it is what millions mistake for it this mode of celebrating any great event and even of illustrating what we think our principles is i fear a vice not only of our age but of our country  and yet neither you nor sir gervaise oakes i see find it necessary to give such a proof of your attachment to the house of hanover or of your readiness to serve it with your time and persons  you will remember my good lady that both oakes and myself are flagofficers in command and it would never do for us to fall into a debauch in sight of our own ships i am glad to see however that mr wychecombe here prefers such society as i find him in to the pleasures of the table  wycherly bowed and mildred cast an expressive not to say grateful glance towards the speaker but her mother pursued the discourse in which she found a little relief to her suppressed emotion  god be thanked for that she exclaimed halfunconscious of the interpretation that might be put on her words all that we have seen of mr wychecombe would lead us to believe that this is not an unusual or an accidental forbearance  so much the more fortunate for him i congratulate you young sir on this triumph of principle or of temperament or of both we belong to a profession in which the bottle is an enemy more to be feared than any that the king can give us a sailor can call in no ally as efficient in subduing this mortal foe as an intelligent and cultivated mind the man who really thinks much seldom drinks much but there are hoursnay weeks and months of idleness in a ship in which the temptation to resort to unnatural excitement in quest of pleasure is too strong for minds that are not well fortified to resist this is particularly the case with commanders who find themselves isolated by their rank and oppressed with responsibility in the privacy of their own cabins and get to make a companion of the bottle by way of seeking relief from uncomfortable thoughts and of creating a society of their own i deem the critical period of a sailors life to be the first few years of solitary command  how truehow true murmured mrs dutton oh that cutterthat cruel cutter  the truth flashed upon the recollection of bluewater at this unguarded and instantly regretted exclamation many years before when only a captain himself he had been a member of a courtmartial which cashiered a lieutenant of the name of dutton for grievous misconduct while in command of a cutter the fruits of the bottle from the first he thought the name familiar to him but so many similar things had happened in the course of forty years service that this particular incident had been partially lost in the obscurity of time it was now completely recalled however and that too with all its attendant circumstances the recollection served to give the rearadmiral renewed interest in the unhappy wife and lovely daughter of the miserable delinquent he had been applied to at the time for his interest in effecting the restoration of the guilty officer or even to procure for him the hopeless station he now actually occupied but he had sternly refused to be a party in placing any man in authority who was the victim of a propensity that not only disgraced himself but which in the peculiar position of a sailor equally jeoparded the honour of the country and risked the lives of all around him he was aware that the last application had been successful by means of a court influence it was very unusual to exert in cases so insignificant and then he had for years lost sight of the criminal and his fortunes this unexpected revival of his old impressions caused him to feel like an ancient friend of the wife and daughter for well could he recall a scene he had with both in which the struggle between his humanity and his principles had been so violent as actually to reduce him to tears mildred had forgotten the name of this particular officer having been merely a child but well did mrs dutton remember it and with fear and trembling had she come that day to meet him at the hall the first look satisfied her that she was forgotten and she had struggled herself to bury in oblivion a scene which was one of the most painful of her life the unguarded expression mentioned entirely changed the state of affairs  mrs dutton said bluewater kindly taking a hand of the distressed wife i believe we are old friends if after what has passed you will allow me so to consider myself  ah admiral bluewater my memory needed no admonisher to tell me that your sympathy and kindness are as grateful to me now as they were in that dreadful moment when we met before  and i had the pleasure of seeing this young lady more than once on that unpleasant occasion this accounts for a fancy that has fairly haunted me throughout the day for from the instant my eye fell on miss mildred it struck me that the face and most of all its expression was familiar to me certainly it is not a countenance once seen easily to be forgotten  mildred was then but a child sir and your recollection must have been a fancy indeed as children of her age seldom make any lasting impression on the mind particularly in the way of features  it is not the features that i recognize but the expression and that i need not tell the young ladys mother is an expression not so very easily forgotten i dare say mr wychecombe is ready enough to vouch for the truth of what i say  hark exclaimed mrs dutton who was sensitively alive to any indication of the progress of the debauch there is great confusion in the diningroomi hope the gentlemen are of one mind as respects this rising in scotland  if there is a jacobite among them he will have a warm time of it with sir wycherly his nephew and the vicarall three of whom are raging lions in the way of loyalty there does indeed seem something out of the way for those sounds i should think are the feet of servants running to and fro if the servantshall is in the condition i suspect it will as much need the aid of the parlour as the parlour can possibly  a tap at the door caused bluewater to cease speaking and as wycherly threw open the entrance galleygo appeared on the threshold by this time reduced to the necessity of holding on by the casings  well sir said the rearadmiral sternly for he was no longer disposed to trifle with any of the crapulous set well sir what impertinence has brought you here  no impertinence at all your honour we carries none of that in the old planter there being no young gentlemen hereabouts to report proceedings i thought id just step in and do the duty with my own tongue we has so many reports in our cabin that there isnt an officer in the fleet that can make em better as myself sir  there are a hundred who would spend fewer words on any thing what is your business  why sir just to report one flag struck and a commanderinchief on his beamends  good god nothing has happened to sir gervaisespeak fellow or ill have you sent out of this babel and off to the ship though it were midnight  it be pretty much that admiral blue or past six bells as any one may see by the ships clock on the great companion ladder six bells going well on to seven  your business sir what has happened to sir gervaise repeated bluewater shaking his long forefinger menacingly at the steward  we are as well admiral blue as the hour we came over the planters side sir jarvy will carry sail with the best on em ill answer for it whether the ship floats in old port oporto or in a brewers vat let sir jarvy alone for them trickshe wasnt a young gentleman for nothing  have a moments patience sir put in wycherly and i will go myself and ascertain the truth  i shall make but another inquiry continued admiral bluewater as wycherly left the room  why dye see your honour old sir wycherly who is commanderinchief along shore here has capsized in consequence of carrying sail too hard in company with younger craft and theyre now warping him into dock to be overhauled  is this allthat was a result to be expected in such a debauch you need not have put on so ominous a face for this galleygo  no sir so i thought myself and i only tried to look as melancholy as a young gentleman who is sent below to report a topgallantmast over the side or a studdingsailboom gone in the iron dye remember the time admiral blue when you thought to luff up on the old planters weatherquarter and get between her and the french ninety on three decks and how your stunsails went one ater another just like so many musherrooms breaking in peeling  galleygo who was apt to draw his images from his two trades might have talked on an hour without interruption for while he was uttering the above sentence wycherly returned and reported that their host was seriously even dangerously ill while doing the honours of his table he had been seized with a fit which the vicar a noted threebottle man feared was apoplexy mr rotherham had bled the patient who was already a little better and an express had been sent for a medical man as a matter of course the convives had left the table and alarm was frightening the servants into sobriety at mrs duttons earnest request wycherly immediately left the room again forcing galleygo out before him with a view to get more accurate information concerning the baronets real situation both the mother and daughter feeling a real affection for sir wycherly the kind old man having won their hearts by his habitual benevolence and a constant concern for their welfare  sic transit gloria mundi muttered admiral bluewater as he threw his tall person in his own careless manner on a chair in a dark corner of the room this baronet has fallen from his throne in a moment of seeming prosperity and revelry why may not another do the same  mrs dutton heard the voice without distinguishing the words and she felt distressed at the idea that one whom she so much respected and loved might be judged of harshly by a man of the rearadmirals character  sir wycherly is one of the kindesthearted men breathing she said a little hurriedly and there is not a better landlord in england then he is by no means addicted to indulgence at table more than is customary with gentlemen of his station his loyalty has no doubt carried him this evening farther than was prudent or than we could have wished  i have every disposition to think favourably of our poor host my dear mrs dutton and we seamen are not accustomed to judge a bon vivant too harshly  ah admiral bluewater you who have so widespread a reputation for sobriety and correct deportment well do i remember how i trembled when i heard your name mentioned as one of the leading members of that dreadful court  you let your recollections dwell too much on these unpleasant subjects mrs dutton and i should like to see you setting an example of greater cheerfulness to your sweet daughter i could not befriend you then for my oath and my duty were both against it but now there exists no possible reason why i should not while there does exist almost every possible disposition why i should this sweet child interests me in a way i can hardly describe  mrs dutton was silent and thoughtful the years of admiral bluewater did not absolutely forbid his regarding mildreds extreme beauty with the eyes of ordinary admiration but his language and most of all his character ought to repel the intrusive suspicion still mildred was surpassingly lovely and men were surpassingly weak in matters of love many a hero had passed a youth of selfcommand and discretion to consummate some act of exceeding folly of this very nature in the decline of life and bitter experience had taught her to be distrustful nevertheless she could not at once bring herself to think ill of one whose character she had so long respected and with all the rearadmirals directness of manner there was so much real and feeling delicacy blended with the breeding of a gentlemanlike sailor that it was not easy to suppose he had any other motives than those he saw fit to avow mildred had made many a friend by a sweetness of countenance that was even more winning than her general beauty of face and form was attractive and why should not this respectable old seaman be of the number  this train of thought was interrupted by the sudden and unwelcome appearance of dutton he had just returned from the bedside of sir wycherly and now came to seek his wife and daughter to bid them prepare to enter the chariot which was in waiting to convey them home the miserable man was not intoxicated in the sense which deprives a man of the use of speech and limbs but he had drunk quite enough to awaken the demon within him and to lay bare the secrets of his true character if any thing his nerves were better strung than common but the wine had stirred up all the energies of a being whose resolutions seldom took the direction of correct feeling or of right doing the darkness of the room and a slight confusion which nevertheless existed in his brain prevented him from noticing the person of his superior seated as the latter was in the dark corner and he believed himself once more alone with those who were so completely dependent on his mercy and who had so long been the subjects of his brutality and tyranny  i hope sir wycherly is better dutton the wife commenced fearful that her husband might expose himself and her before he was aware of the presence in which he stood admiral bluewater is as anxious as we are ourselves to know his real state  ay you women are all pity and feeling for baronets and rearadmirals answered dutton throwing himself rudely into a chair with his back towards the stranger in an attitude completely to exclude the latter from his view while a husband or father might die a hundred deaths and not draw a look of pity from your beautiful eyes or a kind word from your devilish tongues  neither mildred nor i merit this from you dutton  no youre both perfection like mother like child havent i been fifty times at deaths door with this very complaint of sir wycherlys and did either of you ever send for an apothecary even  you have been occasionally indisposed dutton but never apoplectic and we have always thought a little sleep would restore you as indeed it always has  what business had you to think surgeons think and medical men and it was your duty to send for the nearest professional man to look after one youre bound both to honour and obey you are your own mistress martha i do suppose in a certain degree and what cant be cured must be endured but mildred is my child and ill have her respect and love if i break both your hearts in order to get at them  a pious daughter always respects her parent dutton said the wife trembling from head to foot but love must come willingly or it will not come at all  well see as to that mrs martha dutton well see as to that come hither mildred i have a word to say to you which may as well be said at once  mildred trembling like her mother drew near but with a feeling of filial piety that no harshness could entirely smother she felt anxious to prevent the father from further exposing himself in the presence of admiral bluewater with this view then and with this view only she summoned firmness enough to speak  father she said had we not better defer our family matters until we are alone  under ordinary circumstances bluewater would not have waited for so palpable a hint for he would have retired on the first appearance of any thing so disagreeable as a misunderstanding between man and wife but an ungovernable interest in the lovely girl who stood trembling at her fathers knee caused him to forget his habitual delicacy of feeling and to overlook what might perhaps be termed almost a law of society instead of moving therefore as mildred had both hoped and expected he remained motionless in his seat duttons mind was too obtuse to comprehend his daughters allusions in the absence of ocular evidence of a strangers presence and his wrath was too much excited to permit him to think much of any thing but his own causes of indignation  stand more in front of me mildred he answered angrily more before my face as becomes one who dont know her duty to her parent and needs be taught it  oh dutton exclaimed the afflicted wife do notdo notaccuse mildred of being undutiful you know not what you sayknow not her obligayou cannot know her heart or you would not use these cruel imputations  silence mrs martha duttonmy business is not with you at present but with this young lady to whom i hope i may presume to speak a little plainly as she is my own child silence then mrs martha dutton if my memory is not treacherous you once stood up before gods altar with me and there vowd to love honour and obey yes that was the word obey mrs martha dutton  and what did you promise at the same time frank exclaimed the wife from whose bruised spirit this implied accusation was torn in an agony of mental suffering  nothing but what i have honestly and manfully performed i promised to provide for you to give you food and raiment to let you hear my name and stand before the world in the honourable character of honest frank duttons wife  honourable murmured the wife loud enough to be heard by both the admiral and mildred and yet in a tone so smothered as to elude the obtuse sense of hearing that long excess had left her husband when this expressive word had broken out of her very heart however she succeeded in suppressing her voice and sinking into a chair concealed her face in her hands in silence  mildred come hither resumed the brutalized parent you are my daughter and whatever others have promised at the altar and forgotten a law of nature teaches you to obey me you have two admirers either of whom you ought to be glad to secure though there is a great preference between them  father exclaimed mildred every feeling of her sensitive nature revolting at this coarse allusion to a connection and to sentiments that she was accustomed to view as among the most sacred and private of her moral being surely you cannot mean what you say  like mother like child let but disobedience and disrespect get possession of a wife and they are certain to run through a whole family even though there were a dozen children harkee miss mildred it is you who dont happen to know what you say while i understand myself as well as most parents your mother would never acquaint you with what i feel it a duty to put plainly before your judgment and therefore i expect you to listen as becomes a dutiful and affectionate child you can secure either of these young wychecombes and either of them would be a good match for a poor disgraced sailingmasters daughter  father i shall sink through the floor if you say another word in this cruel manner  no dear youll neither sink nor swim unless it be by making a bad or a good choice mr thomas wychecombe is sir wycherlys heir and must be the next baronet and possessor of this estate of course he is much the best thing and you ought to give him a preference  dutton can you as a father and a christian give such heartless counsel to your own child exclaimed mrs dutton inexpressibly shocked at the want of principle as well as at the want of feeling discovered in her husbands advice  mrs martha dutton i can and believe the counsel to be any thing but heartless too do you wish your daughter to be the wife of a miserable signalstation keeper when she may become lady wychecombe with a little prudent management and the mistress of this capital old house and noble estate  fatherfather interrupted mildred soothingly though ready to sink with shame at the idea of admiral bluewaters being an auditor of such a conversation you forget yourself and overlook my wishes there is little probability of mr thomas wychecombes ever thinking of me as a wifeor indeed of anyone elses entertaining such thoughts  that will turn out as you manage matters milly mr thomas wychecombe does not think of you as a wife quite likely just at this moment but the largest whales are taken by means of very small lines when the last are properly handled this young lieutenant would have you tomorrow though a more silly thing than for you two to marry could not well be hit upon he is only a lieutenant and though his name is so good a one it does not appear that he has any particular right to it  and yet dutton you were only a lieutenant when you married and your name was nothing in the way of interest or preferment observed the mother anxious to interpose some new feeling between her daughter and the cruel inference left by the former part of her husbands speech we then thought all lay bright before us  and so all would lie to this hour mrs dutton but for that one silly act of mine a man with the charges of a family on him little pay and no fortune is driven to a thousand follies to hide his misery you do not strengthen your case by reminding me of that imprudence but mildred i do not tell you to cut adrift this young virginian for he may he of use in more ways than one in the first place you can play him off against mr thomas wychecombe and in the second place a lieutenant is likely one day to be a captain and the wife of a captain in his majestys navy is no disreputable birth i advise you girl to use this youngster as a bait to catch the heir with and failing a good bite to take up with the lad himself  this was said dogmatically but with a coarseness of manner that fully corresponded with the looseness of the principles and the utter want of delicacy of feeling that alone could prompt such advice mrs dutton fairly groaned as she listened to her husband for never before had he so completely thrown aside the thin mask of decency that he ordinarily wore but mildred unable to control the burst of wild emotion that came over her broke away from the place she occupied at her fathers knee and as if blindly seeking protection in any asylum that she fancied safe found herself sobbing as if her heart would break in admiral bluewaters arms  dutton followed the ungovernable impulsive movement with his eye and for the first time he became aware in whose presence he had been exposing his native baseness wine had not so far the mastery of him as to blind him to all the consequences though it did stimulate him to a point that enabled him to face the momentary mortification of his situation  i beg a thousand pardons sir he said rising and bowing low to his superior i was totally ignorant that i had the honour to be in the company of admiral bluewateradmiral blue i find jack calls you sir hahahaa familiarity which is a true sign of love and respect i never knew a captain or a flagofficer that got a regular expressive ships name that he wasnt the delight of the whole service yes sir i find the people call sir gervaise little jarvy and yourself admiral bluehahahaan infallible sign of merit in the superior and of love in the men  i ought to apologize mr dutton for making one so unexpectedly to myself in a family council returned the rearadmiral as for the men they are no great philosophers though tolerable judges of when they are well commanded and well treatedbut the hour is late and it was my intention to sleep in my own ship tonight the coach of sir wycherly has been ordered to carry me to the landing and i hope to have your permission to see these ladies home in it  the answer of dutton was given with perfect selfpossession and in a manner to show that he knew how to exercise the courtesies of life or to receive them when in the humour  it is an honour sir they will not think of declining if my wishes are consulted he said come milly foolish girl dry your tears and smile on admiral bluewater for his condescension young women sir hardly know how to take a joke and our ships humours are sometimes a little strong for them i tell my dear wife sometimeswife i say his majesty cant have stouthearted and stouthanded seamen and the women poets and dieaway swains and all in the same individual says i mrs dutton understands me sir and so does little milly who is an excellent girl in the main though a little addicted to using the eyepumps as we have it aboard ship sir  and now mr dutton it being understood that i am to see the ladies home will you do me the favour to inquire after the condition of sir wycherly one would not wish to quit his hospitable roof in uncertainty as to his actual situation  dutton was duly sensible of an awkwardness in the presence of his superior and he gladly profited by this commission to quit the room walking more steadily than if he had not been drinking  all this time mildred hung on admiral bluewaters shoulder weeping and unwilling to quit a place that seemed to her in her fearful agitation a sort of sanctuary  mrs dutton said bluewater first kissing the cheek of his lovely burthen in a manner so parental that the most sensitive delicacy could not have taken the alarm you will succeed better than myself in quieting the feelings of this little trembler i need hardly say that if i have accidentally overheard more than i ought it is as much a secret with me as it would be with your own brother the characters of all cannot be affected by the mistaken and excited calculations of one and this occasion has served to make me better acquainted with you and your admirable daughter than i might otherwise have been by means of years of ordinary intercourse  oh admiral bluewater do not judge him too harshly he has been too long at that fatal table which i fear has destroyed poor dear sir wycherly and knew not what he said never before have i seen him in such a fearful humour or in the least disposed to trifle with or to wound the feelings of this sweet child  her extreme agitation is a proof of this my good madam and shows all you can wish to say view me as your sincere friend and place every reliance on my discretion  the wounded mother listened with gratitude and mildred withdrew from her extraordinary situation wondering by what species of infatuation she could have been led to adopt it     chapter ix                      ah montague     if thou be there sweet brother take my hand     and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile     thou lovst me not for brother if thou didst     thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood     that glues my lips and will not let me speak     come quickly montague or i am dead           king henry vi   sir wycherly had actually been seized with a fit of apoplexy it was the first serious disease he had experienced in a long life of health and prosperity and the sight of their condescending goodhumored and indulgent master in a plight so miserable had a surprising effect on the heated brains of all the household mr rotherham a good threebottle man on emergency had learned to bleed and fortunately the vein he struck as his patient still lay on the floor where he had fallen sent out a stream that had the effect not only to restore the baronet to life but in a great measure to consciousness sir wycherly was not a hard drinker like dutton but he was a fair drinker like mr rotherham and most of the beneficed clergy of that day want of exercise as he grew older had as much influence in producing his attack as excess of wine and there were already strong hopes of his surviving it aided as he was by a good constitution the apothecary had reached the hall within five minutes after the attack having luckily been prescribing to the gardener and the physician and surgeon of the family were both expected in the course of the morning  sir gervaise oakes had been acquainted with the state of his host by his own valet as soon as it was known in the servantshall and being a man of action he did not hesitate to proceed at once to the chamber of the sick to offer his own aid in the absence of that which might be better at the door of the chamber he met atwood who had been summoned from his pen and they entered together the viceadmiral feeling for a lancet in his pocket for he too had acquired the art of the bloodletter they now learned the actual state of things  where is bluewater demanded sir gervaise after regarding his host a moment with commiseration and concern i hope he has not yet left the house  he is still here sir gervaise but i should think on the point of quitting us i heard him say that notwithstanding all sir wycherlys kind plans to detain him he intended to sleep in his own ship  that ive never doubted though ive affected to believe otherwise go to him atwood and say i beg he will pull within hail of the plantagenet as he goes off and desire mr magrath to come ashore as soon as possible there shall be a conveyance at the landing to bring him here and he may order his own surgeon to come also if it be agreeable to himself  with these instructions the secretary left the room while sir gervaise turned to tom wychecombe and said a few of the words customary on such melancholy occasions  i think there is hope sir he added yes sir i think there is hope though your honoured relative is no longer youngstill this early bleeding has been a great thing and if we can gain a little time for poor sir wycherly our efforts will not be thrown away sudden death is awful sir and few of us are prepared for it either in mind or affairs we sailors have to hold our lives in our hands it is true but then it is for king and country and we hope for mercy on all who fall in the discharge of their duties for my part i am never unprovided with a will and that disposes of all the interests of this world while i humbly trust in the great mediator for the hereafter i hope sir wycherly is equally provident as to his worldly affairs  no doubt my dear uncle could wish to leave certain trifling memorials behind him to a few of his intimates returned tom with a dejected countenance but he has not been without a will i believe for some time and i presume you will agree with me in thinking he is not in a condition to make one now were he unprovided in that way  perhaps not exactly at this moment though a rally might afford an opportunity the estate is entailed i think mr dutton told me at dinner  it is sir gervaise and i am the unworthy individual who is to profit by it according to the common notions of men though heaven knows i shall consider it any thing but a gain still i am the unworthy individual who is to be benefited by my uncles death  your father was the baronets next brother observed sir gervaise casually a shade of distrust passing athwart his mind though coming from what source or directed to what point he was himself totally unable to say mr baron wychecombe i believe was your parent  he was sir gervaise and a most tender and indulgent father i ever found him he left me his earnings some seven hundred a year and i am sure the death of sir wycherly is as far from my necessities as it is from my wishes  of course you will succeed to the baronetcy as well as to the estate mechanically asked sir gervaise led on by the supererogatory expressions of tom himself rather than by a vulgar curiosity to ask questions that under other circumstances he might have thought improper  of course sir my father was the only surviving brother of sir wycherly the only one who ever married and i am his eldest child since this melancholy event has occurred it is quite fortunate that i lately obtained this certificate of the marriage of my parentsis it not sir  here tom drew from his pocket a soiled piece of paper which professed to be a certificate of the marriage of thomas wychecombe barrister with martha dodd spinster c c the document was duly signed by the rector of a parish church in westminster and bore a date sufficiently old to establish the legitimacy of the person who held it this extraordinary precaution produced the very natural effect of increasing the distrust of the viceadmiral and in a slight degree of giving it a direction  you go well armed sir observed sir gervaise drily is it your intention when you succeed to carry the patent of the baronetcy and the titledeeds in your pocket  ah i perceive my having this document strikes you as odd sir gervaise but it can be easily explained there was a wide difference in rank between my parents and some illdisposed persons have presumed so far to reflect on the character of my mother as to assert she was not married at all  in which case sir you would do well to cut off halfadozen of their ears  the law is not to be appeased in that way sir gervaise my dear parent used to inculcate on me the necessity of doing every thing according to law and i endeavour to remember his precepts he avowed his marriage on his deathbed made all due atonement to my respected and injured mother and informed me in whose hands i should find this very certificate i only obtained it this morning which fact will account for its being in my pocket at this melancholy and unexpected crisis in my beloved uncles constitution  the latter part of toms declaration was true enough for after having made all the necessary inquiries and obtained the handwriting of a clergyman who was long since dead he had actually forged the certificate that day on a piece of soiled paper that bore the watermark of 1720 his language however contributed to alienate the confidence of his listener sir gervaise being a man who was so much accustomed to directness and fairdealing himself as to feel disgust at any thing that had the semblance of cant or hypocrisy nevertheless he had his own motives for pursuing the subject the presence of neither at the bedside of the sufferer being just then necessary  and this mr wycherly wychecombe he said he who has so much distinguished himself of late your uncles namesakeis it true that he is not allied to your family  not in the least sir gervaise answered tom with one of his sinister smiles he is only a virginian you know sir and cannot well belong to us i have heard my uncle say often that the young gentleman must be descended from an old servant of his fathers who was transported for stealing silver out of a shop on ludgate hill and who was arrested for passing himself off as one of the wychecombe family they tell me sir gervaise that the colonies are pretty much made of persons descended from that sort of ancestors  i cannot say that i have found it so though when i commanded a frigate i served several years on the north american station the larger portion of the americans like much the larger portion of the english are humble labourers established in a remote colony where civilization is not far advanced wants are many and means few but in the way of character i am not certain that they are not quite on a level with those they left behind them and as to the gentry of the colonies i have seen many men of the best blood of the mother country among themyounger sons and their descendants as a matter of course but of an honourable and respected ancestry  well sir this surprises me and it is not the general opinion i am persuaded certainly it is not the fact as respects the gentlemanstranger i might call him for stranger he is at wychecombewho has not the least right to pretend to belong to us  did you ever know him to lay claim to that honour sir  not directly sir gervaise though i am told he has made many hints to that effect since he landed here to be cured of his wound it would have been better had he presented his rights to the landlord than to present them to the tenants i think you will allow as a man of honour yourself sir gervaise  i can approve of nothing clandestine in matters that require open and fair dealing mr thomas wychecombe but i ought to apologize for thus dwelling on your family affairs which concern me only as i feel an interest in the wishes and happiness of my new acquaintance my excellent host  sir wycherly has property in the funds that is not entailedquite ¬£1000 a year beyond the estatesand i know he has left a will continued tom who with the shortsightedness of a rogue flattered himself with having made a favourable impression on his companion and who was desirous of making him useful to himself in an emergency that he felt satisfied must terminate in the speedy death of his uncle yes a good ¬£1000 a year in the fives money saved from his rents in a long life this will probably has some provision in favour of my younger brothers and perhaps of this namesake of histom was well aware that it devised every shilling real and personal to himselffor a kinder heart does not exist on earth in fact this will my uncle put in my possession as heir at law feeling it due to my pretensions i suppose but i have never presumed to look into it  here was another instance of excessive finesse in which tom awakened suspicion by his very efforts to allay it it seemed highly improbable to sir gervaise that a man like the nephew could long possess his uncles will and feel no desire to ascertain its contents the language of the young man was an indirect admission that he might have examined the will if he would and the admiral felt disposed to suspect that what he might thus readily have done he actually had done the dialogue however terminated here dutton just at that moment entering the room on the errand on which he had been sent by admiral bluewater and tom joining his old acquaintance as soon as the latter made his appearance sir gervaise oakes was too much concerned for the condition of his host and had too many cares of his own to think deeply or long on what had just passed between himself and tom wychecombe had they separated that night what had been said and the unfavourable impressions it had made would have been soon forgotten but circumstances subsequently conspired to recall the whole to his mind of which the consequences will be related in the course of our narrative  dutton appeared to be a little shocked as he gazed upon the pallid features of sir wycherly and he was not sorry when tom led him aside and began to speak confidentially of the future and of the probable speedy death of his uncle had there been one present gifted with the power of reading the thoughts and motives of men a deep disgust of human frailties must have come over him as these two impure spirits betrayed to him their cupidity and cunning outwardly they were friends mourning over a mutual probable loss while inwardly dutton was endeavouring to obtain such a hold of his companions confidence as might pave the way to his own future preferment to the high and unhopedfor station of a rich baronets fatherinlaw while tom thought only of so far mystifying the master as to make use of him on an emergency as a witness to establish his own claims the manner in which he endeavoured to effect his object however must be left to the imagination of the reader as we have matters of greater moment to record at this particular juncture  from the time sir wycherly was laid on his bed mr rotherham had been seated at the sick mans side watching the course of his attack and ready to interpret any of the patients feebly and indistinctly expressed wishes we say indistinctly because the baronets speech was slightly affected with that species of paralysis which reduces the faculty to the state that is vulgarly called thicktongued although a threebottle man mr rotherham was far from being without his devout feelings on occasions discharging all the clerical functions with as much unction as the habits of the country and the opinions of the day ordinarily exacted of divines he had even volunteered to read the prayers for the sick as soon as he perceived that the patients recollection had returned but this kind offer had been declined by sir wycherly under the clearer views of fitness that the near approach of death is apt to give and which views left a certain consciousness that the party assembled was not in the best possible condition for that sacred office sir wycherly revived so much at last as to look about him with increasing consciousness and at length his eyes passed slowly over the room scanning each person singly and with marked deliberation  i know you allnow said the kindhearted baronet though always speaking thick and with a little difficulty am sorry to givemuch trouble i havelittle time to spare  i hope not sir wycherly put in the vicar in a consolatory manner you have had a sharp attack but then there is a good constitution to withstand it  my timeshortfeel it here rejoined the patient passing his hand over his forehead  note that dutton whispered tom wycherly my poor uncle intimates himself that his mind is a little shaken under such circumstances it would be cruel to let him injure himself with business  it cannot be done legally mr thomasi should think admiral oakes would interfere to prevent it  rotherham continued the patient i willsettle withworld then givethoughtsto god have wegueststhe housemen of familycharacter  certainly

your wishes at a moment so important  let all quitroombut yourselfhead feels worsei cannot delay  tis cruel to distress my beloved uncle with business or conversation in his present state interposed tom wychecombe with emphasis and in a slight degree with authority  all not only felt the truth of this but all felt that the speaker by his consanguinity had a clear right to interfere in the manner he had still sir gervaise oakes had great reluctance in yielding to this remonstrance for to the distrust he had imbibed of tom wychecombe was added an impression that his host wished to reveal something of interest in connection with his new favourite the lieutenant he felt compelled notwithstanding to defer to the acknowledged nephews better claims and he refrained from interfering fortunately sir wycherly was yet in a state to enforce his own wishes  let all quitroom he repeated in a voice that was startling by its unexpected firmness and equally unexpected distinctness all but sir gervaise oakesadmiral bluewatermr rotherham gentlemenfavour to remainrest depart  accustomed to obey their masters orders more especially when given in a tone so decided the domestics quitted the room accompanied by dutton but tom wychecombe saw fit to remain as if his presence were to be a matter of course  do mefavourwithdrawmr wychecombe resumed the baronet after fixing his gaze on his nephew for some time as if expecting him to retire without this request  my beloved uncle it is ithomas your own brothers sonyour next of kinwaiting anxiously by your respected bedside do notdo notconfound me with strangers such a forgetfulness would break my heart  forgive me nephewbut i wishalone with these gentleheadgettingconfused  you see how it is sir gervaise oakesyou see how it is mr rotherham ah there goes the coach that is to take admiral bluewater to his boat my uncle wished for three witnesses to something and i can remain as one of the three  is it your pleasure sir wycherly to wish to see us alone asked sir gervaise in a manner that showed authority would be exercised to enforce his request should the uncle still desire the absence of his nephew  a sign from the sick man indicated the affirmative and that in a manner too decided to admit of mistake  you perceive mr wychecombe what are your uncles wishes observed sir gervaise very much in the way that a wellbred superior intimates to an inferior the compliance he expects i trust his desire will not be disregarded at a moment like this  i am sir wycherly wychecombes next of kin said tom in a slightly bullying tone and no one has the same right as a relative and i may say his heir to be at his bedside  that depends on the pleasure of sir wycherly wychecombe himself sir he is master here and having done me the honour to invite me under his roof as a guest and now having requested to see me alone with others he has expressly namedone of whom you are noti shall conceive it my duty to see his wishes obeyed  this was said in the firm quiet way that the habit of command had imparted to sir gervaises manner and tom began to see it might be dangerous to resist it was important too that one of the viceadmirals character and station should have naught to say against him in the event of any future controversy and making a few professions of respect and of his desire to please his uncle tom quitted the room  a gleam of satisfaction shot over the sick mans countenance as his nephew disappeared and then his eye turned slowly towards the faces of those who remained  bluewater he said the thickness of his speech and the general difficulty of utterance seeming to increase the rearadmirali want allrespectablewitnesses in the house  my friend has left us i understand returned sir gervaise insisting on his habit of never sleeping out of his ship but atwood must soon be back i hope he will answer  a sign of assent was given and then there was the pause of a minute or two ere the secretary made his appearance as soon however as he had returned the three collected around the baronets bed not without some of the weakness which men are supposed to have inherited from their common mother eve in connection with the motive for this singular proceeding of the baronet  sir gervaiserotherhammr atwood slowly repeated the patient his eye passing from the face of one to that of another as he uttered the name of each three witnessesthat will dothomas saidmust have threethree good names  what can we do to serve you sir wycherly inquired the admiral with real interest you have only to name your requests to have them faithfully attended to  old sir michael wychecombe kttwo wivesmargery and joan two wivestwo sonshalfbloodthomas james charles and gregory wholesir reginald wychecombe half understandhopegentlemen  this is not being very clear certainly whispered sir gervaise but perhaps by getting hold of the other end of the rope we may underrun it as we sailors say and come at the meaningwe will let the poor man proceed therefore quite plain my dear sir and what have you next to tell us you left off without saying only half about sir reginald  halfblood only halftom and the rest whole sir reginald no nulliusyoung tom a nullius  a nullius mr rotherham you understand latin sir what can a nullius mean no such rope in the ship hey atwood  nullius or nullius as it ought sometimes to be pronounced is the genitive case singular of the pronoun nullus nullus nulla nullum which means no man no woman no thing nullius means of no man of no woman of no thing  the vicar gave this explanation much in the way a pedagogue would have explained the matter to a class  ayayany schoolboy could have told that which is the first form learning but what the devil can nom nullus nulla nullum gen nullius nullius nullius have to do with mr thomas wychecombe the nephew and heir of the present baronet  that is more than i can inform you sir gervaise answered the vicar stiffly but for the latin i will take upon myself to answer that it is good  sir gervaise was toowell bred to laugh but he found it difficult to suppress a smile  well sir wycherly resumed the viceadmiral this is quite plainsir reginald is only half while your nephew tom and the rest are wholemargery and joan and all that any thing more to tell us my dear sir  tom not wholenullus i wish to say sir reginald halfno nullus  this is like being at sea a week without getting a sight of the sun i am all adrift now gentlemen  sir wycherly does not attend to his cases put in atwood drily at one time he is in the genitive and then he gets back to the nominative which is leaving us in the vocative  comecomeatwood none of your gunroom wit on an occasion so solemn as this my dear sir wycherly have you any thing more to tell us i believe we perfectly understand you now tom is not wholeyou wish to say nullus and not to say nullius sir reginald is only half but he is no nullus  yes sirthat is it returned the old man smiling half but no nullus change my mindseen too much of the other latelytom my nephewwant to make him my heir  this is getting clearer out of all question you wish to make your nephew tom your heir but the law does that already does it not my dear sir mr baron wychecombe was the next brother of the baronet was he not mr rotherham  so i have always understood sir and mr thomas wychecombe must be the heir at law  nononullusnullus repeated sir wycherly with so much eagerness as to make his voice nearly indistinct sir reginaldsir reginaldsir reginald  and pray mr rotherham who may this sir reginald be some old baronet of the family i presume  not at all sir it is sir reginald wychecombe of wychecomberegis herts a baronet of queen annes time and a descendant from a cadet of this family i am told  this is getting on soundingsi had taken it into my head this sir reginald was some old fellow of the reign of one of the plantagenets well sir wycherly do you wish us to send an express into hertfordshire in quest of sir reginald wychecombe who is quite likely your executor do not give yourself the pain to speak a sign will answer  sir wycherly seemed struck with the suggestion which the reader will readily understand was far from being his real meaning and then he smiled and nodded his head in approbation  sir gervaise with the prompitude of a man of business turned to the table where the vicar had written notes to the medical men and dictated a short letter to his secretary this letter he signed and in five minutes atwood left the room to order it to be immediately forwarded by express when this was done the admiral rubbed his hands in satisfaction like a man who felt he had got himself cleverly out of a knotty difficulty  i dont see after all mr rotherham he observed to the vicar as they stood together in a corner of the room waiting the return of the secretary what he lugged in that schoolboy latin fornullus nulla nullum can you possibly explain that  not unless it was sir wycherlys desire to say that sir reginald being descended from a younger son was nobodyas yet had no womanand i believe he is not marriedand was poor or had no thing  and is sir wycherly such a desperate scholar that he would express himself in this hieroglyphical manner on what i fear will prove to be his deathbed  why sir gervaise sir wycherly was educated like all other young gentlemen but has forgotten most of his classics in the course of a long life of ease and affluence is it not probable now that his recollection has returned to him suddenly in consequence of this affection of the head i think i have read of some curious instances of these reviving memories on a deathbed or after a fit of sickness  ay that you may have done exclaimed sir gervaise smiling and poor good sir wycherly must have begun afresh at the very place where he left off but here is atwood again  after a short consultation the three chosen witnesses returned to the bedside the admiral being spokesman  the express will be off in ten minutes sir wycherly he said and you may hope to see your relative in the course of the next two or three days  too latetoo late murmured the patient who had an inward consciousness of his true situation too lateturn the will roundsir reginald tomtom sir reginald turn the will round  turn the will roundthis is very explicit gentlemen to those who can understand it sir reginald tomtom sir reginald at all events it is clear that his mind is dwelling on the disposition of his property since he speaks of wills atwood make a note of these words that there need be no mistake i wonder he has said nothing of our brave young lieutenant his namesake there can be no harm mr rotherham in just mentioning that fine fellow to him in a moment like this  i see none sir it is our duty to remind the sick of their duties  do you not wish to see your young namesake lieutenant wycherly wychecombe sir wycherly asked the admiral sufficiently emphasizing the christian name he must be in the house and i dare say would be happy to obey your wishes  i hope he is well sirfine young gentlemanhonour to the name sir  quite true sir wycherly and an honour to the nation too  didnt know virginia was a nationso much the betterfine young virginian sir  of your family no doubt sir wycherly as well as of your name added the admiral who secretly suspected the young sailor of being a son of the baronet notwithstanding all he had heard to the contrary an exceedingly fine young man and an honour to any house in england  i suppose they have houses in virginiabad climate houses necessary no relative sirprobably a nullus many wychecombes nulluses tom a nullusthis young gentleman a nulluswychecombes of surrey all nullusessir reginald no nullus but a halfthomas james charles and gregory all whole my brother baron wychecombe told mebefore died  whole what sir wycherly asked the admiral a little vexed at the obscurity of the others language  bloodwhole blood sir capital law sir gervaise had it from the baronfirst hand  now one of the peculiarities of england is that in the division of labour few know any thing material about the law except the professional men even their knowledge is divided and subdivided in a way that makes a very fair division of profit thus the conveyancer is not a barrister the barrister is not an attorney and the chancery practitioner would be an unsafe adviser for one of the purely law courts that particular provision of the common law which baron wychecombe had mentioned to his brother as the rule of the halfblood has been set aside or modified by statute within the last ten years but few english laymen would be at all likely to know of such a law of descent even when it existed for while it did violence to every natural sentiment of right it lay hidden in the secrets of the profession were a case stated to a thousand intelligent englishmen who had not read law in which it was laid down that brothers by different mothers though equally sons of the founder of the estate could not take from each other unless by devise or entail the probability is that quite nine in ten would deny the existence of any rule so absurd and this too under the influence of feelings that were creditable to their sense of natural justice nevertheless such was one of the important provisions of the perfection of reason until the recent reforms in english law and it has struck us as surprising that an ingenious writer of fiction who has recently charmed his readers with a tale the interest of which turns principally on the vicissitudes of practice did not bethink him of this peculiar feature of his countrys laws inasmuch as it would have supplied mystery sufficient for a dozen ordinary romances and improbabilities enough for a hundred that sir gervaise and his companions should be ignorant of the law of the halfblood is consequently very much a matter of course and no one ought to be surprised that the worthy baronets repeated allusions to the whole and the half were absolutely enigmas which neither had the knowledge necessary to explain  what can the poor fellow mean demanded the admiral more concerned than he remembered ever before to have been on any similar occasion one could wish to serve him as much as possible but all this about nullus and whole blood and half is so much gibberish to mecan you make any thing of ithey atwood  upon my word sir gervaise it seems a matter for a judge rather than for manofwars men like ourselves  it certainly can have no connection with this rising of the jacobites that is an affair likely to trouble a loyal subject in his last moments mr rotherham  sir wycherlys habits and age forbid the idea that he knows more of that sir than is known to us all his request however to turn the will round i conceive to be altogether explicit several capital treatises have appeared lately on the human will and i regret to say my honoured friend and patron has not always been quite as orthodox on that point as i could wish i therefore consider his words as evidence of a hearty repentance  sir gervaise looked about him as was his habit when any droll idea crossed his mind but again suppressing the inclination to smile he answered with suitable gravity  i understand you sir you think all these inexplicable terms are connected with sir wycherlys religious feelings you may certainly be right for it exceeds my knowledge to connect them with any thing else i wish notwithstanding he had not disowned this noble young lieutenant of ours is it quite certain the young man is a virginian  so i have always understood it sir he has never been known in this part of england until he was landed from a frigate in the roads to be cured of a serious wound i think none of sir wycherlys allusions have the least reference to him  sir gervaise oakes now joined his hands behind his back and walked several times quarterdeck fashion to and fro in the room at each turn his eyes glanced towards the bed and he ever found the gaze of the sick man anxiously fastened on himself this satisfied him that religion had nothing to do with his hosts manifest desire to make himself understood and his own trouble was greatly increased it seemed to him as if the dying man was making incessant appeals to his aid without its being in his power to afford it it was not possible for a generous man like sir gervaise to submit to such a feeling without an effort and he soon went to the side of the bed again determined to bring the affair to some intelligible issue  do you think sir wycherly you could write a few lines if we put pen ink and paper before you he asked as a sort of desperate remedy  impossiblecan hardly see have got no strengthstopwill tryif you please  sir gervaise was delighted with this and he immediately directed his companions to lend their assistance atwood and the vicar bolstered the old man up and the admiral put the writing materials before him substituting a large quarto bible for a desk sir wycherly after several abortive attempts finally got the pen in his hand and with great difficulty traced six or seven nearly illegible words running the line diagonally across the paper by this time his powers failed him altogether and he sunk back dropping the pen and closing his eyes in a partial insensibility at this critical instant the surgeon entered and at once put an end to the interview by taking charge of the patient and directing all but one or two necessary attendants to quit the room  the three chosen witnesses of what had just past repaired together to a parlour atwood by a sort of mechanical habit taking with him the paper on which the baronet had scrawled the words just mentioned this by a sort of mechanical use also he put into the hands of sir gervaise as soon as they entered the room much as he would have laid before his superior an order to sign or a copy of a letter to the secretary of the navy board  this is as bad as the nullus exclaimed sir gervaise after endeavouring to decipher the scrawl in vain what is this first word mr rotherhamirish is it nothey atwood  i believe it is no move than in stretched over much more paper than is necessary  you are right enough vicar and the next word is the though it looks like a chevaux de frisewhat follows it looks like manofwar atwood  i beg your pardon sir gervaise this first letter is what i should call an elongated nthe next is certainly an athe third looks like the waves of a riverah it is an mand the last is an enamethat makes name gentlemen  yes eagerly added the vicar and the two next words are of god  then it is religion after all that was on the poor mans mind exclaimed sir gervaise in a slight degree disappointed if the truth must be told whats this amenamenwhy its a sort of prayer  this is the form in which it is usual to commence wills i believe sir gervaise observed the secretary who had written many a one on board ship in his day in the name of god amen  by george youre right atwood and the poor man was trying all the while to let us know how he wished to dispose of his property what could he mean by the nullusit is not possible that the old gentleman has nothing to leave  ill answer for it sir gervaise that is not the true explanation the vicar replied sir wycherlys affairs are in the best order and besides the estate he has a large sum in the funds  well gentlemen we can do no more tonight a medical man is already in the house and bluewater will send ashore one or two others from the fleet in the morning if sir wycherly is in a state to converse this matter shall be attended to  the party now separated a bed being provided for the vicar and the admiral and his secretary retiring to their respective rooms     chapter x      bid physicians talk our veins to temper     and with an argument newset a pulse     then think my lord of reasoning into love           young   while the scene just related took place in the chamber of the sick man admiral bluewater mrs dutton and mildred left the house in the old familycoach the rearadmiral had pertinaciously determined to adhere to his practice of sleeping in his ship and the manner in which he had offered seats to his two fair companionsfor mrs dutton still deserved to be thus termedhas already been seen the motive was simply to remove them from any further brutal exhibitions of duttons cupidity while he continued in his present humour and thus influenced it is not probable that the gallant old sailor would be likely to dwell more than was absolutely necessary on the unpleasant scene of which he had been a witness in fact no allusion was made to it during the quarter of an hour the party was driving from the hall to the stationhouse they all spoke with regretmildred with affectionate tenderness evenof poor sir wycherly and several anecdotes indicative of his goodness of heart were eagerly related to bluewater by the two females as the carriage moved heavily along in the time mentioned the vehicle drew up before the door of the cottage and all three alighted  if the morning of that day had been veiled in mist the sun had set in as cloudless a sky as is often arched above the island of great britain the night was what in that region is termed a clear moonlight it was certainly not the mimic day that is so often enjoyed in purer atmospheres but the panorama of the headland was clothed in a soft magical sort of semidistinctness that rendered objects sufficiently obvious and exceedingly beautiful the rounded shorn swells of the land hove upward to the eye verdant and smooth while the fine oaks of the park formed a shadowy background to the picture inland seaward the ocean was glittering like a reversed plane of the firmament far as eye could reach if our own hemisphere or rather this latitude may boast of purer skies than are enjoyed by the mother country the latter has a vast superiority in the tint of the water while the whole american coast is bounded by a dulllooking sheet of seagreen the deep blue of the wide ocean appears to be carried close home to the shores of europe this glorious tint from which the term of ultramarine has been derived is most remarkable in the mediterranean that sea of delights but it is met with all along the rockbound coasts of the peninsula of spain and portugal extending through the british channel until it is in a measure lost on the shoals of the north sea to be revived however in the profound depths of the ocean that laves the wild romantic coast of norway  tis a glorious night exclaimed bluewater as he handed mildred the last from the carriage and one can hardly wish to enter a cot let it swing ever so lazily  sleep is out of the question returned mildred sorrowfully these are nights in which even the weary are reluctant to lose their consciousness but who can sleep while there is this uncertainty about dear sir wycherly  i rejoice to hear you say this mildredfor so the admiral had unconsciously and unrepelled begun to call his sweet companioni rejoice to hear you say this for i am an inveterate stargazer and moonite and i shall hope to persuade you and mrs dutton to waste yet another hour with me in walking on this height ah yonder is sam yoke my coxswain waiting to report the barge i can send sir gervaises message to the surgeons by deputy and there will be no occasion for my hastening from this lovely spot and pleasant company  the orders were soon given to the coxswain a dozen boats it would seem were in waiting for officers ashore notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and directions were sent for two of them to pull off and obtain the medical men the coach was sent round to receive the latter and then all was tranquil again on the height mrs dutton entered the house to attend to some of her domestic concerns while the rearadmiral took the arm of mildred and they walked together to the verge of the cliffs  a fairer moonlight picture seldom offered itself to a seamans eye than that which now lay before the sight of admiral bluewater and mildred beneath them rode the fleet sixteen sail of different rigs eleven of which however were twodecked ships of the largest size then known in naval warfare and all of which were in that perfect order that an active and intelligent commander knows how to procure even from the dilatory and indifferent if admiral bluewater was conspicuous in manoeuvring a fleet and in rendering every vessel of a line that extended a league efficient and that too in her right place sir gervaise oakes had the reputation of being one of the best seamen in the ordinary sense of the word in england no vessel under his command ever had a lubberly look and no ship that had any sailing in her failed to have it brought out of her the viceadmiral was familiar with that allimportant factone that members equally of congress and of parliament are so apt to forgot or rather not to know at allthat the efficiency of a whole fleet as a fleet is necessarily brought down to the level of its worst ships of little avail is it that four or five vessels of a squadron sail fast and work well if the eight or ten that remain behave badly and are dull a separation of the vessels is the inevitable consequence when the properties of all are thoroughly tried and the division of a force is the first step towards its defeat as its proper concentration is a leading condition of victory as the poorer vessels cannot imitate the better the good are compelled to regulate their movements by the bad which is at once essentially bringing down the best ships of a fleet to the level of its worst the proposition with which we commenced  sir gervaise oakes was so great a favourite that all he asked was usually conceded to him one of his conditions was that his vessels should sail equally well if you give me fast ships he said i can overtake the enemy if dull the enemy can overtake me and i leave you to say which course will be most likely to bring on an action at any rate give me consorts not one flyer and one drag but vessels that can keep within hail of each other without anchoring the admiralty professed every desire to oblige the gallant commander and as he was resolved never to quit the plantagenet until she was worn out it was indispensably necessary to find as many fast vessels as possible to keep her company the result was literally a fleet of horses as galleygo used to call it and it was generally said in the service that oakes had a squadron of flyers if not a flyingsquadron  vessels like these just mentioned are usually symmetrical and graceful to the eye as well as fast this fact was apparent to mildred accustomed as she was to the sight of ships and she ventured to express as much after she and her companion had stood quite a minute on the cliff gazing at the grand spectacle beneath them  your vessels look even handsomer than common admiral bluewater she said though a ship to me is always an attractive sight  this is because they are handsomer than common my pretty critic viceadmiral oakes is an officer who will no more tolerate an ugly ship in his fleet than a peer of the realm will marry any woman but one who is handsome unless indeed she happen to be surpassingly rich  i have heard that men are accustomed to lose their hearts under such an influence said mildred laughing but i did not know before that they were ever frank enough to avow it  the knowledge has been imparted by a prudent mother i suppose returned the rearadmiral in a musing manner i wish i stood sufficiently in the parental relation to you my young friend to venture to give a little advice also never before did i feel so strong a wish to warn a human being of a great danger that i fear is impending over her could i presume to take the liberty  it is not a liberty but a duty to warn any one of a danger that is known to ourselves and not to the person who incurs the risk at least so it appears to the eyes of a very young girl  yes if the danger was of falling from these cliffs or of setting fire to a house or of any other visible calamity the case is different when young ladies and setting fire to the heart are concerned  certainly i can perceive the distinction answered mildred after a short pause and can understand that the same person who would not scruple to give the alarm against any physical danger would hesitate even at hinting at one of a moral character nevertheless if admiral bluewater think a simple girl like me of sufficient importance to take the trouble to interest himself in her welfare i should hope he would not shrink from pointing out this danger it is a terrible word to sleep on and i confess besides a little uneasiness to a good deal of curiosity to know more  this is said mildred because you are unaccustomed to the shocks which the tongue of rude man may give your sensitive feelings  unaccustomed said mildred trembling so that the weakness was apparent to her companion unaccustomed alas admiral bluewater can this be so after what you have seen and heard  pardon me dear child nothing was farther from my thoughts than to wish to revive those unpleasant recollections if i thought i should be forgiven i might venture yet to reveal my secret for never beforethough i cannot tell the reason of so sudden and so extraordinary an interest in one who is almost a stranger  nononot a stranger dear sir after all that has passed today after you have been admitted though it were by accident to one most sacred secretafter all that was said in the carriage and the terrible scenes my beloved mother went through in your presence so many years since you can never be a stranger to us whatever may be your own desire to fancy yourself one  girl you do not fascinateyou do not charm me but you bind me to you in a way i did not think it in the power of any human being to subjugate my feelings  this was said with so much energy that mildred dropped the arm she held and actually recoiled a step if not in alarm at least in surprise but on looking up into the face of her companion and perceiving large tears actually glistening on his cheek and seeing the hair that exposure and mental cares had whitened more than time all her confidence returned and she resumed the place she had abandoned of her own accord and as naturally as a daughter would have clung to the side of a father  i am sure sir my gratitude for this interest ought to be quite equal to the honour it does me mildred said earnestly and now admiral bluewater do not hesitate to speak to me with the frankness that a parent might use i will listen with the respect and deference of a daughter  then do listen to what i have to say and make no answer if you find yourself wounded at the freedom i am taking it would seem that there is but one subject on which a man old fellow or young fellow can speak to a lovely young girl when he gets her alone under the light of a fine moonand that is love nay start not again my dear for if i am about to speak on so awkward a subject it is not in my own behalf i hardly know whether you will think it in behalf of any one as what i have to say is not an appeal to your affections but a warning against bestowing them  a warning admiral bluewater do you really think that can be necessary  nay my child that is best known to yourself of one thing i am certain the young man i have in my eye affects to admire you whether he does or not and when young women are led to believe they are loved it is a strong appeal to all their generous feelings to answer the passion if not with equal warmth at least with something very like it  affects to admire sirand why should any one be at the pains of affecting feelings towards me that they do not actually entertain i have neither rank nor money to bribe any one to be guilty of an hypocrisy so mean and which in my ease would be so motiveless  yes if it were motiveless to win the most beautiful creature in england but no matter we will not stop to analyze motives when facts are what we aim at i should think there must be some passion in this youths suit and that will only make it so much the more dangerous to its object at all events i feel a deep conviction that he is altogether unworthy of you this is a bold expression of opinion on an acquaintance of a day but there are such reasons for it that a man of my time of life if unprejudiced can scarcely be deceived  all this is very singular sir and i had almost used your own word of alarming replied mildred slightly agitated by curiosity but more amused i shall be as frank as yourself and say that you judge the gentleman harshly mr rotherham may not have all the qualities that a clergyman ought to possess but he is far from being a bad man good or bad however it is not probable that he will carry his transient partiality any farther than he has gone already  mr rotherhami have neither thought nor spoken of the pious vicar at all  mildred was now sadly confused mr rotherham had made his proposals for her only the day before and he had been mildly but firmly refused the recent occurrence was naturally uppermost in her mind and the conjecture that her rejected suitor under the influence of wine might have communicated the state of his wishes or what he fancied to be the state of his wishes to her companion was so very easy that she had fallen into the error almost without reflection  i beg pardon siri really imagined the confused girl answered but it was a natural mistake for me to suppose you meant mr rotherham as he is the only person who has ever spoken to my mother on the subject of any thing like a preference for me  i should have less fear of those who spoke to your mother mildred than of those who spoke only to you as i hate ambiguity however i will say at once that my allusion was to mr wychecombe  mr wychecombe admiral bluewaterand the veteran felt the arm that leaned on him tremble violently a sad confirmation of even more than he apprehended or he would not have been so abrupt surelysurelythe warning you mean cannot ought not to apply to a gentleman of mr wychecombes standing and character  such is the world miss dutton and we old seamen in particular get to know it whether willingly or not my sudden interest in you the recollection of former but painful scenes and the events of the day have made me watchful and you will add boldbut i am resolved to speak even at the risk of disobliging you for everand in speaking i must say that i never met with a young man who has made so unfavourable an impression on me as this same mr wychecombe  mildred unconsciously to herself withdrew her arm and she felt astonished at her own levity in so suddenly becoming sufficiently intimate with a stranger to permit him thus to disparage a confirmed friend  i am sorry sir that you entertain so indifferent an opinion of one who is i believe a general favourite in this part of the country she answered with a coldness that rendered her manner marked  i perceive i shall share the fate of all unwelcome counsellors but can only blame my own presumption mildred we live in momentous times and god knows what is to happen to myself in the next few months but so strong is the inexplicable interest that i feel in your welfare that i shall venture still to offend i like not this mr wychecombe who is so devout an admirer of yoursreal or affectedand as to the liking of dependants for the heir of a considerable estate it is so much a matter of course that i count it nothing  the heir of a considerable estate repeated mildred in a voice to which the natural sweetness returned quietly resuming the arm she had so unceremoniously droppedsurely dear sir you are not speaking of mr thomas wychecombe sir wycherlys nephew  of whom else should i speakhas he not been your shadow the whole dayso marked in his attentions as scarce to deem it necessary to conceal his suit  has it really struck you thus siri confess i did not so consider it we are so much at home at the hall that we rather expect all of that family to be kind to us but whether you are right in your conjecture or not mr thomas wychecombe can never be ought to meand as proof admiral bluewater that i take your warning as it is meant in kindness and sincerity i will add that he is not a very particular favourite  i rejoice to hear it now there is his namesake our young lieutenant as gallant and as noble a fellow as ever livedwould to heaven be was not so wrapt up in his profession as to be insensible to any beauties but those of a ship were you my own daughter mildred i could give you to that lad with as much freedom as i would give him my estate were he my son  mildred smiledand it was archly though not without a shade of sorrow toobut she had sufficient selfcommand to keep her feelings to herself and too much maiden reserve not to shrink from betraying her weakness to one who after all was little more than a stranger  i dare say sir she answered with an equivocation which was perhaps venial that your knowledge of the world has judged both these gentlemen rightly mr thomas wychecombe notwithstanding all you heard from my poor father is not likely to think seriously of me and i will answer for my own feelings as regards him i am in no manner a proper person to become lady wychecombe and i trust i should have the prudence to decline the honour were it even offered to me believe me sir my father would have held a different language tonight had it not been for sir wycherlys wine and the many loyal toasts that were drunk he must be conscious in his reflecting moments that a child of his is unsuited to so high a station our prospects in life were once better than they are now admiral bluewater but they have never been such as to raise these high expectations in us  an officers daughter may always claim to be a gentlewoman my dear and as such you might become the wife of a duke did he love you since i find my warning unnecessary however we will change the discourse did not something extraordinary occur at this cliff this morning and in connection with this very mr thomas wychecombe sir gervaise was my informant but he did not relate the matter very clearly  mildred explained the mistake and then gave a vivid description of the danger in which the young lieutenant had been placed as well as of the manner in which he had extricated himself she particularly dwelt on the extraordinary presence of mind and resolution by means of which he had saved his life when the stone first gave way beneath his foot  all this is well and what i should have expected from so active and energetic a youth returned the rearadmiral a little gravely but i confess i would rather it had not happened your inconsiderate and reckless young men who risk their necks idly in places of this sort seldom have much in them after all had there been a motive it would have altered the case  oh but there was a motive sir he was far from doing so silly a thing for nothing  and what was the motive prayi can see no sufficient reason why a man of sense should trust his person over a cliff as menacing as this one may approach it by moonlight but in the day i confess to you i should not fancy standing as near it as we do at this moment  mildred was much embarrassed for an answer her own heart told her wycherlys motive but that it would never do to avow to her companion great as was the happiness she felt in avowing it to herself gladly would she have changed the discourse but as this could not be done she yielded to her native integrity of character and told the truth as far as she told any thing  the flowers that grow on the sunny side of these rocks admiral bluewater are singularly fragrant and beautiful she said and hearing my mother and myself speaking of them and how much the former delighted in them though they were so seldom to be had he just ventured over the cliffnot here where it is so very perpendicular but yonder where one may cling to it very well with a little careand it was in venturing a littlejust a very little too far he told me himself sir today after dinnerthat the stone broke and the accident occurred i do not think mr wycherly wychecombe in the least foolhardy and not at all disposed to seek a silly admiration by a silly exploit  he has a most lovely and a most eloquent advocate returned the admiral smiling though the expression of his countenance was melancholy even to sadness and he is acquitted i think few men of his years would hesitate about risking their necks for flowers so fragrant and beautiful and so much coveted by your mother mildred  and he a sailor sir who thinks so little of standing on giddy places and laughs at fears of this nature  quite true though there are few cliffs on board ship ropes are our sources of courage  so i should think by what passed today returned mildred laughing mr wycherly called out for a rope and we just threw him one to help him out of his difficulty the moment he got his rope though it was only yonder small signalhalyards he felt himself as secure as if he stood up here on the height with acres of level ground around him i do not think he was frightened at any time but when he got hold of that little rope he was fairly valiant  mildred endeavoured to laugh at her own history by way of veiling her interest in the event but her companion was too old and too discerning to be easily deceived he continued silent as he led her away from the cliff and when he entered the cottage mildred saw by the nearer light of the candles that his countenance was still sad  admiral bluewater remained half an hour longer in the cottage when he tore himself away from a society which for him possessed a charm that he could not account for nor yet scarcely estimate it was past one when he bid mrs dutton and her daughter adieu promising however to see them again before the fleet sailed late as it was the mother and mildred felt no disposition to retire after the exciting scenes they had gone through but feeling a calm on their spirits succeeding the rude interruption produced by duttons brutality they walked out on the cliff to enjoy the cool air and the bland scenery of the headland at that witching hour  i should feel alarm at this particularity of attention from most men my child observed the prudent mother as they left the house but the years and especially the character of admiral bluewater are pledges that he meditates nothing foolish nor wrong  his years would be sufficient mother cried mildred laughingfor her laugh came easily since the opinion she had just before heard of wycherlys meritleaving the character out of the question  for you perhaps mildred but not for himself men rarely seem to think themselves too old to win the young of our sex and what they want in attraction they generally endeavour to supply by flattery and artifice but i acquit our new friend of all that  had he been my own father dearest mother his language and the interest he took in me could not have been more paternal i have found it truly delightful to listen to such counsel from one of his sex for in general they do not treat me in so sincere and fatherly a manner  mrs duttons lip quivered her eyelids trembled too and a couple of tears fell on her cheeks  it is new to you mildred to listen to the language of disinterested affection and wisdom from one of his years and sex i do not censure your listening with pleasure but merely tell you to remember the proper reserve of your years and character hist there are the sounds of his barges oars  mildred listened and the measured but sudden jerk of oars in the rullocks ascended on the still nightair as distinctly as they might have been heard in the boat at the next instant an eightoared barge moved swiftly out from under the cliff and glided steadily on towards a ship that had one lantern suspended from the end of her gaff another in her mizzentop and the small nightflag of a rearadmiral fluttering at her mizzenroyalmasthead the cutter lay nearest to the landing and as the barge approached her the ladies heard the loud hail of boatahoy the answer was also audible though given in the mild gentlemanlike voice of bluewater himself it was simply rearadmirals flag a deathlike stillness succeeded this annunciation of the rank of the officer in the passing boat interrupted only by the measured jerk of the oars once or twice indeed the keen hearing of mildred made her fancy she heard the common dip of the eight oars and the wash of the water as they rose from the element to gain a renewed purchase as each vessel was approached however the hail and the answer were renewed the quiet of midnight in every instance succeeding at length the barge was seen shooting along on the quarter of the c√¶sar the rearadmirals own ship and the last hail was given this time there was a slight stir in the vessel and soon after the sound of the oars ceased the lanterns descended from the stations they had held since nightfall two or three other lanterns were still displayed at the gaffs of other vessels the signs that their captains were not on board though whether they were ashore or visiting in the fleet were facts best known to themselves the plantagenet however had no light it being known that sir gervaise did not intend to come off that night  when all this was over mrs dutton and mildred sought their pillows after an exciting day and to them one far more momentous than they were then aware of     chapter xi      when i consider life tis all a cheat     yet foold with hope men favour the deceit     trust on and think tomorrow will repay     tomorrows falser than the former day           dryden   although admiral bluewater devoted the minimum of time to sleep he was not what the french term matinal there is a period in the morning on board of a ship of warthat of washing deckswhich can best be compared to the discomfort of the american purification yelepd a housecleaning this occurs daily about the rising of the sun and no officer whose rank raises him above mingling with the duty ever thinks except on extraordinary occasions that may require his presence for other purposes of intruding on its sacred mysteries it is a rabid hour in a ship and the wisest course for all idlers and all watchofficers who are not on duty is to keep themselves under hatches if their convenience will possibly allow it he who wears a flag however is usually reposing in his cot at this critical moment or if risen at all he is going through similar daily ablutions of his own person  admiral bluewater was in the act of opening his eyes when the splash of the first bucket of water was heard on the deck of the c√¶sar and he lay in the species of enjoyment which is so peculiar to naval men after they have risen to the station of commander a sort of semitrance in which the mind summons all the ancient images connected with squalls reefing topsails in the rain standing on the quarter of a yard shouting haul out to leeward peering over the weather hammockcloths to eye the weather with the sleet pricking the face like needlesand washing decks these dreamy images of the past however are summoned merely to increase the sense of present enjoyment they are so many wellcontrived foils to give greater brilliancy to the diamonds of a comfortable cot and the entire consciousness of being no longer exposed to an untimely summons on deck  our rearadmiral nevertheless was not a vulgar dreamer on such occasions he thought little of personal comforts at any time unless indeed when personal discomforts obtruded themselves on his attention he knew little or nothing of the table whereas his friend was a knowing cook and in his days of probation had been a distinguished caterer but he was addicted to a sort of dreaming of his own even when the sun stood in the zenith and he was walking the poop in the midst of a circle of his officers still he could not refrain from glancing back at the past that morning as plash after plash was heard and recalling the time when magna pars quorum fuit at this delectable instant the ruddy face of a young gentleman appeared in his stateroom door and first ascertaining that the eyes of his superior were actually open the youngster said  a note from sir gervaise admiral bluewater  very well sirtaking the notehows the wind lord geoffrey  an irishmans hurricane sir right up and down our first says sir he never knew finer channel weather  our first is a great astrologer is the fleet riding flood yet  no sir its slackwater or rather the ebb is just beginning to make  go on deck my lord and see if the dover has hove in any upon her larboard bower so as to bring her more on our quarter  ayaysir and this cadet of one of the most illustrious houses of england skipped up the ladder to ascertain this fact  in the mean while bluewater stretched out an arm drew a curtain from before his little window fumbled for some time among his clothes before he got his spectacles and then opened the note this early epistle was couched in the following words       dear blue       i write this in a bed big enough to ware a ninety in ive been      athwart ships half the night without knowing it galleygo has just      been in to report our fleet all well and the ships riding flood      it seems there is a good lookout from the top of the house where      part of the roads are visible magrath and the rest of them have      been at poor sir wycherly all night i learn but he remains down      by the head yet i am afraid the good old man will never be in      trim again i shall remain here until something is decided and as      we cannot expect our orders until next day after tomorrow at the      soonest one might as well be here as on board come ashore and      breakfast with us when we can consult about the propriety of      remaining or of abandoning the wreck adieu       oakes      rearadmiral bluewater       psthere was a little occurrence last night connected with sir      thomas wycherlys will that makes me particularly anxious to see      you as early as possible this morning       o  sir gervaise like a woman had written his mind in his postscript the scene of the previous night had forcibly presented itself to his recollection on awakening and calling for his writingdesk he had sent off this note at the dawn of day with the wish of having as many important witnesses as he could well obtain at the interview he intended to demand at the earliest practicable hour  what the deuce can oakes have to do with sir wycherly wychecombes will thought the rearadmiral by the way that puts me in mind of my own and of my own recent determination what are my poor ¬£30000 to a man with the fortune of lord bluewater having neither a wife nor child brother nor sister of my own ill do what i please with my money oakes wont have it besides hes got enough of his own and to spare an estate of ¬£7000 a year besides heaps of prizemoney funded i dare say he has a good ¬£12000 a year and nothing but a nephew to inherit it all im determined to do as i please with my money i made every shilling of it and ill give it to whom i please  the whole time admiral bluewater lay with his eyes shut and with a tongue as motionless as if it couldnt stir with all his laissez aller manner however he had the promptitude of a sailor when his mind was made up to do a thing though he always performed it in his own peculiar mode to rise dress and prepare to quit his stateroom occupied him but a short time and he was seated before his own writingdesk in the aftercabin within twenty minutes after the thoughts just recorded had passed through his mind his first act was to take a folded paper from a private drawer and glance his eye carelessly over it this was the will in favour of lord bluewater it was expressed in very concise terms filling only the first side of a page this will he copied verbatim et literatim leaving blanks for the name of the legatee and appointing sir gervaise oakes his executor as in the will already executed when finished in this manner he set about filling up the blanks for a passing instant he felt tempted to insert the name of the pretender but smiling at his own folly he wrote that of mildred dutton daughter of francis dutton a master in his majestys navy in all the places that it was requisite so to do then he affixed the seal and folding all the upper part of the sheet over so as to conceal the contents he rang a little silver bell which always stood at his elbow the outer cabindoor was opened by the sentry who thrust his head in at the opening  i want one of the young gentlemen sentry said the rearadmiral  the door closed and in another minute the smiling face of lord geoffrey was at the entrance of the aftercabin  whos on deck my lord demanded bluewater beside the watch  no one sir all the idlers keep as close as foxes when the decks are getting it and as for any of our snorers showing their faces before six bells its quite out of the question sir  some one must surely be stirring in the gunroom by this time go and ask the chaplain and the captain of marines to do me the favour to step into the cabinor the first lieutenant or the master or any of the idlers  the midshipman was gone two or three minutes when he returned with the purser and the chaplain  the first lieutenant is in the forehold sir all the marines have got their deadlights still in and the master is workingup his log the gunroom steward says i hope these will do sir they are the greatest idlers in the ship i believe  lord geoffrey cleveland was the second son of the third duke in the english empire and he knew it as well as any one on board admiral bluewater had no slavish respect for rank nevertheless like all men educated under an aristocratic system he was influenced by the feeling to a degree of which he himself was far from being conscious this young scion of nobility was not in the least favoured in matters of duty for this his own high spirit would have resented but he dined in the cabin twice as often as any other midshipman on board and had obtained for himself a sort of license for the tongue that emboldened him to utter what passed for smart things in the cockpit and gunroom and which out of all doubt were pert things everywhere neither the chaplain nor the purser took offence at his liberties on the present occasion and as for the rearadmiral he had not attended to what had been uttered as soon however as he found others in his cabin he motioned to them to approach his desk and pointed to the paper folded down as mentioned  every prudent man he said and especially every prudent sailor and soldier in a time of war ought to be provided with a will this is mine just drawn up by myself and that instrument is an old one which i now destroy in your presence i acknowledge this to be my hand and seal writing his name and touching the seal with a finger as he spoke affixed to this my last will and testament will you have the kindness to act as witnesses  when the chaplain and purser had affixed their names there still remained a space for a third signature this by a sign from his superior the laughing midshipman filled with his own signature  i hope youve recollected sir cried the boy with glee as he took his seat to obey that the bluewaters and clevelands are related i shall be grievously disappointed when this will is proved if my name be not found somewhere in it  so shall i too my lord drily returned bluewater for i fully expect it will appear as a witness a character that is at once fatal to all claims as a legatee  well sir i suppose flagofficers can do pretty much as they please with their money since they do pretty much as they please with the ships and all in them i must lean so much the harder on my two old aunts as i appear to have laid myself directly athwarthawse of fortune in this affair  gentlemen said the rearadmiral with easy courtesy i regret it is not in my power to have your company at dinner today as i am summoned ashore by sir gervaise and it is uncertain when i can get off again but tomorrow i shall hope to enjoy that pleasure  the officers bowed expressed their acknowledgments accepted the invitation bowed once or twice more each and left the cabin with the exception of the midshipman  well sir exclaimed bluewater a little surprised at finding he was not alone after a minute of profound reverie to what request am i indebted still for the pleasure of your presence  why sir its just forty miles to my fathers house in cornwall and i know the whole family is there so i just fancied that by bending on two extra horses a chaise might make the park gates in about five hours and by getting under way on the return passage tomorrow about this time the old c√¶sar would never miss a crazy reefer more or less  very ingeniously put young gentleman and quite plausible when i was of your age i was four years without once seeing either father or mother  yes sir but that was such a long time ago boys cant stand it half as well now as they did then as all old people say  the rearadmirals lips moved slightly as if a smile struggled about his mouth then his face suddenly lost the expression in one approaching to sadness  you know geoffrey i am not commanderinchief sir gervaise alone can give a furlough  very true sir but whatever you ask of sir gervaise he always does more especially as concerns us of your flagship  perhaps that is true but my boy we live in serious times and we may sail at an hours notice are you ignorant that prince charles edward has landed in scotland and that the jacobites are up and doing if the french back him we may have our hands full here in the channel  then my dear mother must go without a kiss for the next twelvemonth cried the gallant boy dashing a hand furtively across his eyes in spite of his resolution the throne of old england must be upheld even though not a mother nor a sister in the island see a midshipman in years  nobly said lord geoffrey and it shall be known at headquarters your family is whig and you do well at your time of life to stick to the family politics  a small run on the shore sir would be a great pleasure after six months at sea  you must ask captain stowels leave for that you know i never interfere with the duty of the ship  yes sir but there are so many of us and all have a hankering after terra firma might i just say that i have your permission to ask captain stowel to let me have a run on the cliffs  you may do that my lord if you wish it but stowel knows that he can do as he pleases  he would be a queer captain of a manofwar if he didnt sir thank you admiral bluewater i will write to my mother and i know shell be satisfied with the reason i shall give her for not coming to see her goodmorning sir  goodmorningthen when the boys hand was on the lock of the cabindoormy lord  did you wish to say any thing more sir  when you write remember me kindly to the duchess we were intimate when young people and i might say loved each other  the midshipman promised to do as desired then the rearadmiral was left alone he walked the cabin for half an hour musing on what he had done in relation to his property and on what he ought to do in relation to the pretender when he suddenly summoned his coxswain gave a few directions and sent an order on deck to have his barge manned the customary reports went their usual rounds and reached the cabin in about three minutes more lord geoffrey bringing them down again  the barge is manned sir said the lad standing near the cabindoor rigged out in the neat goashoreclothes of a midshipman  have you seen captain stowel my lord demanded the rearadmiral  i have sir and he has given me permission to drift along shore until sunset to be off with the evening gun of the viceadmiral  then do me the favour to take a seat in my barge if you are quite ready  this offer was accepted and in a few minutes all the ceremonies of the deck had been observed and the rearadmiral was seated in his barge it was now so late that etiquette had fair play and no point was omitted on the occasion the captain was on deck in person as well as gunroom officers enough to represent their body the guard was paraded under its officers the drums rolled the boatswain piped six side boys over and lord geoffrey skipped down first into the boat remaining respectfully standing until his superior was seated all these punctilios observed the boat was shoved off from the vessels side the eight oars dropped as one and the party moved towards the shore every cutter barge yawl or launch that was met and which did not contain an officer of rank itself tossed its oars as this barge with the rearadmirals flag fluttering in its bow passed while the others lay on theirs the gentlemen saluting with their hats in this manner the barge passed the fleet and approached the shore at the landing a little natural quay formed by a low flat rock there was a general movement as the rearadmirals flag was seen to draw near and even the boats of captains were shoved aside to give the naval pas as soon however as the foot of bluewater touched the rock the little flag was struck and a minute later a cutter with only a lieutenant in her coming in that officer ordered the barge to make way for him with an air of high and undisputed authority  perhaps there was not a man in the british marine to whom the etiquette of the service gave less concern than to bluewater in this respect he was the very reverse of his friend for sir gervaise was a punctilious observer and a rigid enforcer of all the prescribed ceremonials this was by no means the only professional point on which these two distinguished officers differed it has already been mentioned that the rearadmiral was the best tactician in england while the viceadmiral was merely respectable in that branch of his duty on the other hand sir gervaise was deemed the best practical seaman afloat so far as a single ship was concerned while bluewater had no particular reputation in that way then as to discipline the same distinction existed the commanderinchief was a little of a martinet exacting compliance with the most minute regulations while his friend even when a captain had thrown the police duty of his ship very much on what is called the executive officer or the first lieutenant leaving to that important functionary the duty of devising as well as of executing the system by which order and cleanliness were maintained in the vessel nevertheless bluewater had his merit even in this peculiar feature of the profession he had made the best captain of the fleet to his friend that had ever been met with this office which in some measure corresponds to that of an adjutantgeneral on shore was suited to his generalizing and philosophical turn of mind and he had brought all its duties within the circle and control of clear and simple principles which rendered them pleasant and easy then too whenever he commanded in chief as frequently happened for a week or two at a time sir gervaise being absent it was remarked that the common service of the fleet went on like clockwork his mind seeming to embrace generals when it refused to descend to details in consequence of these personal peculiarities the captains often observed that bluewater ought to have been the senior and oakes the junior and then their joint commands would have produced perfection but these criticisms must be set down in a great measure to the natural propensity to find fault and an inherent desire in men even when things are perfectly well in themselves to prove their own superiority by pointing out modes and means by which they might be made much better had the service been on land this opinion might possibly have had more practical truth in it but the impetuosity and daring of sir gervaise were not bad substitutes for tactics in the straightforward combats of ships to resume the narrative  when bluewater landed he returned the profound and general salute of all on or near the rock by a sweeping but courteous bow which was nevertheless given in a vacant slovenly manner and immediately began to ascend the ravine he had actually reached the grassy acclivity above before he was at all aware of any persons being near him turning he perceived that the midshipman was at his heels respect alone preventing one of the latters active limbs and years from skipping past his superior on the ascent the admiral recollected how little there was to amuse one of the boys habits in a place like wychecombe and he goodnaturedly determined to take him along with himself  you are little likely to find any diversion here lord geoffrey he said if you will accept of the society of a dull old fellow like myself you shall see all i see be it more or less  ive shipped for the cruise sir and am ready and happy too to follow your motions with or without signals returned the laughing youngster i suppose wychecombe is about as good as portsmouth or plymouth and im sure these green fields are handsomer than the streets of any dirty town i ever entered  ay green fields are indeed pleasant to the eyes of us sailors who see nothing but water for months at a time turn to the right if you please my lord i wish to call at yonder signalstation on my way to the hall  the boy as is not usual with lads of his age inclined in the way he was told to go and in a few minutes both stood on the headland as it would not have done for the master to be absent from his staff during the day with a fleet in the roads dutton was already at his post cleanly dressed as usual but trembling again with the effect of the last nights debauch on his nerves he arose with great deference of manner to receive the rearadmiral and not without many misgivings of conscience for while memory furnished a tolerable outline of what had occurred in the interview between himself and his wife and daughter wine had lost its influence and no longer helped to sustain his selfcommand he was much relieved however by the discreet manner in which he was met by bluewater  how is sir wycherly inquired the admiral saluting the master as if nothing had happened a note from sir gervaise written about daybreak tells me he was not then essentially better  i wish it were in my power to give you any good news sir he must be conscious notwithstanding for dick his groom has just ridden over with a note from mr rotherham to say that the excellent old baronet particularly desires to see my wife and daughter and that the coach will be here to take them over in a few minutes if you are bound to the hall this morning sir im certain the ladies would be delighted to give you a seat  then i will profit by their kindness returned bluewater seating himself on the bench at the foot of the staff more especially if you think they will excuse my adding lord geoffrey cleveland one of stowels midshipmen to the party he has entered to follow my motions with or without signals  dutton uncovered again and bowed profoundly at this announcement of the lads name and rank the boy himself taking the salute in an offhand and indifferent way like one already wearied with vulgar adulation while he gazed about him with some curiosity at the headland and flagstaff  this a good lookout sir observed the midshipman and one that is somewhat loftier than our crosstrees a pair of sharp eyes might see every thing that passes within twenty miles and as a proof of it i shall be the first to sing out sail ho  whereaway my young lord said dutton fidgeting as if he had neglected his duty in the presence of a superior im sure your lordship can see nothing but the fleet at anchor and a few boats passing between the different ships and the landing  whereaway sure enough youngster added the admiral i see some gulls glancing along the surface of the water a mile or two outside the ships but nothing like a sail  the boy caught up duttons glass which lay on the seat and in a minute he had it levelled at the expanse of water it was some little time and not without much sighting along the barrel of the instrument that he got it to suit himself  well master sharpeyes said bluewater drily is it a frenchman or a spaniard  hold on a moment sir until i can get this awkward glass to bear on itaynow i have hershes but a speck at the bestroyals and head of topgallantsailsno sir by george its our own cutter the active with her squaresail set and the heads of her lower sails just rising i know her by the way she carries her gaff  the activethat betokens news observed bluewater thoughtfullyfor the march of events at that moment must necessarily brink on a crisis in his own career sir gervaise sent her to look into cherbourg  yes sir we all know thatand there she comes to tell us i hope that monsieur de vervillin has at last made up his mind to come out and face us like a man will you look at the sail sir  bluewater took the glass and sweeping the horizon he soon caught a view of his object a short survey sufficed for one so experienced and he handed the glass back to the boy  you have quick eyes sir he said as he did so that is a cutter certainly standing in for the roads and i believe you may be right in taking her for the active  tis a long way to know so small a craft observed dutton who also took his look at the stranger  very true sir answered the boy but one ought to tell a friend as far as he can see him the active carries a longer and a lower gaff than any other cutter in the navy which is the way we all tell her from the gnat the cutter we have with us  i am glad to find your lordship is so close an observer returned the complaisant dutton a certain sign my lord that your lordship will make a good sailor in time  geoffrey is a good sailor already observed the admiral who knew that the youngster was never better pleased than when he dropped the distance of using his title and spoke to or of him as of a connection which in truth he was he has now been with me four years having joined when he was only twelve two more years will make an officer of him  yes sir said dutton bowing first to one and then to the other yes sir his lordship may well look forward to that with his particular merit your esteemed favour and his own great name ah sir theyve caught a sight of the stranger in the fleet and bunting is at work already  in anchoring his ships admiral bluewater had kept them as close together as the fog rendered safe for one of the great difficulties of a naval commander is to retain his vessels in compact order in thick or heavy weather orders had been given however for a sloop and a frigate to weigh and stretch out into the offing a league or two as soon as the fog left them the preceding day in order to sweep as wide a reach of the horizon as was convenient in order to maintain their ground in a light wind and with a strong tide running these two cruisers had anchored one at the distance of a league from the fleet and the other a mile or two farther outside though more to the eastward the sloop lay nearest to the stranger and signals were flying at her mainroyalmasthead which the frigate was repeating and transmitting to the flagship of the commanderinchief bluewater was so familiar with all the ordinary signals that it was seldom he had recourse to his book for the explanations and in the present instance he saw at once that it was the actives number that was shown other signals however followed which it surpassed the rearadmirals knowledge to read without assistance from all which he was satisfied that the stranger brought intelligence of importance and which could only be understood by referring to the private signalbook  while these facts were in the course of occurrence the coach arrived to convey mrs dutton and mildred to the hall bluewater now presented himself to the ladies and was received as kindly as they had separated from him a few hours before nor were the latter displeased at hearing he was to be their companion back to the dwelling of sir wycherly  i fear this summons bodes evil tidings said mrs dutton he would hardly think of desiring to see us unless something quite serious were on his mind and the messenger said he was no better  we shall learn all my dear lady when we reach the hall returned bluewater and the sooner we reach it the sooner our doubts will be removed before we enter the carriage let me make you acquainted with my young friend lord geoffrey cleveland whom i have presumed to invite to be of the party  the handsome young midshipman was well received though mrs dutton had been too much accustomed in early life to see people of condition to betray the same deference as her husband for the boys rank the ladies occupied as usual the hind seat of the coach leaving that in front to their male companions the arrangement accidentally brought mildred and the midshipman opposite each other a circumstance that soon attracted the attention of the admiral in a way that was a little odd if not remarkable there is a charm in youth that no other period of life possesses infancy with its helpless beauty scarcely seizing upon the imagination and senses with an equal force both the young persons in question possessed this advantage in a high degree and had there been no other peculiarity the sight might readily have proved pleasing to one of bluewaters benevolence and truth of feeling the boy was turned of sixteen an age in england when youth does not yet put on the appearance of manhood and he retained all the evidences of a gay generous boyhood rendered a little piquant by the dash of archness roguery and fun that a manofwar is tolerably certain to impart to a lad of spirit nevertheless his countenance retained an expression of ingenuousness and of sensitive feeling that was singularly striking in one of his sex and which in spite of her beauty of feature hair and complexion formed the strongest attraction in the loveliness of mildred that expression which had so much struck and charmed bluewaterhaunted him we might addsince the previous day by appearing so familiar even while so extraordinary and for which he had been unable to recollect a counterpart as she now sat face to face with lord geoffrey to his great surprise the rearadmiral found much of the same character of this very expression in the handsome boy as in the lovely girl it is true the look of ingenuousness and of sensitive feeling was far less marked in young cleveland than in mildred and there was little general resemblance of feature or countenance between the two still the first was to be found in both and so distinctly as to be easily traced when placed in so close contact geoffrey cleveland had the reputation of being like his mother and furnished with this clue the fact suddenly flashed on bluewaters mind that the being whom mildred so nearly and strikingly resembled was a deceased sister of the duchess and a beloved cousin of his own miss hedworth the young lady in question had long been dead but all who had known her retained the most pleasing impressions equally of her charms of person and of mind between her and bluewater there had existed a tender friendship in which however no shade of passion had mingled a circumstance that was in part owing to the difference in their years captain bluewater having been nearly twice his young relatives age and in part probably to the invincible manner in which the latter seemed wedded to his profession and his ship agnes hedworth notwithstanding had been very dear to our sailor from a variety of causesfar more so than her sister the duchess though she was a favouriteand the rearadmiral when his mind glanced rapidly through the chain of association that traced the accidental resemblance of mildred to this esteemed object had a sincere delight in finding he had thus been unconsciously attracted by one whose every look and smile now forcibly reminded him of the countenance of a being whom in her day he had thought so near perfection this delight however was blended with sadness on various accounts and the short excursion proved to be so melancholy that no one was sorry when it terminated     chapter xii      nath truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly varied     like a scholar at the least but sir i assure ye it was a buck of     the first head      hol sir nathaniel haud credo      bull twas not a haud credo twas a pricket           lovers labour lost   every appearance of the jolly negligence which had been so characteristic of life at wychecombehall had vanished when the old coach drew up in the court to permit the party it had brought from the station to alight as no one was expected but mrs dutton and her daughter not even a footman appeared to open the door of the carriage the vulgarminded usually revenging their own homage to the powerful by manifesting as many slights as possible to the weak galleygo let the newcomers out and consequently he was the first person of whom inquiries were made as to the state of things in the house  well said admiral bluewater looking earnestly at the steward how is sir wycherly and what is the news  sir wycherly is still on the doctors list your honour and i expects his case is set down as a hard un wes as well as can be expected and altogether in good heart sir jarvy turned out with the sun thof he didnt turn in till the middlewatch was half goneor two bells as they calls em aboard this housefour bells as we should say in the old planterand chickens i hears has riz a shillin a head since our first boat landed  its a melancholy business mrs dutton i fear there can be little hope  yes its all that admiral blue continued galleygo following the party into the house no one but himself hearing a word he uttered and twill be worse afore its any better they tells me potaties has taken a start too and as all the bys of all the young gentlemen in the fleet is out like so many wild locusts of hegypt i expects nothing better than as our mess will fare as bad as sogers on a retreat  in the hall tom wychecombe and his namesake the lieutenant met the party from the formal despondency of the first every thing they apprehended was confirmed the last however was more cheerful and not altogether without hope as he did not hesitate openly to avow  for myself i confess i think sir wycherly much better he said although the opinion is not sanctioned by that of the medical men his desiring to see these ladies is favourable and then cheering news for him has been brought back already by the messenger sent only eight hours since for his kinsman sir reginald wychecombe he has sensibly revived since that report was brought in  ah my dear namesake rejoined tom shaking his head mournfully you cannot know my beloved uncles constitution and feelings as well as i rely on it the medical men are right and your hopes deceive you the sending for mrs dutton and miss mildred both of whom my honoured uncle respects and esteems looks more like leavetaking than any thing else and as to sir reginald wychecombethough a relative beyond a questioni think there has been some mistake in sending for him since he is barely an acquaintance of the elder branch of the family and he is of the halfblood  half what mr thomas wychecombe demanded the viceadmiral so suddenly behind the speaker as to cause all to start sir gervaise having hastened to meet the ladies and his friend as soon as he knew of their arrival i ask pardon sir for my abrupt inquiry but as i was the means of sending for sir reginald wychecombe i feel an interest in knowing his exact relationship to my host  tom started and even paled at this sudden question then the colour rushed into his temples he became calmer and replied  halfblood sir gervaise he said steadily this is an affinity that puts a person altogether out of the line of succession and of course removes any necessity or wish to see sir reginald  halfbloodhey atwood muttered the viceadmiral turning away towards his secretary who had followed him down stairs this may be the solution after all do you happen to know what halfblood means it cannot signify that sir reginald comes from one of those who have no fatherall their ancestry consisting only of a mother  i should think not sir gervaise in that case sir reiginald would scarcely be considered of so honourable a lineage as he appears to be i have not the smallest idea sir what halfblood means and perhaps it may not be amiss to inquire of the medical gentlemen magrath is up stairs possibly he can tell us  i rather think it has something to do with the law if this outoftheway place now could furnish even a lubberly attorney we might learn all about it harkee atwood you must stand by to make sir wycherlys will if he says any thing more about ithave you got the heading all written out as i desired  it is quite ready sir gervaisebeginning as usual in the name of god amen i have even ventured so far as to describe the testators style and residence c ci sir wycherly wychecombe bart of wychecombe hall devon do make and declare this to be my last will and testament c c nothing is wanting but the devises as the lawyers call them i can manage a will well enough sir gervaise i believe one of mine has been in the courts now these five years and they tell me it sticks there as well as if it had been drawn in the middle temple  ay i know your skill still there can be no harm in just asking magrath though i think it must be law after all run up and ask him atwood and bring me the answer in the drawingroom where i see bluewater has gone with his convoy andharkeetell the surgeons to let us know the instant the patient says any thing about his temporal affairs the twenty thousand in the funds are his to do what he pleases with let the land be tied up as it may  while this aside was going on in the hall bluewater and the rest of the party had entered a small parlour that was in constant use still conversing of the state of sir wycherly as all of them but the two young men were ignorant of the nature of the message to sir reginald wychecombe and of the intelligence in connection with that gentleman which had just been received mrs dutton ventured to ask an explanation which was given by wycherly with a readiness that proved he felt no apprehensions on the subject  sir wycherly desired to see his distant relative sir reginald said the lieutenant and the messenger who was sent to request his attendance fortunately learned from a postboy that the hertfordshire baronet in common with many other gentlemen is travelling in the west just at this moment and that he slept last night at a house only twenty miles distant the express reached him several hours since and an answer has been received informing us that we may expect to see him in an hour or two  thus much was related by wycherly but we may add that sir reginald wychecombe was a catholic as it was then usual to term the romanists and in secret a jacobite and in common with many of that religious persuasion he was down in the west to see if a rising could not be organized in that part of the kingdom as a diversion to any attempt to repel the young pretender in the north as the utmost caution was used by the conspirators this fact was not even suspected by any who were not in the secret of the whole proceeding understanding that his relation was an inefficient old man sir reginald himself an active and sagacious intriguer had approached thus near to the old paternal residence of his family in order to ascertain if his own name and descent might not aid him in obtaining levies among the ancient tenantry of the estate that day he had actually intended to appear at wychecombe disguised and under an assumed name he proposed venturing on this step because circumstances put it in his power to give what he thought would be received as a sufficient excuse should his conduct excite comment  sir reginald wychecombe was a singular but by no means an unnatural compound of management and integrity his position as a papist had disposed him to intrigue while his position as one proscribed by religious hostility had disposed him to be a papist thousands are made men of activity and even of importance by persecution and proscription who would pass through life quietly and unnoticed if the meddling hand of human forethought did not force them into situations that awaken their hostility and quicken their powers this gentleman was a firm believer in all the traditions of his church though his learning extended little beyond his missal and he put the most implicit reliance on the absurd because improbable fiction of the nags head consecration without having even deemed it necessary to look into a particle of that testimony by which alone such a controversy could be decided in a word he was an instance of what religious intolerance has ever done and will probably for ever continue to do with so wayward a being as man  apart from this weakness sir reginald wychecombe had both a shrewd and an inquiring mind his religion he left very much to the priests but of his temporal affairs he assumed a careful and prudent supervision he was much richer than the head of the family but while he had no meannesses connected with money he had no objection to be the possessor of the old family estates of his own relation to the head of this family he was perfectly aware and the circumstance of the halfblood with all its legal consequences was no secret to him sir reginald wychecombe was not a man to be so situated without having recourse to all proper means in order as it has become the fashion of the day to express it to define his position by means of a shrewd attorney if not of his own religious at least of his own political opinions he had ascertained the fact and this from the mouth of martha herself that baron wychecombe had never married and that consequently tom and his brothers were no more heirs at law to the wychecombe estate than he was in his own person he fully understood too that there was no heir at law and that the lands must escheat unless the present owner made a will and to this last act his precise information told him that sir wycherly had an unconquerable reluctance under such circumstances it is not at all surprising that when the hertfordshire baronet was thus unexpectedly summoned to the bedside of his distant kinsman he inferred that his own claims were at length to be tardily acknowledged and that he was about to be put in possession of the estates of his legitimate ancestors it is still less wonderful that believing this he promptly promised to lose no time in obeying the summons determining momentarily to forget his political in order to look a little after his personal interests  the reader will understand of course that all these details were unknown to the inmates of the hall beyond the fact of the expected arrival of sir reginald wychecombe and that of the circumstance of the halfblood which in its true bearing was known alone to tom their thoughts were directed towards the situation of their host and little was said or done that had not his immediate condition for the object it being understood however that the surgeons kept the sick chamber closed against all visiters a silent and melancholy breakfast was taken by the whole party in waiting for the moment when they might be admitted when this cheerless meal was ended sir gervaise desired bluewater to follow him to his room whither he led the way in person  it is possible certainly that vervillin is out commenced the viceadmiral when they were alone but we shall know more about it when the cutter gets in and reports you saw nothing but her number i think you told me  she was at work with private signals when i left the headland of course i was unable to read them without the book  that vervillin is a good fellow returned sir gervaise rubbing his hands a way he had when much pleased and has stuff in him he has thirteen twodecked ships dick and that will be one apiece for our captains and a spare one for each of our flags i believe there is no threedecker in that squadron  there youve made a small mistake sir gervaise as the comte de vervillin had his flag in the largest threedecker of france le bourbon 120 the rest of his ships are like our own though much fuller manned  never mind bluenever mindwell put two on the bourbon and try to make our frigates of use besides you have a knack at keeping the fleet so compact that it is nearly a single battery  may i venture to ask then if its your intention to go out should the news by the active prove to be what you anticipate  sir gervaise cast a quick distrustful glance at the other anxious to read the motive for the question at the same time that he did not wish to betray his own feelings then he appeared to meditate on the answer  it is not quite agreeable to lie here chafing our cables with a french squadron roving the channel he said but i rather think its my duty to wait for orders from the admiralty under present circumstances  do you expect my lords will send you through the straits of dover to blockade the frith  if they do bluewater i shall hope for your company i trust a nights rest has given you different views of what ought to be a seamans duty when his country is at open war with her ancient and most powerful enemies  it is the prerogative of the crown to declare war oakes no one but a lawful sovereign can make a lawful war  ay here come your cursed distinctions about de jure and de facto again by the way dick you are something of a scholarcan you tell me what is understood by calling a man a nullus  admiral bluewater who had taken his usual lolling attitude in the most comfortable chair he could find while his more mercurial friend kept pacing the room now raised his head in surprise following the quick motions of the other with his eyes as if he doubted whether he had rightly heard the question  its plain english is it notor plain latin if you willwhat is meant by calling a man a nullus repeated sir gervaise observing the others manner  the latin is plain enough certainly returned bluewater smiling you surely do not mean nullus nulla nullum  exactly thatyouve hit it to a gendernullus nulla nullum no man no woman no thing masculine feminine neuter  i never heard the saying if ever used it must be some silly play on sounds and mean a numskullor perhaps a fling at a fellows position by saying he is a nobody who the deuce has been calling another a nullus in the presence of the commanderinchief of the southern squadron  sir wycherly wychecombeour unfortunate host here the poor man who is on his deathbed on this very floor  again bluewater raised his head and once more his eye sought the face of his friend sir gervaise had now stopped short with his hands crossed behind his back looking intently at the other in expectation of the answer  i thought it might be some difficulty from the fleetsome silly fellow complaining of another still more silly for using such a word sir wycherlythe poor mans mind must have failed him  i rather think not if it has there is method in his madness for he persevered most surprisingly in the use of the term his nephew tom wychecombe the presumptive heir he insists on it is a nullus while this sir reginald who is expected to arrive every instant he says is only halfor halfblood as it has since been explained to us  i am afraid this nephew will prove to be any thing but nullus when he succeeds to the estate and title answered bluewater gravely a more sinisterlooking scoundrel i never laid eyes on  that is just my way of thinking and not in the least like the family  this matter of likenesses is not easily explained oakes we see parents and children without any visible resemblance to each other and then we find startling likenesses between utter strangers  bachelors children may be in that predicament certainly but i should think few others i never yet studied a child that i did not find some resemblance to both parents covert and only transitory perhaps but a likeness so distinct as to establish the relationship what an accursed chance it is that our noble young lieutenant should have no claim on this old baronet while this dd nullus is both heir at law and heir of entail i never took half as much interest in any other mans estate as i take in the succession to this of our poor host  there you are mistaken oakes you took more in mine for when i made a will in your own favour and gave it to you to read you tore it in two and threw it overboard with your own hand  ay that was an act of lawful authority as your superior i countermanded that will i hope youve made another and given your money as i told you to your cousin the viscount  i did but that will has shared the fate of the first it appearing to me that we are touching on serious times and bluewater being rich already i destroyed the devise in his favour and made a new one this very morning as you are my executor as usual it may be well to let you know it  dick you have not been mad enough to cut off the head of your own familyyour own flesh and blood as it might beto leave the few thousands you own to this mad adventurer in scotland  bluewater smiled at this evidence of the familiarity of his friend with his own way of thinking and feeling and for a single instant he regretted that he had not put his first intention in force in order that the conformity of views might have been still more perfect but putting a hand in his pocket he drew out the document itself and leaning forward gave it carelessly to sir gervaise  there is the will and by looking it over you will know what ive done he said i wish you would keep it for if misery makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows revolutions reduce us often to strange plights and the paper will be safer with you than with me of course you will keep my secret until the proper time to reveal it shall arrive  the viceadmiral who knew that he had no direct interest in his friends disposition of his property took the will with a good deal of curiosity to ascertain its provisions so short a testament was soon read and his eye rested intently on the paper until it had taken in the last word then his hand dropped and he regarded bluewater with a surprise he neither affected nor wished to conceal he did not doubt his friends sanity but he greatly questioned his discretion  this is a very simple but a very ingenious arrangement to disturb the order of society he said and to convert a very modest and unpretending though lovely girl into a forward and airstaking old woman what is this mildred dutton to you that you should bequeath to her ¬£30000  she is one of the meekest most ingenuous purest and loveliest of her meek ingenuous pure and lovely sex crushed to the earth by the curse of a brutal drunken father and i am resolute to see that this world for once afford some compensation for its own miseries  never doubt that richard bluewater never doubt that so certain is vice or crime to bring its own punishment in this life that one may well question if any other hell is needed and depend on it your meek modest ingenuousness in its turn will not go unrewarded  quite true so far as the spirit is concerned but i mean to provide a little for the comfort of the body you remember agnes hedworth i take it for granted  remember herout of all question had the war left me leisure for making love she was the only woman i ever knew who could have brought me to her feeti mean as a dog dick  do you see any resemblance between her and this mildred dutton it is in the expression rather than in the featuresbut it is the expression which alone denotes the character  by george youre right bluewater and this relieves me from some embarrassment ive felt about that very expression of which you speak she is like poor agnes who became a saint earlier than any of us could have wished living or dead agnes hedworth must be an angel you were fonder of her than of any other woman i believe at one time i thought you might propose for her hand  it was not that sort of affection and you could not have known her private history or you would not have fancied this i was so situated in the way of relatives that agnes though only the child of a cousingerman was the nearest youthful female relative i had on earth and i regarded her more as a sister than as a creature who could ever become my wife she was sixteen years my junior and by the time she had become old enough to marry i was accustomed to think of her only as one destined for another station the same feeling existed as to her sister the duchess though in a greatly lessened degree  poor sweet agnesand it is on account of this accidental resemblance that you have determined to make the daughter of a drunken sailingmaster your heiress  not altogether so the will was drawn before i was conscious that the likeness existed still it has probably unknown to myself greatly disposed me to view her with favour but gervaise agnes herself was not fairer in person or more lovely in mind than this very mildred dutton  well you have not been accustomed to regard her as a sister and she has become marriageable without there having been any opportunity for your regarding her as so peculiarly sacred dick returned sir gervaise half suppressing a smile as he threw a quiet glance at his friend  you know this to be idle oakes some one must inherit my money my brother is long since dead even poor poor agnes is gone her sister dont need it bluewater is an overrich bachelor already you wont take it and what better can i do with it if you could have seen the cruel manner in which the spirits of both mother and daughter were crushed to the earth last night by that beast of a husband and father you would have felt a desire to relieve their misery even though it had cost you bowldero and half your money in the funds  umph bowldero has been in my family five centuries and is likely to remain there master bluewater five more unless indeed your dashing pretender should succeed and take it away by confiscation  there again was another inducement should i leave my cash to a rich person and should chance put me on the wrong side in this struggle the king de facto would get it all whereas even a german would not have the heart to rob a poor creature like mildred of her support  the scotch are notorious for bowels in such matters well have it your own way dick its of no great moment what you do with your prizemoney though i had supposed it would fall into the hands of this boy geoffrey cleveland who is no discredit to your blood  he will have a hundred thousand pounds at fiveandtwenty that were left him by old lady greenfield his greataunt and that is more than he will know what to do with but enough of this have you received further tidings from the north during the night  not a syllable this is a retired part of the country and half scotland might be capsized in one of its loughs and we not know of it for a week down here in devonshire should i get no intelligence or orders in the next thirtysix hours i think of posting up to london leaving you in command of the fleet  that may not be wise you would scarcely confide so important a trust in such a crisis to a man of my political feelingsi will not say opinions since you attribute all to sentiment  i would confide my life and honour to you richard bluewater with the utmost confidence in the security of both so long as it depended on your own acts or inclinations we must first see however what news the active brings us for if de vervillin is really out i shall assume that the duty of an english sailor is to beat a frenchman before all other considerations  if he can drily observed the other raising his right leg so high as to place the foot on the top of an oldfashioned chair an effort that nearly brought his back in a horizontal line  i am far from regarding it as a matter of course admiral bluewater but it has been done sufficiently often to render it an event of no very violent possibility ah here is magrath to tell us the condition of his patient  the surgeon of the plantagenet entering the room at that moment the conversation was instantly changed  well magrath said sir gervaise stopping suddenly in his quarterdeck pace what news of the poor man  he is reviving admiral oakes returned the phlegmatic surgeon but it is like the gleaming of sunshine that streams through clouds as the great luminary sets behind the hills  oh hang your poetry doctor let us have nothing but plain matteroffact this morning  well then sir gervaise as commanderinchief youll be obeyed i think sir wycherly wychecombe is suffering under an attack of apoplexyor greek apopl√™xis as the greeks had it the diagnosis of the disease is not easily mistaken though it has its affinities as well as other maladies the applications for gout or arthritissometimes produce apoplexy though one disease is seated in the head while the other usually takes refuge in the feet yell understand this the more readily gentlemen when ye reflect that as a thief is chased from one hidingplace he commonly endeavours to get into another i much misgive the prudence of the phlebotomy ye practised among ye on the first summons to the patient  what the dl does the man mean by phlebotomy exclaimed sir gervaise who had an aversion to medicine and knew scarcely any of the commonest terms of practice though expert in bleeding  im thinking its what you and admiral bluewater so freely administer to his majestys enemies whenever ye fall in with em at seahehehe answered magrath chuckling at his own humour which as the quantity was small was all the better in quality  surely he does not mean powder and shot we give the french shot sir wycherly has not been shot  varra true sir gervaise but yeve let him blood amang ye a measure that has been somewhat precipitately practised ive my misgivings  now any old woman can tell us better than that doctor bloodletting is the everyday remedy for attacks of this sort  i do not dispute the dogmas of elderly persons of the other sex sir gervaise or your everyday remedia if everyday doctors would save life and alleviate pain diplomas would be unnecessary and we might all of us practise on the principle of the deel tak the hindmaist as ye did yoursel sir gervaise when ye cut and slashd amang the dons in boarding el lirio i was there yell both remember gentlemen and was obleeged to sew up the gashes ye made with your own irreverent and ungodly hands  this speech referred to one of the most desperate handtohand struggles in which the two flagofficers had ever been engaged and as it afforded them the means of exhibiting their personal gallantry when quite young men both usually looked back upon the exploit with great selfcomplacency sir gervaise in particular his friend having often declared since that they ought to have been laid on the shelf for life as a punishment for risking their men in so mad an enterprise though it did prove to be brilliantly successful  that was an affair in which one might engage at twentytwo magrath observed bluewater but which he ought to hesitate about thinking of even after thirty  id do it again this blessed day if you would give us a chance exclaimed sir gervaise striking the back of one hand into the palm of the other with a sudden energy that showed how much he was excited by the mere recollection of the scene  that wud yethat wud ye said magrath growing more and more scotch as he warmed in the discourse yed board a mackerelhoy rather than not have an engagement yer a varra capital viceadmiral of the red sir gervaise but im judging yed mak a varra indeeferent loblollyboy  bluewater i shall be compelled to change ships with you in order to get rid of the old standbys of the plantagenets they stick to me like leeches and have got to be so familiar that they criticise all my orders and dont more than half obey them in the bargain  no one will criticise your nautical commands sir gervaise though in the way of the healing airtscience it should be calledyere no mair to be trusted than one of the young gentlemen im told ye drew yer lancet on this poor gentleman as yed draw yer sword on an enemy  i did indeed sir though mr rotherham had rendered the application of the instrument unnecessary apoplexy is a rushing of the blood to the head and by diminishing the quantity in the veins of the arms or temples you lessen the pressure on the brain  just laymans practice sirjust laymans practice will ye tell me now if the patients face was red or white every thing depends on that which is the true diagnosis of the malady  red i think was it not bluewater red like old port of which i fancy the poor man had more than his share  weel in that case you were not so varra wrong but they tell me his countenance was pallid and deathlike in which case ye came near to committing murder there is one principle that controls the diagnosis of all cases of apoplexy among yer true country gentlemenand that is that the system is reduced and enfeebled by habitual devotion to the decanter in such attacks ye canna do warse than to let blood but ill no be hard upon you sir gervaise and so well drop the subjectthough truth to say i do not admire your poaching on my manor sir wycherly is materially better and expresses as well as a man who has not the use of his tongue can express a thing his besetting desire to make his last will and testament in ordinary cases of apoplexia it is good practice to oppose this craving though as it is my firm opinion that nothing can save the patients life i do not set myself against the measure in this particular case thar was a curious discussion at edinbro in my youth gentlemen on the question whether the considerations connected with the disposition of the property or the considerations connected with the patients health ought to preponderate in the physicians mind when it might be reasonably doubted whether the act of making a will would or would not essentially affect the nervous system and otherwise derange the functions of the body a very pretty argument in excellent edinbro latin was made on each side of the question i think on the whole the physicos had the best o it for they could show a plausible present evil as opposed to a possible remote good  has sir wycherly mentioned my name this morning asked the viceadmiral with interest  he has indeed sir gervaise and that in a way so manifestly connected with his will that im opining yell no be forgotten in the legacies the name of bluewater was in his mouth also  in which case no time should be lost for never before have i felt half the interest in the disposition of a strangers estate hark are not those wheels rattling in the courtyard  yer senses are most pairfect sir gervaise and that ive always said was one reason why yer so great an admiral returned magrath mind only one sir gervaise for many qualities united are necessary to make a truly great man i see a middleaged gentleman alighting and servants around him who wear the same liveries as those of this house some relative no doubt come to look after the legacies also  this must be sir reginald wychecombe it may not be amiss if we go forward to receive him bluewater  at this suggestion the rearadmiral drew in his legs which had not changed their position on account of the presence of the surgeon arose and followed sir gervaise as the latter left the room     chapter xiii      videsne quis venit     video et gaudeo           nathaniel et holofernes   tom wychecombe had experienced an uneasiness that it is unnecessary to explain ever since he learned that his reputed uncle had sent a messenger to bring the halfblood to the hall from the moment he got a clue to the fact he took sufficient pains to ascertain what was in the wind and when sir reginald wychecombe entered the house the first person he met was this spurious supporter of the honours of his name  sir reginald wychecombe i presume from the arms and the liveries said tom endeavouring to assume the manner of a host it is grateful to find that though we are separated by quite two centuries all the usages and the bearings of the family are equally preserved and respected by both its branches  i am sir reginald wychecombe sir and endeavour not to forget the honourable ancestry from which i am derived may i ask what kinsman i have the pleasure now to meet  mr thomas wychecombe sir at your command the eldest son of sir wycherlys next brother the late mr baron wychecombe i trust sir reginald you have not considered us as so far removed in blood as to have entirely overlooked our births marriages and deaths  i have not sir returned the baronet drily and with an emphasis that disturbed his listener though the cold jesuitical smile that accompanied the words had the effect to calm his vivid apprehensions all that relates to the house of wychecombe has interest in my eyes and i have endeavoured successfully i trust to ascertain all that relates to its births marriages and deaths i greatly regret that the second time i enter this venerable dwelling should be on an occasion as melancholy as this on which i am now summoned how is your respectablehow is sir wycherly wychecombe i wish to say  there was sufficient in this answer taken in connection with the deliberate guarded and yet expressive manner of the speaker to make tom extremely uncomfortable though there was also sufficient to leave him in doubts as to his namesakes true meaning the words emphasized by the latter were touched lightly though distinctly and the cold artificial smile with which they were uttered completely baffled the sagacity of a rogue as commonplace as the heirexpectant then the sudden change in the construction of the last sentence and the substitution of the name of the person mentioned for the degree of affinity in which he was supposed to stand to tom might be merely a rigid observance of the best tone of society or it might be equivocal all these little distinctions gleamed across the mind of tom wychecombe but that was not the moment to pursue the investigation courtesy required that he should make an immediate answer which he succeeded in doing steadily enough as to general appearances though his sagacious and practised questioner perceived that his words had not failed of producing the impression he intended for he had looked to their establishing a species of authority over the young man  my honoured and beloved uncle has revived a little they tell me said tom but i fear these appearances are delusive after eightyfour death has a fearful hold upon us sir the worst of it is that my poor dear uncles mind is sensibly affected and it is quite impossible to get at any of his little wishes in the way of memorials and messages  how then sir came sir wycherly to honour me with a request to visit him demanded the other with an extremely awkward pertinency  i suppose sir he has succeeded in muttering your name and that a natural construction has been put on its use at such a moment his will has been made some time i understand though i am ignorant of even the name of the executor as it is closed in an envelope and sealed with sir wycherlys arms it cannot be then on account of a will that he has wished to see you i rather think as the next of the family out of the direct line of succession he may have ventured to name you as the executor of the will in existence and has thought it proper to notify you of the same  yes sir returned sir reginald in his usual cold wary manner though it would have been more in conformity with usage had the notification taken the form of a request to serve previously to making the testament my letter was signed gervaise oakes and as they tell me a fleet is in the neighbourhood i have supposed that the celebrated admiral of that name has done me the honour to write it  you are not mistaken sir sir gervaise oakes is in the houseahhere he comes to receive you accompanied by rearadmiral bluewater whom the sailors call his mainmast  the foregoing conversation had taken place in a little parlour that led off from the great hall whither tom had conducted his guest and in which the two admirals now made their appearance introductions were scarcely necessary the uniform and starfor in that age officers usually appeared in their robesthe uniform and star of sir gervaise at once proclaiming his rank and name while between sir reginald and bluewater there existed a slight personal acquaintance which had grown out of their covert but deep jacobite sympathies  sir gervaise oakes and sir reginald wychecombe passed between the gentlemen with a hearty shake of the hand from the admiral which was met by a cold touch of the fingers on the part of the other that might very well have passed for the great model of the sophisticated manipulation of the modern salute but which in fact was the result of temperament rather than of fashion as soon as this ceremony was gone through and a few brief expressions of courtesy were exchanged the new comer turned to bluewater with an air of greater freedom and continued  and you too sir richard bluewater i rejoice to meet an acquaintance in this melancholy scene  i am happy to see you sir reginald though you have conferred on me a title to which i have no proper claim  nothe papers tell us that you have received one of the lately vacant red ribands  i believe some such honour has been in contemplation  contemplationi do assure you sir your name is fairly and distinctly gazettedas by sending to my carriage it will be in my power to show you i am then the first to call you sir richard  excuse me sir reginaldthere is some little misapprehension in this matter i prefer to remain plain rearadmiral bluewater in due season all will be explained  the parties exchanged looks which in times like those in which they lived were sufficiently intelligible to both and the conversation was instantly changed before sir reginald relinquished the hand he held however he gave it a cordial squeeze an intimation that was returned by a warm pressure from bluewater the party then began to converse of sir wycherly his actual condition and his probable motive in desiring to see his distant kinsman this motive sir gervaise regardless of the presence of tom wychecombe declared to be a wish to make a will and as he believed the intention of naming sir reginald his executor if not in some still more interesting capacity  i understand sir wycherly has a considerable sum entirely at his own disposal continued the viceadmiral and i confess i like to see a man remember his friends and servants generously in his last moments the estate is entailed i hear and i suppose mr thomas wychecombe here will be none the worse for that precaution in his ancestor let the old gentleman do as he pleases with his savings  sir gervaise was so much accustomed to command that he did not feel the singularity of his own interference in the affairs of a family of what might be called strangers though the circumstance struck sir reginald as a little odd nevertheless the last had sufficient penetration to understand the viceadmirals character at a glance and the peculiarity made no lasting impression when the allusion was made to toms succession as a matter of course however he cast a cold but withering look at the reputed heir which almost chilled the marrow in the bones of the jealous rogue  might i say a word to you in your own room sir gervaise asked sir reginald in an aside these matters ought not to be indecently hurried and i wish to understand the ground better before i advance  this question was overheard by bluewater who begging the gentlemen to remain where they were withdrew himself taking tom wychecombe with him as soon as they were alone sir reginald drew from his companion by questions warily but ingeniously put a history of all that had occurred within the last twentyfour hours a knowledge of the really helpless state of sir wycherly and of the manner in which he himself had been summoned included when satisfied he expressed a desire to see the sick man  by the way sir reginald said the viceadmiral with his hand on the lock of the door arresting his own movement to put the question i see by your manner of expressing yourself that the law has not been entirely overlooked in your education do you happen to know what halfblood means it is either a medical or a legal term and i understand few but nautical  you could not apply to any man in england sir gervaise better qualified to tell you answered the hertfordshire baronet smiling expressively i am a barrister of the middle temple having been educated as a younger son and having since succeeded an elder brother at the age of twentyseven i stand in the unfortunate relation of the halfblood myself to this very estate on which we are now conversing  sir reginald then proceeded to explain the law to the other as we have already pointed it out to the reader performing the duty succinctly but quite clearly  bless mebless me sir reginald exclaimed the directminded and justminded sailorhere must be some mistake a fortieth cousin or the king take this estate before yourself though you are directly descended from all the old wychecombes of the times of the plantagenets  such is the common law sir gervaise were i sir wycherlys halfbrother or a son by a second wife of our common father i could not take from him although that common father had earned the estate by his own hands or services  this is damnable sirdamnableand youll pardon me but i can hardly believe we have such a monstrous principle in the good honest wellmeaning laws of good honest wellmeaning old england  sir reginald was one of the few lawyers of his time who did not recognize the virtue of this particular provision of the common law a circumstance that probably arose from his having so small an interest now in the mysteries of the profession and so large an interest in the family estate of wychecombe destroyed by its dictum he was consequently less surprised and not at all hurt at the evident manner in which the sailor repudiated his statement as doing violence equally to reason justice and probability  good honest wellmeaning old england tolerates many grievous things notwithstanding sir gervaise he answered among others it tolerates the law of the halfblood much depends on the manner in which men view these things that which seems gold to one resembling silver in the eyes of another now i dare saythis was said as a feeler and with a smile that might pass for ironical or confiding as the listener pleased to take itnow i dare say the clans would tell us that england tolerates an usurper while her lawful prince was in banishment though you and i might not feel disposed to allow it  sir gervaise started and cast a quick suspicious glance at the speaker but there the latter stood with as open and guileless an expression on his handsome features as was ever seen in the countenance of confiding sixteen  your supposititious case is no parallel returned the viceadmiral losing every shade of suspicion at this appearance of careless frankness since men often follow their feelings in their allegiance while the law is supposed to be governed by reason and justice but now we are on the subject will you tell me sir reginald if you also know what a nullus is  i have no farther knowledge of the subject sir gervaise returned the other smiling this time quite naturally than is to be found in the latin dictionaries and grammars  ayyou mean nullus nulla nullum even we sailors know that as we all go to school before we go to sea but sir wycherly in efforts to make himself understood called you a halfblood  and quite correctlyi admit such to be the fact and that i have no more legal claim whatever on this estate than you have yourself my moral right however may be somewhat better  it is much to your credit that you so frankly admit it sir reginald for hang me if i think even the judges would dream of raising such an objection to your succeeding unless reminded of it  therein you do them injustice sir gervaise as it is their duty to administer the laws let them be what they may  perhaps you are right sir but the reason for my asking what a nullus is was the circumstance that sir wycherly in the course of his efforts to speak repeatedly called his nephew and heir mr thomas wychecombe by that epithet  did he indeedwas the epithet as you well term it filius nullius  i rather think it was nullusthough i do believe the word filius was muttered once or twice also  yes sir this has been the case and i am not sorry sir wycherly is aware of the fact as i hear that the young man affects to consider himself in a different point of view a filius nullius is the legal term for a bastardthe son of nobody as you will at once understand i am fully aware that such is the unfortunate predicament of mr thomas wychecombe whose father i possess complete evidence to show was never married to his mother  and yet sir reginald the impudent rascal carries in his pocket even a certificate signed by some parish priest in london to prove the contrary  the civil baronet seemed surprised at this assertion of his military brother but sir gervaise explaining what had passed between himself and the young man he could no longer entertain any doubt of the fact  since you have seen the document resumed sir reginald it must indeed be so and this misguided boy is prepared to take any desperate step in order to obtain the title and the estate all that he has said about a will must be fabulous as no man in his senses would risk his neck to obtain so hollow a distinction as a baronetcywe are equally members of the class and may speak frankly sir gervaiseand the will would secure the estate if there were one i cannot think therefore that there is a will at all  if this will were not altogether to the fellows liking would not the marriage beside the hollow honour of which you have spoken put the whole of the landed property in his possession under the entail  it would indeed and i thank you for the suggestion if however sir wycherly is desirous now of making a new will and has strength and mind sufficient to execute his purpose the old one need give us no concern this is a most delicate affair for one in my situation to engage in sir and i greatly rejoice that i find such honourable and distinguished witnesses in the house to clear my reputation should any thing occur to require such exculpation on the one side sir gervaise there is the danger of an ancient estates falling into the hands of the crown and this too while one of no stain of blood derived from the same honourable ancestors as the last possessor is in existence or on the other of its becoming the prey of one of base blood and of but very doubtful character the circumstance that sir wycherly desired my presence is a great deal and i trust to you and to those with you to vindicate the fairness of my course if its your pleasure sir we will now go to the sick chamber  with all my heart i think however sir reginald said the viceadmiral as he approached the door that even in the event of an escheat you would find these brunswick princes sufficiently liberal to restore the property i could not answer for those wandering scotchmen who have so many breechless nobles to enrich but i think with the hanoverians you would be safe  the last have certainly one recommendation the most returned the other smiling courteously but in a way so equivocal that even sir gervaise was momentarily struck by it they have fed so well now at the crib that they may not have the same voracity as those who have been long fasting it would be however more pleasant to take these lands from a wychecombea wychecombe to a wychecombethan to receive them anew from even the plantagenet who made the first grant  this terminated the private dialogue as the colloquists entered the hall just as the last speaker concluded wycherly was conversing earnestly with mrs dutton and mildred at the far end of the hall when the baronets appeared but catching the eye of the admiral he said a few words hastily to his companions and joined the two gentlemen who were now on their way to the sick mans chamber  here is a namesake if not a relative sir reginald observed sir gervaise introducing the lieutenant and one i rejoice to say of whom all of even your honourable name have reason to be proud  sir reginalds bow was courteous and bland as the admiral proceeded to complete the introduction but wycherly felt that the keen searching look he bestowed on himself was disagreeable  i am not at all aware that i have the smallest claim to the honour of being sir reginald wychecombes relative he said with cold reserve indeed until last evening i was ignorant of the existence of the hertfordshire branch of this family and you will remember sir gervaise that i am a virginian  a virginian exclaimed his namesake taken so much by surprise as to lose a little of his selfcommand i did not know indeed that any who bear the name had found their way to the colonies  and if they had sir they would have met with a set of fellows every way fit to be their associates sir reginald we english are a little clannishi hate the word too it has such a narrow scotch soundbut we are clannish although generally provided with garments to our nether limbs and we sometimes look down upon even a son whom the love of adventure has led into that part of the world in my view an englishman is an englishman let him come from what part of the empire he may that is what i call genuine liberality sir reginald  quite true sir gervaise and a scotchman is a scotchman even though he come from the north of tweed  this was quietly said but the viceadmiral felt the merited rebuke it contained and he had the goodnature and the good sense to laugh at it and to admit his own prejudices this little encounter brought the party to sir wycherlys door where all three remained until it was ascertained that they might enter  the next quarter of an hour brought about a great change in the situation of all the principal inmates of wychecombe hall the interdict was taken off the rooms of sir wycherly and in them had collected all the gentlemen mrs dutton and her daughter with three or four of the upper servants of the establishment even galleygo contrived to thrust his ungainly person in among the rest though he had the discretion to keep in the background among his fellows in a word both dressingroom and bedroom had their occupants though the last was principally filled by the medical men and those whose rank gave them claims to be near the person of the sick  it was now past a question known that poor sir wycherly was on his deathbed his mind had sensibly improved nor was his speech any worse but his physical system generally had received a shock that rendered recovery hopeless it was the opinion of the physicians that he might possibly survive several days or that he might be carried off in a moment by a return of the paralytic affection  the baronet himself appeared to be perfectly conscious of his situation as was apparent by the anxiety he expressed to get his friends together and more especially the concern he felt to make a due disposition of his worldly affairs the medical men had long resisted both wishes until convinced that the question was reduced to one of a few hours more or less of life and that denial was likely to produce worse effects than compliance they finally and unanimously consented  its no a great concession to mortal infirmity to let a dying man have his way whispered magrath to the two admirals as the latter entered the room sir wycherly is a hopeless case and well just consent to let him make a few codicils seeing that he so fairvently desires it and then there may be fewer hopeless deevils left behind him when hes gathered to his forefathers  here we are my dear sir wycherly said the viceadmiral who never lost an occasion to effect his purpose by any unnecessary delay here we all are anxious to comply with your wishes your kinsman sir reginald wychecombe is also present and desirous of doing your pleasure  it was a painful sight to see a man on his deathbed so anxious to discharge the forms of the world as the master of the hall now appeared to be there had been an unnecessary alienation between the heads of the two branches of the family not arising from any quarrel or positive cause of disagreement but from a silent conviction in both parties that each was unsuited to the other they had met a few times and always parted without regret the case was now different the separation was in one sense at least to be eternal and all minor considerations all caprices of habits or despotism of tastes faded before the solemn impressions of the moment still sir wycherly could not forget that he was master of wychecombe and that his namesake was esteemed a man of refinement and in his simple way of thinking he would fain have arisen in order to do him honour a little gentle violence even was necessary to keep the patient quiet  much honoured sirgreatly pleased muttered sir wycherly the words coming from him with difficulty same ancestorssame nameplantagenetsold house sirhead go new one comenone better than  do not distress yourself to speak unnecessarily my dear sir interrupted sir reginald with more tenderness for the patient than consideration for his own interest as the next words promised to relate to the succession sir gervaise oakes tells me he understands your wishes generally and that he is now prepared to gratify them first relieve your mind in matters of business and then i shall be most happy to exchange with you the feelings of kindred  yes sir wycherly put in sir gervaise on this hint i believe i have now found the clue to all you wish to say the few words written by you last night were the commencement of a will which it is your strong desire to make do not speak but raise your right hand if i am not mistaken  the sick man actually stretched his right arm above the bedclothes and his dull eyes lighted with an expression of pleasure that proved how strongly his feelings were enlisted in the result  you see gentlemen said sir gervaise with emphasis no one can mistake the meaning of this come nearer doctormr rotherhamall who have no probable interest in the affairi wish it to be seen that sir wycherly wychecombe is desirous of making his will  the viceadmiral now went through the ceremony of repeating his request and got the same significant answer  so i understood it sir wycherly and i believe now i also understand all about the half and the whole and the nullus you meant to tell us that your kinsman sir reginald wychecombe was of the halfblood as respects yourself and that mr thomas wychecombe your nephew is what is termed in lawhowever painful this may be gentlemen at such solemn moments the truth must be plainly spokenthat mr thomas wychecombe is what the law terms a filius nullius if we have understood you in this also have the goodness to give this company the same sign of assent  the last words were scarcely spoken before sir wycherly again raised his arm and nodded his head  here there can be no mistake and no one rejoices in it more than i do myself for the unintelligible words gave me a great deal of vexation well my dear sir understanding your wishes my secretary mr atwood has drawn the commencement of a will in the usual form using your own pious and proper language ofin the name of god amen as the commencement and he stands ready to write down your bequests as you may see fit to name them we will take them first on a separate piece of paper then read them to you for your approbation and afterwards transcribe them into the will i believe sir reginald that mode would withstand the subtleties of all the gentlemen of all the inns of court  it is a very proper and prudent mode for executing a will sir under the peculiar circumstances returned he of hertfordshire but sir gervaise my situation here is a little delicate as may be that of mr thomas wychecombeothers of the name and family if any such there be would it not be well to inquire if our presence is actually desired by the intended testator  is it your wish sir wycherly that your kinsmen and namesakes remain in the room or shall they retire until the will is executed i will call over the names of the company and when you wish any one in particular to stay in the room you will nod your head  allall stay muttered sir wycherly sir reginaldtomwycherlyall  this seems explicit enough gentlemen resumed the viceadmiral you are all requested to stay and if i might venture an opinion our poor friend has named those on whom he intends his bequests to falland pretty much too in the order in which they will come  that will appear more unanswerably when sir wycherly has expressed his intentions in words observed sir reginald very desirous that there should not be the smallest appearance of dictation or persuasion offered to his kinsman at a moment so grave let me entreat that no leading questions be put  sir gervaise understands leading in battle much better than in a crossexamination sir reginald bluewater observed in a tone so low that none heard him but the person to whom the words were addressed i think we shall sooner get at sir wycherlys wishes by allowing him to take his own course  the other bowed and appeared disposed to acquiesce in the mean time preparations were making for the construction of the will atwood seated himself at a table near the bed and commenced nibbing his pens the medical men administered a cordial sir gervaise caused all the witnesses to range themselves around the room in a way that each might fairly see and be seen taking care however so to dispose of wycherly as to leave no doubt of his handsome persons coming into the sick mans view the lieutenants modesty might have rebelled at this arrangement had he not found himself immediately at the side of mildred     chapter xiv      yet all is oerfear doubt suspense are fled     let brighter thoughts be with the virtuous dead     the final ordeal of the soul is past     and the pale brow is sealed to heaven at last           mrs hemans   it will be easily supposed that tom wychecombe witnessed the proceedings related in the preceding chapter with dismay the circumstance that he actually possessed a bona fide will of his uncle which left him heir of all the latter owned real or personal had made him audacious and first induced him to take the bold stand of asserting his legitimacy and of claiming all its consequences he had fully determined to assume the title on the demise of sir wycherly plausibly enough supposing that as there was no heir to the baronetcy the lands once in his quiet possession no one would take sufficient interest in the matter to dispute his right to the rank here however was a blow that menaced death to all his hopes his illegitimacy seemed to be known to others and there was every prospect of a new wills supplanting the old one in its more important provisions at least he was at a loss to imagine what had made this sudden change in his uncles intentions for he did not sufficiently understand himself to perceive that the few months of close communion which had succeeded the death of his reputed father had sufficed to enlighten sir wycherly on the subject of his own true character and to awaken a disgust that had remained passive until suddenly aroused by the necessity of acting and least of all could he understand how surprisingly the moral vision of men is purified and enlarged as respects both the past and the future by the near approach of death although symptoms of strong dissatisfaction escaped him he quieted his feelings as much as possible cautiously waiting for any occurrence that might be used in setting aside the contemplated instrument hereafter or what would be still better to defeat its execution now  as soon as the necessary preparations were made atwood his pen nibbed ink at hand and paper spread was ready to proceed and a breathless stillness existing in the chamber sir gervaise resumed the subject on which they were convened  atwood will read to you what he has already written sir wycherly he said should the phraseology be agreeable to you you will have the goodness to make a sign to that effect well if all is ready you can now commencehey atwood  in the name of god amen commenced the methodical secretary i wycherly wychecombe bart of wychecombehall in the county of devon being of sound mind but of a feeble state of health and having the view of death before my eyes revoking all other wills codicils or testamentary devises whatsoever do make and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament that is to say imprimis i do hereby constitute and appoint   of  the executor of this my said will with all the powers and authority that the law gives or may hereafter give to said executor secondly i give and bequeath to  this is all that is yet written sir gervaise blanks being left for the name or names of the executor or executors as well for the s at the end of executor should the testator see fit to name more than one  there sir reginald said the viceadmiral not altogether without exultation this is the way we prepare these things on board a manofwar a flagofficers secretary needs have himself qualified to do any thing short of a knowledge of administering to the cure of souls  and the cure of bodies yell be permitting me to add sir gervaise observed magrath taking an enormous pinch of a strong yellow snuff  our secretary would make but a lubberly fist at turning off a delicate turtlesoup out of pigshead such as we puts on our table at sea so often muttered galleygo in the ear of mrs larder  i see nothing to object to sir gervaise if the language is agreeable to sir wycherly answered the barrister by profession though not by practice it would be advisable to get his approbation of even the language  that we intend to do of course sir sir wycherly do you find the terms of this will to your liking  sir wycherly smiled and very clearly gave the sign of assent  i thought as muchfor atwood has made the wills of two admirals and of three captains to my knowledge and my lord chief justice said that one of the last would have done credit to the best conveyancer in england and that it was a pity the testator had nothing to bequeath now sir wycherly will you have one executor or more if one hold up a single finger and a finger for each additional executor you wish us to insert in these blanks one atwoodyou perceive gentlemen that sir wycherly raises but one finger and so you can give a flourish at the end of the r as the word will be in the singularhey atwood  the secretary did as directed and then reported himself ready to proceed  it will be necessary for you now to name your executor sir wycherlymake as little effort as possible as we shall understand the name alone  sir wycherly succeeded in uttering the name of sir reginald wychecombe quite audibly  this is plain enough resumed the viceadmiral how does the sentence read now atwood  imprimisi do hereby constitute and appoint sir reginald wychecombe of wychecomberegis in the county of herts baronet the executor of this my said will c  if that clause is to your liking sir wycherly have the goodness to give the sign agreed on  the sick man smiled nodded his head raised his hand and looked anxiously at his kinsman  i consent to serve sir wycherly if such is your desire observed the nominee who detected the meaning of his kinsmans look  and now sir continued the viceadmiral it is necessary to ask you a few questions in order that atwood may know what next to write is it your desire to bequeath any real estate sir wycherly assented do you wish to bequeath all your real estate the same sign of assent was given do you wish to bequeath all to one person the sign of assent was given to this also this makes plain sailing and a short runhey atwood  the secretary wrote as fast as possible and in two or three minutes he read aloud as follows  secondly i make and declare the

pardon sir gervaise it should read by himself his heirs c  very truevery true atwood now read it slowly and sir wycherly will assent if he approve  this was done and sir wycherly not only approved but it was apparent to all present the abashed and confounded tom himself not excepted that he approved with a feeling akin to delight  that gives a black eye to all the landhey atwood said sir gervaise who by this time had entered into the business in hand with all the interest of a regular notaryor rather with that of one on whose shoulders rested the responsibility of success or failure we come next to the personals do you wish to bequeath your furniture wines horses carriages and other things of that sort to any particular person sir wycherly  allsir reginaldwychecombehalfbloodold sir

if such be sir wycherlys pleasure  if you approve of that clause my dear sir make the usual sign of assent  sir wycherly both raised his hand and nodded his head evidently quite satisfied  now my good sir we come to the poundsnoguineas you like that betterwell i confess that it sounds better on the ear and is more in conformity with the habits of gentlemen will you now bequeath guineas goodfirst name the legateeis that right sir reginald  quite right sir gervaise and sir wycherly will understand that he now names the first person to whom he wishes to bequeath any thing else  milly muttered the sick man  what millsthe mills go with the lands sir reginald  he means miss mildred dutton eagerly interposed wycherly though with sufficient modesty  yesrightright added the testator little millymilly duttongood little milly  sir gervaise hesitated and looked round at bluewater as much as to say this is bringing coals to newcastle but atwood took the idea and wrote the bequest in the usual form  i give and bequeath to mildred dutton he read aloud daughter of francis dutton of the royal navy the sum of  what sum shall i fill the blank with sir wycherly  threethreeyes three  hundreds or thousands my good sir asked sir gervaise a little surprised at the amount of the bequest  guineasthreethousandguineasfive per cents  thats as plain as logarithms give the young lady three thousand guineas in the fives atwood  i give and bequeath to mildred dutton daughter of francis dutton of the royal navy the sum of three thousand guineas in the five per cent stocks of this kingdom will that do sir wycherly  the old man looked at mildred and smiled benevolently for at that moment he felt he was placing the pure and lovely girl above the ordinary contingencies of her situation by rendering her independent  whose name shall we next insert sir wycherly resumed the viceadmiral there must be many more of these guineas left  gregoryandjameschildren of my brother thomasbaron wychecombefive thousand guineas each added the testator making a great effort to express his meaning as clearly as possible  he was understood and after a short consultation with the viceadmiral atwood wrote out the devise at length  i give and bequeath to my nephews gregory and james wychecombe the reputed sons of my late brother thomas wychecombe one of the barons of his majestys exchequer the sum of five thousand guineas each in the five per cent funded debt of this kingdom  do you approve of the devise sir wycherly if so make the usual sign of assent  sir wycherly complied as in all the previous cases of his approval  whose name shall we next insert in readiness for a legacy sir wycherly asked the admiral  here was a long pause the baronet evidently turning over in his mind what he had done and what yet remained to do  spread yourselves my friends in such a way as to permit the testator to see you all continued the viceadmiral motioning with his hand to widen the circle around the bed which had been contracted a little by curiosity and interest stand more this way lieutenant wycherly wychecombe that the ladies may see and be seen and you too mr thomas wychecombe come further in front where your uncle will observe you  this speech pretty exactly reflected the workings of the speakers mind the idea that wycherly was a natural child of the baronets notwithstanding the virginian story was uppermost in his thoughts and taking the supposed fact in connection with the young mans merit he earnestly desired to obtain a legacy for him as for tom he cared little whether his name appeared in the will or not justice was now substantially done and the judges property being sufficient for his wants the present situation of the lately reputed heir excited but little sympathy nevertheless sir gervaise thought it would be generous under the circumstances to remind the testator that such a being as tom wychecombe existed  here is your nephew mr thomas sir wycherly he said is it your wish to let his name appear in your will  the sick man smiled coldly but he moved his head as much as to imply assent  i give and bequeath to thomas wychecombe the eldest reputed son of my late brother thomas one of the barons of his majestys exchequer read atwood when the clause was duly written the sum of  in the five per cent stocks of this kingdom  what sum will you have inserted sir wycherly asked the viceadmiral  fiftyfiftypounds said the testator in a voice clearer and fuller than he had before used that day  the necessary words were immediately inserted the clause as completed was read again and the approval was confirmed by a distinctly pronounced yes tom started but as all the others maintained their selfcommand the business of the moment did not the less proceed  do you wish any more names introduced into your will sir wycherly asked the viceadmiral you have bequeathed butaaahow muchhey atwooday ten and three are thirteen and fifty pounds

atwood to write naming his cook butler groom valet or bodyservant and housekeeper in the order they have been laid before the reader  how much to each sir wycherlyi see atwood has made short work and put them all in the same clausethat will never do unless the legacies are the same  goodgoodright muttered the testator ¬£200each¬£1000allmoneymoney  this settled the point and the clause was regularly written read and approved  this raises the money bequests to ¬£14180 sir wycherlysome 6 or ¬£7000 more must remain to be disposed of stand a little further this way if you please mr wycherly wychecombe and allow the ladies more room whose name shall we insert next sir  sir wycherly thus directed by the eager desire of the admiral to serve the gallant lieutenant fastened his eyes on the young man regarding him quite a minute in silent attention  virginiansame nameamericancoloniesgood ladbrave lad¬£1000 muttered the sick man between his teeth and yet so breathless was the quiet of the chamber at that moment every syllable was heard by all present yes¬£1000wycherly wychecomberoyal navy  atwoods pen was running rapidly over the paper and had just reached the name of the contemplated legatee when his hand was arrested by the voice of the young man himself  stop mr atwooddo not insert any clause in my favour cried wycherly his face the colour of crimson and his chest heaving with the emotions he felt it so difficult to repress i decline the legacyit will be useless to write it as i will not receive a shilling  young sir said sir gervaise with a little of the severity of a superior when he rebukes an interior in his manner you speak hastily it is not the office of an auditor or of a spectator to repel the kindness of a man about to pass from the face of the earth into the more immediate presence of his god  i have every sentiment of respect for sir wycherly wychecombe sirevery friendly wish for his speedy recovery and a long evening to his life but i will accept of the money of no man who holds my country in such obvious distaste as it is apparent the testator holds mine  you are an englishman i believe lieutenant wychecombe and a servant of king george ii  i am not an englishman sir gervaise oakesbut an american a virginian entitled to all the rights and privileges of a british subject i am no more an englishman than dr magrath may lay claim to the same character  this is putting the case stronglyhey atwood answered the viceadmiral smiling in spite of the occasion i am far from saying that you are an englishman in all senses sir but you are one in the sense that gives you national character and national rights you are a subject of england  no sir gervaise your pardon i am the subject of george ii but in no manner a subject of england i am in one sense perhaps a subject of the british empire but i am not the less a virginian and an american not a shilling of any mans money will i ever touch who expresses his contempt for either  you forget yourself young man and overlook the future the hundred or two of prizemoney bought at the expense of your blood in the late affair at groix will not last for ever  it is gone already sir every shilling of it having been sent to the widow of the boatswain who was killed at my side i am no beggar sir gervaise oakes though only an american i am the owner of a plantation which affords me a respectable independence already and i do not serve from necessity but from choice perhaps if sir wycherly knew this he would consent to omit my name i honour and respect him would gladly relieve his distress either of body or mind but i cannot consent to accept his money when offered on terms i consider humiliating  this was said modestly but with a warmth and sincerity which left no doubt that the speaker was in earnest sir gervaise too much respected the feelings of the young man to urge the matter any further and he turned towards the bed in expectation of what the sick man might next say sir wycherly heard and understood all that passed and it did not fail to produce an impression even in the state to which he was reduced kindhearted and indisposed to injure even a fly all the natural feelings of the old man resumed their ascendency and he would gladly have given every shilling of his funded property to be able freely to express his compunction at having ever uttered a syllable that could offend sensibilities so noble and generous but this exceeded his powers and he was fain to do the best he could in the painful situation in which he was placed  noble fellow he stuttered out honour to namecome heresir gervaisebring here  i believe it is the wish of sir wycherly that you would draw near the bed mr wychecombe of virginia said the viceadmiral pithily though he extended a hand to and smiled kindly on the youth as the latter passed him in compliance  the sick man now succeeded with a good deal of difficulty in drawing a valuable signetring from a fingerthis ring bore the wychecombe arms engraved on it it was without the bloody hand however for it was far older than the order of baronets having as wycherly well knew been given by one of the plantagenet dukes to an ancestor of the family during the french wars of henry vi and that too in commemoration of some signal act of gallantry in the field  wear thisnoble fellowhonour to name said sir wycherly must be descendedall wychecombes descendedhim  i thank you sir wycherly for this present which i prize as it ought to be prized said wycherly every trace of any other feeling than that of gratitude having vanished from his countenance i may have no claims to your honours or money but this ring i need not be ashamed to wear since it was bestowed on one who was as much my ancestor as he was the ancestor of any wychecombe in england  legitimate cried tom a fierce feeling of resentment upsetting his caution and cunning  yes sir legitimate answered wycherly turning to his interrogator with the calmness of one conscious of his own truth and with a glance of the eye that caused tom to shrink back again into the circle i need no bar to enable me to use this seal which you may perceive sir gervaise oakes is a fac simile of the one i ordinarily wear and which was transmitted to me from my direct ancestors  the viceadmiral compared the seal on wycherlys watchchain with that on the ring and the bearings being principally griffins he was enabled to see that one was the exact counterpart of the other sir reginald advanced a step and when the admiral had satisfied himself he also took the two seals and compared them as all the known branches of the wychecombes of wychecombe bore the same arms viz griffins for wychecombe with three batteringrams quartered for wycherlyhe saw at once that the young man habitually carried about his person this proof of a common origin sir reginald knew very well that arms were often assumed as well as names and the greater the obscurity of the individual who took these liberties the greater was his impunity but the seal was a very ancient one and innovations on personal rights were far less frequent a century since than they are today then the character and appearance of wycherly put fraud out of the question so far as the young lieutenant himself was concerned although the elder branch of the family legitimately speaking was reduced to the helpless old man who was now stretched upon his deathbed his own had been extensive and it well might be that some cadet of the wychecombes of wychecomberegis had strayed into the colonies and left descendants secretly resolving to look more closely into these facts he gravely returned the seals and intimated to sir gervaise that the more important business before them had better proceed on this hint atwood resumed the pen and the viceadmiral his duties  there want yet some 6 or ¬£7000 to make up ¬£20000 sir wycherly which i understand is the sum you have in the funds whose name or names will you have next inserted  rotherhamvicarpoor st jamesgone yesmrrotherhamvicar  the clause was written the sum of ¬£1000 was inserted and the whole was read and approved  this still leaves us some ¬£5000 more to deal with my dear sir  a long pause succeeded during which time sir wycherly was deliberating what to do with the rest of his ready money at length his wandering eye rested on the pale features of mrs dutton and while he had a sort of liking that proceeded from habit for her husband he remembered that she had many causes for sorrow with a feeling that was creditable to his own heart he uttered her name and the sum of ¬£2000 the clause was written accordingly read and approved  we have still ¬£3000 certainly if not ¬£4000 added sir gervaise  millydear littlemillypretty milly stammered out the baronet affectionately  this must go into a codicil sir gervaise interrupted atwood there being already one legacy in the young ladys favour shall it be one two three or four thousand pounds sir wycherly in favour of miss mildred to whom you have already bequeathed ¬£3000  the sick man muttered the words three thousand after a short pause adding codicil  his wishes were complied with and the whole was read and approved after this sir gervaise inquired if the testator wished to make any more devises sir wycherly who had in effect bequeathed within a few hundred pounds all he had to bestow bethought himself for a few moments of the state of his affairs and then he signified his satisfaction with what had been done  as it is possible sir wycherly that you may have overlooked something said sir gervaise and it is better that nothing should escheat to the crown i will suggest the expediency of your making some one residuary legatee  the poor old man smiled an assent and then he succeeded in muttering the name of sir reginald wychecombe  this clause like all the others was written read and approved the will was now completed and preparations were made to read it carefully over to the intended testator in order that this might be done with sufficient care for future objections the two admirals and atwood who were selected for the witnesses each read the testament himself in order to say that nothing was laid before the testator but that which was fairly contained in the instrument and that nothing was omitted when all was ready the will was audibly and slowly read to sir wycherly by the secretary from the beginning to the end the old man listened with great attention smiled when mildreds name was mentioned and clearly expressed by signs and words his entire satisfaction when all was ended it remained only to place a pen in his hand and to give him such assistance as would enable him to affix his name twice once to the body of the instrument and when this was duly witnessed then again to the codicil by this time tom wychecombe thought that the moment for interposing had arrived he had been on thorns during the whole proceeding forming desperate resolutions to sustain the bold fraud of his legitimacy and thus take all the lands and heirlooms of the estate under the entail still he well knew that a subordinate but important question might arise as between the validity of the two wills in connection with sir wycherlys competency to make the last it was material therefore in his view of the case to enter a protest  gentlemen he said advancing to the foot of the bed i call on you all to observe the nature of this whole transaction my poor beloved but misled uncle no longer ago than last night was struck with a fit of apoplexy or something so very near it as to disqualify him to judge in these matters and here he is urged to make a will  by whom sir demanded sir gervaise with a severity of tone that induced the speaker to fall back a step  why sir in my judgment by all in the room if not with their tongues at least with their eyes  and why should all in the room do this am i a legateeis admiral bluewater to be a gainer by this willcan witnesses to a will be legatees  i do not wish to dispute the matter with you sir gervaise oakes but i solemnly protest against this irregular and most extraordinary manner of making a will let all who hear me remember this and be ready to testify to it when called on in a court of justice  here sir wycherly struggled to rise in the bed in evident excitement gesticulating strongly to express his disgust and his wish for his nephew to withdraw but the physicians endeavoured to pacify him while atwood with the paper spread on a portfolio and a pen in readiness coolly proceeded to obtain the necessary signatures sir wycherlys hand trembled so much when it received the pen that for the moment writing was out of the question and it became necessary to administer a restorative in order to strengthen his nerves  awayout of sight muttered the excited baronet leaving no doubt on all present that the uppermost feeling of the moment was the strong desire to rid himself of the presence of the offensive object sir reginaldlittle millypoor servantsbrothersall the rest stay  just be calming the mind sir wycherly wychecombe put in magrath and yell be solacing the body by the same effort when the mind is in a state of exaltation the nervous system is apt to feel the influence of sympathy by bringing the two in harmonious cooperation the testamentary devises will have none the less of validity either in reality or in appearances  sir wycherly understood the surgeon and he struggled for selfcommand he raised the pen and succeeded in getting its point on the proper place then his dim eye lighted and shot a reproachful glance at tom he smiled in a ghastly manner looked towards the paper passed a hand across his brow closed his eyes and fell back on the pillow utterly unconscious of all that belonged to life its interests its duties or its feelings in ten minutes he ceased to breathe  thus died sir wycherly wychecombe after a long life in which general qualities of a very negative nature had been somewhat relieved by kindness of feeling a passive if not an active benevolence and such a discharge of his responsible duties as is apt to flow from an absence of any qualities that are positively bad as well as of many of material account that are affirmatively good     chapter xv      come ye who still the cumbrous load of life       push hard up hill but at the farthest steep     you trust to gain and put on end to strife       down thunders back the stone with mighty sweep       and hurls your labours to the valley deep           thomson   the sudden and in some measure unlookedfor event related in the close of the last chapter produced a great change in the condition of things at wychecombe hall the first step was to make sure that the baronet was actually dead a fact that sir gervaise oakes in particular was very unwilling to believe in the actual state of his feelings men often fainted and apoplexy required three blows to kill the sick man might still revive and at least be able to execute his so clearly expressed intentions  yell never have act of any sort testamentary or matrimonial legal or illegal in this life from the late sir wycherly wychecombe of wychecombe hall devonshire coolly observed magrath as he collected the different medicines and instruments he had himself brought forth for the occasion hes far beyond the jurisdiction of my lord high chancellor of the college of physicians and surgeons and therefore yell be acting prudently to consider him as deceased or in the light in which the human body is placed by the cessation of all the animal functions  this decided the matter and the necessary orders were given all but the proper attendants quitting the chamber of death it would be far from true to say that no one lamented sir wycherly wychecombe both mrs dutton and mildred grieved for his sudden end and wept sincerely for his loss though totally without a thought of its consequences to themselves the daughter did not even once think how near she had been to the possession of ¬£6000 and how unfortunately the cup of comparative affluence had been dashed from her lips though truth compels us to avow that the mother did once recall this circumstance with a feeling akin to regret a similar recollection had its influence on the manifestations of sorrow that flowed from others the domestics in particular were too much astounded to indulge in any very abstracted grief and sir gervaise and atwood were both extremely vexed in short the feelings usual to such occasions were but little indulged in though there was a strict observance of decorum  sir reginald wychecombe noted these circumstances attentively and he took his measures accordingly seizing a favourable moment to consult with the two admirals his decision was soon made and within an hour after his kinsmans death all the guests and most of the upper servants were assembled in the room which it was the usage of the house to call the library though the books were few and seldom read previously there had been a consultation between sir reginald and the two admirals to which atwood had been admitted ex officio as every thing therefore had been arranged in advance there was no time lost unnecessarily when the company was collected the hertfordshire baronet coming to the point at once and that in the clearest manner  gentlemen and you good people domestics of the late sir wycherly wychecombe he commenced you are all acquainted with the unfortunate state of this household by the recent death of its master it is left without a head and the deceased departing this life a bachelor there is no child to assume his place as the natural and legal successor in one sense i might be deemed the next of kin though by a dictum of the common law i have no claim to the succession nevertheless you all know it was the intention of our late friend to constitute me his executor and i conceive it proper that search should now be made for a will which by being duly executed must dispose of all in this house and let us know who is entitled to command at this solemn and important moment it strikes me sir gervaise oakes that the circumstances are so peculiar as to call for prompt proceedings  i fully agree with you sir reginald returned the viceadmiral but before we proceed any further i would suggest the propriety of having as many of those present as possible who have an interest in the result mr thomas wychecombe the reputed nephew of the deceased i do not see among us  on examination this was found to be true and the man of tom wychecombe who had been ordered by his master to be present as a spy was immediately sent to the latter with a request that he would attend after a delay of two or three minutes the fellow returned with the answer  sir thomas wychecombes compliments gentlemen he said and he desires to know the object of your request he is in his room indulging in natural grief for his recent loss and he prefers to be left alone with his sorrows just at this moment if it be agreeable to you  this was taking high ground in the commencement and as the man had his cue and delivered his message with great distinctness and steadiness the effect on the dependants of the household was very evident sir reginalds face flushed while sir gervaise bit his lip bluewater played with the hilt of his sword very indifferent to all that was passing while atwood and the surgeons shrugged their shoulders and smiled the first of these persons well knew that tom had no shadow of a claim to the title he had been in so much haste to assume however and he hoped that the feebleness of his rights in all particulars was represented by the mixed feebleness and impudence connected with this message determined not to be bullied from his present purpose therefore he turned to the servant and sent him back with a second message that did not fail of its object the man was directed to inform his master that sir reginald wychecombe was in possession of facts that in his opinion justified the course he was taking and if mr thomas wychecombe did not choose to appear in order to look after his own interests he should proceed without him this brought tom into the room his face pale with uncertainty rather than with grief and his mind agitated with such apprehensions as are apt to beset even the most wicked when they take their first important step in evil he bowed however to the company with an air that he intended to represent the manner of a wellbred man acknowledging his duties to respected guests  if i appear remiss in any of the duties of a host gentlemen he said you will overlook it i trust in consideration of my present feelings sir wycherly was my fathers elder brother and was very dear as he was very near to me by this melancholy death sir reginald i am suddenly and unexpectedly elevated to be the head of our ancient and honourable family but i know my own personal unworthiness to occupy that distinguished place and feel how much better it would be filled by yourself although the law has placed a wide and impassable barrier between all of your branch of the family and ourselves i shall ever be ready to acknowledge the affinity and to confess that it does us quite as much honour as it bestows  sir reginald by a great effort commanded himself so far as to return the bow and apparently to receive the condescending admissions of the speech with a proper degree of respect  sir i thank you he answered with formal courtesy no affinity that can be properly and legally established will ever be disavowed by me under present circumstances however summoned as i have been to the side of his deathbed by the late sir wycherly himself and named by him as one might say with his dying breath as his executor i feel it a duty to inquire into the rights of all parties and if possible to ascertain who is the successor and consequently who has the best claim to command here  you surely do not attach any validity sir reginald to the pretended will that was so singularly drawn up in my dear uncles presence an hour before he died had that most extraordinary instrument been duly signed and sealed i cannot think that the doctors commons would sustain it but unsigned and unsealed it is no better than so much waste paper  as respects the real estate sir though so great a loser by the delay of five minutes i am willing to admit that you are right with regard to the personals a question in equityone of clearlyexpressed intentionmight possibly arise though even of that i am by no means certain  no sir no cried tom a glow of triumph colouring his cheek in spite of every effort to appear calm no english court would ever disturb the natural succession to the personals i am the last man to wish to disturb some of these legaciesparticularly that to mr rotherham and those to the poor faithful domesticstom saw the prudence of conciliating allies at such a critical moment and his declaration had an instant and strong effect as was evident by the countenances of many of the listenersand i may say that to miss mildred dutton all of which will be duly paid precisely as if my beloved uncle had been in his right mind and had actually made the bequests for this mixture of reason and justice with wild and extraordinary conceits is by no means uncommon among men of great age and in their last moments however sir reginald i beg you will proceed and act as in your judgment the extraordinary circumstances of what may be called a very peculiar case require  i conceive it to be our duty sir to search for a will if sir wycherly has actually died intestate it will be time enough to inquire into the question of the succession at common law i have here the keys of his private secretary and mr furlong the landsteward who has just arrived and whom you see in the room tells me sir wycherly was accustomed to keep all his valuable papers in this piece of furniture i shall now proceed to open it  do so sir reginald no one can have a stronger desire than myself to ascertain my beloved uncles pleasure those to whom he seemed to wish to give even shall not be losers for the want of his name  tom was greatly raised in the opinions of half in the room by this artful declaration which was effectually securing just so many friends in the event of any occurrence that might render such support necessary in the mean time sir reginald assisted by the steward opened the secretary and found the deposite of papers the leases were all in order the titledeeds were properly arranged the books and accounts appeared to be exactly kept ordinary bills and receipts were filed with method two or three bags of guineas proved that ready cash was not wanting and in short every thing showed that the deceased had left his affairs in perfect order and in a very intelligible condition paper after paper however was opened and nothing like a will rough draft or copied was to be found disappointment was strongly painted on the faces of all the gentlemen present for they had ignorantly imbibed the opinion that the production of a will would in some unknown manner defeat the hopes of the soidisant sir thomas wychecombe nor was tom himself altogether without concern for since the recent change in his uncles feelings towards himself he had a secret apprehension that some paper might be found to defeat all his hopes triumph however gradually assumed the place of fear in the expression of his countenance and when mr furlong a perfectly honest man declared that from the late baronets habits as well as from the result of this search he did not believe that any such instrument existed his feelings overflowed in language  not so fast master furlongnot so fast he cried here is something that possibly even your legal acumen may be willing to term a will you perceive gentlemen i have it in my possession on good authority as it is addressed to me by name and that too in sir wycherlys own handwriting the envelope is sealed with his private seal you will pronounce this to be my dear uncles hand furlongshowing the superscription of the letterand this to be his seal  both are genuine gentlemen returned the steward with a sigh thus far mr thomas is in the right  mr thomas sirrahand why not sir thomas are baronets addressed as other men in england but no matter there is a time for all things sir gervaise oakes as you are perfectly indifferent in this affair i ask of you the favour to break the seal and to inquire into the contents of the paper  the viceadmiral was not slow in complying for by this time he began to feel an intense interest in the result the reader will readily understand that tom had handed to sir gervaise the will drawn up by his father and which after inserting his reputed nephews name sir wycherly had duly executed and delivered to the person most interested the envelope address and outer seal tom had obtained the very day the will was signed after assuring himself of the contents of the latter by six or eight careful perusals the viceadmiral read the instrument from beginning to end before he put it into the hands of sir reginald to examine the latter fully expected to meet with a clumsy forgery but the instant his eyes fell on the phraseology he perceived that the will had been drawn by one expert in the law a second look satisfied him that the hand was that of mr baron wychecombe it has already been said that in this instrument sir wycherly bequeathed all he had on earth to his nephew thomas wychecombe son c c making his heir also his executor  this will appears to me to have been drawn up by a very skilful lawyer the late baron wychecombe observed the baronet  it was sir reginald answered tom endeavouring to appear unconcerned he did it to oblige my respected uncle leaving blanks for the name of the devisee not liking to make a will so very decidedly in favour of his own son the writing in the blanks is by sir wycherly himself leaving no doubts of his intentions  i do not see but you may claim to be the heir of wychecombe sir as well as of the personals though your claims to the baronetcy shall certainly be contested and defeated  and why defeated demanded wycherly stepping forward for the first time and speaking with a curiosity he found it difficult to control is not mr thomassir thomas i ought rather to saythe eldest son of the late sir wycherlys next brother and as a matter of course heir to the title as well as to the estate  not he as i can answer from a careful examination of proofs mr baron wychecombe was never married and thus could have no heir at law  is this possiblehow have we all been deceived then in america  why do you say this young gentleman can you have any legal claims here  i am wycherly the only son of wycherly who was the eldest son of gregory the younger brother of the late baronet and if what you say be true the next in succession to the baronetcy at least  this is toms words stuck in his throat for the quiet stern eye of the young sailor met his look and warned him to be prudentthis is a mistake he resumed my uncle gregory was lost at sea and died a bachelor he can have left no lawful issue  i must say young gentleman added sir reginald gravely that such has always been the history of his fate i have had too near an interest in this family to neglect its annals  i know sir that such has been the opinion here for more than half a century but it was founded in error the facts are simply these my grandfather a warmhearted but impetuous young man struck an older lieutenant when ashore and on duty in one of the west india islands the penalty was death but neither the party injured nor the commander of the vessel wished to push matters to extremity and the offender was advised to absent himself from the ship at the moment of sailing the injured party was induced to take this course as in a previous quarrel my grandfather had received his fire without returning it frankly admitting his fault the ship did sail without mr gregory wychecombe and was lost every soul on board perishing my grandfather passed into virginia where he remained a twelvemonth suppressing his story lest its narration might lead to military punishment love next sealed his future fate he married a woman of fortune and though his history was well known in his own retired circle it never spread beyond it no one supposed him near the succession and there was no motive for stating the fact on account of his interests once he wrote to sir wycherly but he suppressed the letter as likely to give more pain than pleasure that letter i now have and in his own handwriting i have also his commission and all the other proofs of identity that such a person would be apt to possess they are as complete as any court in christendom would be likely to require for he never felt a necessity for changing his name he has been dead but two years and previously to dying he saw that every document necessary to establish my claim should a moment for enforcing it ever arrive was put in such a legal form as to admit of no cavilling he outlived my own father but none of us thought there was any motive for presenting ourselves as all believed that the sons of baron wychecombe were legitimate i can only say sir that i have complete legal evidence that i am heir at law of gregory the younger brother of the late sir wycherly wychecombe whether the fact will give me any rights here you best can say  it will make you heir of entail to this estate master of this house and of most of what it contains and the present baronet you have only to prove what you say to defeat every provision of this will with the exception of that which refers to the personal estate  bravo cried sir gervaise fairly rubbing his hands with delight bravo dick if we were aboard the plantagenet by the lord id turn the hands up and have three cheers so then my brave young seaman you turn out to be sir wycherly wychecombe after all  yes thats the way we always does on board ship observed galleygo to the group of domestics whenever any thing of a hallooing character turns up sometimes we makes a signal to admiral blue and the rest on em to stand by to cheer and all of us sets to to cheer as if our stomachs was lull of hurrahs and we wanted to get rid on em if sir jarvy would just pass the word now youd have a taste of that ere custom that would do your ears good for a twelvemonth its a cheering matter when the one of the trade falls heir to an estate  and would this be a proper mode of settling a question of a right of property sir gervaise oakes asked tom with more of right and reason than he commonly had of his side and that too with my uncle lying dead beneath this roof  i acknowledge the justice of the reproof young sir and will say no more in the matterat least nothing as indiscreet as my last speech sir reginald you have the affair in hand and i recommend it to your serious attention  fear nothing sir gervaise answered he of hertfordshire justice shall be done in the premises if justice rule in england your story young gentleman is probable and naturally told and i see a family likeness between you and the wychecombes generally a likeness that is certainly not to be traced in the person of the other claimant did the point depend on the legitimacy of mr thomas wychecombe it might be easily determined as i have his own mothers declaration to the fact of his illegitimacy as well as of one other material circumstance that may possibly unsettle even the late baron wychecombes will but this testamentary devise of sir wycherly appears to be perfect and nothing but the entail can defeat it you speak of your proofs where are they it is allimportant to know which party is entitled to possession  here they are sir answered wycherly removing a belt from his body and producing his papers not in the originals certainly for most of them are matters of official record in virginia but in what the lawyers call exemplified copies and which i am told are in a fit state to be read as evidence in any court in england that can take cognizance of the matter  sir reginald took the papers and began to read them one by one and with deep attention the evidence of the identity of the grandfather was full and of the clearest nature he had been recognised as an old schoolfellow by one of the governors of the colony and it was at this gentlemans suggestion that he had taken so much pains to perpetuate the evidence of his identity both the marriages one with jane beverly and the other with rebecca randolph were fully substantiated as were the two births the personal identity of the young man and this too as the only son of wycherly the eldest son of gregory was well certified to and in a way that could leave no doubt as to the person meant in a word the proofs were such as a careful and experienced lawyer would have prepared in a case that admitted of no doubt and which was liable to be contested in a court of law sir reginald was quite half an hour in looking over the papers and during this time every eye in the room was on him watching the expression of his countenance with the utmost solicitude at length he finished his task when he again turned to wycherly  these papers have been prepared with great method and an acute knowledge of what might be required he said why have they been so long suppressed and why did you permit sir wycherly to die in ignorance of your near affinity to him and of your claims  of my claims i was ignorant myself believing not only mr thomas wychecombe but his two brothers to stand before me this was the opinion of my grandfather even when he caused these proofs to be perpetuated they were given to me that i might claim affinity to the family on my arrival in england and it was the injunction of my grandfather that they should be worn on my person until the moment arrived when i could use them  this explains your not preferring the claimwhy not prefer the relationship  what for sir i found america and americans looked down on in englandcolonists spoken of as a race of inferior beingsof diminished stature feebler intellects and a waning spirit as compared to those from whom they had so recently sprung and i was too proud to confess an affinity where i saw it was not desired when wounded and expecting to die i was landed here at my own request with an intention to state the facts but falling under the care of ministering angelshere wycherly glanced his eye at mildred and her motheri less felt the want of relatives sir wycherly i honoured but he too manifestly regarded us americans as inferiors to leave any wish to tell him i was his greatnephew  i fear we are not altogether free from this reproach sir gervaise observed sir reginald thoughtfully we do appear to think there is something in the air of this part of the island that renders us better than common nay if a claim comes from over water let it be what it may it strikes us as a foreign and inadmissible claim the fate from which even princes are not exempt humbler men must certainly submit to  i can understand the feeling and i think it honourable to the young man admiral bluewater you and i have had occasion often to rebuke this very spirit in our young officers and you will agree with me when i say that this gentleman has acted naturally in acting as he has  i must corroborate what you say sir gervaise answered bluewater and as one who has seen much of the colonies and who is getting to be an old man i venture to predict that this very feeling sooner or later will draw down upon england its own consequences in the shape of condign punishment  i dont go as far as that dicki dont go as far as that but it is unwise and unsound and we who know both hemispheres ought to set our faces against it we have already some gallant fellows from that quarter of the world among us and i hope to live to see more  this let it be remembered was said before the hallowells and coffins and brentons of our own times were enrolled in a service that has since become foreign to that of the land of their birth but it was prophetic of their appearance and of that of many other high names from the colonies in the lists of the british marine wycherly smiled proudly but he made no answer all this time sir reginald had been musing on what had passed  it would seem gentlemen the latter now observed that contrary to our belief there is an heir to the baronetcy as well as to the estate of wychecombe and all our regrets that the late incumbent did not live to execute the will we had drawn at his request have become useless sir wycherly wychecombe i congratulate you on thus succeeding to the honours and estates of your family and as a member of the last i may be permitted to congratulate all of the name in being so worthily represented for one of that family i cheerfully recognise you as its head and chief  wycherly bowed his acknowledgments receiving also the compliments of most of the others present tom wychecombe however formed an exception and instead of manifesting any disposition to submit to this summary disposal of his claims he was brooding over the means of maintaining them detecting by the countenances of the upper servants that they were effectually bribed by his promise to pay the late baronets legacies he felt tolerably confident of support from that quarter he well knew that possession was nine points of the law and his thoughts naturally turned towards the means necessary to securing this great advantage as yet the two claimants were on a par in this respect for while the executed will might seem to give him a superior claim no authority that was derived from an insufficient source would be deemed available in law and sir wycherly had clearly no right to devise wychecombe so long as there existed an heir of entail both parties too were merely guests in the house so that neither had any possession that would require a legal process to eject him tom had been entered at the temple and had some knowledge of the law of the land more especially as related to real estate and he was aware that there existed some quaint ceremony of taking possession as it existed under the feudal system but he was ignorant of the precise forms and had some reasonable doubts how far they would benefit him under the peculiar circumstances of this case on the whole therefore he was disposed to try the effect of intimidation by means of the advantages he clearly possessed and of such little reason as the facts connected with his claim allowed him to offer  sir reginald wychecombe he said gravely and with as much indifference as he could assume you have betrayed a facility of belief in this american history that has surprised me in one with so high a reputation for prudence and caution this sudden revival of the dead may answer for the credulous lovers of marvels but it would hardly do for a jury of twelve soberminded and sworn men admitting the whole of this gentlemans statement to be true however you will not deny the late sir wycherlys right to make a will if he only devised his old shoes and having this right that of naming his executor necessarily accompanied it now sir i am clearly that executor and as such i demand leave to exercise my functions in this house as its temporary master at least  not so fastnot so fast young sir wills must be proved and executors qualified before either has any validity then again sir wycherly could only give authority over that which was his own the instant he ceased to breathe his brother gregorys grandson became the lifetenant of this estate the house included and i advise him to assert that right trusting to the validity of his claim for his justification in law should it become necessary in these matters he who is right is safe while he who is wrong must take the consequences of his own acts mr furlong your stewardship ceased with the life of your principal if you have any keys or papers to deliver i advise your placing them in the hands of this gentleman whom beyond all cavil i take to be the rightful sir wycherly wychecombe  furlong was a cautious clearheaded honest man and with every desire to see tom defeated he was tenacious of doing his duty he led sir reginald aside therefore and examined him at some length touching the nature of the proofs that had been offered until quite satisfied that there could be no mistake he declared his willingness to comply with the request  certainly i hold the keys of the late sir wycherlys papersthose that have just been seen in the search for the will he said and have every wish to place them in the hands of their proper owner here they are sir wycherly though i would advise you to remove the bags of gold that are in the secretary to some other place as those your uncle had a right to bequeath to whom he saw fit every thing else in the secretary goes with the estate as do the plate furniture and other heirlooms of the hall  i thank you mr furlong and i will first use these keys to follow your advice answered the new baronet then i will return them to you with a request that you will still retain the charge of all your former duties  this was no sooner said than done wycherly placing the bags of gold on the floor until some other place of security could be provided  all that i legally can sir wycherly will i cheerfully do in order to aid you in the assertion of your right though i do not see how i can transfer more than i hold qui facit per alium facit per se is good law sir reginald but the principal must have power to act before the deputy can exercise authority it appears to me that this is a case in which each party stands on his own rights at his own peril the possession of the farms is safe enough for the time being with the tenants but as to the hall and park there would seem to be no one in the legal occupancy this makes a case in which title is immediately available  such is the law mr furlong and i advise sir wycherly to take possession of the key of the outer door at once as master of the tenement  no sooner was this opinion given than wycherly left the room followed by all present to the hall here he proceeded alone to the vestibule locked the great door of the building and put the key in his pocket this act was steadily performed and in a way to counteract in a great degree the effect on the domestics of toms promises concerning the legacies at the same moment furlong whispered something in the ear of sir reginald  now you are quietly in possession sir wycherly said the latter smiling there is no necessity of keeping us all prisoners in order to maintain your claims david the usual porter mr furlong tells me is a faithful servant and if he will accept of the key as your agent it may be returned to him with perfect legal safety  as david cheerfully assented to this proposition the key was put into his hands again and the new sir wycherly was generally thought to be in possession nor did tom dare to raise the contemplated question of his own legitimacy before sir reginald who he had discovered possessed a clue to the facts and he consequently suppressed for the moment at least the certificate of marriage he had so recently forged bowing round to the whole company therefore with a sort of sarcastic compliance he stalked off to his own room with the air of an injured man this left our young hero in possession of the field but as the condition of the house was not one suitable to an unreasonable display of triumph the party soon separated some to consult concerning the future some to discourse of the past and all to wonder more or less at the present     chapter xvi      let winds be shrill let waves roll high     i fear not wove nor wind     yet marvel not sir childe that i     am sorrowful of mind           childe harold   well sir jarvy said galleygo following on the heels of the two admirals as the latter entered the dressingroom of the officer addressed it has turned out just as i thought and the county of fairvillain has come out of his hole like a porpoise coming up to breathe the moment our backs is turned as soon as we gives the order to squareaway for england and i see the old planters cabin windows turned upon franco i foreseed them consequences well gentlemen heres been a heap of prizemoney made in this house without much fighting we shall have to give the young lieutenant a leave for a few months in order that he may take his swing ashore here among his brother squires  pray sir what may be your pleasure demanded sir gervaise and what the devil has brought you at my heels  why big ships always tows small craft your honour returned galleygo simpering howsever i never comes without an errand as every body knows you see sir jarvyyou see admiral blue that our signalofficer is ashore with a report for us and meeting me in the hall he made it to me first like that i might bring it up to you aterwards his news is that the french county is gone to sea as i has just told you gentlemen  can it be possible that bunting has brought any such tidings here harkee galleygo desire mr bunting to walk up and then see that you behave yourself as is decent in a house of mourning  ayaysir no fears of i gentlemen i can put on as grievous a look as the best on em and if they wishes to see sorrow becomingly and shipshape let them study my conduct and countenance we has all seen dead men afore now gentlemen as we all knows when we fout mounsheer graveland gravelin we had fortyseven slain besides the hurt that lived to tell their own pain and when we had the  go to the devil master galleygo and desire mr bunting to walk up stairs cried sir gervaise impatiently  ayaysir which will your honour have done first  let me see the signalofficer first answered the viceadmiral laughing then be certain of executing the other order  well muttered galleygo as he descended the stairs if i was to do as he says now what would we do with the fleet ships wants orders to fight and flags wants food to give orders and food wants stewards to be put upon the table and stewards wants no devils to help em do their duty nonosir jarvy ill not pay that visit till we all goes in company as is suitable for them that has sailed so long together  this will be great news dick if de vervillin has really come out cried sir gervaise rubbing his hands with delight hang me if i wait for orders from london but well sail with the first wind and tide let them settle the quarrel at home as they best can it is our business to catch the frenchman how many ships do you really suppose the count to have  twelve of two decks besides one threedecker and beating us in frigates two or three however are short vessels and cannot be quite as heavy as our own i see no reason why we should not engage him  i rejoice to hear you say so how much more honourable is it to seek the enemy than to be intriguing about a court i hope you intend to let me announce that red riband in general orders tomorrow dick  never with my consent sir gervaise so long as the house of hanover confers the boon but what an extraordinary scene we have just had below this young lieutenant is a noble fellow and i hope with all my heart he will be enabled to make good his claim  of that sir reginald assures me there can be no manner of doubt his papers are in perfect order and his story simple and probable do you not remember hearing when we were midshipmen in the west indies of a lieutenant of the sapphos striking a senior officer ashore and of his having been probably saved from the sentence of death by the loss of the ship  as well as if it were yesterday now you name the vessel and this you suppose to have been the late sir wycherlys brother did he belong to the sappho  so they tell me below and it leaves no doubt on my mind of the truth of the whole story  it is a proof too how easy it is for one to return to england and maintain his rights after an absence of more than half a century he in scotland has a claim quite as strong as that of this youth  dick bluewater you seem determined to pull a house down about your own ears what have you or i to do with these scotch adventurers when a gallant enemy invites us to come out and meet him but mumhere is bunting  at this instant the signallieutenant of the plantagenet was shown into the room by galleygo in person  well bunting what tidings from the fleet demanded sir gervaise do the ships still ride to the flood  it is slackwater sir gervaise and the vessels are looking all ways at once most of us are clearing hawse for there are more round turns in our cables than i remember ever to have seen in so short a time  that comes of there being no wind and the uselessness of the staysails and spankers what has brought you ashore galleygo tells us something of a cutters coming in with information that the french are out but his news is usually galleynews  not always sir gervaise returned the lieutenant casting a sidelook at the steward who often comforted him with ships delicacies in the admirals cabin this time he is right at least the active is coming in slowly and has been signalling us all the morning we make her out to say that monsieur vervillin is at sea with his whole force  yes muttered galleygo to the rearadmiral in a sort of aside the county of fairvillain has come out of his hole just as i told sir jarvy fairweathervillains they all is and no bones broken  silenceand you think bunting you read the signals clearly  no doubt of it sir gervaise captain greenly is of the same opinion and has sent me ashore with the news he desired me to tell you that the ebb would make in half an hour and that we can then fetch past the rocks to the westward light as the wind is  ay that is greenly i can swearhell not sit down until we are all aweigh and standing out does the cutter tell us which way the count was looking  to the westward sir on an easy bowline and under short canvass  the gentleman is in no hurry it would seem has he a convoy  not a sail sir nineteen sail all cruisers and only twelve of the line he has one twodecker and two frigates more than we can muster just a frenchmans odds sir  the count has certainly with him the seven new ships that were built last season quietly observed bluewater leaning back in his easychair until his body inclined at an angle of fortyfive degrees and stretching a leg on an empty stand in his usual selfindulgent manner they are a little heavier than their old vessels and will give us harder work  the tougher the job the more creditable the workmanship the tide is turning you say bunting  it is sir gervaise and we shall all tend ebb in twenty minutes the frigates outside are riding down channel already the chloe seems to think that we shall be moving soon as she has crossed topgallant and royalyards even captain greenly was thinking of stretching along the messenger  ah youre a set of uneasy fellows all roundyou tire of your native land in twentyfour hours i find well mr bunting you can go off and say that all is very well this house is in a sad state of confusion as i presume you know mention this to captain greenly  ayaysir is it your pleasure i should tell him any thing else sir gervaise oakes  whyyesbunting answered the viceadmiral smiling you may as well give him a hint to get all his fresh grub off as fast as he canandyes to let no more men quit the ship on liberty  any thing more sir gervaise added the pertinacious officer  on the whole you may as well run up a signal to be ready to unmoor the ships can very well ride at single anchors when the tide has once fairly made what say you bluewater  a signal to unmoor at once would expedite matters you know very well you intend to go to sea and why not do the thing offhand  i dare say now bunting you too would like to give the commanderinchief a nudge of some sort or other  if i could presume so far sir gervaise i can only say sir that the sooner we are off the sooner we shall flog the french  and master galleygo what are your sentiments on this occasion it is a full council and all ought to speak freely  you knows sir jarvy that i never speaks in these matters unless spoken to admiral blue and your honour are quite enough to take care of the fleet in most circumstances though there is some knowledge in the tops as well as in the cabin my ideas is gentlemen that by casting to starboard on this ebb tide we shall all have our heads offshore and we shall fetch into the offing as easily as a country wench turns in a jig what we shall do with the fleet when we gets out will be shown in our ultra movements  by ultra david meant ulterior a word he had caught up from hearing despatches read which he understood no better than those who wrote them at the admiralty  thanks to you all my friends cried sir gervaise who was so delighted at the prospect of a general engagement that he felt a boyish pleasure in this fooling and now to business seriously mr bunting i would have the signal for sailing shown let each ship fire a recallgun for her boats half an hour later show the bunting to unmoor and send my boat ashore as soon as you begin to heave on the capstan so goodmorning my fine fellow and show your activity  mr bunting as you pass the c√¶sar do me the favour to ask for my boat also said bluewater lazily but halfraising his body to look after the retiring lieutenant if we are to move i suppose i shall have to go with the rest of them of course we shall repeat all your signals  sir gervaise waited until bunting was out of the room when he turned to the steward and said with some dryness of manner  mr galleygo you have my permission to go on board bag and baggage  yes sir jarvy i understands we are about to get the ships under way and good men ought to be in their places goodby admiral blue we shall meet before the face of the french and then i expects every man on us will set an example to himself of courage and devotion  that fellow grows worse and worse each day and i shall have to send him forward in order to check his impertinence said sir gervaise halfvexed and halflaughing i wonder you stand his saucy familiarity as well as you appear to dowith his admiral blues  i shall take offence as soon as i find sir jarvy really out of humour with him the man is brave honest and attached and these are virtues that would atone for a hundred faults  let the fellow go to the devildo you not think i had better go out without waiting for despatches from town  it is hard to say your orders may send us all down into scotland to face charles stuart perhaps too they may make you a duke and me a baron in order to secure our fidelity  the blackguardswell say no more of that just now if m de vervillin is steering to the westward he can hardly be aiming at edinburgh and the movements in the north  that is by no means so certain your really politic fellows usually look one way and row another  it is my opinion that his object is to effect a diversion and my wish is to give it to him to his hearts content so long as this force is kept near the chops of the channel it can do no harm in the north and insomuch must leave the road to germany open  for one i think it a pitynot to say a disgracethat england cannot settle her own quarrels without calling in the aid of either frenchman or dutchman  we must take the world as it is dick and act like two straightforward seamen without stopping to talk politics i take it for granted notwithstanding your stuart fervour that you are willing enough to help me thresh monsieur de vervillin  beyond a question nothing but the conviction that he was directly employed in serving my natural and legitimate prince could induce me to show him any favour still oakes it is possible he may have succours for the scotch on board and be bound to the north by the way of the irish channel  ay pretty succours truly for an englishman to stomach mousquetaires and r√©giments de croy or de dillon or some dd french name or other and perhaps beautiful muskets from the bois de vincennes or some other infernal nest of gallic inventions to put down the just ascendency of old england nonodick bluewater your excellent loyal truehearted english mother never bore you to be a dupe of bourbon perfidy and trick i dare say she sickened at the very name of louis  ill not answer for that sir jarvy returned the rearadmiral with a vacant smile for she passed some time at the court of le grand monarque but all this is idle we know each others opinions and by this time ought to know each others characters have you digested any plan for your future operations and what part am i to play in it  sir gervaise paced the room with hands folded behind his back in an air of deep contemplation for quite five minutes before he answered all this time bluewater remained watching his countenance and movements in anticipation of what was to come at length the viceadmiral appeared to have made up his mind and he delivered himself of his decision as follows  i have reflected on them dick he said even while my thoughts have seemed to be occupied with the concerns of others if de vervillin is out he must still be to the eastward of us for running as the tides do on the french coast he can hardly have made much westing with this light southwest wind we are yet uncertain of his destination and it is allimportant that we get immediate sight of him and keep him in view until he can be brought to action now my plan is this i will send out the ships in succession with orders to keep on an easy bowline until each reaches the chops of the channel when she is to go about and stand in towards the english coast each succeeding vessel however will weigh as soon as her leader is hull down and keep within signal distance in order to send intelligence through the whole line nothing will be easier than to keep in sight of each other in such fine weather and by these means we shall spread a wide clewquite a hundred milesand command the whole of the channel as soon as monsieur de vervillin is made the fleet can close when we will be governed by circumstances should we see nothing of the french by the time we make their coast we may be certain they have gone up channel and then a signal from the van can reverse the order of sailing and we will chase to the eastward closing to a line abreast as fast as possible  all this is very well certainly and by means of the frigates and smaller cruisers we can easily sweep a hundred and fifty miles of oceannevertheless the fleet will be much scattered  you do not think there will be any danger of the frenchs engaging the van before the rear can close to aid it asked sir gervaise with interest for he had the profoundest respect for his friends professional opinions i intended to lead out in the plantagenet myself and to have five or six of the fastest ships next to me with a view that we might keep off until you could bring up the rear if they chase you know we can retire  beyond a doubt if sir gervaise oakes can make up his mind to retire before any frenchman who was ever born returned bluewater laughing all this sounds well but in the event of a meeting i should expect to find you with the whole van dismasted fighting your hulks like bulldogs and keeping the count at bay leaving the glory of covering your retreat to me  nonodick ill give you my honour ill do nothing so boyish and silly im a different man at fiftyfive from what i was at twentyfive you may be certain that i will run until i think myself strong enough to fight  will you allow me to make a suggestion admiral oakes and this with all the frankness that ought to characterize our ancient friendship  sir gervaise stopped short in his walk looked bluewater steadily in the face and nodded his head  i understand by the expression of your countenance continued the other that i am expected to speak i had no more to say than to make the simple suggestion that your plan would be most likely to be executed were i to lead the van and were you to bring up the rear  the devil you dothis comes as near mutinyor scandalum magnatumas one can wish and why do you suppose that the plan of the commanderinchief will be least in danger of failing if admiral bluewater lead on this occasion instead of admiral oakes  merely because i think admiral oakes when an enemy is pressing him is more apt to take counsel of his heart than of his head while admiral bluewater is not you do not know yourself sir jarvy if you think it so easy a matter to run away  ive spoiled you dick by praising your foolish manoeuvring so much before your face and thats the whole truth of the matter nomy mind is made up and i believe you know me well enough to feel sure when that is the case even a council of war could not move it i lead out in the first twodecked ship that lifts her anchor and you follow in the last you understand my plan and will see it executed as you see every thing executed in face of the enemy  admiral bluewater smiled and not altogether without irony in his manner though he managed at the same time to get the leg that had been lowest for the last five minutes raised by an ingenuity peculiar to himself several inches above its fellow  nature never made you for a conspirator oakes he said as soon as this change was effected to his mind for you carry a toplight in your breast that even the blind can see  what crotchet is uppermost in your mind now dick arnt the orders plain enough to suit you  i confess itas well as the motive for giving them just in this form  lets have it at once i prefer a full broadside to your minuteguns what is my motive  simply that you sir jarvy say to a certain sir gervaise oakes bart viceadmiral of the red and member for bowldero in your own mind now if i can just leave that fellow dick bluewater behind me with four or five ships hell never desert me when in front of the enemy whatever he might do with king george and so ill make sure of him by placing the question in such a light that it shall be one of friendship rather than one of loyalty  sir gervaise coloured to the temples for the other had penetrated into his most secret thoughts and yet spite of his momentary vexation he faced his accuser and both laughed in the heartfelt manner that the circumstance would be likely to excite  harkee dick said the viceadmiral as soon as he could command sufficient gravity to speak they made a mistake when they sent you to sea you ought to have been apprenticed to a conjuror i care not what you think about it my orders are given and they must be obeyed have you a clear perception of the plan  one quite as clear i tell you as i have of the motive  enough of this bluewater we have serious duties before us  sir gervaise now entered more at length into his scheme explaining to his friend all his wishes and hopes and letting him know with official minuteness what was expected at his hands the rearadmiral listened with his accustomed respect whenever any thing grave was in discussion between them and had any one entered while they were thus engaged he would have seen in the manner of one nothing but the dignified frankness of a friendly superior and in the other the deference which the naval inferior usually pays to rank as he concluded sir gervaise rang his bell and desired the presence of sir wycherly wychecombe  i could have wished to remain and see this battle for the succession fairly fought he said but a battle of a different sort calls us in another quarter show him in he added as his man intimated that the young baronet was in waiting  what between the duties of our professional stations and those of the guest to the host said the viceadmiral rising and bowing to the young man it is not easy to settle the question of etiquette between us sir wycherly and i have from habit thought more of the admiral and the lieutenant than of the lord of the manor and his obliged guests if i have erred you will excuse me  my new situation is so very novel that i still remain all sailor sir gervaise answered the other smiling as such i hope you will ever consider me can i be of any service here  one of our cutters has just come in with news that will take the fleet to sea again this morning or as soon as the tide begins to run a strong ebb the french are out and we must go and look for them it was my intention and my hope to be able to take you to sea with me in the plantagenet the date of your commission would not put you very high among her lieutenants but bunting deserves a first lieutenancy and i meant to give it to him this afternoon in which case there would be a vacancy in the situation of my own signalofficer a duty you could well perform as it is you ought not to quit this house and i must take my leave of you with regret it is so  admiral oakes what is there that ought to keep one of my station ashore on the eve of a general battle i sincerely hope and trust you will alter the last determination and return to the first  you forget your own important interestsremember that possession is nine points of the law  we had heard the news below and sir reginald mr furlong and myself were discussing the matter when i received your summons these gentlemen tell me that possession can be held by deputy as well as in person i am satisfied we can dispose of this objection  your grandfathers brother and the late head of your family lies dead in this house it is proper his successor should be present at his funeral obsequies  we thought of that also sir reginald has kindly offered to appear in my place and then there is the chance that the meeting with monsieur de vervillin will take place within the next eightandforty hours whereas my uncle cannot be interred certainly for a week or ten days  i see you have well calculated all the chances young sir said sir gervaise smiling bluewater how does this matter strike you  leave it in my hands and i will see to it you will sail near or quite twentyfour hours before me and there will be time for more reflection sir wycherly can remain with me in the c√¶sar in the action or he can be thrown aboard the plantagenet when we meet  after a little reflection sir gervaise who liked to give every one a fair chance consented to the arrangement and it was decided that wycherly should come out in the c√¶sar if nothing occurred to render the step improper  this arrangement completed the viceadmiral declared he was ready to quit the hall galleygo and the other servants had already made the dispositions necessary for embarking and it only remained to take leave of the inmates of the dwelling the parting between the baronets was friendly for the common interest they felt in the success of wycherly had in a degree rendered them intimates and much disposed sir reginald to overlook the sailors wellknown whiggery dutton and the ladies took their departure at the same time and what passed between them and sir gervaise on this occasion took place on the road to the headland whither all parties proceeded on foot  a person so important as sir gervaise oakes did not leave the roof that had sheltered him to embark on board his own ship without a due escort to the shore bluewater accompanied him in order to discuss any little point of duty that might occur to the mind of either at the last moment and wycherly was of the group partly from professional feeling and more from a desire to be near mildred then there were atwood and the surgeons mr rotherham and two or three of the cabin attendants lord geoffrey too strolled along with the rest though it was understood that his own ship would not sail that day  just as the party issued from the gate of the park into the street of the hamlet a heavy gun was fired from the fleet it was soon succeeded by others and whiffs and cornets were seen flying from the mastheads that rose above the openings in the cliffs the signals of recall for all boats this set every one in motion and never within the memory of man had wychecombe presented such a scene of confusion and activity halfintoxicated seamen were driven down to the boats by youngsters with the cloth diamond in their collars like swine who were reluctant to go and yet afraid to stay quarters of beeves were trundled along in carts or barrows and were soon seen swinging at different mainstays while the gathering of eggs butter poultry mutton lamb and veal menaced the surrounding country with a scarcity through this throng of the living and the dead our party held its way jostled by the eager countrymen and respectfully avoided by all who belonged to the fleet until it reached the point where the roads to the cliffs and the landing separated when the viceadmiral turned to the only midshipman present and courteously lifting his hat as if reluctant to impose such a duty on a young gentleman on liberty he said  do me the favour lord geoffrey to step down to the landing and ascertain if my barge is there the officer of the boat will find me at the signalstation  the boy cheerfully complied and this son of an english duke who by the death of an elder brother became in time a duke himself went on a service that among gentlemen of the land would be deemed nearly menial with as much alacrity as if he felt honoured by the request it was by a training like this that england came in time to possess a marine that has achieved so many memorable deeds since it taught those who were destined to command the high and useful lesson how to obey  while the midshipman was gone to look for the boat the two admirals walked the cliff side by side discussing their future movements and when all was ready sir gervaise descended to the shore using the very path by which he had ascended the previous day and pushing through the throng that crowded the landing almost too much engaged to heed even his approach he entered his barge in another minute the measured strokes of the oars urged him swiftly towards the plantagenet     chapter xvii      twas not without some reason for the wind       increased at night until it blew a gale     and though twas not much to a naval mind       some landsmen would have lookd a little pale     for sailors are in fact a different kind       at sunset they began to take in sail     for the sky showd it would come on to blow       and carry away perhaps a mast or so           byron   as it was just past the turn of the day bluewater determined to linger on the cliffs for several hours or until it was time to think of his dinner abstracted as his thoughts were habitually his mind found occupation and pleasure in witnessing the evolutions that succeeded among the ships some of which evolutions it may be well now briefly to relate  sir gervaise oakes foot had not been on the deck of the plantagenet five minutes before a signal for all commanders was flying at that vessels masthead in ten minutes more every captain of the fleet with the exception of those belonging to the vessels in the offing were in the flagships cabin listening to the intentions and instructions of the viceadmiral  my plan of sailing gentlemen is easily comprehended continued the commanderinchief after he had explained his general intentions to chase and engage and everyone of you will implicitly follow it we have the tide strong at ebb and a good sixknot breeze is coming up at southwest i shall weigh with my yards square and keep them so until the ship has drawn out of the fleet and then i shall luff up on a taut bowline and on the starboard tack bringing the ebb well under my leebow this will hawse the ship over towards morlaix and bringing us quite as far to windward as is desirable while the ebb lasts and this breeze stands we shall have plain sailing the difficulty will come on the flood or with a shift of wind the ships that come out last must be careful to keep their seconds ahead and astern in plain sight and regulate their movements as much as they can by the leading vessels the object is to spread as wide a clew as possible while we hold the ships within signaldistance of each other towards sunset i shall shorten sail and the line will close up within a league from vessel to vessel and i have told bluewater to use his discretion about coming out with the last ships though i have requested him to hold on as long as he shall deem it prudent in the hope of receiving another express from the admiralty when the flood makes i do not intend to go about but shall continue on the starboard tack and i wish you all to do the same this will bring the leading vessels considerably to windward of those astern and may possibly throw the fleet into a bow and quarter line being in the van it will fall to my duty to look to this and to watch for the consequences but i ask of you to keep an eye on the weather and to hold your ships within plain signaldistance of each other if it come on thick or to blow very hard we must close from van to rear and try our luck in a search in compact order let the man who first sees the enemy make himself heard at once and send the news with the bearings of the french both ahead and astern as fast as possible in that case you will all close on the point from which the intelligence comes and mark me no cruising to get to windward in your own fashions as if you sailed with roving commissions you know ill not stand that and now gentlemen it is probable that we shall all never meet again god bless you come and shake hands with me one by one and then to your boats for the first lieutenant has just sent greenly word that we are up and down let him trip greenly and be off as soon as we can  the leavetaking a scene in which joyousness and sadness were strangely mingled succeeded and then the captains disappeared from that moment every mind was bent on sailing  although bluewater did not witness the scene in the plantagenets cabin he pictured it in his minds eye and remained on the cliffs to watch the succeeding movements as wycherly had disappeared in the house and dutton clung to his flagstaff the rearadmiral had no one but lord geoffrey for a companion the latter perceiving that his relation did not seem disposed to converse had the tact to be silent himself a task that was less difficult than common on account of the interest he felt in the spectacle  the boats of the different captains were still shoving off from the starboard side of the plantagenet whither etiquette had brought them together in a little crowd when her three topsails fell and their sheets steadily drew the clews towards the ends of the lower yards even while this was in process the yards began to ascend and rose with that steady but graduated movement which marks the operation in a manofwar all three were fairly mastheaded in two minutes as the wind struck the canvass obliquely the sails filled as they opened their folds and by the time their surfaces were flattened by distension the plantagenet steadily moved from her late berth advancing slowly against a strong tide out of the group of ships among which she had been anchored this was a beautiful evolution resembling that of a seafowl which lazily rises on its element spreads its wings emerges from the water and glides away to some distant and unseen point  the movement of the flagship was stately measured and grand for five minutes she held her way nearly due east with the wind on her starboard quarter meeting the tide in a direct line until having drawn sufficiently ahead of the fleet she let fall her courses sheeted home topgallantsails and royals set her spanker jibs and staysails and braced up sharp on a wind with her head at southsoutheast this brought the tide well under her lee forechains and set her rapidly off the land and to windward as she trimmed her sails and steadied her bowlines she fired a gun made the numbers of the vessels in the offing to weigh and to pass within hail all this did bluewater note with the attention of an amateur as well as with the critical analysis of a connoisseur  very handsomely done master geoffreyvery handsomely done it must be allowed never did a bird quit a flock with less fuss or more beautifully than the plantagenet has drawn out of the fleet it must be admitted that greenly knows how to handle his ship  i fancy captain stowel would have done quite as well with the c√¶sar sir answered the boy with a proper espritdeship dont you remember admiral bluewater the time when we got under way off lorient with the wind blowing a gale directly on shore even sir gervaise said afterwards that we lost less ground than any ship in the fleet and yet the plantagenet is the most weatherly twodecker in the navy as every body says  every bodyshe is certainly a weatherly vessel but not more so than several others whom did you ever hear give that character to this particular ship  why sir her reefers are always bragging as much as that and a great deal more too  her reefersyoung gentlemen are particularly struck with the charms of their first loves both ashore and afloat my boy did you ever hear an old seaman say that much for the plantagenet  i think i have sir returned lord geoffrey blushing galleygo sir gervaises steward is commonly repeating some such stuff or other they are furious braggarts the plantagenets all round sir  that comes honestly answered bluewater smiling her namesakes and predecessors of old having some such characteristic too look at that ships yards boy and learn how to trim a vessels sails on a wind the pencil of a painter could not draw lines more accurate  captain stowel tells us sir that the yards ought not to be braced in exactly alike but that we ought to check the weatherbraces a little as we go aloft so that the topsail yard should point a little less forward than the lower yard and the topgallant than the topsail  you are quite right in taking stowels opinion in all such matters geoffrey but has not captain greenly done the same thing in the plantagenet when i speak of symmetry i mean the symmetry of a seaman  the boy was silenced though exceedingly reluctant to admit that any ship could equal his own in the mean time there was every appearance of a change in the weather just about the time the plantagenet braced up the wind freshened and in ten minutes it blew a stiff breeze some time before the admiral spoke the vessels outside he was compelled to take in all his light canvass and when he filled again after giving his orders to the frigate and sloop the topgallant sheets were let fly a single reef was taken in the topsails and the lighter sails were set over them this change in the weather more especially as the night threatened to be clouded if not absolutely dark would necessarily bring about a corresponding change in the plan of sailing reducing the intervals between the departures of the vessels quite onehalf to such vicissitudes are all maritime operations liable and it is fortunate when there is sufficient capacity in the leaders to remedy them  in less than an hour the plantagenets hull began to sink to those on a level with it when the carnatic tripped her anchor opened her canvass shot out of the fleet hauled by the wind and followed in the admirals wake so accurate was the course she steered that half an hour after she had braced up a hawsebucket which had been dropped from the plantagenet in hauling water was picked up we may add here though it will be a little anticipating events that the thunderer followed the carnatic the blenheim the thunderer the achilles the blenheim the warspite the achilles the dover the warspite the york the dover the elizabeth the york the dublin the elizabeth and the c√¶sar the dublin but hours passed before all these ships were in motion and hours in which we shall have some occurrences to relate that took place on shore still it will aid the reader in better understanding the future incidents of our tale if we describe at once some of the circumstances under which all these ships got in motion  by the time the plantagenets topsails were beginning to dip from the cliffs the carnatic the thunderer the blenheim the achilles and the warspite were all stretching out in line with intervals of quite two leagues between them under as much canvass as they could now bear the admiral had shortened sail the most and was evidently allowing the carnatic to close most probably on account of the threatening look of the sky to windward while he was suffering the frigate and sloop the chloe and driver to pass ahead of him the one on his weather and the other on his lee bow when the dover weighed the admirals upper sail was not visible from her tops though the warspites hull had not yet disappeared from her deck she left the fleet or the portions of it that still remained at anchor with her forecourse set and hauled by the wind under doublereefed topsails a single reef in her mainsail and with her maintopgallant sail set over its proper sail with this reduced canvass she started away on the track of her consorts the brine foaming under her bows and with a heel that denoted the heavy pressure that bore on her sails by this time the york was aweigh the tide had turned and it became necessary to fill on the other tack in order to clear the land to the eastward this altered the formation but we will now revert to the events as they transpired on the shore with a view to relate them more in their regular order  it is scarcely necessary to say that bluewater must have remained on or about the cliffs several hours in order to witness the departure of so many of the vessels instead of returning to the hall at the dinner hour agreeably to promise he profited by the appearance of wycherly who left the cottage with a flushed agitated manner just as he was thinking of the necessity of sending a message to sir reginald and begged the young man to be the bearer of his excuses he thought that the change in the weather rendered it necessary for him to remain in sight of the sea dutton overheard this message and after a private conference with his wife he ventured to invite his superior to appease his appetite under his own humble roof to this bluewater cheerfully assented and when the summons came to the table to his great joy he found that his only companion was to be mildred who like himself for some reason known only to her own bosom had let the ordinary dining hour pass without appearing at table but whom her mother had now directed to take some sustenance  the late events at the hall have agitated the poor child sir said mrs dutton in the way of apology and she has not tasted food since morning i have told her you would excuse the intrusion and receive her carving and attentions as an excuse for her company  bluewater looked at the pallid countenance of the girl and never before had he found the resemblance to agnes hedworth so strong as that moment the last year or two of his own sweet friends life had been far from happy and the languid look and tearful eyes of mildred revived the recollection of the dead with painful distinctness  good god he murmured to himself that two such beings should exist only to suffer my good mrs dutton make no excuses but believe me when i say that you could not have found in england another that would have proved as welcome as my present little messmate  mildred struggled for a smile and she did succeed in looking extremely grateful beyond this however it exceeded her powers to go mrs dutton was gratified and soon left the two to partake of their neat but simple meal by themselves household duties requiring her presence elsewhere  let me persuade you to take a glass of this really excellent port my child said bluewater if you had cruised as long as i have done on the coast of portugal you would know how to value a liquor as pure as this i dont know of an admiral that has as good  it is probably our last sir answered mildred shaking a tear from each of her long dark lashes by an involuntarily trembling motion as she spoke it was a present from dear old sir wycherly who never left my mother wholly unsupplied with such plain delicacies as he fancied poverty placed beyond our reach the wine we can easily forget not so easily the donor  bluewater felt as if he could draw a cheque for onehalf the fortune he had devised to his companion and yet by a caprice of feeling that is not uncommon to persons of the liveliest susceptibility he answered in a way to smother his own emotion  there will not soon be another old sir wycherly to make his neighbours comfortable but there is a young one who is not likely to forget his uncles good example i hope you all here rejoice at the sudden rise in fortune that has so unexpectedly been placed within the reach of our favourite lieutenant  a look of anguish passed over mildreds face and her companion noted it though surprise and pitynot to say resentmentprevented his betraying his discovery  we endeavour to be glad sir answered mildred smiling in so suffering a manner as to awaken all her companions sympathies but it is not easy for us to rejoice at any thing which is gained by the loss of our former valued friend  i am aware that a young follow like the present sir wycherly can be no substitute for an old fellow like the last sir wycherly my dear but as one is a sailor and the other was only a landsman my professional prejudices may not consider the disparity as great as it may possibly appear to be to your less partial judgment  bluewater thought the glance he received was imploring and he instantly regretted that he had taken such means to divert his companions sadness some consciousness of this regret probably passed through mildreds mind for she rallied her spirits and made a partially successful effort to be a more agreeable companion  my father thinks sir she said that our late pleasant weather is about to desert us and that it is likely to blow heavily before sixandthirty hours are over  i am afraid mr dutton will prove to be too accurate an almanac the weather has a breeding look and i expect a dirty night good or bad we seamen must face it and that too in the narrow seas where gales of wind are no gales of araby  ah sir it is a terrible life to lead by living on this cliff i have learned to pity sailors  perhaps my child you pity us when we are the most happy nine seamen in ten prefer a respectable gale to a flat calm there are moments when the ocean is terrific but on the whole it is capricious rather than malignant the night that is before us promises to be just such a one as sir gervaise oakes delights in he is never happier than when he hears a gale howling through the cordage of his ship  i have heard him spoken of as a very daring and selfrelying commander but you cannot entertain such feelings admiral bluewater for to me you seem better fitted for a fireside well filled with friends and relatives than for the conflicts and hardships of the sea  mildred had no difficulty now in forcing a smile for the sweet one she bestowed on the veteran almost tempted him to rise and fold her in his arms as a parent would wrap a beloved daughter to his heart discretion however prevented a betrayal of feelings that might have been misinterpreted and he answered in his original vein  i fear i am a wolf in sheeps clothing he said while oakes admits the happiness he feels in seeing his ship ploughing through a raging sea in a dark night he maintains that my rapture is sought in a hurricane i do not plead guilty to the accusation but i will allow there is a sort of fierce delight in participating as it might be in a wild strife of the elements to me my very nature seems changed at such moments and i forget all that is mild and gentle that comes of having lived so much estranged from your sex my dear desolate bachelor as i am  do you think sailors ought to marry asked mildred with a steadiness that surprised herself for while she put the question consciousness brought the blood to her temples  i should be sorry to condemn a whole profession and that one i so well love to the hopeless misery of single life there are miseries peculiar to the wedded lives of both soldiers and sailors but are there not miseries peculiar to those who never separate i have heard seamen saymen too who loved their wives and familiesthat they believed the extreme pleasure of meetings after long separations the delights of hope and the zest of excited feelings have rendered their years of active service more replete with agreeable sensations than the stagnant periods of peace never having been married myself i can only speak on report  ah this may be so with men butsurelysurelywomen never can feel thus  i suppose a sailors daughter yourself you know jacks account of his wifes domestic creed a good fire a clean hearth the children abed and the husband at sea is supposed to be the climax of felicity  this may do for the sailors jokes admiral bluewater answered mildred smiling but it will hardly ease a breaking heart i fear from all i have heard this afternoon and from the sudden sailing of the ships that a great battle is at hand  and why should you a british officers daughter dread that have you so little faith in us as to suppose a battle will necessarily bring defeat i have seen much of my own profession miss dutton and trust i am in some small degree above the rhodomontade of the braggarts but it is not usual for us to meet the enemy and to give those on shore reason to be ashamed of the english flag it has never yet been my luck to meet a frenchman who did not manifest a manly desire to do his country credit and i have always felt that we must fight hard for him before we could get him nor has the result ever disappointed me still fortune or skill or right is commonly of our side and has given us the advantage in the end  and to which sir do you ascribe a success at sea so very uniform  as a protestant i ought to say to our religion but this my own knowledge of protestant vices rejects then to say fortune would be an exceeding selfabasementone that between us is not needed and i believe i must impute it to skill as plain seamen i do believe we are more expert than most of our neighbours though i am far from being positive we have any great advantage over them in tactics if any the dutch are our equals  notwithstanding you are quite certain of success it must be a great encouragement to enter into the fight with a strong confidence in victory i supposethat is it seems to meit is a matter of course sirthat our new sir wycherly will not be able to join in the battle this time  mildred spoke timidly and she endeavoured to seem unconcerned but bluewater read her whole heart and pitied the pain which she had inflicted on herself in asking the question it struck him too that a girl of his companions delicacy and sensibility would not thus advert to the young mans movements at all if the latter had done aught justly to awaken censure and this conviction greatly relieved his mind as to the effect of sudden elevation on the handsome lieutenant as it was necessary to answer however lest mildred might detect his consciousness of her feelings not a moment was lost before making a reply  it is not an easy matter to prevent a young dashing sailor like this sir wycherly wychecombe from doing his part in a general engagement and that too of the character of the one to which we are looking forward he said oakes has left the matter in my hands i suppose i shall have to grant the young mans request  he has then requested to be received in your ship asked mildred her hand shaking as she used the spoon it held  that of course no one who wears the uniform could or would do less it seems a ticklish moment for him to quit wychecombe too where i fancy he will have a battle of his own to fight ere long but professional feeling will overshadow all others in young men among us seamen it is said to be even stronger than love  mildred made no answer but her pale cheek and quivering lips evidences of feeling that her artlessness did not enable her to conceal caused bluewater again to regret the remark with a view to restore the poor girl to her selfcommand he changed the subject of conversation which did not again advert to wycherly the remainder of the meal was consequently eaten in peace the admiral manifesting to the last however the sudden and generous interest he had taken in the character and welfare of his companion when they rose from table mildred joined her mother and bluewater walked out upon the cliffs again  it was now evening and the waste of water that lay stretched before the eye though the softness of summer was shed upon it had the wild and dreary aspect that the winds and waves lend to a view as the light of day is about to abandon the ocean to the gloom of night all this had no effect on bluewater however who knew that twodecked ships strongly manned with their heavy canvass reduced would make light work of worrying through hours of darkness that menaced no more than these still the wind had freshened and when he stood on the verge of the cliff sustained by the breeze which pressed him back from the precipice rendering his head more steady and his footing sure the elizabeth was casting under closereefed topsails and two reefs in her courses with a heavy staysail or two to ease her helm he saw that the ponderous machine would stagger under even this short canvass and that her captain had made his dispositions for a windy night the lights that the dover and the york carried in their tops were just beginning to be visible in the gathering gloom the last about a league and a half down channel the ship standing in that direction to get to windward and the former more to the southward the vessel having already tacked to follow the admiral a chain of lights connected the whole of the long line and placed the means of communication in the power of the captains at this moment the plantagenet was full fifty miles at sea ploughing through a heavy southwest swell which the wind was driving into the chops of the channel from the direction of the bay of biscay and the broad atlantic  bluewater buttoned his coat and he felt his frame invigorated by a gale that came over his person loaded by the peculiar flavour of the sea but two of the heavy ships remained at their anchors the dublin and the c√¶sar and his experienced eye could see that stowel had every thing on board the latter ready to trip and be off as soon as he himself should give the order at this moment the midshipman who had been absent for hours returned and stood again at his side  our turn will soon come sir said the gallant boy and for one i shall not be sorry to be in motion those chaps on board the plantagenet will swagger like so many dons if they should happen to get a broadside at monsieur de vervillin while we are lying here under the shore like a gentlemans yacht hauled into a bay that the ladies might eat without disturbing their stomachs  little fear of that geoffrey the active is too light of foot especially in the weather we have had to suffer heavy ships to be so close on her heels she must have had some fifteen or twenty miles the start and the french have been compelled to double cape la hogue and alderney before they could even look this way if coming down channel at all they are fully fifty miles to the eastward and should our van stretch far enough by morning to head them off it will bring us handsomely to windward sir gervaise never set a better trap than he has done this very day the elizabeth has her hands full boy and the wind seems to be getting scant for her if it knock her off much more it will bring the flood on her weatherbow and compel her to tack this will throw the rear of our line into confusion  what should we do sir in such a case it would never answer to leave poor sir jarvy out there by himself  we would try not to do that returned bluewater smiling at the affectionate solicitude of the lad a solicitude that caused him slightly to forget his habitual respect for the commanderinchief and to adopt the sobriquet of the fleet in such a case it would become my duty to collect as many ships as i could and to make the best of our way towards the place where we might hope to fall in with the others in the morning there is little danger of losing each other for any length of time in these narrow waters and i have few apprehensions of the french being far enough west to fall in with our leading vessels before morning if they should indeed geoffrey  ay sir if they should i know well enough what would come to pass  what boyon the supposition that monsieur de vervillin did meet with sir gervaise by daybreak what in your experienced eyes seem most likely to be the consequences  why sir sir jarvy would go at em like a dolphin at a flyingfish and if he should really happen to catch one or two of em therell be no sailing in company with the plantagenets for us c√¶sarswhen we had the last bout with monsieur de gravelin they were as saucy as peacocks because we didnt close until their foreyard and mizzentopgallantmast were gone although the shift of wind brought us dead to leeward and after all we had eleven men the most hurt in the fight you dont know them plantagenets sir for they never dare say any thing before you  not to the discredit of my young c√¶sars ill answer for it yet youll remember sir gervaise gave us full credit in his despatches  yes sir all very true sir gervaise knows better and then he understands what the c√¶sar is and what she can do and has done but its a very different matter with his youngsters who fancy because they carry a red flag at the fore they are so many blakes and howards themselves theres jack oldcastle now hes always talking of our reefers as if there was no seablood in our veins and that just because his own father happened to be a captaina commodore he says because he happened once to have three frigates under his orders  well that would make a commodore for the time being but surely he does not claim privilege for the oldcastle blood over that of the clevelands  no sir it isnt that sort of thing at all returned the fine boy blushing a little in spite of his contempt for any such womanly weakness you know we never talk of that nonsense in our squadron with us its all service and that sort of thing jack oldcastle says the clevelands are all civilians as he calls em or soldiers which isnt much better as you know sir now i tell him that there is an old picture of one of em with an anchorbutton and that was long before queen annes timequeen elizabeths perhapsand then you know sir i fetch him up with a yarn about the hedworths for i am just as much hedworth as cleveland  and what does the impudent dog say to that geoffrey  why sir he says the name should be spelt headwork and that they were all lawyers but i gave him as good as he sent for that saucy speech im certain  and what did you give him in return for such a compliment did you tell him the oldcastles were just so much stone and wood and old iron and that too in a tumbledown condition  no sir not i answered the boy laughing i didnt think of any answer half so clever and so i just gave him a dig in the nose and that laid on with right good will  and how did he receive that argument was it conclusiveor did the debate continue  oh of course sir we fought it out twas on board the dover and the first lieutenant saw fair play jack carried too many guns for me sir for hes more than a year older but i hulled him so often that he owned it was harder work than being mastheaded after that the dovers chaps took my part and they said the hedworths had no headwork at all but they were regular sailors admirals and captains and youngsters you know sir like all the rest of us i told em my grandfather hedworth was an admiral and a good one too  in that you made a small mistake your mothers father was only a general but his father was a full admiral of the redfor he lived before that grade was abolishedand as good an officer as ever trod a plank he was my mothers brother and both sir gervaise and myself served long under his orders he was a sailor of whom you well might boast  i dont think any of the plantagenets will chase in that quarter again sir for weve had an overhauling among our chaps and we find we can muster four admirals two commodores and thirteen captains in our two messes that is counting all sorts of relatives you know sir  well my dear boy i hope you may live to reckon all that and more too in your own persons at some future day yonder is sir reginald wychecombe coming this way to my surprise perhaps he wishes to see me alone go down to the landing and ascertain if my barge is ashore and let me know it as soon as is convenient remember geoffrey you will go off with me and hunt up sir wycherly wychecombe who will lose his passage unless ready the instant he is wanted  the boy touched his cap and went bounding down the hill to execute the order     chapter xviii      so glozed the tempter and his poison tuned     into the heart of eve his words made way     though at the voice much marvelling           milton   it was probably a species of presentiment that induced bluewater to send away the midshipman when he saw the adherent of the dethroned house approaching enough had passed between the parties to satisfy each of the secret bias of the other and by that sort of freemasonry which generally accompanies strong feelings of partisanship the admiral felt persuaded that the approaching interview was about to relate to the political troubles of the day  the season and the hour and the spot too were all poetically favourable to an interview between conspirators it was now nearly dark the headland was deserted dutton having retired first to his bottle and then to his bed the wind blew heavily athwart the bleak eminence or was heard scuffling in the caverns of the cliffs while the portentous clouds that drove through the air now veiled entirely and now partially and dimly revealed the light of the moon in a way to render the scene both exciting and wild no wonder then that bluewater his visiter drawing near felt a stronger disposition than had ever yet come over him to listen to the tale of the tempter as under all the circumstances it would scarcely exceed the bounds of justice to call sir reginald  in seeking you at such a spot and in the midst of this wild landscape said the latter i might have been assured i should be certain of finding one who really loved the sea and your noble profession the hall is a melancholy house just at this moment and when i inquired for you no one could say whither you had strolled in following what i thought a seamans instinct it appears that i did welldo my eyes fail me or are there no more than three vessels at anchor yonder  your eyes are still good sir reginald admiral oakes sailed several hours since and he has been followed by all the fleet with the exception of the two lineofbattle ships and the frigate you see leaving me to be the last to quit the anchorage  is it a secret of state or are you permitted to say whither so strong a force has so suddenly sailed demanded the baronet glancing his dark eye so expressively towards the other as to give him in the growing obscurity the appearance of an inquisitor i had been told the fleet would wait for orders from london  such was the first intention of the commanderinchief but intelligence of the sailing of the comte de vervillin has induced sir gervaise to change his mind an english admiral seldom errs when he seeks and beats an active and dangerous enemy  is this always true admiral bluewater returned sir reginald dropping in at the side of the other and joining in his walk as he paced to and fro a short path that dutton called his own quarterdeck or is it merely an unmeaning generality that sometimes causes men to become the dupes of their own imaginations are those always our enemies who may seem to be so or are we so infallible that every feeling or prejudice may be safely set down as an impulse to which we ought to submit without questioning its authority  do you esteem it a prejudice to view france as the natural enemy of england sir reginald  by heaven i do sir i can conceive that england may be much more her own enemy than france has ever proved to be then conceding that ages of warfare have contributed to awaken some such feeling as this you hint at is there not a question of right and wrong that lies behind all reflect how often england has invaded the french soil and what serious injuries she has committed on the territory of the latter while france has so little wronged us in the same way how even her throne has been occupied by our princes and her provinces possessed by our armies  i think you hardly allow for all the equity of the different cases parts of what is now france were the just inheritance of those who have sat on the english throne and the quarrels were no more than the usual difficulties of neighbourhood when our claims were just in themselves you surely could not have wished to see them abandoned  far from it but when claims were disputed is it not natural for the loser to view them as a hardship i believe we should have had a much better neighbourhood as you call it with france had not the modern difficulties connected with religious changes occurred  i presume you know sir reginald that i and all my family are protestants  i do admiral bluewater and i rejoice to find that a difference of opinion on this great interest does not necessarily produce one on all others from several little allusions that have passed between us today i am encouraged to believe that we think alike on certain temporal matters however wide the chasm between us on spiritual things  i confess i have fallen into the same conclusion and i should be sorry to be undeceived if wrong  what occasion then for farther ambiguity surely two honourable men may safely trust each other with their common sentiments when the times call for decision and frankness i am a jacobite admiral bluewater if i risk life or fortune by making the avowal i place both without reserve at your mercy  they could not be in safer hands sir and i know no better mode of giving you every possible assurance that the confidence will not be abused than by telling you in return that i would cheerfully lay down my life could the sacrifice restore the deposed family to the throne  this is noble and manly and frank as i had hoped from a sailor exclaimed sir reginald more delighted than he well knew how to express at the moment this simple assurance from your lips carries more weight than all the oaths and pledges of vulgar conspiracy we understand each other and i should be truly sorry to inspire less confidence than i feel  what better proof can i give you of the reliance placed on your faith than the declaration you have heard sir reginald my head would answer for your treachery in a week but i have never felt it more securely on my shoulders than at this moment  the baronet grasped the others hand and each gave and received a pressure that was full of meaning then both walked on thoughtful and relieved for quite a minute in profound silence  this sudden appearance of the prince in scotland has taken us all a little by surprise sir reginald resumed after the pause though a few of us knew that his intentions led him this way perhaps he has done well to come unattended by a foreign force and to throw himself as it might be singly into the arms of his subjects trusting every thing to their generosity loyalty and courage some blame him but i do not he will awaken interest now in every generous heart in the nationthis was artfully adapted to the character of the listenerwhereas some might feel disposed to be lukewarm under a less manly appeal to their affections and loyalty in scotland we learn from all directions that his royal highness is doing wonders while the friends of his house are full of activity in england though compelled for a time to be watchful and prudent  i rejoice from the bottom of my heart to hear this said bluewater drawing a long breath like one whose mind was unexpectedly relieved from a heavy load from the bottom of my heart do i rejoice i had my apprehensions that the sudden appearance of the prince might find his wellwishers unprepared and timid  as far from that as possible my dear sir though much still depends on the promptitude and resolution of the master spirits of the party we are strong enough to control the nation if we can bring those forward who have the strength to lead and control ourselves all we now want are some hundred or two of prominent men to step out of their diffidence and show us the way to honourable achievement and certain success  can such men be wanting at a moment like this  i think we are secure of most of the high nobility though their great risks render them all a little wary in the outset it is among the professional menthe gallant soldiers and the bold ardent seamen of the fleet that we must look for the first demonstrations of loyalty and true patriotism to be honest with you sir i tire of being ruled by a german  do you know of any intention to rally a force in this part of england sir reginald if so say but the wordpoint out the spot where the standard is to be raised and i will rally under it the instant circumstances will permit  this is just what i expected mr bluewater answered the baronet more gratified than he thought it prudent to express though it is not exactly the form in which you can best serve us at this precise moment cut off from the north as we are in this part of the island by all the resources of the actual government it would be the height of imprudence in us to show our hands until all the cards are ready to be played active and confidential agents are at work in the army london has its proper share of business men while others are in the counties doing their best to put things in a shape for the consummation we so anxiously look for i have been with several of our friends in this vicinity to bring matters into a combined state and it was my intention to visit this very estate to see what my own name might do with the tenantry had not the late sir wycherly summoned me as he did to attend his deathbed have you any clue to the feelings of this new and young head of my family the sealieutenant and present baronet  not a very plain one sir though i doubt if they be favourable to the house of stuart  i feared as much this very evening i have had an anonymous communication that i think must come from his competitor pretty plainly intimating that by asserting his rights as they are called the whole wychecombe tenantry and interest could be united in the present struggle on whichever side i might desire to see them  this is a bold and decided stroke truly may i inquire as to your answer sir reginald  i shall give none under all circumstances i will ever refuse to place a bastard in the seat of a legitimate descendant of my family we contend for legal and natural rights my dear admiral and the means employed should not be unworthy of the end besides i know the scoundrel to be unworthy of trust and shall not have the weakness to put myself in his power i could wish the other boy to be of another mind but by getting him off to sea whither he tells me he is bound we shall at least send him out of harms way  in all this sir reginald was perfectly sincere for while he did not always hesitate about the employment of means in matters of politics he was rigidly honest in every thing that related to private properly a species of moral contradiction that is sometimes found among men who aim at the management of human affairs since those often yield to a besetting weakness who are nearly irreproachable in other matters bluewater was glad to hear this declaration his own simplicity of character inducing him to fancy it was an indication to the general probity of his companion  yes observed the latter in all eases we must maintain the laws of the land in an affair of private right this young man is not capable perhaps of forming a just estimate of his political duties in a crisis like this and it may be well truly to get him off to sea lest by taking the losing side he endangers his estate before he is fairly possessed of it and having now disposed of sir wycherly what can i do most to aid the righteous and glorious cause  this is coming to the point manfully sir richardi beg pardon for thus styling you but i happen to know that your name has been before the prince for some time as one of those who are to receive the riband from a sovereign really authorized to bestow it if i have spoken a little prematurely i again entreat your pardonbut this is at once coming manfully to the point serve us you can of course and that most effectually and in an allimportant manner i now greatly regret that my father had not put me in the army in my youth that i might serve my prince as i could wish in this perilous trial but we have many friends accustomed to arms and among them your own honourable name will appear conspicuous as to the past and encouraging as to the future  i have carried arms from boyhood it is true sir reginald but it is in a service that will scarcely much avail us in this warfare prince edward has no ships nor do i know he will need any  true my dear sir but king george has as for the necessity permit me to say you are mistaken it will soon be allimportant to keep open the communication with the continent no doubt monsieur de vervillin is out with some such object already  bluewater started and he recoiled from the firm grasp which the other took of his arm in the earnestness of discourse with some such instinctive aversion as a man recoils from the touch of the reptile the thought of a treachery like that implied in the remark of his companion had never occurred to him and his honest mind turned with a strong disrelish from even the implied proposition of the other still he was not quite certain how far sir reginald wished to urge him and he felt it just to ascertain his real views before he answered them plausible as this appeared it was a dangerous delay for one so simpleminded when brought in contact with a person so practised as the baronet sir reginald having the tact to perceive that his new friends feelings had already taken the alarm and at once determined to be more wary  what am i to understand by this sir reginald wychecombe demanded the rearadmiral in what manner can i possibly be connected with the naval resources of the house of hanover when it is my intention to throw off its service king georges fleets will hardly aid the stuarts and they will at least obey the orders of their own officers  not the least doubt in the world of this admiral bluewater what a glorious privilege it was for monk to have it in his power to put his liege sovereign in his rightful seat and thus to save the empire by a coup de main from the pains and grievances of a civil contest of all the glorious names in english history i esteem that of george monk as the one most to be envied it is a great thing to be a princeone born to be set apart as gods substitute on earth in all that relates to human justice and human poweryet it is greater in my eyes to be the subject to restore the order of these almost divine successions when once deranged by lawless and presuming men  this is true enough sir though i would rather have joined charles on the beach at dover armed only with an untainted sword than followed by an army at my heels  what when that army followed cheerfully and was equally eager with yourself to serve their sovereign  that indeed might somewhat qualify the feeling but soldiers and sailors are usually influenced by the opinions of those who have been placed over them by the higher authorities  no doubt they are and that is as it should be we are encouraged to believe that some ten or fifteen captains are already welldisposed towards us and will cheerfully take their respective ships to the points our wants require the moment they feel assured of being properly led when collected by a little timely concert we can command the north sea and keep open important communications with the continent it is known the ministry intend to employ as many german troops as they can assemble and a naval force will be allimportant in keeping these mustachoed foreigners at a distance the quarrel is purely english sir and ought to be decided by englishmen only  in that indeed i fully concur sir reginald answered bluewater breathing more freely i would cruise a whole winter in the north sea to keep the dutchmen at home and let englishmen decide who is to be englands king to me foreign interference in such a matter is the next evil to positive disloyalty to my rightful prince  these are exactly my sentiments dear sir and i hope to see you act on them by the way how happens it you are left alone and in what manner do you admirals divide your authority when serving in company  i do not know i comprehend your question sir reginald i am left here to sail the last with the c√¶sar sir gervaise leading out in the plantagenet with a view to draw a line across the channel that shall effectually prevent de vervillin from getting to the westward  to the westward repeated the other smiling ironically though the darkness prevented the admiral from seeing the expression of his features does admiral oakes then think that the french ships are steering in that direction  such is our information have you any reason to suppose that the enemy intend differently  the baronet paused and he appeared to ruminate enough had already passed to satisfy him he had not an ordinary mind in that of his companion to deal with and he was slightly at a loss how to answer to bring the other within his lures he was fully resolved and the spirits that aid the designing just at that moment suggested the plan which of all others was most likely to be successful bluewater had betrayed his aversion to the interference of foreign troops in the quarrel and on this subject he intended to strike a chord which he rightly fancied would thrill on the rearadmirals feelings  we have our information certainly answered sir reginald like one who was reluctant to tell all he knew though good faith requires it should not actually be exposed nevertheless any one can reason on the probabilities the duke of cumberland will collect his german auxiliaries and they must get into england the best way that they can would an intelligent enemy with a wellappointed fleet suffer this junction if he could prevent it we know he would not and when we remember the precise time of the sailing of the comte his probable ignorance of the presence of this squadron of yours in the channel and all the other circumstances of the case who can suppose otherwise than to believe his aim is to intercept the german regiments  this does seem plausible and yet the actives signals told us that the french were steering west and that too with a light westerly wind  do not fleets like armies frequently make false demonstrations might not monsieur de vervillin so long as his vessels were in sight from the shore have turned toward the west with an intention as soon as covered by the darkness to incline to the east again and sail up channel under english ensigns perhaps is it not possible for him to pass the straits of dover even as an english squadronyour own for instanceand thus deceive the hanoverian cruisers until ready to seize or destroy any transports that may be sent  hardly sir reginald said bluewater smiling a french ship can no more be mistaken for an english ship than a frenchman can pass for a briton we sailors are not as easily deceived as that would show it is true however that a fleet might well stand in one direction until far enough off the land or covered by night when it might change its course suddenly in an opposite direction and it is possible the comte de vervillin has adopted some such stratagem if he actually knew of the intention to throw german troops into the island it is even quite probable in that case for one i could actually wish him success  well my dear sir and what is to prevent it asked sir reginald with a triumph that was not feigned nothing you will say unless he fall in with sir gervaise oakes but you have not answered my inquiry as to the manner in which flagofficers divide their commands at sea  as soldiers divide their commands ashore the superior orders and the inferior obeys  ay this is true but it does not meet my question here are eleven large ships and two admirals now what portion of these ships are under your particular orders and what portion under those of sir gervaise oakes  the viceadmiral has assigned to himself a division of six of the ships and left me the other five each of us has his frigates and smaller vessels but an order that the commanderinchief may choose to give any captain must be obeyed by him as the inferior submits as a rule to the last order  and you resumed sir reginald with quickness how are you situated as respects these captains  should i give a direct order to any captain in the fleet it would certainly be his duty to obey it though circumstances might occur which would render it obligatory on him to let me know that he had different instructions from our common superior but why these questions sir reginald  your patience my dear admiraland what ships have you specifically under your care  the c√¶sar my own the dublin the elizabeth the york and the dover to these must be added the druid frigate the sloop of war and the gnat my division numbers eight in all  what a magnificent force to possess at a moment as critical as thisbut where are all these vessels i see but four and a cutter and only two of these seem to be large  the light you perceive there along the land to the westward is on board the elizabeth and that broad off here in the channel is on board the york the dovers lantern has disappeared further to the southward ah there the dublin casts and is off after the others  and you intend to follow admiral bluewater  within an hour or i shall lose the division as it is i have been deliberating on the propriety of calling back the sternmost ships and collecting them in close squadron for this increase and hauling of the wind render it probable they will lose the viceadmiral and that daylight will find the line scattered and in confusion one mind must control the movements of ships as well as of battalions sir reginald if they are to act in concert  with what view would you collect the vessels you have mentioned and in the manner you have named if you do not deem my inquiry indiscreet demanded the baronet with quickness  simply that they might be kept together and brought in subjection to my own particular signals this is the duty that more especially falls to my share as head of the division  have you the means to effect this here on this hill and by yourself sir  it would be a great oversight to neglect so important a provision my signalofficer is lying under yonder cover wrapped in his cloak and two quartermasters are in readiness to make the very signal in question for its necessity has been foreseen and really would seem to be approaching if done at all it must be done quickly too the light of the york grows dim in the distance it shall be done sir prudence requires it and you shall see the manner in which we hold our distant ships in command  bluewater could not have announced more agreeable intelligence to his companion sir reginald was afraid to propose the open treason he meditated but he fancied if the rearadmiral could fairly withdraw his own division from the fleet it would at once weaken the viceadmiral so much as to render an engagement with the french impossible and might lead to such a separation of the commands as to render the final defection of the division inshore easier of accomplishment it is true bluewater himself was actuated by motives directly contrary to these wishes but as the parties travelled the same road to a certain point the intriguing baronet had his expectations of being able to persuade his new friend to continue on in his own route  promptitude is a military virtue and among seamen it is a maxim to do every thing that is required to be done with activity and vigour these laws were not neglected on the present occasion no sooner had the rearadmiral determined on his course than he summoned his agents to put it in execution lord geoffrey had returned to the heights and was within call and he carried the orders to the lieutenant and the quartermasters the lanterns only required lighting and then they were run aloft on duttons staff as regularly as the same duty could have been performed on the poop of the c√¶sar three rockets were thrown up immediately after and the gun kept on the cliffs for that purpose was fired to draw attention to the signal it might have been a minute ere the heavy ordnance of the c√¶sar repeated the summons and the same signal was shown at her masthead the dublin was still so near that no time was lost but according to orders she too repeated the signal for in the line that night it was understood that an order of this nature was to be sent from ship to ship  now for the elizabeth cried bluewater she cannot fail to have heard our guns and to see our signals  the york is ahead of her sir exclaimed the boy see she has the signal up already  all this passed in a very few minutes the last ships having sailed in the expectation of receiving some such recall the york preceded the ship next to her in the line in consequence of having gone about and being actually nearer to the rearadmiral than her second astern it was but a minute before the gun and the lanterns of the elizabeth however announced her knowledge of the order also  the two ships last named were no longer visible from the cliffs though their positions were known by their lights but no sign whatever indicated the part of the ocean on which the dover was struggling along through the billows after a pause of several minutes bluewater spoke  i fear we shall collect no more he said one of my ships must take her chance to find the commanderinchief alone hathat means something  at this instant a faint distant flash was seen for a single moment in the gloom and then all heads were bent forward to listen in breathless attention a little time had elapsed when the dull smothered report of a gun proclaimed that even the dover had caught the rapidly transmitted order  what means that sir eagerly demanded sir reginald who had attended to every thing with intense expectation  it means sir that all of the division are still under my command no other ship would note the order their directions unless specifically pointed out by their numbers must come from the viceadmiral is my barge ashore lord geoffrey cleveland  it is sir as well as the cutter for mr cornet and the quartermasters  it is well gentlemen we will go on board the c√¶sar must weigh and join the other vessels in the offing i will follow you to the landing but you will shove off at once and desire captain stowel to weigh and cast toport we will fill on the starboard tack and haul directly off the land  the whole party immediately left the station hurrying down to the boats leaving bluewater and sir reginald to follow more leisurely it was a critical moment for the baronet who had so nearly effected his purpose that his disappointment would have been double did he fail of his object altogether he determined therefore not to quit the admiral while there was the slightest hope of success the two consequently descended together to the shore walking for the first minute or two in profound silence  a great game is in your hands admiral bluewater resumed the baronet rightly played it may secure the triumph of the good cause i think i may say i know de vervillins object and that his success will reseat the stuarts on the thrones of their ancestors one who loves them should ponder well before he does aught to mar so glorious a result  this speech was as bold as it was artful in point of fact sir reginald wychecombe knew no more of the comte de vervillins intended movements than his companion but he did not hesitate to assert what he now did in order to obtain a great political advantage in a moment of so much importance to commit bluewater and his captains openly on the side of the stuarts would be a great achievement in itself to frustrate the plans of sir gervaise might safely be accounted another and then there were all the chances that the frenchman was not at sea for nothing and that his operations might indeed succour the movements of the prince the baronet upright as he was in other matters had no scruples of conscience on this occasion having long since brought himself over to the belief that it was justifiable to attain ends as great as those he had in view by the sacrifice of any of the minor moral considerations  the effect on bluewater was not trifling the devil had placed the bait before his eyes in a most tempting form for he felt that he had only to hold his division in reserve to render an engagement morally improbable abandon his friend to a superior force he could and would not but it is our painful duty to avow that his mind had glimpses of the possibility of doing the adventurer in scotland a great good without doing the viceadmiral and the van of the fleet any very essential harm let us be understood however the rearadmiral did not even contemplate treason or serious defection of any sort but through one of those avenues of frailty by which men are environed he had a glance at results that the masterspirit of evil momentarily placed before his mental vision as both great and glorious  i wish we were really certain of de vervillins object he said the only concession he made to this novel feeling in words it might indeed throw a great light on the course we ought to take ourselves i do detest this german alliance and would abandon the service ere i would convoy or transport a ragamuffin of them all to england  here sir reginald proved how truly expert he was in the arts of management a train of thought and feeling had been lighted in the mind of his companion which he felt might lead to all he wished while he was apprehensive that further persuasion would awaken opposition and renew old sentiments he wisely determined therefore to leave things as they were trusting to the strong and declared bias of the admiral in favour of the revolution to work out its own consequences with a visible and allimportant advantage so prominently placed before his eyes  i know nothing of ships he answered modestly but i do know that the comte has our succour in view it would ill become me to advise one of your experience how to lead a force like this which is subject to your orders but a friend of the good cause who is now in the west and who was lately in the presence itself tells me that the prince manifested extreme satisfaction when he learned how much it might be in your power to serve him  do you then think my name has reached the royal ear and that the prince has any knowledge of my real feelings  nothing but your extreme modesty could cause you to doubt the first sir as to the last ask yourself how came i to approach you tonight with my heart in my hand as it might be making you master of my life as well as of my secret love and hatred are emotions that soon betray themselves  it is matter of historical truth that men of the highest principles and strongest minds have yielded to the flattery of rank bluewaters political feelings had rendered him indifferent to the blandishments of the court at london while his imagination that chivalrous deference to antiquity and poetical right which lay at the root of his jacobitism and his brooding sympathies disposed him but too well to become the dupe of language like this had he been more a man of facts one less under the influence of his own imagination had it been his good fortune to live even in contact with those he now so devoutly worshipped in a political sense at least their influence over a mind as just and clearsighted as his own would soon have ceased but passing his time at sea they had the most powerful auxiliary possible in the high faculty he possessed of fancying things as he wished them to be no wonder then that he heard this false assertion of sir reginald with a glow of pleasure with even a thrill at the heart to which he had long been a stranger for a time his better feelings were smothered in this new and treacherous sensation  the gentlemen by this time were at the landing and it became necessary to separate the barge of the rearadmiral was with difficulty kept from leaping on the rock by means of oars and boathooks and each instant rendered the embarkation more and more difficult the moments were precious on more accounts than one and the leavetaking was short sir reginald said but little though he intended the pressure of the hand he gave his companion to express every thing  god be with you he added and as you prove true may you prove successful remember a lawful prince and the claims of birthright god be with you  adieu sir reginald when we next meet the future will probably be more apparent to us allbut who comes hither rushing like a madman towards the boat  a form came leaping through the darkness nor was it known until it stood within two feet of bluewater it was that of wycherly he had heard the guns and seen the signals guessing at the reasons he dashed from the park which he was pacing to cool his agitation and which now owned him for a master and ran the whole distance to the shore in order not to be left his arrival was most opportune for in another minute the barge left the rock     chapter xix      oer the glad waters of the darkblue sea     our thoughts as boundless and our souls as free     far as the breeze can bear the billows foam     survey our empire and behold our home           the corsair   one is never fully aware of the extent of the movement that agitates the bosom of the ocean until fairly subject to its action himself when indeed we all feel its power and reason closely on its dangers the first pitch of his boat told bluewater that the night threatened to be serious as the lusty oarsmen bent to their stroke the barge rose on a swell dividing the foam that glanced past it like a marine aurora borealis and then plunged into the trough as if descending to the bottom it required several united and vigorous efforts to force the little craft from its dangerous vicinity to the rocks and to get it in perfect command this once done however the wellpractised crew urged the barge slowly but steadily ahead  a dirty nighta dirty night muttered bluewater unconsciously to himself we should have had a wild berth had we rode out this blow at anchor oakes will have a heavy time of it out yonder in the very chops of the channel with a westerly swell heaving in against this ebb  yes sir answered wycherly the viceadmiral will be looking out for us all anxiously enough in the morning  not another syllable did bluewater utter until his boat had touched the side of the c√¶sar he reflected deeply on his situation and those who know his feelings will easily understand that his reflections were not altogether free from pain such as they were he kept them to himself however and in a manofwars boat when a flagofficer chooses to be silent it is a matter of course for his inferiors to imitate his example  the barge was about a quarter of a mile from the landing when the heavy flap of the c√¶sars maintopsail was heard as closereefed it struggled for freedom while her crew drew its sheets down to the blocks on the lower yardarms a minute later the gnat under the head of her foreandaftmainsail was seen standing slowly off from the land looking in the darkness like some halfequipped shadow of herself the sloop of war too was seen bending low to the force of the wind with her mere apology of a topsail thrown aback in waiting for the flagship to cast  the surface of the waters was a sheet of glancing foam while the air was filled with the blended sounds of the wash of the element and the roar of the winds still there was nothing chilling or repulsive in the temperature of the air which was charged with the freshness of the sea and was bracing and animating bringing with it the flavour that a seaman loves after fully fifteen minutes severe tugging at the oars the barge drew near enough to permit the black mass of the c√¶sar to be seen for some time lord geoffrey who had seated himself at the tilleryokelines were not used a century sincesteered by the toplight of the rearadmiral but now the maze of hamper was seen waving slowly to and fro in the lurid heavens and the huge hull became visible heaving and setting as if the ocean groaned with the labour of lifting such a pile of wood and iron a light gleamed from the cabinwindows and ever and anon one glanced athwart an open gunroom port in all other respects the ship presented but one hue of blackness nor was it an easy undertaking even after the barge was under the lee of the ship for those in it to quit its uneasy support and get a firm footing on the cleets that lined the vessels side like a ladder this was done however and all ascended to the deck but two of the crew who remained to hookon the yard and staytackles this effected the shrill whistle gave the word and that large boat built to carry at need some twenty souls was raised from the raging water as it were by some gigantic effort of the ship herself and safely deposited in her bosom  we are none too soon sir said stowel the moment he had received the rearadmiral with the customary etiquette of the hour its a capfull of wind already and it promises to blow harder before morning we are catted and fished sir and the forecastlemen are passing the shankpainter at this moment  fill sir and stretch off on an easy bowline was the answer when a league in the offing let me know it mr cornet i have need of you in my cabin  as this was said bluewater went below followed by his signalofficer at the same instant the first lieutenant called out to man the mainbraces and to fill the topsail as soon as this command was obeyed the c√¶sar started ahead her movement was slow but it had a majesty in it that set at naught the turbulence of the elements  bluewater had paced to and fro in his cabin no less than six times with his head drooping in a thoughtful attitude ere his attention was called to any external object  do you wish my presence admiral bluewater the signalofficer at length inquired  i ask your pardon mr cornet i was really unconscious that you were in the cabin let me seeayour last signal was division come within hail of rearadmiral they must get close to us to be able to do that tonight cornet the winds and waves have begun their song in earnest  and yet sir ill venture a months pay that captain drinkwater brings the dover so near us as to put the officer of the watch and the quartermaster at the wheel in a fever we once made that signal in a gale of wind and he passed his jibboomend over our taffrail  he is certainly a most literal gentleman that captain drinkwater but he knows how to take care of his ship look for the number of follow the rearadmirals motions tis 211 i think  no sir but 212 blue red and white with the flags with the lanterns tis one of the simplest signals we have  we will make it at once when that is done show the rearadmiral keep in his wake in the general order of sailing that i am sure is 204  yes sir you are quite right shall i show the second signal as soon as all the vessels have answered the first sir  that is my intention cornet when all have answered let me know it  mr cornet now left the cabin and bluewater took a seat in an armchair in deep meditation for quite half an hour the former was busy on the poop with his two quartermasters going through the slow and far from easy duty of making nightsignals as they were then practised at sea it was some time before the most distant vessel the dover gave any evidence of comprehending the first order and then the same tardy operation had to be gone through with for the second at length the sentinel threw open the cabindoor and cornet reappeared during the whole of his absence on deck bluewater had not stirred scarce seemed to breathe his thoughts were away from his ships and for the first time in the ten years he had worn a flag he had forgotten the order he had given  the signals are made and answered sir said cornet as soon as he had advanced to the edge of the table on which the rearadmirals elbow was leaning the dublin is already in our wake and the elizabeth is bearing down fast on our weatherquarter she will bring herself into her station in ten minutes  what news of the york and dover cornet asked bluewater rousing himself from a fit of deep abstraction  the yorks light nears us quite evidently though that of the dover is still a fixed star sir answered the lieutenant chuckling a little at his own humour it seems no larger than it did when we first made it  it is something to have made it at all i was not aware it could be seen from deck  nor can it sir but by going up halfadozen ratlins we get a look at it captain drinkwater bowses up his lights to the gaffend and i can see him always ten minutes sooner than any other ship in the fleet under the same circumstances  drinkwater is a careful officer do the bearings of his light alter enough to tell the course he is steering  i think they do sir though our standing out athwart his line of sailing would make the change slow of course every foot we get to the southward you know sir would throw his bearings farther west while every foot he comes east would counteract that change and throw his bearings further south  thats very clear but as he must go three fathoms to our one running off with square yards before such a breeze i think we should be constantly altering his bearings to the southward  no doubt of it in the world sir and that is just what we are doing i think i can see a difference of half a point already but when we get his light fairly in view from the poop we shall be able to tell with perfect accuracy  all very well cornet do me the favour to desire captain stowel to step into the cabin and keep a bright lookout for the ships of the division stay for a single instant what particularly sharpeyed youngster happens to belong to the watch on deck  i know none keener in that way than lord geoffrey cleveland sir he can see all the roguery that is going on in the whole fleet at any rate and ought to see other things  he will do perfectly well send the young gentleman to me sir but first inform the officer of the watch that i have need of him  bluewater was unusually fastidious in exercising his authority over those who had temporary superiors on the assigned duty of the ship and he never sent an order to any of the watch without causing it to pass through the officer of that watch he waited but a minute before the boy appeared  have you a good gripe tonight boy asked the rearadmiral smiling or will it be both hands for yourself and none for the king i want you on the foretopgallantyard for eight or ten minutes  well sir its a plain road there and one ive often travelled returned the lad cheerfully  that i well know you are certainly no skulk when duty is to be done go aloft then and ascertain if the lights of any of sir gervaises squadron are to be seen you will remember that the dover bears somewhere about southwest from us and that she is still a long way to seaward i should think all of sir gervaises ships must be quite as far to windward as that point would bring them but much further off by looking sharp a point or half a point to windward of the dover you may possibly see the light of the warspite and then we shall get a correct idea of the bearings of all the rest of the division  ayaysir interrupted the boy i think i understand exactly what you wish to know admiral bluewater  that is a natural gift at sixteen my lord returned the admiral smiling but it may be improved a little perhaps by the experience of fifty now it is possible sir gervaise may have gone about as soon as the flood made in which case he ought to bear nearly west of us and you will also look in that direction on the other hand sir gervaise may have stretched so far over towards the french coast before night shut in as to feel satisfied monsieur de vervillin is still to the eastward of him in which case he would keep off a little and may at this moment be nearly ahead of us so that under all the circumstances you will sweep the horizon from the weatherbeam to the leebow ranging forward am i understood now my lord  yes sir i think you are answered the boy blushing at his own impetuosity you will excuse my indiscretion admiral bluewater but i thought i understood all you desired when i spoke so hastily  no doubt you did geoffrey but you perceive you did not nature has made you quick of apprehension but not quick enough to foresee all an old mans gossip come nearer now and let us shake hands so go aloft and hold on well for it is a windy night and i do not desire to lose you overboard  the boy did as told squeezed bluewaters hand and dashed out of the cabin to conceal his tears as for the rearadmiral he immediately relapsed into his fit of forgetfulness waiting for the arrival of stowel  a summons to a captain does not as immediately produce a visit on board a vessel of war as a summons to a midshipman captain stowel was busy in looking at the manner in which his boats were stowed when cornet told him of the rearadmirals request and then he had to give some orders to the first lieutenant concerning the fresh meat that had been got off and one or two other similar little things before he was at leisure to comply  see me do you say mr cornet in his own cabin as soon as it is convenient he at length remarked when all these several offices had been duly performed  the signalofficer repeated the request word for word as he had heard it when he turned to take another look at the light of the dover as for stowel he cared no more for the dover windy and dark as the night promised to be than the burgher is apt to care for his neighbours house when the whole street is threatened with destruction to him the c√¶sar was the great centre of attraction and cornet paid him off in kind for of all the vessels in the fleet the c√¶sar was precisely the one to which he gave the least attention and this for the simple reason that she was the only ship to which he never gave or from which he never received a signal  well mr bluff said stowel to the first lieutenant one of us will have to be on deck most of the night and ill take a slant below for half an hour first and see what the admiral wishes  thus saying the captain left the deck in order to ascertain his superiors pleasure captain stowel was several years the senior of bluewater having actually been a lieutenant in one of the frigates in which the rearadmiral had served as a midshipman a circumstance to which he occasionally alluded in their present intercourse the change in the relative positions was the result of the family influence of the junior who had passed his senior in the grade of master and commander a rank that then brought many an honest man up for life in the english marine at the age of fiveandforty that at which bluewater first hoisted his flag stowell was posted and soon after he was invited by his old shipmate who had once had him under him as his first lieutenant in a sloop of war to take the command of his flagship from that day down to the present moment the two officers had sailed together whenever they sailed at all perfectly good friends though the captain never appeared entirely to forget the time when they were in the aforesaid frigate one a gunroom officer and the other only a youngster  stowel must now have been about sixtyfive a square hardfeatured redfaced seaman who knew all about his ship from her truck to her limberrope but who troubled himself very little about any thing else he had married a widow when he was posted but was childless and had long since permitted his affections to wander back into their former channels from the domestic hearth to his ship he seldom spoke of matrimony but the little he saw fit to say on the subject was comprehensive and to the point a perfectly sober man he consumed large quantities of both wine and brandy as well as of tobacco and never seemed to be the worse for either loyal he was by political faith and he looked upon a revolution let its object be what it might as he would have regarded a mutiny in the c√¶sar he was exceedingly pertinacious of his rights as captain of his own ship both ashore and afloat a disposition that produced less trouble with the mild and gentlemanly rearadmiral than with mrs stowel if we add that this plain sailor never looked into a book his proper scientific works excepted we shall have said all of him that his connection with our tale demands  goodevening admiral bluewater said this true tar saluting the rearadmiral as one neighbour would greet another on dropping in of an evening for they occupied different cabins mr cornet told me you would like to say a word to me before i turned in if indeed turn in at all i do this blessed night  take a seat stowel and a glass of this sherry in the bargain bluewater answered kindly showing how well he understood his man by the manner in which he shoved both bottle and glass within reach of his hand how goes the nightand is this wind likely to stand  im of opinion sirwell drink his majesty if youve no objection admiral bluewaterim of opinion we shall stretch the threads of that new maintopsail before weve done with the breeze sir i believe ive not told you yet that ive had the new sail bent since we last spoke together on the subject its a good fit sir and closereefed the sails stands like the side of a house  im glad to hear it stowel though i think all your canvass usually appears to be in its place  why you know admiral bluewater that ive been long enough at it to understand something about the matter it is now more than forty years since we were in the calypso together and ever since that time ive borne the commission of an officer you were then a youngster and thought more of your joke than of bending sails or of seeing how they would stand  there wasnt much of me certainly forty years ago stowel but i well remember the knack you had of making every robin sheet bowline and thread do its duty then as you do today by the way can you tell me any thing of the dover this evening  not i sir she came out with the rest of us i suppose and must be somewhere in the fleet though i dare say the log will have it all if she has been anywhere near us lately i am sorry we did not go into one of the wateringports instead of this open roadstead for we must be at least twentyseven hundred gallons short of what we ought to have by my calculation and then we want a new set of light spars pretty much all round and the lower hold hasnt as many barrels of provisions in it by thirtyodd as i could wish to see there  i leave these things to you entirely stowel you will report in time to keep the ship efficient  no fear of the c√¶sar sir for between mr bluff the master and myself we know pretty much all about her though i dare say there are men in the fleet who can tell you more about the dublin or the dover or the york we will drink the queen and all the royal family if you please sir  as usual bluewater merely bowed for his companion required no further acquiescence in his toasts just at that moment too it would have needed a general order at least to induce him to drink any of the family of the reigning house  oakes must be well off midchannel by this time captain stowel  i should think he might be sir though i cant say i took particular notice of the time he sailed i dare say its all in the log the plantagenet is a fast ship sir and captain greenly understands her trim and what she can do on all tacks and yet i do think his majesty has one ship in this fleet that can find a frenchman quite as soon and deal with him when found quite as much to the purpose  of course you mean the c√¶sarwell im quite of your way of thinking though sir gervaise manages never to be in a slow ship i suppose you know stowel that monsieur de vervillin is out and that we may expect to see or hear something of him tomorrow  yes sir there is some such conversation in the ship i know but the quantity of galleynews is so great in this squadron that i never attend much to what is said one of the officers brought off a rumour i believe that there was a sort of a row in scotland by the way sir there is a supernumerary lieutenant on board and as he has joined entirely without orders im at a loss how to berth or to provision him we can treat the gentleman hospitably tonight but in the morning i shall be obliged to get him regularly on paper  you mean sir wycherly wychecombe he shall come into my mess rather than give you any trouble  i shall not presume to meddle with any gentleman you may please to invite into your cabin sir answered stowel with a stiff bow in the way of apology thats what i always tell mrs stowel sirthat my cabin is my own and even a wife has no right to shake a broom in it  which is a great advantage to us seamen for it gives us a citadel to retreat to when the outworks are pressed you appear to take but little interest in this civil war stowel  then its true is it sir i didnt know but it might turn out to be galleynews pray what is the rumpus all about admiral bluewater for i never could get that story fidded properly so as to set up the rigging and have the spar well stayed in its place  it is merely a war to decide who shall be king of england nothing else i do assure you sir  theyre an uneasy set ashore sir if the truth must be said of them weve got one king already and on what principle does any man wish for more now there was captain blakely from the elizabeth on board of me this afternoon and we talked the matter over a little and both of us concluded that they got these things up much as a matter of profit among the army contractors and the dealers in warlike stores  bluewater listened with intense interest for here was proof how completely two of his captains at least would be at his own command and how little they would be likely for a time at least to dispute any of his orders he thought of sir reginald and of the rapture with which he would have received this trait of nautical character  there are people who set their hearts on the result notwithstanding carelessly observed the rearadmiral and some who see their fortunes marred or promoted by the success or downfall of the parties they think de vervillin is out on some errand connected with this rising in the north  well i dont see what he has got to do with the matter at all for i dont suppose that king louis is such a fool as to expect to be king of england as well as king of france  the dignity would be too much for one pair of shoulders to bear as well might one admiral wish to command all the divisions of his own fleet though they were fifty leagues asunder  or one captain two ships or what is more to the purpose sir one ship to keep two captains well drink to discipline if youve no objection sir tis the soul of order and quiet ashore or afloat for my part i want no coequali believe thats the cant word they use on such occasionsbut i want no coequal in the c√¶sar and i am unwilling to have one in the house at greenwich though mrs stowel thinks differently heres my ship shes in her place in the line its my business to see she is fit for any service that a firstclass twodecker can undertake and that duty i endeavour to perform and i make no doubt it is all the better performed because theres no wife or coequal aboard here where the ship is to go and what she is to do are other matters which i take from general orders special orders or signals let them act up to this principle in london and we should hear no more of disturbances north or south  certainly stowel your doctrine would make a quiet nation as well as a quiet ship i hope you do me the justice to think there is no coequal in my commands  that there is not sirand i have the honour to drink your healththat there is not when we were in the calypso together i had the advantage and i must say that i never had a youngster under me who ever did his duty more cheerfully since that day weve shifted places end for end as one might say and i endeavour to pay you in your own coin there is no man whose orders i obey more willingly or more to my own advantage always excepting those of admiral oakes who being commanderinchief overlays us all with his anchor we must dowse our peaks to his signals though we can maintain without mutinying that the c√¶sar is as good a boat on or off a wind as the plantagenet the best day sir jarvy ever saw  there is no manner of doubt of that you have all the notions of a true sailor i find stowel obey orders before all other things i am curious to know how our captains generally stand affected to this claim which the pretender has set up to the throne  cant tell you on my soul sir though i fancy few of them give themselves any great anxiety in the matter when the wind is fair we can run off large and when it is foul we must haul upon a bowline let who will reign i was a youngster under queen anne and she was a stuart i believe and i have served under the german family ever since and to be frank with you admiral bluewater i see but little difference in the duty the pay or the rations my maxim is to obey orders and then i know the blame will fall on them that give them if any thing goes wrong  we have many scotchmen in the fleet stowel observed the rearadmiral in a musing manner like one who rather thought aloud than spoke several of the captains are from the north of tweed  ay sir one is pretty certain of meeting gentlemen from that part of the island in almost all situations in life i never have understood that scotland had much of a navy in ancient times and yet the moment old england has to pay for it the lairds are willing enough to send their children to sea  nevertheless it must be owned that they make gallant and useful officers stowel  no doubt they do sir but gallant and useful men are not scarce anywhere you and i are too old and too experienced admiral bluewater to put any faith in the notion that courage belongs to any particular part of the world or usefulness either i never fought a frenchman yet that i thought a coward and in my judgment there are brave men enough in england to command all her ships and to fight them too  let this be so stowel still we must take things as they come what do you think of the night  dirty enough before morning i should think sir though it is a little out of rule that it does not rain with this wind already the next time we cometo admiral bluewater i intend to anchor with a shorter scope of cable than we have been doing lately for i begin to think there is no use in wetting so many yarns in the summer months they tell me the york brings up always on forty fathoms  thats a short range i should think for a heavy ship but here is a visiter  the sentinel opened the cabindoor and lord geoffrey with his cap fastened to his head by a pockethandkerchief and his face red with exposure to the wind entered the cabin  well said bluewater quietly what is the report from aloft  the dover is running down athwart our forefoot and nearing us fast sir returned the midshipman the york is close on our weatherbeam edging in to her station but i can make out nothing ahead of us though i was on the yard twenty minutes  did you look well on the weatherbeam and thence forward to the leebow  i did sir if any light is in view better eyes than mine must find it  stowel looked from one to the other as this short conversation was held but as soon as there was a pause he put in a word in behalf of the ship  youve been up forward my lord he said  yes i have captain stowel  and did you think of seeing how the heel of the topgallantmast stood it in this sea bluff tells me tis too loose to be fit for very heavy weather  i did not sir i was sent aloft to look out for the ships of the commanderinchiefs division and didnt think of the heel of the topgallantmasts being too loose at all  ay thats the way with all the youngsters nowadays in my time or even in yours admiral bluewater we never put our feet on a ratlin but hands and eyes were at work until we reached the halting place even though it should be the truck that is the manner to know what a ship is made of  i kept my hands and eyes at work too captain stowel but it was to hold on well and to look out well  that will never dothat will never do if you wish to make yourself a sailor begin with your own ship first learn all about her then when you get to be an admiral as your fathers son my lord will be certain to become it will be time enough to be inquiring about the rest of the fleet  you forget captain stowel  that will do lord geoffrey bluewater soothingly interposed for he knew that the captain preached no more than he literally practised if i am satisfied with your report no one else has a right to complain desire sir wycherly wychecombe to meet me on deck where we will now go stowel and take a look at the weather for ourselves  with all my heart admiral bluewater though ill just drink the first lords health before we quit this excellent liquor that youngster has stuff in him in spite of his nobility and by fetching him up with round turns occasionally i hope to make a man of him yet  if he do not grow into that character physically and morally within the next few years sir he will be the first person of his family who has ever failed of it  as bluewater said this he and the captain left his cabin and ascended to the quarterdeck here stowel stopped to hold a consultation with his first lieutenant while the admiral went up the poopladder and joined cornet the last had nothing new to communicate and as he was permitted to go below he was desired to send wycherly up to the poop where the young man would be expected by the rearadmiral  some little time elapsed before the virginian could be found no sooner was this effected however than he joined bluewater they had a private conversation of fully half an hour pacing the poop the whole time and then cornet was summoned back again to his usual station the latter immediately received an order to acquaint captain stowel the rearadmiral desired that the c√¶sar might be hoveto and to make a signal for the druid 36 to come under the flagships lee and back her maintopsail no sooner did this order reach the quarterdeck than the watch was sent to the braces and the mainyard was rounded in until the portion of sail that was still set lay against the mast this deadened the way of the huge body which rose and fell heavily in the seas as they washed under her scarcely large enough to lift the burthen it imposed upon them just at this instant the signal was made  the sudden check to the movement of the c√¶sar brought the dublin booming up in the darkness when putting her helm up that ship surged slowly past to leeward resembling a black mountain moving by in the gloom she was hailed and directed to heaveto also as soon as far enough ahead the elizabeth followed clearing the flagship by merely twenty fathoms and receiving a similar order the druid had been on the admirals weatherquarter but she now came gliding down with the wind abeam taking room to back her topsail under the c√¶sars leebow by this time a cutter was in the water rising six or eight feet up the black side of the ship and sinking as low apparently beneath her bottom next wycherly reported himself ready to proceed  you will not forget sir said bluewater any part of my commission but inform the commanderinchief of the whole it may be important that we understand each other fully you will also hand him this letter which i have hastily written while the boat was getting ready  i think i understand your wishes sirat least i hope soand i will endeavour to execute them  god bless you sir wycherly wychecombe added bluewater with emotion we may never meet again we sailors carry uncertain lives and we may be said to carry them in our hands  wycherly took his leave of the admiral and he ran down the poopladder to descend into the boat twice he paused on the quarterdeck however in the manner of one who felt disposed to return and ask some explanation but each time he moved on decided to proceed  it needed all the agility of our young sailor to get safely into the boat this done the oars fell and the cutter was driven swiftly away to leeward in a few minutes it shot beneath the lee of the frigate and discharged its freight wycherly could not have been three minutes on the deck of the druid ere her yards were braced up and her topsail filled with a heavy flap this caused her to draw slowly ahead five minutes later however a white cloud was seen dimly fluttering over her hull and the reefed mainsail was distended to the wind the effect was so instantaneous that the frigate seemed to glide away from the flagship and in a quarter of an hour under her three topsails doublereefed and her courses she was a mile distant on her weatherbow those who watched her movements without understanding them observed that she lowered her light and appeared to detach herself from the rest of the division  it was some time before the c√¶sars boat was enabled to pull up against the tide wind and sea when this hard task was successfully accomplished the ship filled passed the dublin and elizabeth and resumed her place in the line  bluewater paced the poop an hour longer having dismissed his signalofficer and the quartermasters to their hammocks even stowel had turned in nor did mr bluff deem it necessary to remain on deck any longer at the end of the hour the rearadmiral bethought him of retiring too before he quitted the poop however he stood at the weatherladder holding on to the mizzenrigging and gazing at the scene  the wind had increased as had the sea but it was not yet a gale the york had long before hauled up in her station a cables length ahead of the c√¶sar and was standing on under the same canvass as the flagship looking stately and black the dover was just shooting into her berth under the standing sailingorders at the same distance ahead of the york visible but much less distinct and imposing the sloop and the cutter were running along under the lee of the heavy snips a quarter of a mile distant each vessel keeping her relative position by close attention to her canvass further than this nothing was in sight the sea had that wild mixture of brightness and gloom which belongs to the element when much agitated in a dark night while the heavens were murky and threatening  within the ship all was still here and there a lantern threw its wavering light around but the shadows of the masts and guns and other objects rendered this relief to the night trifling the lieutenant of the watch paced the weather side of the quarterdeck silent but attentive occasionally he hailed the lookouts and admonished them to be vigilant also and at each turn he glanced upward to see how the topsail stood four or five old and thoughtful seamen walked the waist and forecastle but most of the watch were stowed between the guns or in the best places they could find under the lee of the bulwarks catching cats naps this was an indulgence denied the young gentlemen of whom one was on the forecastle leaning against the mast dreaming of home one in the waist supporting the nettings and one walking the leeside of the quarterdeck his eyes shut his thoughts confused and his footing uncertain as bluewater stepped on the quarterdeckladder to descend to his own cabin the youngster hit his foot against an eyebolt and fetched way plump up against his superior bluewater caught the lad in his arms and saved him from a fall setting him fairly on his feet before he let him go  tis seven bells geoffrey said the admiral in an under tone hold on for half an hour longer and then go dream of your dear mother  before the boy could recover himself to thank his superior the latter had disappeared     chapter xx      yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint     as humorous as winter and as sudden     as flaws congealed in the spring of day     his temper therefore must be well observed           shakespeare   the reader will remember that the wind had not become fresh when sir gervaise oakes got into his barge with the intention of carrying his fleet to sea a retrospective glance at the state of the weather will become necessary to the reader therefore in carrying his mind back to that precise period whither it has now become our duty to transport him in imagination  the viceadmiral governed a fleet on principles very different from those of bluewater while the last left so much to the commanders of the different vessels his friend looked into every thing himself the details of the service he knew were indispensable to success on a larger scale and his active mind descended into all these minuti√¶ to a degree sometimes that annoyed his captains on the whole however he was sufficiently observant of that formidable barrier to excessive familiarity and that great promoter of heartburnings in a squadron naval etiquette to prevent any thing like serious misunderstandings and the best feelings prevailed between him and the several magnates under his orders perhaps the circumstance that he was a fighting admiral contributed to this internal tranquillity for it has been often remarked that armies and fleets will both tolerate more in leaders that give them plenty to do with the enemy than in commanders who leave them inactive and less exposed the constant encounters with the foe would seem to let out all the superfluous quarrelsome tendencies nelson to a certain extent was an example of this influence in the english marine suffren1 in that of france and preble to a much greater degree than in either of the other cases in our own at all events while most of his captains sensibly felt themselves less of commanders while sir gervaise was on board or around their ships than when he was in the cabin of the plantagenet the peace was rarely broken between them and he was generally beloved as well as obeyed bluewater was a more invariable favourite perhaps though scarcely as much respected and certainly not half as much feared  footnote 1 suffren though one of the best seacaptains france ever possessed was a man of extreme severity and great roughness of manner still he must have been a man of family as his title of bailli de suffren was derived from his being a knight of malta it is a singular circumstance connected with the death of this distinguished officer which occurred not long before the french revolution that he disappeared in an extraordinary manner and is buried no one knows where it is supposed that he was killed by one of his own officers in a rencontre in the streets of paris at night and that the influence of the friends of the victor was sufficiently great to suppress inquiry the cause of the quarrel is attributed to harsh treatment on service  on the present occasion the viceadmiral did not pull through the fleet without discovering the peculiar propensity to which we have alluded in passing one of the ships he made a sign to his coxswain to cause the boats crew to lay on their oars when he hailed the vessel and the following dialogue occurred  carnatic ahoy cried the admiral  sir exclaimed the officer of the deck jumping on a quarterdeck gun and raising his hat  is captain parker on board sir  he is sir gervaise will you see him sir  a nod of the head sufficed to bring the said captain parker on deck and to the gangway where he could converse with his superior without inconvenience to either  how do you do captain parkera certain sign sir gervaise meant to rap the other over the knuckles else would it have been parkerhow do you do captain parker i am sorry to see you have got your ship too much down by the head sir shell steer off the wind like a colt when he first feels the bridle now with his head on one side and now on the other you know i like a compact line and straight wakes sir  i am well aware of that sir gervaise returned parker a grayheaded meek old man who had fought his way up from the forecastle to his present honourable station and who though brave as a lion before the enemy had a particular dread of all his commanders but we have been obliged to use more water aft than we could wish on account of the tiers we shall coil away the cables anew and come at some of the leaguers forward and bring all right again in a week i hope sir  a weekthe dl sir that will never do when i expect to see de vervillin tomorrow fill all your empty casks aft with saltwater immediately and if that wont do shift some of your shot forward i know that craft of yours well she is as tender as a fellow with corns and the shoe musnt pinch anywhere  very well sir gervaise the ship shall be brought in trim as soon as possible  ay ay sir that is what i expect from every vessel at all times and more especially when we are ready to meet an enemy and i say parkermaking a sign to his boats crew to stop rowing againi say parker i know you love brawnill send you some that galleygo tells me he has picked up alongshore here as soon as i get aboard the fellow has been robbing all the henroosts in devonshire by his own account of the matter  sir gervaise waved his hand parker smiled and bowed his thanks and the two parted with feelings of perfect kindness notwithstanding the little skirmish with which the interview had commenced  mr williamson said captain parker to his first lieutenant on quitting the gangway you hear what the commanderinchief says and he must be obeyed i dont think the carnatic would have sheered out of the line even if she is a little by the head but have the empty casks filled and bring her down six inches more by the stern  thats a good fellow that old parker said sir gervaise to his purser whom he was carrying off goodnaturedly to the ship lest he might lose his passage and i wonder how he let his ship get her nose under water in that fashion i like to have him for a second astern for i feel sure hed follow if i stood into cherbourg bows on yes a good fellow is parker and lockerto his own man who was also in the boatmind you send him two of the best pieces of that brawnheyheyheywhat the dl has lord morganica descendant from royalty by the left handbeen doing now that ship is kept like a tailors jay figure just to stuff jackets and gimcracks on herachilles there  a quartermaster ran to the edge of the poop and then turning he spoke to his captain who was walking the deck and informed him that the commanderinchief hailed the ship the earl of morganic a young man of fourandtwenty who had succeeded to the title a few years before by the death of an elder brotherthe usual process by which an old peer is brought into the british navy the work being too discouraging for those who have fortune before their eyes from the startnow advanced to the quarter of the ship bowed with respectful ease and spoke with a selfpossession that not one of the old commanders of the fleet would have dared to use in general this noblemans intercourse with his superiors in naval rank betrayed the consciousness of his own superiority in civil rank but sir gervaise being of an old family and quite as rich as he was himself the viceadmiral commanded more of his homage than was customary his ship was full of nobs as they term it in the british navy or the sons and relatives of nobles and it was by no means an uncommon thing for her messes to have their jokes at the expense of even flagofficers who were believed to be a little ignorant of the peculiar sensibilities that are rightly enough imagined to characterize social station  goodmorning sir gervaise called out this noble captain im glad to see you looking so well after our long cruise in the bay i intended to have the honour to inquire after your health in person this morning but they told me you slept out of your ship we shall have to hold a court on you sir if you fall much into that habit  all within hearing smiled even to the rough old tars who were astraddle of the yards and even sir gervaises lip curled a little though he was not exactly in a joking humour  come come morganic do you let my habits alone and look out for your own foretopmast why in the name of seamanship is that spar stayed forward in such a fashion looking like a xebecs foremast  do you dislike it sir gervaisenow to our fancies aboard here it gives the achilles a knowing look and we hope to set a fashion by carrying the headsails well forward we help the ship round in a sea you know sir  indeed i know no such thing my lord what you gain after being taken aback you lose in coming to the wind if i had a pair of scales suitable to such a purpose i would have all that hamper you have stayed away yonder over your bows on the end of such a long lever weighed in order that you might learn what a beautiful contrivance youve invented among you to make a ship pitch in a head sea why de if i think youd lieto at all with so much stuff aloft to knock you off to leeward come up every thing forward come up every thing my lord and bring the mast as near perpendicular as possible its a hard matter i find to make one of your newfashioned captains keep things in their places  well now sir gervaise i think the achilles makes as good an appearance as most of the other ships and as to travelling or working i do not know that she is either dull or clumsy  shes pretty well morganic considering how many bondstreet ideas you have got among you but shell never do in a head sea with that foretopmast threatening your knightheads so get the mast upanddown again as soon as convenient and come and dine with me without further invitation the first fine day we have at sea im going to send parker some brawn but ill feed you on some of galleygos turtlesoup made out of pigs heads  thankee sir gervaise well endeavour to straighten the slick since you will have it so though i confess i get tired of seeing every thing today just as we had it yesterday  yesyesthats the way with most of these st james cruisers continued the viceadmiral as he rowed away they want a fashionable tailor to rig a manofwar as they are rigged themselves theres my old friend and neighbour lord scuppertonhes taken a fancy to yachting lately and when his new brig was put into the water lady scupperton made him send for an upholsterer from town to fit out the cabin and when the blackguard had surveyed the unfortunate craft as if it were a country box what does he do but give an opinion that this here edifice my lord in my judgment should be furnished in cottage stylethe vagabond  this story which was not particularly original for sir gervaise himself had told it at least a dozen times before put the admiral in a good humour and he found no more fault with his captains until he reached the plantagenet  daly said the earl of morganic to his first lieutenant an experienced old irishman of fifty who still sung a good song and told a good story and what was a little extraordinary for either of these accomplishments knew how to take good care of a shipdaly i suppose we must humour the old gentleman or hell be quarantining me and that i shouldnt particularly like on the eve of a general action so well ease off forward and set up the strings aft again hang me if i think he could find it out if we didnt so long as we kept dead in his wake  that wouldnt be a very safe desait for sir jarvy my lord for hes a wonderful eye for a rope were it admiral blue now id engage to cruise in his company for a week with my mizzenmast stowed in the hold and there should be no bother about the novelty at all quite likely hed be hailing us and ask what brigs that but none of these tricks will answer with tother who misses the whipping off the end of a gasket as soon as any first luff of us all and so ill just go about the business in earnest get the carpenter up with his plumbbob and set every thing as straight upanddown as the back of a grenadier  lord morganic laughed as was usual with him when his lieutenant saw fit to be humorous and then his caprice in changing the staying of his masts as well as the order which countermanded it was forgotten  the arrival of sir gervaise on board his own ship was always an event in the fleet even though his absence had lasted no longer than twentyfour hours the effect was like that which is produced on a team of highmettled cattle when they feel that the reins are in the hands of an experienced and spirited coachman  goodmorning greenly goodmorning to you all gentlemen said the viceadmiral bowing to the quarterdeck in gross in return for the presentarms and rattling of drums and lowering of hats that greeted his arrival a fine day and it is likely we shall have a fresh breeze captain greenly your spritsailyard wants squaring by the lifts and bunting make the thunderers signal to get her foreyard in its place as soon as possible shes had it down long enough to make a new one instead of merely fishing it are your boats all aboard greenly  all but your own barge sir gervaise and that is hooked on  in with it sir then trip and well be off monsieur de vervillin has got some mischief in his head gentlemen and we must go and take it out of him  these orders were promptly obeyed but as the manner in which the plantagenet passed out of the fleet and led the other ships to sea has been already related it is unnecessary to repeat it there was the usual bustle the customary orderly confusion the winding of calls the creaking of blocks and the swinging of yards ere the vessels were in motion as the breeze freshened sail was reduced as already related until by the time the leading ship was ten leagues at sea all were under short canvass and the appearance of a windy if not a dirty night had set in of course all means of communication between the plantagenet and the vessels still at anchor had ceased except by sending signals down the line but to those sir gervaise had no recourse since he was satisfied bluewater understood his plans and he then entertained no manner of doubt of his friends willingness to aid them  little heed was taken of any thing astern by those on board the plantagenet every one saw it is true that ship followed ship in due succession as long as the movements of those inshore could be perceived at all but the great interest centred on the horizon to the southward and eastward in that quarter of the channel the french were expected to appear for the cause of this sudden departure was a secret from no one in the fleet a dozen of the best lookouts in the ship were kept aloft the whole afternoon and captain greenly himself sat in the forwardcrosstrees with a glass for more than an hour just as the sun was setting in order to sweep the horizon two or three sail were made it is true but they all proved to be english coasters guernsey or jerseymen standing for ports in the west of england most probably laden with prohibited articles from the country of the enemy whatever may be the dislike of an englishman for a frenchman he has no dislike to the labour of his hands and there probably has not been a period since civilization has introduced the art of smuggling among its other arts when french brandies and laces and silks were not exchanged against english tobacco and guineas and that in a contraband way let it be in peace or let it be in war one of the characteristics of sir gervaise oakes was to despise all petty means of annoyance usually he disdained even to turn aside to chase a smuggler fishermen he never molested at all and on the whole he carried on a marine warfare a century since in a way that some of his successors might have imitated to advantage in our own times like that highspirited irishman caldwell2 who conducted a blockade in the chesapeake at the commencement of the revolution with so much liberality that his enemies actually sent him an invitation to a public dinner sir gervaise knew how to distinguish between the combatant and the noncombatant and heartily disdained all the moneymaking parts of his profession though large sums had fallen into his hands in this way as pure godsends no notice was taken therefore of any thing that had not a warlike look the noble old ship standing steadily on towards the french coast as the mastiff passes the cur on his way to encounter another animal of a mould and courage more worthy of his powers  footnote 2 the writer believes this nobleminded sailor to have been the late admiral sir benjamin caldwell it is scarcely necessary to say that the invitation could not be accepted though quite seriously given  make nothing of em hey greenly said sir gervaise as the captain came down from his perch in consequence of the gathering obscurity of evening followed by halfadozen lieutenants and midshipmen who had been aloft as volunteers well we know they cannot yet be to the westward of us and by standing on shall be certain of heading them off before this time six months how beautifully all the ships behave following each other as accurately as if bluewater himself were aboard each vessel to conn her  yes sir they do keep the line uncommonly well considering that the tides run in streaks in the channel i do think if we were to drop a hammock overboard that the carnatic would pick it up although she must be quite four leagues astern of us  let old parker alone for that ill warrant you he is never out of the way were it lord morganic now in the achilles i should expect him to be away off here on our weatherquarter just to show us how his ship can eat us out of the wind when he tries or away down yonder under our lee that we might understand how she falls off when he dont try  my lord is a gallant officer and no bad seaman for his years notwithstanding sir gervaise observed greenly who generally took the part of the absent whenever his superior felt disposed to berate them  i deny neither greenly most particularly the first i know very well were i to signal morganic to run into brest hed do it but whether he would go in ringtailboom or jibboom first i couldnt tell till i saw it now you are a youngish man yourself greenly  every day of eightandthirty sir gervaise and a few months to spare and i care not if the ladies know it  pohthey like us old fellows half the time as well as they do the boys but you are of an age not to feel time in your bones and can see the folly of some of our oldfashioned notions perhaps though you are not quite as likely to understand the fooleries that have come in in your own day nothing is more absurd than to be experimenting on the settled principles of ships they are machines greenly and have their laws just the same as the planets in the heavens the idea comes from a fishhead run and helm and all we have to do is to study the fishes in order to get the sort of craft we want if there is occasion for bulk take the whale and you get a round bottom full forebody and a clean run when you want speed models are plentytake the dolphin for instanceand there you find an entrance like a wedge a lean forebody and a run as clean as this ships decks but some of our young captains would spoil a dolphins sailing if they could breathe under water so as to get at the poor devils look at their fancies the first lord shall give one of his cousins a frigate now that is moulded after nature itself as one might say with a bottom that would put a trout to shame well one of the first things the lad does when he gets on board her is to lengthen his gaff perhaps put a cloth or two in his mizzen and call it a spanker settle away the peak till it sticks out over his taffrail like a signpost and then away he goes upon a wind with his helm hardup bragging what a weatherly craft he has and how hard it is to make her even look to leeward  i have known such sailors i must confess sir gervaise but time cures them of that folly  that is to be hoped for what would a man think of a fish to which nature had fitted a tail athwartships and which was obliged to carry a fin like a leeboard under its leejaw to prevent falling off dead before the wind  here sir gervaise laughed heartily at the picture of the awkward creature to which his own imagination had given birth greenly joining in the merriment partly from the oddity of the conceit and partly from the docility with which commanderinchiefs jokes are usually received the feeling of momentary indignation which had aroused sir gervaise to such an expression of his disgust at modern inventions was appeased by this little success and inviting his captain to sup with hima substitute for a dinnerhe led the way below in high goodhumour galleygo having just announced that the table was ready  the convives on this occasion were merely the admiral himself greenly and atwood the fare was substantial rather than scientific but the service was rich sir gervaise uniformly eating off of plate in addition to galleygo no less than five domestics attended to the wants of the party as a ship of the plantagenets size was reasonably steady at all times a gale of wind excepted when the lamps and candles were lighted and the group was arranged aided by the admixture of rich furniture with frowning artillery and the other appliances of war the great cabin of the plantagenet was not without a certain air of rude magnificence sir gervaise kept no less than three servants in livery as a part of his personal establishment tolerating galleygo and one or two more of the same stamp as a homage due to neptune  the situation not being novel to either of the party and the days work having been severe the first twenty minutes were pretty studiously devoted to the duty of restoration as it is termed by the great masters of the science of the table by the end of that time however the glass began to circulate though moderately and with it tongues to loosen  your health captain greenlyatwood i remember you said the viceadmiral nodding his head familiarly to his two guests on the eve of tossing off a glass of sherry these spanish wines go directly to the heart and i only wonder why a people who can make them dont make better sailors  in the days of columbus the spaniards had something to boast of in that way too sir gervaise atwood remarked  ay but that was a long time ago and they have got bravely over it i account for the deficiencies of both the french and spanish marines something in this way greenly columbus and the discovery of america brought ships and sailors into fashion but a ship without an officer fit to command her is like a body without a soul fashion however brought your young nobles into their services and men were given vessels because their fathers were dukes and counts and not because they knew any thing about them  is our own service entirely free from this sort of favouritism quietly demanded the captain  far from it greenly else would not morganic have been made a captain at twenty and old parker for instance one only at fifty but somehow our classes slide into each other in a way that neutralizes in a great degree the effect of birth is it not so atwood  some of our classes sir gervaise manage to slide into all the best places if the truth must be said  well that is pretty bold for a scotchman rejoined the viceadmiral goodhumouredly ever since the accession of the house of stuart weve built a bridge across the tweed that lets people pass in only one direction i make no doubt this pretenders son will bring down half scotland at his heels to fill all the berths they may fancy suitable to their merits its an easy way of paying bountypromises  this affair in the north they tell me seems a little serious said greenly i believe this is mr atwoods opinion  youll find it serious enough if sir gervaises notion about the bounty be true answered the immovable secretary scotia is a small country but its well filled with braw sperits if theres an opening for them to prove it  well well this war between england and scotland is out of place while we have the french and spaniards on our hands most extraordinary scenes have we had ashore yonder greenly with an old devonshire baronet who slipped and is off for the other world while we were in his house  magrath has told me something of it sir and he tells me the fillusnullushang me if i can make out his gibberish five minutes after it was told to me  filius nullius you mean nobodys babythe son of nobodyhave you forgotten your latin man  faith sir gervaise i never had any to forget my father was a captain of a manofwar before me and he kept me afloat from the time i was five down to the day of his death latin was no part of my spoonmeat  ayaymy good fellow i knew your father and was in the third ship from him in the action in which he fell returned the viceadmiral kindly bluewater was just ahead of him and we all loved him as we did an elder brother you were not promoted then  no sir i was only a midshipman and didnt happen to be in his own ship that day answered greenly sensibly touched with this tribute to his parents merit but i was old enough to remember how nobly you all behaved on the occasion wellslily brushing his eye with his handlatin may do a schoolmaster good but it is of little use on board ship i never had but one scholar among all my cronies and intimates  and who was he greenly you shouldnt despise knowledge because you dont understand it i dare say your intimate was none the worse for a little latinenough to go through nullus nulla nullum for instance who was this intimate greenly  john bluewaterhandsome jack as he was called the younger brother of the admiral they sent him to sea to keep him out of harms way in some love affair and you may remember that while he was with the admiral or captain bluewater as he was then i was one of the lieutenants although poor jack was a soldier and in the guards and he was four or five years my senior he took a fancy to me and we became intimate he understood latin better than he did his own interests  in what did he failbluewater was never very communicative to me about that brother  there was a private marriage and cross guardians and the usual difficulties in the midst of it all poor john fell in battle as you know and his widow followed him to the grave within a month or two twas a sad story all round and i try to think of it as little as possible  a private marriage repeated sir gervaise slowly are you quite sure of that i dont think bluewater is aware of that circumstance at least i never heard him allude to it could there have been any issue  no one can know it better than myself as i helped to get the lady off and was present at the ceremony that much i know of issue i should think there was none though the colonel lived a year after the marriage how far the admiral is familiar with all these circumstances i cannot say as one would not like to introduce the particulars of a private marriage of a deceased brother to his commanding officer  i am glad there was no issue greenlyparticular circumstances make me glad of that but we will change the discourse as these family disasters make one melancholy and a melancholy dinner is like ingratitude to him who bestows it  the conversation now grew general and in due season in common with the feast it ended after sitting the usual time the guests retired sir gervaise then went on deck and paced the poop for an hour looking anxiously ahead in quest of the french signal and failing of discovering them he was fain to seek his berth out of sheer fatigue before he did this however the necessary orders were given and that to call him should any thing out of the common track occur was repeated no less than four times     chapter xxi      roll on thou deep and darkblue oceanroll       ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain     man marks the earth with ruinhis control       stops with the shoreupon the watery plain     the wrecks are all thy deed           childe harold   it was broad daylight when sir gervaise oakes next appeared on deck as the scene then offered to his view as well as the impression it made on his mind will sufficiently explain to the reader the state of affairs some six hours later than the time last included in our account we refer him to those for his own impressions the wind now blew a real gale though the season of the year rendered it less unpleasant to the feelings than is usual with wintry tempests the air was even bland and still charged with the moisture of the ocean though it came sweeping athwart sheets of foam with a fury at moments which threatened to carry the entire summits of waves miles from their beds in spray even the aquatic birds seemed to be terrified in the instants of the greatest power of the winds actually wheeling suddenly on their wings and plunging into the element beneath to seek protection from the maddened efforts of that to which they more properly belonged  still sir gervaise saw that his ships bore up nobly against the fierce strife each vessel showed the same canvass viza reefed foresail a small triangular piece of strong heavy cloth fitted between the end of the bowsprit and the head of the foretopmast a similar sail over the quarterdeck between the mizzen and main masts and a closereefed maintopsail several times that morning captain greenly had thought he should be compelled to substitute a lower surface to the wind than that of the sail last mentioned as it was an important auxiliary however in steadying the ship and in keeping her under the command of her helm on each occasion the order had been delayed until he now began to question whether the canvass could be reduced without too great a risk to the men whom it would be necessary to send aloft he had decided to let it stand or blow away as fortune might decide similar reasoning left nearly all the other vessels under precisely the same canvass  the ships of the viceadmirals division had closed in the night agreeably to an order given before quitting the anchorage which directed them to come within the usual sailing distance in the event of the weathers menacing a separation this command had been obeyed by the ships astern carrying sail hard long after the leading vessels had been eased by reducing their canvass the order of sailing was the plantagenet in the van and the carnatic achilles thunderer blenheim and warspite following in the order named some changes having been made in the night in order to bring the ships of the division into their fightingstations in a line ahead the viceadmiral leading the superiority of the plantagenet was a little apparent notwithstanding the carnatic alone and that only by means of the most careful watching being able to keep literally in the commanderinchiefs wake all the other vessels gradually but almost imperceptibly setting to leeward of it these several circumstances struck sir gervaise the moment his foot touched the poop where he found greenly keeping an anxious lookout on the state of the weather and the condition of his own ship leaning at the same time against the spankerboom to steady himself in the gusts of the gale the viceadmiral braced his own wellknit and compact frame by spreading his legs then he turned his handsome but weatherbeaten face towards the line scanning each ship in succession as she lay over to the wind and came wallowing on shoving aside vast mounds of water with her bows her masts describing short arcs in the air and her hull rolling to windward and lurching as if boring her way through the ocean galleygo who never regarded himself as a steward in a gale of wind was the only other person on the poop whither he went at pleasure by a sort of imprescriptibly right  well done old planter cried sir gervaise heartily as soon as his eye had taken in the leading peculiarities of the view you see greenly she has every body but old parker to leeward and she would have him there too but he would carry every stick he has out of the carnatic rather than not keep his berth look at master morganic he has his main course closereefed on the achilles to luff into his station and ill warrant you will get a good six months wear out of that ship in this one gale loosening her knees and jerking her spars like so many whiphandles and all for love of the new fashion of rigging an english twodecker like an algerian xebec well let him tug his way up to windward bondstreet fashion if he likes the fun what has become of the chloe greenly  here she is sir quite a league on our leebow looking out according to orders  ay that is her work and shell do it effectuallybut i dont see the driver  shes dead ahead sir answered greenly smiling her orders being rather more difficult of execution her station would be off yonder to windward half a league ahead of us but its no easy matter to get into that position sir gervaise when the plantagenet is really in earnest  sir gervaise laughed and rubbed his hands then he turned to look for the active the only other vessel of his division this little cutter was dancing over the seas half the time under water notwithstanding under the head of her mainsail broad off on the admirals weatherbeam finding no difficulty in maintaining her station there in the absence of all tophamper and favoured by the lowness of her hull after this he glanced upward at the sails and spars of the plantagenet which he studied closely  no signs of de vervillin hey greenly the admiral asked when his survey of the whole fleet had ended i was in hopes we might see something of him when the light returned this morning  perhaps it is quite as well as it is sir gervaise returned the captain we could do little besides look at each other in this gale and admiral bluewater ought to join before i should like even to do that  think you so master greenlythere you are mistaken then for id lie by him were i alone in this ship that i might know where he was to be found as soon as the weather would permit us to have something to say to him  these words were scarcely uttered when the lookout in the forward crosstrees shouted at the top of his voice sailho at the next instant the chloe fired a gun the report of which was just heard amid the roaring of the gale though the smoke was distinctly seen floating above the mists of the ocean she also set a signal at her naked mizzentopgallantmasthead  run below young gentleman said the viceadmiral advancing to the break of the poop and speaking to a midshipman on the quarterdeck and desire mr bunting to make his appearance the chloe signals ustell him not to look for his kneebuckles  a century since the last injunction though still so much in use on shipboard was far more literal than it is today nearly all classes of men possessing the articles in question though not invariably wearing them when at sea the midshipman dove below however as soon as the words were out of his superiors mouth and in a very few minutes bunting appeared having actually stopped on the maindeck ladder to assume his coat lest he might too unceremoniously invade the sacred precincts of the quarterdeck in his shirtsleeves  there it is bunting said sir gervaise handing the lieutenant the glass two hundred and twentysevena large sail ahead if i remember right  no sir gervaise sails ahead the number of them to follow hoist the answering flag quartermaster  so much the better so much the better bunting the number to follow well well follow the number let it be greater or smaller come sirrah bear a hand up with your answering flag  the usual signal that the message was understood was now run up between the masts and instantly hauled down again the flags seen in the chloe descending at the same moment  now for the number of the sails ahead said sir gervaise as he greenly and bunting each levelled a glass at the frigate on board which the next signal was momentarily expected eleven by george  no sir gervaise exclaimed greenly i know better than that red above and blue beneath with the distinguishing pennant beneath make fourteen in our books now  well sir if they are forty well go nearer and see of what sort of stuff they are made show your answering flag bunting that we may know what else the chloe has to tell us  this was done the frigate hauling down her signals in haste and showing a new set as soon as possible  what now buntingwhat now greenly demanded sir gervaise a sea having struck the side of the ship and thrown so much spray into his face as to reduce him to the necessity of using his pockethandkerchief at the very moment he was anxious to be looking through his glass what do you make of that gentlemen  i make out the number to be 382 answered greenly but what it means i know not  strange sails enemies read bunting from the book show the answer quartermaster  we hardly wanted a signal for that greenly since there can be no friendly force here away and fourteen sail on this coast always means mischief what says the chloe next  strange sails on the larboard tack heading as follows  by george crossing our coursewe shall soon see them from deck do the ships astern notice the signals  every one of them sir gervaise answered the captain the thunderer has just lowered her answering flag and the active is repeating i have never seen quartermasters so nimble  so much the betterso much the betterdown he comes stand by for another  after the necessary pause the signal to denote the point of the compass was shown from the chloe  heading how bunting the viceadmiral eagerly inquired heading how sir  northwestandbynorth or as bunting pronounced it norwestandbyloathe i believe sirno i am mistaken sir gervaise it is nornorwest  jammed up like ourselves hard on a wind this gale comes directly from the broad atlantic and one party is crossing over to the north and the other to the south shore we must meet unless one of us run awayhey greenly  true enough sir gervaise though fourteen sail is rather an awkward odds for seven  you forget the driver and active sir weve nine nine hearty substantial british cruisers  to wit six ships of the line one frigate a sloop and a cutter laying heavy emphasis on the two last vessels  what does the chloe say now bunting that were enough for the french although they are two to one  not exactly that i believe sir gervaise five more sail ahead they increase fast sir  ay at that rate they may indeed grow too strong for us answered sir gervaise with more coolness of manner nineteen to nine are rather heavy odds i wish we had bluewater here  that is what i was about to suggest sir gervaise observed the captain if we had the other division as some of the frenchmen are probably frigates and corvettes we might do better admiral bluewater cannot be far from us somewhere down here towards northeastor nornoreast by warring round i think we should make his division in the course of a couple of hours  what and leave to monsieur de vervillin the advantage of swearing he frightened us away nonogreenly we will first pass him fairly and manfully and that too within reach of shot and then it will be time enough to go round and look after our friends  will not that be putting the french exactly between our two divisions sir gervaise and give him the advantage of dividing our force if he stand far on a nornorwest course i think he will infallibly get between us and admiral bluewater  and what will he gain by that greenlywhat according to your notions of matters and things will be the great advantage of having an english fleet on each side of him  not much certainly sir gervaise answered greenly laughing if these fleets were at all equal to his own but as they will be much inferior to him the comte may manage to close with one division while the other is so far off as to be unable to assist and one hour of a hot fire may dispose of the victory  all this is apparent enough greenly yet i could hardly brook letting the enemy go scathe less so long as it blows as it does now there will not be much fighting and there can be no harm in taking a near look at m de vervillin in half an hour or an hour at most we must get a sight of him from off deck even with this slow headway of the two fleets let them heave the log and ascertain how fast we go sir  should we engage the french in such weather sir gervaise answered greenly after giving the order just mentioned it would be giving them the very advantage they like they usually fire at the spars and one shot would do more mischief with such a strain on the masts than halfadozen in a moderate blow  that will do greenlythat will do said the viceadmiral impatiently if i didnt so well know you and hadnt seen you so often engaged i should think you were afraid of these nineteen sail you have lectured long enough to render me prudent and well say no more  here sir gervaise turned on his heel and began to pace the poop for he was slightly vexed though not angered such little dialogues often occurred between him and his captain the latter knowing that his commanders greatest professional failing was excess of daring while he felt that his own reputation was too well established to be afraid to inculcate prudence next to the honour of the flag and his own perhaps greenly felt the greatest interest in that of sir gervaise oakes under whom he had served as midshipman lieutenant and captain and this his superior knew a circumstance that would have excused far greater liberties after moving swiftly to and fro several times the viceadmiral began to cool and he forgot this passing ebullition of quick feelings greenly on the other hand satisfied that the just mind of the commanderinchief would not fail to appreciate facts that had been so plainly presented to it was content to change the subject they conversed together in a most friendly manner sir gervaise being even unusually frank and communicative in order to prove he was not displeased the matter in discussion being the state of the ship and the situation of the crew  you are always ready for battle greenly the viceadmiral said smilingly in conclusion when there is a necessity and always just as ready to point out the inexpediency of engaging where you fancy nothing is to be gained by it you would not have me run away from a shadow however or a signal and that is much the same thing so we will stand on until we make the frenchmen fairly from offdeck when it will be time enough to determine what shall come next  sailho shouted one of the lookouts from aloft a cry that immediately drew all eyes towards the mizzentopmastcrosstrees whence the sound proceeded  the wind blew too fresh to render conversation even by means of a trumpet easy and the man was ordered down to give an account of what he had seen of course he first touched the poopdeck where he was met by the admiral and captain the officer of the watch to whom he properly belonged giving him up to the examination of his two superiors without a grimace  whereaway is the sail youve seen sir demanded sir gervaise a little sharply for he suspected it was no more than one of the ships ahead already signaled down yonder to the southward and eastwardhey sirrah  no sir jarvy answered the topman hitching his trowsers with one hand and smoothing the hair on his forehead with the other but out here to the forward and westward on our weatherquarter its none o them french chaps as is with the county of fairvillianfor so all the common men of the fleet believed their gallant enemy to be rightly namedbut is a squarerigged craft by herself jammed up on a wind pretty much like all on us  that alters the matter greenly how do you know she is squarerigged my man  why sir jarvy your honour shes under her fore and maintawsails closereefed with a bit of the mainsail set as well as i can make it out sir  the devil she is it must be some fellow in a great hurry to carry that canvass in this blow can it be possible greenly that the leading vessel of bluewater is heaving in sight  i rather think not sir gervaise it would be too far to windward for any of his twodeckers it may turn out to be a lookout ship of the french got round on the other tack to keep her station and carrying sail hard because she dislikes our appearance  in that case she must claw well to windward to escape us whats your name my ladtom davis if im not mistaken  no sir jarvy its jack brown which is much the same your honour wes no ways particlar about names  well jack does it blow hard aloft so as to give you any trouble in holding on  nothing to speak on sir jarvy ater cruising a winter and spring in the bay of biscay i looks on this as no more nor a puff half a hand will keep a fellow in his berth aloft  galleygotake jack brown below to my cabin and give him a fresh nip in his jiggerhell hold on all the better for it  this was sir gervaises mode of atoning for the error in doing the man injustice by supposing he was mistaken about the new sail and jack brown went aloft devoted to the commanderinchief it costs the great and powerful so little to become popular that one is sometimes surprised to find that any are otherwise but when we remember that it is also their duty to be just astonishment ceases justice being precisely the quality to which a large portion of the human race are most averse  half an hour passed and no further reports were received from aloft in a few minutes however the warspite signalled the admiral to report the stranger on her weatherquarter and not long after the active did the same still neither told his character and the course being substantially the same the unknown ship approached but slowly notwithstanding the unusual quantity of sail she had set at the end of the period mentioned the vessels in the southeastern board began to be visible from the deck the ocean was so white with foam that it was not easy to distinguish a ship under short canvass at any great distance but by the aid of glasses both sir gervaise and greenly satisfied themselves that the number of the enemy at the southward amounted to just twenty one more having hove in sight and been signalled by the chloe since her first report several of these vessels however were small and the viceadmiral after a long and anxious survey lowered his glass and turned to his captain in order to compare opinions  well greenly he asked what do you make of them nowaccording to my reckoning there are thirteen of the line two frigates four corvettes and a lugger or twenty sail in all  there can be no doubt of the twenty sail sir gervaise though the vessels astern are still too distant to speak of their size i rather think it will turn out fourteen of the line and only three frigates  that is rather too much for us certainly without bluewater his five ships now and this westerly position would make a cheering prospect for us we might stick by mr de vervillin until it moderated and then pay our respects to him what do you say to that greenly  that it is of no great moment sir gervaise so long as the other division is not with us but yonder are signals flying on board the active the warspite and the blenheim  ay theyve something to tell us of the chap astern and to windward come bunting give us the news  stranger in the northwest shows the druids number the signalofficer read mechanically from the book  the deuce he does then bluewater cannot be far off let dick alone for keeping in his proper place he has an instinct for a line of battle and i never knew him fail to be in the very spot i could wish to have him looking as much at home as if his ships had all been built there the druids number the c√¶sar and the rest of them are in a line ahead further north heading up well to windward even of our own wake this puts the comte fairly under our lee  but greenly was far from being of a temperament as sanguine as that of the viceadmirals he did not like the circumstance of the druids being alone visible and she too under what in so heavy a gale might be deemed a press of canvass there was no apparent reason for the divisions carrying sail so hard while the frigate would he obliged to do it did she wish to overtake vessels like the plantagenet and her consorts he suggested therefore the probability that the ship was alone and that her object might be to speak them  there is something in what you say greenly answered sir gervaise after a minutes reflection and we must look into it if denham doesnt give us any thing new from the count to change our plans it may be well to learn what the druid is after  denham was the commander of the chloe which ship a neat sixandthirty was pitching into the heavy seas that now came rolling in heavily from the broad atlantic the water streaming from her hawseholes as she rose from each plunge like the spouts of a whale this vessel it has been stated was fully a league ahead and to leeward of the plantagenet and consequently so much nearer to the french who were approaching from that precise quarter of the ocean in a long single line like that of the english a little relieved however by the lookout vessels all of which in their case were sailing along on the weatherbeam of their friends the distance was still so great as to render glasses necessary in getting any very accurate notions of the force and the point of sailing of monsieur de vervillins fleet the ships astern being yet so remote as to require long practice to speak with any certainty of their characters in nothing notwithstanding was the superior practical seamanship of the english more apparent than in the manner in which these respective lines were formed that of sir gervaise oakes was compact each ship being as near as might be a cables length distant from her seconds ahead and astern this was a point on which the viceadmiral prided himself and by compelling his captains rigidly to respect their line of sailing and by keeping the same ships and officers as much as possible under his orders each captain of the fleet had got to know his own vessels rate of speed and all the other qualities that were necessary to maintain her precise position all the ships being weatherly though some in a slight degree were more so than others it was easy to keep the line in weather like the present the wind not blowing sufficiently hard to render a few cloths more or less of canvass of any very great moment if there was a vessel sensibly out of her place in the entire line it was the achilles lord morganic not having had time to get all his forward spars as far aft as they should have been a circumstance that had knocked him off a little more than had happened to the other vessels nevertheless had an airline been drawn at this moment from the mizzentop of the plantagenet to that of the warspite it would have been found to pass through the spars of quite half the intermediate vessels and no one of them all would have been a pistolshot out of the way as there were six intervals between the vessels and each interval as near as could be guessed at was a cables length the extent of the whole line a little exceeded threequarters of a mile  on the other hand the french though they preserved a very respectable degree of order were much less compact and by no means as methodical in their manner of sailing some of their ships were a quarter of a mile to leeward of the line and the intervals were irregular and illobserved these circumstances arose from several causes neither of which proceeded from any fault in the commanderinchief who was both an experienced seaman and a skilful tactician but his captains were new to each other and some of them were recently appointed to their ships it being just as much a matter of course that a seaman should ascertain the qualities of his vessel by familiarity as that a man should learn the character of his wife in the intimacy of wedlock  at the precise moment of which we are now writing the chloe might have been about a league from the leading vessel of the enemy and her position to leeward of her own fleet threatened to bring her half an hour later within range of the frenchmens guns this fact was apparent to all in the squadron still the frigate stood on having been placed in that station and the whole being under the immediate supervision of the commanderinchief  denham will have a warm berth of it sir should he stand on much longer said greenly when ten minutes more had passed during which the ships had gradually drawn nearer  i was hoping he might get between the most weatherly french frigate and her line answered sir gervaise when i think by edging rapidly away we could take her alive with the plantagenet  in which case we might as well clear for action such a manoeuvre being certain to bring on a general engagement  nonoim not quite mad enough for that master telemachus but we can wait a little longer for the chances how many flags can you make out among the enemy bunting  i see but two sir gervaise one at the fore and the other at the mizzen like our own i can make out now only twelve ships of the line too neither of which is a threedecker  so much for rumour as flagrant a liar as ever wagged a tongue twelve ships on two decks and eight frigates sloops and luggers there can be no great mistake in this  i think not sir gervaise their commanderinchief is in the fourth ship from the head of the line his flag is just discernible by means of our best glass ay there goes a signal this instant at the end of his gaff  if one could only read french now greenly said the viceadmiral smiling we might get into some of mr de vervillins secrets perhaps its an order to go to quarters or to clear look out sharp bunting for any signs of such a movement what do you make of it  its to the frigates sir gervaise all of which answer while the other vessels do not  we want no french to read that signal sir put in greenly the frigates themselves telling us what it means monsieur de vervillin has no idea of letting the plantagenet take any thing he has alive  this was true enough just as the captain spoke the object of the order was made sufficiently apparent by all the light vessels to windward of the french fleet bearing up together until they brought the wind abaft their beams when away they glided to leeward like floating objects that have suddenly struck a swift current before this change in their course these frigates and corvettes had been struggling along the seas meeting them on their weatherbows at the rate of about two knots or rather less whereas their speed was now quadrupled and in a few minutes the whole of them had sailed through the different intervals in their main line and had formed as before nearly half a league to leeward of it here in the event of an action their principal duties would have been to succour crippled ships that might be forced out of their allotted stations during the combat all this sir gervaise viewed with disgust he had hoped that his enemy might have presumed on the state of the elements and suffered his light vessels to maintain their original positions  it would be a great triumph to us greenly he said if denham could pass without shifting his berth there would be something manly and seamanlike in an inferior fleets passing a superior in such a style  yes sir though it might cost us a fine frigate the count can have no difficulty in fighting his weather maindeck guns and a discharge from two or three of his leading vessels might cut away some spar that denham would miss sadly just at such a moment  sir gervaise placed his hands behind his back paced the deck a minute and then said decidedly  bunting make the chloes signal to waretacking in this sea and under that short canvass is out of the question  bunting had anticipated this order and had even ventured clandestinely to direct the quartermasters to bend on the necessary flags and sir gervaise had scarcely got the words out of his mouth before the signal was abroad the chloe was equally on the alert for she too each moment expected the command and ere her answering flag was seen her helm was up the mizenstaysail down and her head falling off rapidly towards the enemy this movement seemed to be expected all roundand it certainly had been delayed to the very last momentfor the leading french ship fell off three or four points and as the frigate was exactly endon to her let fly the contents of all the guns on her forecastle as well as of those on her maindeck as far aft as they could be brought to bear one of the topsailsheets of the frigate was shot away by this rapid and unexpected fire and some little damage was done to the standing rigging but luckily none of immediate moment captain denham was active and the instant he found his topsail flapping he ordered it clewed up and the mainsail loosed the latter was set closereefed as the ship came to the wind on the larboard tack and by the time every thing was braced up and hauled aft on that tack the maintopsail was ready to be sheeted home anew during the few minutes that these evolutions required sir gervaise kept his eye riveted on the vessel and when he saw her fairly round and trimmed by the wind again with the mainsail dragging her ahead to own the truth he felt mentally relieved  not a minute too soon sir gervaise observed the cautious greenly smiling i should not be surprised if denham hears more from that fellow at the head of the french line his weather chaseguns are exactly in a range with the frigate and the two upper ones might be worked well enough  i think not greenly the forecastle gun possibly scarcely any thing below it  sir gervaise proved to be partly right and partly wrong the frenchman did attempt a fire with his maindeck gun but at the first plunge of the ship a sea slapped up against her weatherbow and sent a column of water through the port that drove half its crew into the leescuppers in the midst of this waterspout the gun exploded the loggerhead having been applied an instant before giving a sort of chaotic wildness to the scene inboard this satisfied the party below though that on the forecastle fared better the last fired their gun several times and always without success this failure proceeded from a cause that is seldom sufficiently estimated by nautical gunners the shot having swerved from the line of sight by the force of the wind against which it flew two or three hundred feet by the time it had gone the mile that lay between the vessels sir gervaise anxiously watched the effect of the fire and perceiving that all the shot fell to leeward of the chloe he was no longer uneasy about that vessel and he began to turn his attention to other and more important concerns  as we are now approaching a moment when it is necessary that the reader should receive some tolerably distinct impression of the relative positions of the two entire fleets we shall close the present chapter here reserving the duty of explanation for the commencement of a new one     chapter xxii              all were glad     and laughed and shouted as she darted on     and plunged amid the foam and tossed it high     over the deck as when a strong curbed steed     flings the froth from him in his eager race           percival   the long twilight of a high latitude had now ended and the sun though concealed behind clouds had risen the additional light contributed to lessen the gloomy look of the ocean though the fury of the winds and waves still lent to it a dark and menacing aspect to windward there were no signs of an abatement of the gale while the heavens continued to abstain from letting down their floods on the raging waters beneath by this lime the fleet was materially to the southward of cape la hogue though far to the westward where the channel received the winds and waves from the whole rake of the atlantic and the seas were setting in in the long regular swells of the ocean a little disturbed by the influence of the tides ships as heavy as the twodeckers moved along with groaning efforts their bulkheads and timbers complaining to use the language of the sea as the huge masses loaded with their iron artillery rose and sunk on the coming and receding billows but their movements were stately and full of majesty whereas the cutter sloop and even the frigates seemed to be tossed like foam very much at the mercy of the elements the chloe was passing the admiral on the opposite tack quite a mile to leeward and yet as she mounted to the summit of a wave her cutwater was often visible nearly to the keel these are the trials of a vessels strength for were a ship always waterborne equally on all her lines there would not be the necessity which now exists to make her the wellknit mass of wood and iron she is  the progress of the two fleets was very much the same both squadrons struggling along through the billows at the rate of about a marine league in the hour as no lofty sail was carried and the vessels were first made in the haze of a clouded morning the ships had not become visible to each other until nearer than common and by the time at which we have now arrived in our tale the leading vessels were separated by a space that did not exceed two miles estimating the distance only on their respective lines of sailing though there would be about the same space between them when abreast the english being so much to windward of their enemies any one in the least familiar with nautical manoeuvres will understand that these circumstances would bring the van of the french and the rear of their foes much nearer together in passing both fleets being closehauled  sir gervaise oakes as a matter of course watched the progress of the two lines with close and intelligent attention mons de vervillin did the same from the poop of le foudroyant a noble eightygun ship in which his flag of viceadmiral was flying as it might be in defiance by the side of the former stood greenly bunting and bury the plantagenets first lieutenant by the side of the latter his capitaine de vaisseau a man as little like the caricatures of such officers as a hostile feeling has laid before the readers of english literature as washington was like the man held up to odium in the london journals at the commencement of the great american war m de vervillin himself was a man of respectable birth of a scientific education and of great familiarity with ships so far as a knowledge of their general powers and principles was concerned but here his professional excellence ceased all that infinity of detail which composes the distinctive merit of the practical seaman being in a great degree unknown to him rendering it necessary for him to think in moments of emergency periods when the really prime mariner seems more to act by a sort of instinct than by any very intelligible process of ratiocination with his fleet drawn out before him however and with no unusual demands on his resources this gallant officer was an exceedingly formidable foe to contend with in squadron  sir gervaise oakes lost all his constitutional and feverish impatience while the fleets drew nigher and nigher as is not unusual with brave men who are naturally excitable as the crisis approached he grew calmer and obtained a more perfect command over himself seeing all things in their true colours and feeling more and more equal to control them he continued to walk the poop but it was with a slower step and though his hands were still closed behind his back the fingers were passive while his countenance became grave and his eye thoughtful greenly knew that his interference would now be hazardous for whenever the viceadmiral assumed that air he literally became commanderinchief and any attempt to control or influence him unless sustained by the communication of new facts could only draw down resentment on his own head bunting too was aware that the admiral was aboard as the officers among themselves used to describe this state of their superiors mind and was prepared to discharge his own duty in the most silent and rapid manner in his power all the others present felt more or less of this same influence of an established character  mr bunting said sir gervaise when the distance between the plantagenet and le t√©m√©raire the leading french vessel might have been about a league allowing for the difference in the respective lines of sailingmr bunting bend on the signal for the ships to go to quarters we may as well be ready for any turn of the dice  no one dared to comment on this order it was obeyed in readiness and silence  signal ready sir gervaise said bunting the instant the last flag was in its place  run it up at once sir and have a bright lookout for the answers captain greenly go to quarters and see all clear on the maindeck to use the batteries if wanted the people can stand fast below as i think it might be dangerous to open the ports  captain greenly passed off the poop to the quarterdeck and in a minute the drum and fife struck up the air which is known all over the civilized world as the call to arms in most services this summons is made by the drum alone which emits sounds to which the fancy has attached peculiar words those of the soldiers of france being prend ton sacprend ton sacprend ton sac no bad representatives of the meaning but in english and american ships this appeal is usually made in company with the notes of the earpiercing fife which gives it a melody that might otherwise be wanting  signal answered throughout the fleet sir gervaise said bunting  no answer was given to this report beyond a quiet inclination of the head after a moments pause however the viceadmiral turned to his signal officer and said  i should think bunting no captain can need an order to tell him not to open his leelowerdeck ports in such a sea as this  i rather fancy not sir gervaise answered bunting looking drolly at the boiling element that gushed up each minute from beneath the bottom of the ship in a way to appear as high as the hammockcloths the people at the maindeck guns would have rather a wet time of it  bend on the signal sir for the ships astern to keep in the viceadmirals wake young gentleman to the midshipman who always acted as his aid in battle tell captain greenly i desire to see him as soon as he has received all the reports  down to the moment when the first tap of the drum was heard the plantagenet had presented a scene of singular quiet and unconcern considering the circumstances in which she was placed a landsman would scarcely credit that men could be so near their enemies and display so much indifference to their vicinity but this was the result of long habit and a certain marine instinct that tells the sailor when any thing serious is in the wind and when not the difference in the force of the two fleets the heavy gale and the weatherly position of the english all conspired to assure the crew that nothing decisive could yet occur here and there an officer or an old seaman might be seen glancing through a port to ascertain the force and position of the french but on the whole their fleet excited little more attention than if lying at anchor in cherbourg the breakfast hour was approaching and that important event monopolized the principal interest of the moment the officers boys in particular began to make their appearance around the galley provided as usual with their pots and dishes and now and then one cast a careless glance through the nearest opening to see how the strangers looked but as to warfare there was much more the appearance of it between the protectors of the rights of the different messes than between the two great belligerent navies themselves  nor was the state of things materially different in the gunroom or cockpit or on the orlops most of the people of a twodecked ship are berthed on the lower gun deck and the order to clear ship is more necessary to a vessel of that construction before going to quarters seriously than to smaller craft though it is usual in all so long as the bags messchests and other similar appliances were left in their ordinary positions jack saw little reason to derange himself and as reports were brought below from time to time respecting the approach of the enemy and more especially of his being well to leeward few of those whose duty did not call them on deck troubled themselves about the matter at all this habit of considering his fortune as attached to that of his ship and of regarding himself as a point on her mass as we all look on ourselves as particles of the orb we accompany in its revolutions is sufficiently general among mariners but it was particularly so as respects the sailors of a fleet who were kept so much at sea and who had been so often with all sorts of results in the presence of the enemy the scene that was passing in the gunroom at the precise moment at which our tale has arrived was so characteristic in particular as to merit a brief description  all the idlers by this time were out of their berths and cotts the signs of those who slept in the country as it is termed or who were obliged for want of staterooms to sling in the common apartment having disappeared magrath was reading a treatise on medicine in good leyden latin by a lamp the purser was endeavouring to decipher his stewards hieroglyphics favoured by the same light and the captain of marines was examining the lock of an aged musket the third and fourth lieutenants were helping each other to untangle one of their bayofbiscay reckonings which had set both plane and spherical trigonometry at defiance by a lamp of their own and the chaplain was hurrying the steward and the boys along with the breakfasthis usual occupation at that witching time in the morning  while things were in this state the first lieutenant mr bury appeared in the gunroom his arrival caused one or two of the mess to glance upward at him though no one spoke but the junior lieutenant who being an honourable was at his ease with every one on board short of the captain  whats the news from deck bury asked this officer a youth of twenty his senior being a man ten years older is mr de vervillin thinking of running away yet  not he sir theres too much of the gamecock about him for that  ill warrant you he can crow but what is the news bury  the news is that the old planter is as wet as a washtub forward and i must have a dry jacketdo you hear there tom soundings turning to the master who just then came in from forward have you taken a look out of doors this morning  you know i seldom forget that mr bury a pretty pickle the ship would soon be in if i forgot to look about me  he swallowed the deepsea down in the bay cried the honourable laughing and goes every morning at daylight to look for it out at the bridleports  well then soundings what do you think of the third ship in the french line continued bury disregarding the levity of the youth did you ever see such topmasts as she carries before  i scarce ever saw a frenchman without them mr bury youd have just such sticks in this fleet if sir jarvy would stand them  ay but sir jarvy wont stand them the captain who sent such a stick up in his ship would have to throw it overboard before night i never saw such a pole in the air in my life  whats the matter with the mast mr bury put in magrath who kept up what he called constant scientific skirmishes with the elder seaofficers the junior being too inexperienced in his view to be worthy of a contest ill engage the spar is moulded and fashioned agreeably to the most approved pheelosphical principles for in that the french certainly excel us  who ever heard of moulding a spar interrupted soundings laughing loudly we mould a ships frame doctor but we lengthen and shorten and scrape and fid her masts  im answered as usual gentlemen and voted down i suppose by acclamation as they call it in other learned bodies i would advise no creature that has a reason to go to sea an instinct being all that is needed to make a lord high admiral of twenty tails  i should like sir jarvy to hear that my man of books cried the fourth who had satisfied himself that a book was not his own fortei fancy your instinct doctor will prevent you from whispering this in the viceadmirals ear  although magrath had a profound respect for the commanderinchief he was averse to giving in in a gunroom discussion his answer therefore partook of the feeling of the moment  sir gervaise he pronounced this word jairvis sir gervaise oakes honourable sir he said with a sneer may be a good seaman but hes no linguist now there he was ashore among the dead and dying just as ignorant of the meaning of filius nullius which is boys latin as if he had never seen a hornbook nevertheless gentlemen it is science and not even the classics that makes the man as for a creatures getting the sciences by instinct i shall contend it is against the possibilities whereas the attainment of what you call seamanship is among even the lesser probabilities  this is the most marineish talk i ever heard from your mouth doctor interrupted soundings how the devil can a man tell how to ware ship by instinct as you call it if one may ask the question  simply soundings because the process of ratiocination is dispensed with do you have to think in waring ship nowill put it to your own honour for the answer  thinki should be a poor creature for a master indeed if much thinking were wanting in so simple a matter as tacking or veering nonoyour real seadog has no occasion for much thinking when he has his work before him  thatll just be it gentlementhatll be just what im telling ye cried the doctor exulting in the success of his artifice not only will mr soundings not think when he has his ordinary duties to perform but he holds the process itself in merited contempt yell obsairve and so my theory is established by evidence of a pairty concerned which is more than a postulate logically requires  here magrath dropped his book and laughed with that sort of hissing sound that seems peculiar to the genus of which he formed a part he was still indulging in his triumph when the first tap of the drum was heard all listened every ear pricking like that of a deer that hears the hound when there followedrrrap taprrrap taprrrap tapataptaprapataparapatap arapatapataptap  instinct or reason sir jarvy is going to quarters exclaimed the honourable id no notion we were near enough to the monsieurs for that  now said magrath with a grinning sneer as he rose to descend to the cockpit therell may be arise an occasion for a little learning when ill promise ye all the science that can be mustered in my unworthy knowledge soundings i may have to heave the lead in the depths of your physical formation in which case ill just endeevour to avoid the breakers of ignorance  go to the devil or to the cockpit whichever you please sir answered the master ive served in six general actions already and have never been obliged to one of your kidney for so much as a bit of courtplaster or lint with me oakum answers for one and canvass for the other  while this was saying all hands were in motion the sea and marine officers looking for their sidearms the surgeon carefully collecting his books and the chaplain seizing a dish of cold beef that was hurriedly set upon a table carrying it down with him to his quarters by way of taking it out of harms way in a minute the gunroom was cleared of all who usually dwelt there and their places were supplied by the seamen who manned the three or four thirtytwos that were mounted in the apartment together with their opposites as the seaofficers in particular appeared among the men their faces assumed an air of authority and their voices were heard calling out the order to tumble up as they hastened themselves to their several stations  all this time sir gervaise oakes paced the poop bunting and the quartermaster were in readiness to hoist the new signal and greenly merely waited for the reports to join the commanderinchief in about five minutes after the drum had given its first tap these were completed and the captain ascended to the poop  by standing on on our present course captain greenly observed sir gervaise anxious to justify to himself the evolution he contemplated the rear of our line and the van of the french will be brought within fair range of shot from each other and by an accident we might lose a ship since any vessel that was crippled would necessarily sag directly down upon the enemy now i propose to keep away in the plantagenet and just brush past the leading french ships at about the distance the warspite will have to pass and so alter the face of matters a little what do you think would be the consequence of such a manoeuvre  that the van of our line and the van of the french will be brought as near together as you have just said must happen to the rear sir gervaise in any case  it does not require a mathematician to tell that much sir you will keep away as soon as bunting shows the signal and bring the wind abeam never mind the braces let them stand fast as soon as we have passed the french admiral i shall luff again this will cause us to lose a little of our weatherly position but about that i am very indifferent give the order sirbunting run up the signal  these commands were silently obeyed and presently the plantagenet was running directly in the troughs of the seas with quite double her former velocity the other ships answered promptly each keeping away as her second ahead came down to the proper line of sailing and all complying to the letter with an order that was very easy of execution the effect besides giving every prospect of a distant engagement was to straighten the line to nearly mathematical precision  is it your wish sir gervaise that we should endeavour to open our lee lower ports asked greenly unless we attempt something of the sort we shall have nothing heavier than the eighteens to depend on should monsieur de vervillin see fit to begin  and will he be any better offit would be next to madness to think of fighting the lowerdeck guns in such weather and we will keep all fast should the french commence the sport we shall have the advantage of being to windward and the loss of a few weather shrouds might bring down the best mast in their fleet  greenly made no answer though he perfectly understood that the loss of a mast would almost certainly ensure the loss of the ship did one of his own heavier spars go but this was sir gervaises greatest weakness as a commander and he knew it would be useless to attempt persuading him to suffer a single ship under his order to pass the enemy nearer than he went himself in the plantagenet this was what he called covering his ships though it amounted to no more than putting all of them in the jeopardy that happened to be unavoidable as regarded one or two  the comte de vervillin seemed at a loss to understand this sudden and extraordinary movement in the van of his enemy his signals followed and his crews went to their guns but it was not an easy matter for ships that persevered in hugging the wind to make any material alterations in their relative positions in such a gale the rate of sailing of the english however now menaced a speedy collision if collision were intended and it was time to be stirring in order to be ready for it  on the other hand all was quiet and seemingly deathlike in the english ships their people were at their quarters already and this is a moment of profound stillness in a vessel of war the lower ports being down the portions of the crews stationed on those decks were buried as it might be in obscurity while even those above were still partly concealed by the halfports there was virtually nothing for the sailtrimmers to do and every thing was apparently left to the evolutions of the vast machines themselves in which they floated sir gervaise greenly and the usual attendants still remained on the poop their eyes scarcely turning for an instant from the fleet of the enemy  by this time the plantagenct and le t√©m√©raire were little more than a mile apart each minute lessening this distance the latter ship was struggling along her bows plunging into the seas to the hawseholes while the former had a swift easy motion through the troughs and along the summits of the waves her flattened sails aiding in steadying her in the heavy lurches that unavoidably accompanied such a movement still a sea would occasionally break against her weather side sending its crest upward in a brilliant jetdeau and leaving tons of water on the decks sir gervaises manner had now lost every glimmering of excitement when he spoke it was in a gentle pleasant tone such as a gentleman might use in the society of women the truth was all his energy had concentrated in the determination to do a daring deed and as is not unusual with the most resolute men the nearer he approached to the consummation of his purpose the more he seemed to reject all the spurious aids of manner  the french do not open their lower ports greenly observed the viceadmiral dropping the glass after one of his long looks at the enemy although they have the advantage of being to leeward i take that to be a sign they intend nothing very serious  we shall know better five minutes hence sir gervaise this ship slides along like a london coach  his line is lubberly after all greenly look at those two ships asternthey are near half a mile to windward of the rest of the fleet and at least half a mile astern hey greenly  the captain turned towards the rear of the french and examined the positions of the two ships mentioned with sufficient deliberation but sir gervaise dropped his head in a musing manner and began to pace the poop again once or twice he stopped to look at the rear of the french line then distant from him quite a league and as often did he resume his walk  bunting said the viceadmiral mildly come this way a moment our last signal was to keep in the commanderinchiefs wake and to follow his motions  it was sir gervaise the old order to follow motions with or without signals as one might say  bend on the signals to close up in line as near as safe and to carry sail by the flagship  ay ay sir gervaisewell have em both up in five minutes sir  the commanderinchief now even seemed pleased his physical excitement returned a little and a smile struggled round his lip his eye glanced at greenly to see if he were suspected and then all his calmness of exterior returned in the mean time the signals were made and answered the latter circumstance was reported to sir gervaise who cast his eyes down the line astern and saw that the different ships were already bracing in and easing off their sheets in order to diminish the spaces between the different vessels as soon as it was apparent that the carnatic was drawing ahead captain greenly was told to lay his main and foreyards nearly square to light up all his staysail sheets and to keep away sufficiently to make every thing draw although these orders occasioned surprise they were implicitly obeyed  the moment of meeting had now come in consequence of having kept away so much the plantagenet could not be quite threefourths of a mile on the weatherbow of le t√©m√©raire coming up rapidly and threatening a semitransverse fire in order to prevent this the french ship edged off a little giving herself an easier and more rapid movement through the water and bringing her own broadside more fairly to the shock this evolution was followed by the two next ships a little prematurely perhaps but the admiral in le foudroyant disdaining to edge off from her enemy kept her luff the ships astern were governed by the course of their superior this change produced a little disorder in the van of the french menacing still greater unless one party or the other receded from the course taken but time pressed and the two fleets were closing so fast as to induce other thoughts  theres lubberly work for you greenly said sir gervaise smiling a commanderinchief heading up with the bowlines dragged and his second and third aheadnot to say fourthrunning off with the wind abeam now if we can knock the comte off a couple of points in passing all his fellows astern will follow and the warspite and blenheim and thunderer will slip by like girls in a countrydance send bury down to the maindeck with orders to be ready with those eighteens  greenly obeyed of course and he began to think better of audacity in naval warfare than he had done before that day this was the usual course of things with these two officers one arguing and deciding according to the dictates of a cool judgment and the other following his impulses quite as much as any thing else until facts supervened to prove that human things are as much controlled by adventitious agencies the results of remote and unseen causes as by any welldigested plans laid at the moment in their cooler hours when they came to reason on the past the viceadmiral generally consummated his triumphs by reminding his captain that if he had not been in the way of luck he never could have profited by it no bad creed for a naval officer who is otherwise prudent and vigilant  the quartermasters of the fleet were just striking six bells or proclaiming that it was seven oclock in the morning watch as the plantagenet and le t√©m√©raire came abeam of each other both ships lurched heavily in the troughs of the seas and both rolled to windward in stately majesty and yet both slid through the brine with a momentum that resembled the imperceptible motion of a planet the water rolled back from their black sides and shining hammockcloths and all the other dark panoply that distinguishes a shipofwar glistened with the spray but no sign of hostility proceeded from either the french admiral made no signal to engage and sir gervaise had reasons of his own for wishing to pass the enemys van if possible unnoticed minute passed after minute in breathless silence on board the plantagenet and the carnatic the latter vessel being now but half a cableslength astern of the admiral every eye that had any outlet for such a purpose was riveted on the maindeck ports of le t√©m√©raire in expectation of seeing the fire issue from her guns each instant however lessened the chances as regarded that particular vessel which was soon out of the line of fire from the plantagenet when the same scene was to follow with the same result in connection with le conquereur the second ship of the french line sir gervaise smiled as he passed the three first ships seemingly unnoticed but as he drew nearer to the admiral he felt confident this impunity must cease  what they mean by it all greenly he observed to his companion is more than i can say but we will go nearer and try to find out keep her away a little more sir keep her away half a point greenly was not disposed to remonstrate now for his prudent temperament was yielding to the excitement of the moment just reversing the traits of sir gervaises character the one losing his extreme discretion in feeling as the other gained by the pressure of circumstances the helm was eased a little and the ship sheered nearer to le foudroyant  as is usual in all services the french commanderinchief was in one of the best vessels of his fleet not only was the foudroyant a heavy ship carrying french fortytwos below a circumstance that made her rate as an eighty but like the plantagenet she was one of the fastest and most weatherly vessels of her class known by hugging the wind this noble vessel had got by this time materially to windward of her second and third ahead and had increased her distance essentially from her supports astern in a word she was far from being in a position to be sustained as she ought to be unless she edged off herself a movement that no one on board her seemed to contemplate  hes a noble fellow greenly that comte de vervillin murmured sir gervaise in a tone of admiration and so have i always found him and so have i always reported him too the fools about the gazettes and the knaves about the offices may splutter as they will mr de vervillin would give them plenty of occupation were they here i question if he mean to keep off in the least but insists on holding every inch he can gain  the next moment however satisfied sir gervaise that he was mistaken in his last conjecture the bows of the foudroyant gradually falling off until the line of her larboard guns bore when she made a general discharge of the whole of them with the exception of those on the lower deck the plantagenets waited until the ship rose on a sea and then they returned the compliment in the same manner the carnatics side showed a sheet of flame immediately after and the achilles lord morganic luffing briskly to the wind so as to bring her guns to bear followed up the game like flashes of lightning all three of these ships had directed their fire at le foudroyant and the smoke had not yet driven from among her spars when sir gervaise perceived that all three of her topmasts were hanging to leeward at this sight greenly fairly sprang from the deck and gave three cheers the men below caught up the cry even to those who were in a manner buried on the lower deck and presently spite of the gale the carnatics were heard following their example astern at this instant the whole french and english lines opened their fire from van to rear as far as their guns would bear or the shot tell  now sir now is our time to close with de vervillin exclaimed greenly the instant he perceived the manner in which his ship was crippled in our close order we might hope to make a thorough wreck of him  not so greenly returned sir gervaise calmly you see he edges away already and will be down among his other ships in five minutes we should have a general action with twice our force what is done is well done and we will let it stand it is something to have dismasted the enemys commanderinchief do you look to it that the enemy dont do the same with ours i heard shot rattling aloft and every thing now bears a hard strain  greenly went to look after his duty while sir gervaise continued to pace the poop the whole of le foudroyants fire had been directed at the plantagenet but so rough was the ocean that not a shot touched the hull a little injury had been done aloft but nothing that the ready skill of the seamen was not able to repair even in that rough weather the fact is most of the shot had touched the waves and had flown off from their varying surfaces at every angle that offered one of the secrets that sir gervaise had taught his captains was to avoid hitting the surface of the sea if possible unless that surface was reasonably smooth and the object intended to be injured was near at hand then the french admiral received the first firealways the most destructiveof three fresh vessels and his injuries were in proportion  the scene was now animated and not without a wild magnificence the gale continued as heavy as ever and with the raging of the ocean and the howling of the winds mingled the roar of artillery and the smoky canopy of battle still the destruction on neither side bore any proportion to the grandeur of the accompaniments the distance and the unsteadiness of the ships preventing much accuracy of aim in that day a large twodecked ship never carried heavier metal than an eighteen above her lower batteries and this gun efficient as it is on most occasions does not bring with it the fearful destruction that attends a more modern broadside there was a good deal of noise notwithstanding and some blood shed in passing but on the whole when the warspite the last of the english ships ceased her fire on account of the distance of the enemy abreast of her it would have been difficult to tell that any vessel but le foudroyant had been doing more than saluting at this instant greenly reappeared on the poop his own ship having ceased to fire for several minutes  well greenly the maindeck guns are at least scaled said sir gervaise smiling and that is not to be done over again for some time you keep every thing ready in the batteries i trust  we are all ready sir gervaise but there is nothing to be done it would be useless to waste our ammunition at ships quite two miles under our lee  very truevery true sir but all the frenchmen are not quite so far to leeward greenly as you may see by looking ahead yonder two at least are not absolutely out of harms way  greenly turned gazed an instant in the direction in which the commanderinchief pointed and then the truth of what sir gervaise had really in view in keeping away flashed on his mind as it might be at a glance without saying a word he immediately quitted the poop and descending even to the lower deck passed through the whole of his batteries giving his orders and examining their condition     chapter xxiii      by heaven it is a splendid sight to see       for one who hath no friend nor brother there     their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery       their various arms that glitter in the air           childe harold   the little conflict between the english ships and the head of the french line the evolutions that had grown out of it the crippling of le foudroyant and the continuance of the gale contributed to produce material changes in the relative positions of the two fleets all the english vessels kept their stations with beautiful accuracy still running to the southward in a close line ahead having the wind a trifle abaft the beam with their yards braced in under the circumstances it needed but some seven or eight minutes for these ships to glide a mile through the troubled ocean and this was about the period the most exposed of them all had been under the random and slow fire that the state of the weather permitted the trifling damages sustained were already repaired or in a way soon to be so on the other hand considerable disorder prevailed among the french their line had never been perfect extending quite a league a few of the leading vessels or those near the commanderinchief sustaining each other as well as could be desired while long intervals existed between the ships astern among the latter too as has been stated some were much farther to windward than the others an irregularity that proceeded from a desire of the comte to luff up as near as possible to the enemya desire which practised on necessarily threw the least weatherly vessels to leeward thus the two ships in the extreme rear as has been hinted at already being jammed up unusually hard upon the wind had weathered materially on their consorts while their way through the water had been proportionably less it was these combined circumstances which brought them so far astern and to windward  at the time sir gervaise pointed out their positions to greenly the two vessels just mentioned were quite half a mile to the westward of their nearest consort and more than that distance to the southward when it is remembered that the wind was nearly due west and that all the french vessels these two excepted were steering north the relative positions of the latter will be understood le foudroyant too had kept away after the loss of her topmasts until fairly in the wake of the ships ahead of her in her own line and as the vessels had been running off with the wind abeam for several minutes this manoeuvre threw the french still farther to leeward to make the matter worse just as the warspite drew out of the range of shot from the french m de vervillin showed a signal at the end of his gaff for his whole fleet to ware in succession an order which while it certainly had a gallant semblance as it was bringing his vessels round on the same tack as his enemy and looked like a defiance was singularly adapted to restoring to the latter all the advantage of the wind they had lost by keeping away as it was necessary to take room to execute this evolution in order to clear the ships that were now crowded in the van when le t√©m√©raire came to the wind again on the starboard tack she was fully half a mile to leeward of the admiral who had just put his helm up as a matter of course in order to form anew with the heads of the ships to the southward each vessel had to get into her leaders wake which would be virtually throwing the whole french line again two miles to leeward of the english nevertheless the stragglers in the rear of the french continued to hug the wind with a pertinacity that denoted a resolution to have a brush with their enemies in passing the vessels were le scipion and la victoire each of seventyfour guns the first of these ships was commanded by a young man of very little professional experience but of high court influence while the second had a captain who like old parker had worked his way up to his present station through great difficulties and by dint of hard knocks and harder work unfortunately the first ranked and the humble capitaine de fr√©gate placed by accident in command of a ship of the line did not dare to desert a capitaine de vaisseau who had a duc for an elder brother and called himself comte there was perhaps a redeeming gallantry in the spirit which determined the comte de ch√©lincourt to incur the risk of passing so near six vessels with only two that might throw a veil over the indiscretion more especially as his own fleet was near enough to support him in the event of any disaster and it was certainly possible that the loss of a material spar on board either of his foes might induce the capture of the vessel at all events thus reasoned m de ch√©lincourt who continued boldly on with his larboard tacks aboard always hugging the wind even after the t√©m√©raire was round and m comptant chose to follow him in la victoire the plantagenet by this time being not a mile distant from the scipio coming on with steady velocity these intentions and circumstances created every human probability that she would soon be passing her weather beam within a quarter of a mile and consequently that a cannonade far more serious than what had yet occurred must follow the few intervening minutes gave sir gervaise time to throw a glance around him and to come to his final decision  the english fleet was never in better line than at that precise moment the ships were as close to each other as comported with safety and every thing stood and drew as in the trade winds the leading french vessels were waring and increasing their distance to leeward and it would require an hour for them to get up near enough to be at all dangerous in such weather while all the rest were following regardless of the two that continued their luff the chloe had already got round and hugging the wind was actually coming up to windward of her own line though under a press of canvass that nearly buried her the active and driver were in their stations as usual one on the weather beam and the other on the weather bow while the druid had got so near as to show her hull closing fast with square yards  that is either a very bold or a very obstinate fellow he who commands the two ships ahead of us observed greenly as he stood at the viceadmirals side and just as the latter terminated his survey what object can he possibly have in braving three times his force in a gale like this  if it were an englishman greenly we should call him a hero by taking a mast out of one of us he might cause the loss of the ship or compel us to engage double our force do not blame him but help me rather to disappoint him now listen and see all done immediately  sir gervaise then explained to the captain what his intentions really were first ordering himself a very unusual course for one of his habits the first lieutenant to keep the ship off as much as practicable without seeming to wish to do so but as the orders will be explained incidentally in the course of the narrative it is not necessary to give them here greenly then went below leaving sir gervaise bunting and their auxiliaries in possession of the poop a private signal had been bent on some little time and it was now hoisted in about five minutes it was read understood and answered by all the ships of the fleet sir gervaise rubbed his hands like a man who was delighted and he beckoned to bury who had the trumpet on the quarterdeck to join him on the poop  did captain greenly let you into our plot bury asked the viceadmiral in high goodhumour as soon as obeyed i saw he spoke to you in going below  he only told me sir gervaise to edge down upon the frenchmen as close as i could and this we are doing i think as fast as mounsheerbury was an anglogallicanwill at all like  ah there old parker sheers bravely to leeward trust to him to be in the right place the carnatic went fifty fathoms out of the line at that one twist the thunderer and warspite too never was a signal more beautifully obeyed if the frenchmen dont take the alarm now every thing will be to our minds  by this time bury began to understand the manoeuvre each alternate ship of the english was sheering fast to leeward forming a weather and a lee line with increased intervals between the vessels while all of them were edging rapidly away so as greatly to near the enemy it was apparent now indeed that the plantagenet herself must pass within a hundred fathoms of the scipio and that in less than two minutes the delay in issuing the orders for this evolution was in favour of its success inasmuch as it did not give the enemy time for deliberation the comte de ch√©lincourt in fact did not detect it or at least did not foresee the consequences though both were quite apparent to the more experienced capitaine de fr√©gate astern it was too late or the latter would have signalled his superior to put him on his guard but as things were there remained no alternative apparently but to run the gauntlet and trust all to the chances of battle  in a moment like that we are describing events occur much more rapidly than they can be related the plantagenet was now within pistolshot of le scipion and on her weather bow at that precise instant when the bowguns on both sides began to play the carnatic then nearly in a line with the enemy made a rank sheer to leeward and drove on opening in the very act with her weatherbow guns the thunderer and warspite imitated this manoeuvre leaving the frenchman the cheerless prospect of being attacked on both sides it is not to be concealed that m de ch√©lincourt was considerably disturbed by this sudden change in his situation that which an instant before had the prospect of being a chivalrous but extremely hazardous passage in front of a formidable enemy now began to assume the appearance of something very like destruction it was too late however to remedy the evil and the young comte as brave a man as existed determined to face it manfully he had scarcely time to utter a few cheering sentiments in a dramatic manner to those on the quarterdeck when the english flagship came sweeping past in a cloud of smoke and a blaze of fire his own broadside was nobly returned or as much of it as the weather permitted but the smoke of both discharges was still driving between his masts when the dark hamper of the carnatic glided into the drifting canopy which was made to whirl back on the devoted frenchman in another torrent of flame three times was this fearful assault renewed on the scipio at intervals of about a minute the iron hurricane first coming from to windward and then seeming to be driven back from to leeward as by its own rebound leaving no breathing time to meet it the effect was completely to silence her own fire for what between the power of the raging elements and the destruction of the shot a species of wild and bloodfraught confusion took the place of system and order her decks were covered with killed and wounded among the latter of whom was the comte de ch√©lincourt while orders were given and countermanded in a way to render them useless if not incoherent from the time when the plantagenet fired her first gun to that when the warspite fired her last was just five minutes by the watch it seemed an hour to the french and but a moment to their enemies one hundred and eightytwo men and boys were included in the casualties of those teeming moments on board the scipio alone and when that ship issued slowly from the scene of havoc more by the velocity of her assailants in passing than by her own the foremast was all that stood the remainder of her spars dragging under her lee to cut the last adrift and to run off nearly before the wind in order to save the spars forward and to get within the cover of her own fleet was all that could now be done it may as well be said here that these two objects were effected  the plantagenet had received damage from the fire of her opponent some ten or fifteen men were killed and wounded her maintopsail was split by a shot from clew to earing one of the quartermasters was carried from the poop literally dragged overboard by the sinews that connected head and body and several of the spars with a good deal of rigging required to be looked to on account of injuries but no one thought of these things except as they were connected with present and pressing duties sir gervaise got a sight of la victoire some hundred and twenty fathoms ahead just as the roar of the carnatics guns was rushing upon his ears the french commander saw and understood the extreme jeopardy of his consort and he had already put his helm hard up  starboardstarboard hard bury shouted sir gervaise from the poop damn him run him aboard if he dare hold on long enough to meet us  the lieutenant signed with his hand that the order was understood and the helm being put up the ship went whirling off to leeward on the summit of a hill of foam a cheer was heard struggling in the tempest and glancing over his left shoulder sir gervaise perceived the carnatic shooting out of the smoke and imitating his own movement by making another and still ranker sheer to leeward at the same moment she set her mainsail closereefed as if determined to outstrip her antagonist and maintain her station none but a prime seaman could have done such a thing so steadily and so well in the midst of the wild haste and confusion of such a scene sir gervaise now not a hundred yards from the carnatic waved high his hat in exultation and praise and old parker alone on his own poop bared his grey hairs in acknowledgment of the compliment all this time the two ships drove madly ahead while the crash and roar of the battle was heard astern  the remaining french ship was well and nimbly handled as she came round she unavoidably sheered towards her enemies and sir gervaise found it necessary to countermand his last order and to come swiftly up to the wind both to avoid her raking broadside and to prevent running into his own consort but the carnatic having a little more room first kept off and then came to the wind again as soon as the frenchman had fired in a way to compel him to haul up on the other tack or to fall fairly aboard almost at the same instant the plantagenet closed on his weather quarter and raked parker had got abeam and pressing nearer he compelled la victoire to haul her bowlines bringing her completely between two fires spar went after spar and being left with nothing standing but the lower masts the plantagenet and carnatic could not prevent themselves from passing their victim though each shortened sail the first being already without a topsail their places however were immediately supplied by the achilles and the thunderer both ships having hauled down their staysails to lessen their way as the blenheim and warspite were quite near astern and an eighteenpound shot had closed the earthly career of the poor capitaine de fr√©gate his successor in command deemed it prudent to lower his ensign after a resistance that in its duration was unequal to the promise of its commencement still the ship had suffered materially and had fifty of her crew among the casualties his submission terminated the combat  sir gervaise oakes had now leisure and opportunity to look about him most of the french ships had got round but besides being quite as far astern when they should get up abeam supposing himself to remain where he was they would be at very long gunshot dead to leeward to remain where he was however formed no part of his plan for he was fully resolved to maintain all his advantages the great difficulty was to take possession of his prize the sea running so high as to render it questionable if a boat would live lord morganic however was just of an age and a temperament to bring that question to a speedy issue being on the weatherbeam of la victoire as her flag came down he ordered his own first lieutenant into the larger cutter and putting halfadozen marines with the proper crew into the boat it was soon seen dangling in the air over the cauldron of the ocean the oars onend to lower let go and unhook were the acts of an instant the oars fell and the boat was swept away to leeward a commanders commission depended on his success and daly made desperate efforts to obtain it the prize offered a lee and the french with a national benevolence courtesy and magnanimity that would scarcely have been imitated had matters been reversed threw ropes to their conquerors to help to rescue them from a very awkward dilemma the men did succeed in getting into the prize but the boat in the end was stove and lost  the appearance of the red flag of england the symbol of his own professional rank and worn by most under his own orders over the white ensign of france was the sign to sir gervaise that the prizeofficer was in possession he immediately made the signal for the fleet to follow the motions of the commanderinchief by this time his own mainsail closereefed had taken the place of the torn topsail and the plantagenet led off to the southward again as if nothing unusual had occurred daly had a quarter of an hour of extreme exertion on board the prize before he could get her fairly in motion as he desired but by dint of using the axe freely he cut the wreck adrift and soon had la victoire liberated from that incumbrance the foresail and fore and mizzen staysails were on the ship and the mainsail closereefed also was about to be set to drag herfrom the m√™l√©e of her foes when her ensign came down by getting the tack of the latter aboard and the sheet aft he would have all the canvass set the gale would allow and to this allessential point he directed his wits to ride down the maintack of a twodecked ship in a gale of wind or what fell little short of a real gale was not to be undertaken with twenty men the extent of dalys command and he had recourse to the assistance of his enemies a good natured facetious irishman himself with a smattering of french he soon got forty or fifty of the prisoners in a sufficient humour to lend their aid and the sail was set though not without great risk of its splitting from this moment la victoire was better off as respected the gale and keeping a weatherly position than any of the english ships inasmuch as she could carry all the canvass the wind permitted while she was relieved from the drift inseparable from hamper aloft the effect indeed was visible in the first hour to dalys great delight and exultation at the end of that period he found himself quite a cableslength to windward of the line but in relating this last particular events have been a little anticipated  greenly who had gone below to attend to the batteries which were not worked without great difficulty in so heavy a sea and to be in readiness to open the lower ports should occasion offer reappeared on deck just as the commanderinchief showed the signal for the ships to follow his own motions the line was soon formed as mentioned and ere long it became apparent that the prize could easily keep in her station as most of the day was still before him sir gervaise had little doubt of being able to secure the latter ere night should come to render it indispensable  the viceadmiral and his captain shook hands cordially on the poop and the former pointed out to the latter with honest exultation the result of his own bold manoeuvres  weve clipped the wings of two of them added sir gervaise and have fairly bagged a third my good friend and god willing when bluewater joins there will not be much difficulty with the remainder i cannot see that any of our vessels have suffered much and i set them all down as sound theres been time for a signal of inability that curse to an admirals evolutions but no one seems disposed to make it if we really escape that nuisance it will be the first instance in my life  halfadozen yards may be crippled and no one the worse for it in this heavy weather were we under a press of canvass it would be a different matter but now so long as the main sticks stand we shall probably do well enough i can find no injury in my own ship that may not be remedied at sea  and she has had the worst of it twas a decided thing greenly to engage such an odds in a gale but we owe our success most probably to the audacity of the attack had the enemy believed it possible it is probable he would have frustrated it well master galleygo im glad to see you unhurt what is your pleasure  why sir jarvy ive two opportunities as a body might say on the poop just now one is to shake hands as we always does ater a brush you knows sir and to look ater each others health and the other is to report a misfortin that will bear hard on this days dinner you see sir jarvy i had the dead poultry slung in a net over the live stock to be out of harms way well sir a shot cut the lanyard and let all the chickens down by the run in among the gunroom grunters and as they never half feeds them hanimals there isnt as much left of the birds as would make a meal for a sick young gentleman to my notion no one ought to have live stock but the commandersinchief  to the devil with you and the stock give me a shake of the hand and back into your tophow came you sir to quit your quarters without leave  i didnt sir jarvy seeing how things was a going on among the pigs for our top hoverlooks the awful scene i axed the young gentleman to let me come down to condole with your honour and as they always lets me do as i axes in such matters why down i come we has had one rattler in at our top howsever that came nigh lo clear us all out on it  is any spar injured asked sir gervaise quickly this must be looked tohey greenly  not to signify your honour not to signify one of them french eighteens aboard the prize just cocked its nose up as the ship lurched and let fly a round un and a grist of grape right into our faces i seed it coming and sung out scaldings and twas well i did we all ducked in time and the round un cleared every thing but a handful of the marbles are planted in the head of the mast making the spar look like a plumpudding or a fellow with the smallpox  enough of this you are excused from returning to the topand greenly beat the retreat bunting show the signal for the retreat from quarters let the ships pipe to breakfast if they will  this order affords a fair picture of the strange admixture of feelings and employments that characterize the ordinary life of a ship at one moment its inmates find themselves engaged in scenes of wild magnificence and fierce confusion while at the next they revert to the most familiar duties of humanity the crews of the whole fleet now retired from the guns and immediately after they were seated around their kids indulging ravenously in the food for which the exercise of the morning had given keen appetites still there was something of the sternness of battle in the merriment of this meal and the few jokes that passed were seasoned with a bitterness that is not usual among the lighthearted followers of the sea here and there a messmate was missed and the vacancy produced some quaint and even pathetic allusion to his habits or to the manner in which he met his death seamen usually treating the ravages of this great enemy of the race after the blow has been struck with as much solemnity and even tenderness as they regard his approaches with levity it is when spared themselves that they most regard the destruction of battle a mans standing in a ship too carries great weight with it at such times the loss of the quartermaster in particular being much regretted in the plantagenet this man messed with a portion of the petty officers a set of men altogether more thoughtful and grave than the body of the crew and who met when they assembled around their messchest that morning with a sobriety and even sternness of mien that showed how much in the management of the vessel had depended on their individual exertions several minutes elapsed in the particular mess of the dead man before a word was spoken all eating with appetites that were of proof but no one breaking the silence at length an old quartergunner named tom sponge who generally led the discourse said in a sort of halfinquiring halfregretting way  i suppose theres no great use in asking why jack glasss spoon is idle this morning they says them forecastle chaps that they seed his body streaming out over the starboard quarter as if it had been the fly of one of his own ensigns how was it ned you was thereaway and ought to know all about it  to be sure i does said ned who was buntings remaining assistant i was there as you says and seed as much of it as a man can see of what passes between a poor fellow and a shot when they comes together and that not in a very loving manner it happened just as we come upon the weather beam of that first chaphim as we winged so handsomely among us well sir jarvy had clapped a stopper on the signals seeing as we had got fairly into the smoke and jack and i was looking about us for the muskets not knowing but a chance might turn up to chuck a little lead into some of the parlywoos and so says jack says he ned yous got my musketas i had sure enoughand says he ned yous got my musket but no matter arter all as theyre much of a muchness so when hed said this he lets fly but whether he hit any body is more than i can say if he did twas likely a frenchman as he shot thataway now says jack says he ned as this is your musket you can load it and hand over mine and ill sheet home another of the bs well at that moment the frenchman lifted forard on a heavy swell and let drive at us with all his forecastle guns fired as it might be with one priming  that was bad gunnery growled tom sponge it racks a ship woundily  yes theyse no judgment in ships in general well them french twelves are spiteful guns and a little afore they fired it seemed to me i heard something give jack a rap on the check that sounded as if a fellows ear was boxed with a clap of thunder i looked up and there was jack streaming out like the fly of the ensign head foremost with the body towing after it by strings in the neck  i thought when a fellows head was shot off put in another quartermaster named ben barrel that the body was left in the ship while only the truck went  that comes of not seeing them things ben rejoined the eyewitness a fellows head is staid in its berth just like a ships mast theres forard and backstays and shrouds alls one as aboard here the only difference is that the lanyards are a little looser so as to give a man more play for his head than it might be safe to give to a mast when a fellow makes a bow why he only comes up a little aft and bowses on the forestay and now and then you falls in with a chap that is stayed altogether too far forard or whos got a list perhaps from having the shrouds set up too taut to port or to starboard  that sounds reasonable put in the quartergunner gravely ive seen such droggers myself  if youd been on the poop an hour or too ago youd ha seen more on it now theres all our marines their backstays have had a fresh pull since they were launched and as for their captain ill warrant you he had a luff upon luff  ive heard the carpenter overhauling them matters remarked sam wad another quartergunner and he chalked it all out by the square and compass it seems reasonable too  if youd seen jacks head dragging his body overboard just like the frenchman dragging his wreck under his lee youd ha thought it reasonable whats a fellows shoulders for but to give a spread to his shrouds which lead down the neck and are set up under the arms somewhere they says a great deal about the heart and i reckons its likely every thing is keyd there  harkee ned observed a quartermaster who knew little more than the mess generally if what you say is true why dont these shrouds lead straight from the head to the shoulders instead of being all tucked up under a skin in the neck answer me that now  who the devil ever saw a ships shrouds that wasnt catharpened in exclaimed ned with some heat a pretty hand a wife would make of it in pulling her arms around a fellows neck if the rigging spread in the way you mean them things is all settled according to reason when a chaps keels laid  this last argument seemed to dispose of the matter the discourse gradually turning on and confining itself to the merits of the deceased  sir gervaise had directed galleygo to prepare his breakfast as soon as the people were piped to their own but he was still detained on deck in consequence of a movement in one of his vessels to which it has now become necessary more particularly to recur  the appearance of the druid to the northward early in the morning will doubtless be remembered by the reader when near enough to have it made out this frigate had shown her number after which she rested satisfied with carrying sail much harder than any vessel in sight when the fleets engaged she made an effort to set the foretopsail closereefed but several of the critics in the other ships who occasionally noticed her movements fancied that some accident must have befallen her as the canvass was soon taken in and she appeared disposed to remain content with the sail carried when first seen as this ship was materially to windward of the line and she was running the whole time a little free her velocity was much greater than that of the other vessels and by this time she had got so near that sir gervaise observed she was fairly abeam of the plantagenet and a little to leeward of the active of course her hull even to the bottom as she rose on a sea was plainly visible and such of her people as were in the tops and rigging could be easily distinguished by the naked eye  the druid must have some communication for us from the other division of the fleet observed the viceadmiral to his signalofficer as they stood watching the movements of the frigate it is a little extraordinary blewet does not signal look at the book and find me a question to put that will ask his errand  bunting was in the act of turning over the leaves of his little vocabulary of questions and answers when three or four dark balls that sir gervaise by the aid of the glass saw suspended between the frigates masts opened into flags effectually proving that blewet was not absolutely asleep  four hundred and sixteen ordinary communication observed the viceadmiral with his eye still at the glass look up that bunting and let us know what it means  the commanderinchiefwish to speak him read bunting in the customary formal manner in which he announced the purport of a signal  very wellanswer then make the druids number to come within hail the fellow has got cloth enough spread to travel two feet to our one let him edge away and come under our lee speaking will be rather close work today  i doubt if a ship can come near enough to make herself heard returned the other though the second lieutenant of that ship never uses a trumpet in the heaviest weather they tell me sir our gents say his father was a towncrier and that he has inherited the family estate  ay our gents are a set of saucy fellows as is usually the case when there isnt work enough aboard  you should make a little allowance sir gervaise for being in the ship of a successful commanderinchief that makes us all carry weatherhelms among the other messes  up with your signal sir up with your signal i shall be obliged to order greenly to put you upon watchandwatch for a month in order to bring you down to the old level of manners  signal answered already sir gervaise by the way sir ill thank you to request captain greenly to give me another quartermaster its nimble work for us when there is any thing serious to do  you shall have him bunting returned the viceadmiral a shade passing over his face for the moment i had missed poor jack glass and from seeing a spot of blood on the poop guessed his fate i fancied indeed i heard a shot strike something behind me  it struck the poor fellows head sir and made a noise as if a butcher were felling an ox  wellwelllet us try to forget it until something can be done for his son who is one of the side boys ah theres blewet keeping away in earnest how the deuce he is to speak us however is more than i can tell  sir gervaise now sent a message to his captain to say that he desired his presence greenly soon appeared and was made acquainted with the intention of the druid as well as with the purport of the last signals by this time the rent maintopsail was mended and the captain suggested it should be set again closereefed as before and that the mainsail should be taken in this would lessen the plantagenets way which ship was sensibly drawing ahead of her consorts sir gervaise assenting the change was made and the effects were soon apparent not only in the movement of the ship but in her greater ease and steadiness of motion  it was not long before the druid was within a hundred fathoms of the flagship on her weatherquarter shoving the brine before her in a way to denote a fearful momentum it was evidently the intention of captain blewet to cross the plantagenets stern and to luff up under her lee quarter the safest point at which he could approach in so heavy a swell provided it were done with discretion captain blewet had a reputation for handling his frigate like a boat and the occasion was one which would be likely to awaken all his desire to sustain the character he had already earned still no one could imagine how he was to come near enough to make a communication of any length the stentorian lungs of the second lieutenant however might effect it and as the news of the expected hail passed through the ship many who had remained below in apathy while the enemy was close under their lee came on deck curious to witness what was about to pass  hey atwood exclaimed sir gervaise for the little excitement had brought the secretary up from the commanderinchiefs cabinwhat is blewet at the fellow cannot mean to set a studdingsail  he is running out a boom nevertheless sir gervaise or my thirty years experience of nautical things have been thrown away  he is truly rigging out his weather foretopmaststuddingsailboom sir added greenly in a tone of wonder  it is out rejoined the viceadmiral as one would give emphasis to the report of a calamity heywhat isnt that a man theyre running up to the end of it bunting level your glass and let us know at once  a glass is not necessary to make out that much sir gervaise it is a man beyond a doubt and there he hangs at the boomend as if sentenced by a general courtmartial  sir gervaise now suppressed every expression of surprise and his reserve was imitated quite as a matter of course by the twenty officers who by this time had assembled on the poop the druid keeping away approached rapidly and had soon crossed the flagships wake here she came by the wind and favoured by the momentum with which she had come down and the addition of the mainsail drew heavily but steadily up on her leequarter both vessels being closehauled it was not difficult steering and by watching the helms closely it would have been possible perhaps notwithstanding the heavy sea to have brought the two hulls within ten yards of each other and no harm should come of it this was nearer however than it was necessary to approach the studdingsailboom with the man suspended on the end of it projecting twice that distance beyond the vessels bows still it was nice work and while yet some thirty or forty feet from the perpendicular the man on the boomend made a sign for attention swung a coil of line he hold and when he saw hands raised to catch it he made a cast a lieutenant caught the rope and instantly hauled in the slack as the object was now understood a dozen others laid hold of the line and at a common signal when those on board the plantagenet hauled in strongly the people of the druid lowered away by this simple but united movement the man descended obliquely leaping out of the bowline in which he had sat and casting the whip adrift shaking himself to gain his footing he raised his cap and bowed to sir gervaise who now saw wycherly wychecombe on his poop     chapter xxiv      yet weep not thouthe struggle is not oer     o victors of philippi many a field     hath yielded palms to usone effort more     by one stern conflict must our fate be sealed           mrs hemans   as soon as the people of the plantagenet who had so far trespassed on discipline when they perceived a man hanging at the end of the studdingsailboom as to appear in the rigging on the booms and on the guns to watch the result saw the stranger safely landed on the poop they lifted their hats and caps and as one voice greeted him with three cheers the officers smiled at this outbreak of feeling and the violation of usage was forgotten the rigid discipline of a manofwar even giving way occasionally to the sudden impulses of natural feeling  as the druid approached the flagship captain blewet had appeared in her weather mizzenrigging conning his vessel in person and the order to luff or keep off had been given by his own voice or by a gesture of his own hand as soon as he saw wycherlys feet on the poop of the plantagenet and his active form freed from the doublebowline in which it had been seated the captain made a wide sweep of the arm to denote his desire to edge away the helm of the frigate was borne up hard and as the twodecker surged ahead on the bosom of a sea the druids bows were knocked off to leeward leaving a space of about a hundred feet or more between the two ships as it might be in an instant the same causes continuing to operate the plantagenet drove still farther ahead while the frigate soon came to the wind again a cableslength to leeward and abreast of the space between the admiral and his second astern here captain blewet seemed disposed to wait for further orders  sir gervaise oakes was not accustomed to betray any surprise he might feel at little events that occurred on duty he returned the bow of wycherly coolly and then without question or play of feature turned his eyes on the further movements of the druid satisfied that all was right with the frigate he directed the messenger to follow him and went below himself leaving wycherly to obey as fast as the many inquiries he had to answer as he descended the ladders would allow atwood an interested observer of what had passed noted that captain greenly of all present was the only person who seemed indifferent to the nature of the communication the stranger might bring though perhaps the only one entitled by rank to put an interrogatory  you have come aboard of us in a novel and extraordinary mode sir wycherly wychecombe observed the viceadmiral a little severely as soon as he found himself in his own cabin alone with the lieutenant  it was the plan of captain blewet sir and was really the only one that seemed likely to succeed for a boat could scarcely live i trust the success of the experiment and the nature of the communications i may bring will be thought sufficient excuses for the want of ceremony  it is the first time since the days of the conqueror i fancy that an english viceadmirals ship has been boarded so cavalierly but as you say the circumstances may justify the innovation what is your errand sir  this letter i presume sir gervaise will explain itself i have little to say in addition except to report that the druid has sprung her foremast in carrying sail to close with you and that we have not lost a moment since admiral bluewater ordered us to part company with himself  you sailed on board the c√¶sar then asked sir gervaise a great deal mollified by the zeal for service in a youth situated ashore as he knew wycherly to be you left her with this letter  i did sir gervaise at admiral bluewaters command  did you go aboard the druid boomfashion or was that peculiar style reserved for the commanderinchief  i left the c√¶sar in a boat sir gervaise and though we were much nearer in with the coast where the wind has not the rake it has here and the strength of the gale had not then come we were nearly swamped  if a true virginian you would not have drowned wychecombe answered the viceadmiral in better humour you americans swim like cork excuse me while i read what admiral bluewater has to say  sir gervaise had received wycherly in the great cabin standing at the table which was lashed in its centre he would have been puzzled himself perhaps to have given the real reason why he motioned to the young man to take a chair while he went into what he called his drawingroom or the beautiful little apartment between the two staterooms aft which was fitted with an elegance that might have been admired in a more permanent dwelling and whither he always withdrew when disposed to reflection it was probably connected however with a latent apprehension of the rearadmirals political bias for when by himself he paused fully a minute before he opened the letter condemning this hesitation as unmanly he broke the seal however and read the contents of a letter which was couched in the following terms       my dear oakessince we parted my mind has undergone some      violent misgivings as to the course duty requires of me in this      great crisis one handone heartone voice even may decide the      fate of england in such circumstances all should listen to the      voice of conscience and endeavour to foresee the consequences of      their own acts confidential agents are in the west of england and      one of them i have seen by his communications i find more depends      on myself than i could have imagined and more on the movements of      m de vervillin do not be too sanguinetake time for your own      decisions and grant me time for i feel like a wretch whose fate      must soon be sealed on no account engage because you think this      division near enough to sustain you but at least keep off until      you hear from me more positively or we can meet i find it equally      hard to strike a blow against my rightful prince or to desert my      friend for gods sake act prudently and depend on seeing me in      the course of the next twentyfour hours i shall keep well to the      eastward in the hope of falling in with you as i feel satisfied      de vervillin has nothing to do very far west i may send some      verbal message by the bearer for my thoughts come sluggishly and      with great reluctance       ever yours      richard bluewater  sir gervaise oakes read this letter twice with great deliberation then he crushed it in his hand as one would strangle a deadly serpent not satisfied with this manifestation of distaste he tore the letter into pieces so small as to render it impossible to imagine its contents opened a cabinwindow and threw the fragments into the ocean when he fancied that every sign of his friends weakness had thus been destroyed he began to pace the cabin in his usual manner wycherly heard his step and wondered at the delay but his duty compelled him to pass an uncomfortable halfhour in silence ere the door opened and sir gervaise appeared the latter had suppressed the signs of distress though the lieutenant could perceive he was unusually anxious  did the rearadmiral send any message sir wycherly inquired sir gervaise in his letter he would seem to refer me to some verbal explanations from yourself  i am ashamed to say sir none that i can render very intelligible admiral bluewater certainly did make a few communications that i was to repeat but when we had parted by some extraordinary dullness of my own i fear i find it is out of my power to give them any very great distinctness or connection  perhaps the fault is less your own sir than his bluewater is addicted to fits of absence of mind and then he has no reason to complain that others do not understand him for he does not always understand himself  sir gervaise said this with a little glee delighted at finding his friend had not committed himself to his messenger the latter however was less disposed to excuse himself by such a process inasmuch as he felt certain that the rearadmirals feelings were in the matter he communicated let the manner have been what it might  i do not think we can attribute any thing to admiral bluewaters absence of mind on this occasion sir answered wycherly with generous frankness his feelings appeared to be strongly enlisted in what he said it might have been owing to the strength of these feelings that he was a little obscure but it could not have been owing to indifference  i shall best understand the matter then by hearing what he did say sir  wycherly paused and endeavoured to recall what had passed in a way to make it intelligible  i was frequently told to caution you not to engage the french sir until the other division had closed and was ready to assist but really whether this was owing to some secret information that the rearadmiral had obtained or to a natural desire to have a share in the battle is more than i can say  each may have had its influence was any allusion made to secret intelligence that you name it  i never felt more cause to be ashamed of my own dullness than at this present moment sir gervaise oakes exclaimed wycherly who almost writhed under the awkwardness of his situation for he really began to suspect that his own personal grounds of unhappiness had induced him to forget some material part of his messagerecent events ashore had perhaps disqualified me for this duty  it is natural it should be so my young friend and as i am acquainted with them all you can rest satisfied with my indulgence  all nosir gervaise you know not halfbut i forget myself sir and beg your pardon  i have no wish to pry into your secrets sir wycherly wychecombe and we will drop the subject you may say however if the rearadmiral was in good spiritsas an english seaman is apt to be with the prospect of a great battle before him  i thought not sir gervaise admiral bluewater to me seemed sad if i may presume to mention italmost to tears i thought sir one or twice  poor dick mentally ejaculated the viceadmiral he never could have made up his mind to desert me without great anguish of soul was there any thing said speaking aloud about the fleet of m de vervillin  certainly a good deal sir and yet am i ashamed to say i scarce know what admiral bluewater appeared to think the comte de vervillin had no intention to strike a blow at any of our colonies and with this he seemed to connect the idea that there would be less necessity for our engaging him at all events i cannot be mistaken in his wish that you would keep off sir until he could close  ay and you see how instinctively i have answered to his wishes said sir gervaise smiling a little bitterly nevertheless had the rear of the fleet been up this morning sir wycherly it might have been a glorious day for england  it has been a glorious day as it is sir we in the druid saw it all and there was not one among us that did not exult in the name of englishman  what even to the virginian wychecombe rejoined sir gervaise greatly gratified with the natural commendation conveyed in the manner and words of the other and looking in a smiling friendly manner at the young man i was afraid the hits you got in devonshire might have induced you to separate your nationality from that of old england  even to the virginian sir gervaise you have been in the colonies sir and must know we do not merit all that we sometimes receive on this side of the atlantic the king has no subjects more loyal than those of america  i am fully aware of it my noble lad and have told the king as much with my own mouth but think no more of this if your old uncle did give you an occasional specimen of true john bullism he has left you an honourable title and a valuable estate i shall see that greenly finds a berth for you and you will consent to mess with me i hope i trust some time to see you at bowldero at present we will go on deck and if any thing that admiral bluewater has said should recur to your mind more distinctly you will not forget to let me know it  wycherly now bowed and left the cabin while sir gervaise sat down and wrote a note to greenly to request that he would look a little after the comfort of the young man the latter then went on deck in person although he endeavoured to shake off the painful doubts that beset him and to appear as cheerful as became an officer who had just performed a brilliant exploit the viceadmiral found it difficult to conceal the shock he had received from bluewaters communication certain as he felt of striking a decisive blow at the enemy could he be reinforced with the five ships of the rear division he would cheerfully forego the triumph of such additional success to be certain his friend did not intend to carry his disaffection to overt acts he found it hard to believe that a man like bluewater could really contemplate carrying off with him the ships he commanded yet he knew the authority his friend wielded over his captains and the possibility of such a step would painfully obtrude itself on his mind at moments when a man can persuade himself into all the nonsense connected with the jus divinum thought sir gervaise it is doing no great violence to common sense to persuade himself into all its usually admitted consequences then again would interpose his recollections of bluewaters integrity and simplicity of character to reassure him and give him more cheering hopes for the result finding himself thus vacillating between hope and dread the commanderinchief determined to drive the matter temporarily from his mind by bestowing his attention on the part of the fleet he had with him just as this wise resolution was formed both greenly and wycherly appeared on the poop  i am glad to see you with a hungry look greenly cried sir gervaise cheerfully here has galleygo just been to report his breakfast and as i know your cabin has not been put in order since the people left the guns i hope for the pleasure of your company sir wycherly my gallant young virginian here will take the third chair i trust and then our party will be complete  the two gentlemen assenting the viceadmiral was about to lead the way below when suddenly arresting his footsteps on the poopladder he said  did you not tell me wychecombe that the druid had sprung her foremast  badly i believe sir gervaise in the hounds captain blewet carried on his ship fearfully all night  ay hes a fearful fellow with spars that tom blewet i never felt certain of finding all the sticks in their places on turning out of a morning when he was with you as a lieutenant greenly how many jibbooms and topgallant yards did he cost us in that cruise off the cape of good hope by george it must have been a dozen at least  not quite as bad as that sir gervaise though he did expend two jibbooms and three topgallant yards for me captain blewet has a fast ship and he wishes people to know it  and he has sprung his foremast and he shall see i know it harkee bunting make the druids number to lie by the prize and when thats answered tell him to take charge of the frenchman and to wait for further orders ill send him to plymouth to get a new foremast and to see the stranger in by the way does any body know the name of the frenchmanhey greenly  i cannot tell you sir gervaise though some of our gentlemen think it is the ship that was the admirals second ahead in our brush off cape finisterre i am not of the same opinion however for that vessel had a billethead and this has a woman figurehead that looks a little like a minerva the french have a la minerve i think  not now greenly if this be she for she is ours here sir gervaise laughed heartily at his own humour and all near him joined in as a matter of course but la minerve has been a frigate time out of mind the goddess of wisdom has never been fool enough to get into a line of battle when she has had it in her power to prevent it  we thought the figurehead of the prize a venus as we passed her in the druid wycherly modestly observed  there is a way of knowing and it shall be tried when youve done with the druid bunting make the prizes signal to repeat her name by telegraph you know how to make a prizes number i suppose when she has none  i confess i do not sir gervaise answered bunting who had shown by his manner that he was at a loss having no number in our books one would be at a stand how to get at her sir  how would you do it young man asked sir gervaise who all this time was hanging on to the manrope of the poopladder let us see how well youve been taught sir  i believe it may be done in different modes sir gervaise wycherly answered without any appearance of triumph at his superior readiness but the simplest i know is to hoist the french flag under the english by way of saying for whom the signal is intended  do it bunting continued sir gervaise nodding his head as he descended the ladder and i warrant you daly will answer what sort of work he will make with the frenchmans flags is another matter i doubt too if he had the wit to carry one of our books with him in which case he will be at a loss to read our signal try him however bunting an irishman always has something to say though it be a bull  this order given sir gervaise descended to his cabin in half an hour the party was seated at table as quietly as if nothing unusual had occurred that day  the worst of these little brushes which lead to nothing is that they leave as strong a smell of gunpowder in your cabin greenly as if a whole fleet had been destroyed observed the viceadmiral goodhumouredly as he began to help his guests i hope the odour we have here will not disturb your appetites gentlemen  you do this days success injustice sir gervaise in calling it only a brush answered the captain who to say the truth had fallen to as heartily upon the delicacies of galleygo as if he had not eaten in twentyfour hours at any rate it has brushed the spars out of two of king louiss ships and one of them into our hands ay and in a certain sense into our pockets  quite true greenlyquite true but what would it have been if  the sudden manner in which the commanderinchief ceased speaking induced his companions to think that he had met with some accident in eating or drinking both looked earnestly at him as if to offer assistance he was pale in the face but he smiled and otherwise appeared at his ease  it is over gentlemen said sir gervaise gentlywell think no more of it  i sincerely hope youve not been hit sir said greenly ive known men hit who did not discover that they were hurt until some sudden weakness has betrayed it  i believe the french have let me off this time my good friendyes i think magrath will be plugging no shotholes in my hull for this affair sir wycherly those eggs are from your own estate galleygo having laid the manor under contribution for all sorts of good things try them greenly as coming from our friends property  sir wycherly is a lucky fellow in having an estate said the captain few officers of his rank can boast of such an advantage though now and then an old one is better off  that is true enoughhey greenly the army fetches up most of the fortunes for your rich fellows like good county quarters and county balls i was a younger brother when they sent me to sea but i became a baronet and a pretty warm one too while yet a reefer poor josselin died when i was only sixteen and at seventeen they made me an officer  ay and we like you all the better sir gervaise for not giving us up when the money came now lord morganic was a captain when he succeeded and we think much less of that  morganic remains in service to teach us how to stay topmasts and paint figureheads observed sir gervaise a little drily and yet the fellow handled his ship well today making much better weather of it than i feared he would be able to do  i hear we are likely to get another duke in the navy sir its not often we catch one of that high rank  sir gervaise cared much less for things of this sort than bluewater but he naturally cast a glance at the speaker as this was said as much as to ask whom he meant  they tell me sir that lord montresor the elder brother of the boy in the c√¶sar is in a bad way and lord geoffrey stands next to the succession i think there is too much stuff in him to quit us now he is almost fit to get his commission  true bluewater has that boy of high hopes and promise with him too answered sir gervaise in a musing manner unconscious of what he said god send he may not forget that among other things  i dont think rank makes any difference with admiral bluewater or captain stowel the nobles are worked up in their ship as well as the humblest reefer of them all here is bunting sir to tell us something  sir gervaise started from a fit of abstraction and turning he saw his signalofficer ready to report  the druid has answered properly sir gervaise and has already hauled up so close that i think she will luff through the line though it may be astern of the carnatic  and the prize bunting have you signalled the prize as i told you to do  yes sir and she has answered so properly that i make no question the prizeofficer took a book with him the telegraphic signal was answered like the other  well what does he say have you found out the name of the frenchman  thats the difficulty sir we are understood but mr daly has shown something aboard the prize that the quartermaster swears is a paddy  a paddywhat he hasnt had himself run up at a yardarm or stunsailboom end has hehey wychecombe dalys an irishman and has only to show himself to show a paddy  but this is a sort of an image of some kind or other sir gervaise and yet it isnt mr daly i rather think he hasnt the flags necessary for our words and has rigged out a sort of a woman to let us know his ships name for she has a woman figurehead you know sir  the devil he has well that will form an era in signals galleygo look out at the cabin window and let me know if you can see the prize from themwell sir whats the news  i sees her sir jarvy answered the steward and i sees her where no french ship as sails in company with british vessels has a right to be if shes a fathom your honour shes fifty to windward of our line quite out of her place as a body might say and onreasonable  thats owing to our having felled the forests of her masts mr galleygo every spar that is left helping to put her where she is that prize must be a weatherly ship though hey greenly she and her consort were well to windward of their own line or we could never have got em as we did these frenchmen do turn off a weatherly vessel now and then that we must all admit  yes sir jarvy put in galleygo who never let the conversation flag when he was invited to take a part in it yes sir jarvy and when theyve turned em off the stocks they turns em over to us commonly to sail em building a craft is one piece of knowledge and sailing her well is another  enough of your philosophy sirrah look and ascertain if there is any thing unusual to be seen hanging in the rigging of the prize unless you show more readiness ill send one of the bowlderos to help you  these bowlderos were the servants that sir gervaise brought with him from his house having been born on his estate and educated as domestics in his own or his fathers family and though long accustomed to a manofwar as their ambition never rose above their ordinary service the steward held them exceedingly cheap a severer punishment could not be offered him than to threaten to direct one of these common menials to do any duty that in the least pertained to the profession the present menace had the desired effect galleygo losing no time in critically examining the prizes rigging  i calls nothing extrornary in a frenchmans rigging sir jarvy answered the steward as soon as he felt sure of his fact their dockmen have idees of their own as to such things now there is summat hanging at the lee foreyardarm of that chap that looks as if it might be a topgallantstunsail made up to be sent aloft and set but which stopped when it got as high as it is on finding out that theres no hamper overhead to spread it to  thats it sir put in bunting mr daly has run his woman up to the foreyardarm like a pirate  woman repeated galleygodo you call that ere thingummee a woman mr buntin i calls it a bundle of flags made up to set if there was any thing to set em to  its nothing but an irish woman master galleygo as youll see for yourself if youll level this glass at it  ill do that office myself cried sir gervaise have you any curiosity gentlemen to read mr dalys signal galleygo open that weather window and clear away the books and writingdesk that we may have a look  the orders were immediately obeyed and the viceadmiral was soon seated examining the odd figure that was certainly hanging at the lee foreyardarm of the prize a perfect nondescript as regarded all nautical experience  hang me if i can make any thing of it greenly said sir gervaise after a long look do you take this seat and try your hand at an observation it resembles a sort of a woman sure enough  yes sir observed bunting with the earnestness of a man who felt his reputation involved in the issue i was certain that mr daly has run up the figure to let us know the name of the prize and that for want of a telegraphbook to signal the letters and so i made sure of what i was about before i took the liberty to come below and report  and pray what do you make of it bunting the figurehead might tell us better but that seems to be imperfect  the figurehead has lost all its bust and one arm by a shot said greenly turning the glass to the object named and i can tell mr daly that a part of the gammoning of his bowsprit is gone too that ship requires looking to sir gervaise shell have no foremast tomorrow morning if this wind stand another shot has raked the lower side of her foretop and carried away half the frame yes and theres been a fellow at work too  never mind the shotnever mind the shot greenly interrupted the viceadmiral a poor devil like him couldnt have six of us at him at once and expect to go shot free tell us something of the woman  well sir gervaise no doubt daly has hoisted her as a symbol ay no doubt the ship is the minerva after all for theres something on the head like a helmet  it never can be the minerva said the viceadmiral positively for she i feel certain is a frigate hand me the little book with a red cover bunting that near your hand it has a list of the enemys navy here it is la minerve 32 le capitaine de fr√©gate mondon built in 1733 old and dull that settles the minerva for this list is the last sent us by the admiralty  then it must be the pallas rejoined greenly for she wears a helmet too and i am certain there is not only a cap to resemble a helmet but a guernsey frock on the body to represent armour both minerva and pallas if i remember right wore armour  this is coming nearer to the pointhey greenly the viceadmiral innocently chimed in let us look and see if the pallas is a twodecker or not by george theres no such name on the list thats odd now that the french should have one of these goddesses and not the other  they never has any thing right sir jarvy galleygo thrust in by way of commentary on the viceadmirals and the captains classical lore and its surprising to me that they should have any goddess at all seeing that they has so little respect for religion in general  wycherly fidgeted but respect for his superiors kept him silent as for bunting twas all the same to him his father having been a purser in the navy and he himself educated altogether on board ship and this too a century since  it might not be amiss sir gervaise observed the captain to work this rule backwards and just look over the list until we find a twodecked ship that ought to have a woman figurehead which will greatly simplify the matter ive known difficult problems solved in that mode  the idea struck sir gervaise as a good one and he set about the execution of the project in good earnest just as he came to lh√©cate 64 an exclamation from greenly caught his attention and he inquired its cause  look for yourself sir gervaise unless my eyes are good for nothing daly is running a kedge up alongside of his woman  what a kedgeay that is intended for an anchor and it means hope every body knows that hope carries an anchorhey wychecombe upon my word daly shows ingenuity look for the hope in that list buntingyou will find the english names printed first in the end of the book  the hope or l esperance read the signalofficer 36 lee capitang dee frigate dee courtraii  a singledecked ship after all this affair is as bad as the dd nullus ashore there ill not be beaten in learning however by any frenchman who ever floated go below locker and desire doctor magrath to step up here if he is not occupied with the wounded he knows more latin than any man in the ship  yes sir jarvy but this is french you knows your honour and isnt as latin at all i expects shell turn out to have some name as no modest person wishes to use and we shall have to halter it  ay hes catted his anchor sure enough if the figure be not hope it must be faith or charity  no fear of them sir jarvy the french has no faith nor no charity no nor no bowels as any poor fellow knows as has ever been wrecked on their coast as once happened to me when a by i looks upon em as no better than so many heatheners and perhaps thats the name of the ship ive seed heatheners a hundred times sir jarvy in that sort of toggery  what man did you ever see a heathen with an anchorone that will weigh three hundred if it will weigh a pound  perhaps not your honour with a downright hanchor but with summat like a killog but thats no hanchor ater all but only a kedge catted hanchorfashion sir  here comes magrath to help us out of the difficulty and well propound the matter to him  the viceadmiral now explained the whole affair to the surgeon frankly admitting that the classics of the cabin were at fault and throwing himself on the gunroom for assistance magrath was not a little amused as he listened for this was one of his triumphs and he chuckled not a little at the dilemma of his superiors  well sir jairvis he answered ye might do warse than call a council o war on the matter but if its the name yell be wanting i can help ye to that without the aids of symbols and signs and hyeroglyphics of any sort as we crossed the vessels wake a couple of hours since i read it on her stern in letters of gold its la victoire or the victory a most unfortunate cognomen for an unlucky ship shes a french victory however yell remember gentlemen  that must be a mistake magrath for daly has shown an anchor yonder and victory carries no anchor  its hard to say veeceadmiral one mans victory being another mans defeat as for mr dalys image its just an irish goddess and allowances must be made for the country  sir gervaise laughed invited the gentlemen to help demolish the breakfast and sent orders on deck to hoist the answering flag at a later day daly when called on for an explanation asserted that the armour and helmet belonged to victory as a matter of course though he admitted that he had at first forgotten the anchor but when i did run it up they read it aboard the ould planter as if it had been just so much primmer     chapter xxv      theres beauty in the deep     the wave is bluer than the sky     and though the light shines bright on high     more softly do the seagems glow     that sparkle in the depths below     the rainbows tints are only made     when on the waters they are laid     and sun and moon most sweetly shine     upon the oceans level brine     theres beauty in the deep           brainard   as daly was the recognised jester of the fleet his extraordinary attempt to announce his vessels name was received as a characteristic joke and it served to laugh at until something better offered under the actual circumstances of the two squadrons however it was soon temporarily forgotten in graver things for few believed the collision that had already taken place was to satisfy a man of the known temperament of the commanderinchief as the junction of the rear division was the only thing wanting to bring on a general engagement as soon as the weather should moderate a little every ship had careful lookouts aloft sweeping the horizon constantly with glasses more particularly towards the east and northeast the gale broke about noon though the wind still continued fresh from the same quarter as before the sea began to go down however and at eight bells material changes had occurred in the situations of both fleets some of these it may be necessary to mention  the ship of the french admiral le foudroyant and le scipion had been received as it might be in the arms of their own fleet in the manner already mentioned and from this moment the movement of the whole force was in a measure regulated by that of these two crippled vessels the former ship by means of her lower sails might have continued to keep her station in the line so long as the gale lasted but the latter unavoidably fell off compelling her consorts to keep near or to abandon her to her fate m de vervillin preferred the latter course the consequences were that by the time the sun was in the zenith his line a good deal extended still and far from regular was quite three leagues to leeward of that of the english nor was this all at that important turn in the day sir gervaise oakes was enabled to make sail on all his ships setting the fore and mizzentopsails closereefed while la victoire a fast vessel was enabled to keep in company by carrying whole courses the french could not imitate this inasmuch as one of their crippled vessels had nothing standing but a foremast sir gervaise had ascertained before the distance became too great for such observations that the enemy was getting ready to send up new topmasts and the other necessary spars on board the admiral as well as jury lowermasts in le scipion though the sea would not yet permit any very positive demonstrations to be made towards such an improvement he laid his own plans for the approaching night accordingly determining not to worry his people or notify the enemy of his intentions by attempting any similar improvement in the immediate condition of his prize  about noon each ships number was made in succession and the question was put if she had sustained any material injury in the late conflict the answers were satisfactory in general though one or two of the vessels made such replies as induced the commanderinchief to resort to a still more direct mode of ascertaining the real condition of his fleet in order to effect this important object sir gervaise waited two hours longer for the double purpose of letting all the messes get through with their dinners and to permit the wind to abate and the sea to fall as both were now fast doing at the expiration of that time however he appeared on the poop summoning bunting to his customary duty  at 2 pm it blew a whole topsail breeze as it is called but the sea being still high and the ships closehauled the viceadmiral did not see fit to order any more sail perhaps he was also influenced by a desire not to increase his distance from the enemy it being a part of his plan to keep m de vervillin in plain sight so long as the day continued in order that he might have a tolerable idea of the position of his fleet during the hours of darkness his present intention was to cause his vessels to pass before him in review as a general orders his battalions to march past a station occupied by himself and staff with a view to judge by his own eye of their steadiness and appearance viceadmiral oakes was the only officer in the british navy who ever resorted to this practice but he did many things of which other men never dreamed and among the rest he did not hesitate to attack double his force when an occasion offered as has just been seen the officers of the fleet called these characteristic reviews sir jarvys fielddays finding a malicious pleasure in comparing any thing out of the common nautical track to some usage of the soldiers  bunting got his orders notwithstanding the jokes of the fleet and the necessary signals were made and the answers given captain greenly then received his verbal instructions when the commanderinchief went below to prepare himself for the approaching scene when sir gervaise reappeared on the poop he was in full uniform wearing the star of the bath as was usual with him on all solemn official occasions atwood and bunting were at his side while the bowlderos in their rich shoreliveries formed a group at hand captain greenly and his first lieutenant joined the party as soon as their duty with the ship was over on the opposite side of the poop the whole of the marines off guard were drawn up in triple lines with their officers at their head the ship herself had hauled up her mainsail hauled down all her staysails and lay with her maintopsail braced sharp aback with orders to the quartermaster to keep her little off the wind the object being to leave a little way through the water in order to prolong the expected interviews with these preparations the commanderinchief awaited the successive approach of his ships the sun for the first time in twentyfour hours making his appearance in a flood of brilliant summerlight as if purposely to grace the ceremony  the first ship that drew near the plantagenet was the carnatic as a matter of course she being the next in the line this vessel remarkable as the commanderinchief had observed for never being out of the way was not long in closing though as she luffed up on the admirals weatherquarter to pass to windward she let go all her topsail bowlines so as to deaden her way making a sort of halfboard this simple evolution as she righted her helm brought her about fifty yards to windward of the plantagenet past which ship she surged slowly but steadily the weather now permitting a conversation to be held at that distance and by means of trumpets with little or no effort of the voice  most of the officers of the carnatic were on her poop as she came sweeping up heavily casting her shadow on the plantagenets decks captain parker himself was standing near the ridgeropes his head uncovered and the grey hairs floating in the breeze the countenance of this simpleminded veteran was a little anxious for had he feared the enemy a tenth part as much as he stood in awe of his commanding officer he would have been totally unfit for his station now he glanced upward at his sails to see that all was right then as he drew nearer fathom by fathom as it might be he anxiously endeavoured to read the expression of the viceadmirals face  how do you do captain parker commenced sir gervaise with true trumpet formality making the customary salutation  how is sir gervaise oakes today i hope untouched in the late affair with the enemy  quite well i thank you sir has the carnatic received any serious injury in the battle  none to mention sir gervaise a rough scrape of the foremast but not enough to alarm us now the weather has moderated a little rigging cut and a couple of raps in the hull  have your people suffered sir  two killed and seven wounded sir gervaise good lads most of em but enough like em remain  i understand then captain parker that you report the carnatic fit for any service  as much so as my poor abilities enable me to make her sir gervaise oakes answered the other a little alarmed at the formality and precision of the question meet her with the helmmeet her with the helm  all this passed while the carnatic was making her halfboard and the helm being righted she now slowly and majestically fell off with her broadside to the admiral gathering way as her canvass began to draw again at this instant when the yardarms of the two ships were about a hundred feet asunder and just as the carnatic drew up fairly abeam sir gervaise oakes raised his hat stepped quickly to the side of the poop waved his hand for silence and spoke with a distinctness that rendered his words audible to all in both vessels  captain parker he said i wish publicly to thank you for your noble conduct this day i have always said a surer support could never follow a commanderinchief into battle you have more than proved my opinion to be true i wish publicly to thank you sir  sir gervaisei cannot expressgod bless you sir gervaise  i have but one fault to find with you sir and that is easily pardoned  im sure i hope so sir  you handled your ship so rapidly and so surely that we had hardly time to get out of the way of your guns  old parker could not now have answered had his life depended on it but he bowed and dashed a hand across his eyes there was but a moment to say any more  if his majestys sword be not laid on your shoulder for this days work sir it shall be no fault of mine added sir gervaise waving his hat in adieu  while this dialogue lasted so profound was the stillness in the two ships that the wash of the water under the bows of the carnatic was the only sound to interfere with sir gervaises clarion voice but the instant he ceased to speak the crews of both vessels rose as one man and cheered the officers joined heartily and to complete the compliment the commanderinchief ordered his own marines to present arms to the passing vessel then it was that every sail drawing again the carnatic took a sudden start and shot nearly her length ahead on the summit of a sea in half a minute more she was ahead of the plantagenets flyingjibboomend steering a little free so as not to throw the admiral to leeward  the carnatic was scarcely out of the way before the achilles was ready to take her place this ship having more room had easily luffed to windward of the plantagenet simply letting go her bowlines as her bows doubled on the admirals stern in order to check her way  how do you do today sir gervaise called out lord morganic without waiting for the commanderinchiefs hailallow me to congratulate you sir on the exploits of this glorious day  i thank you my lord and wish to say i am satisfied with the behaviour of your ship youve all done well and i desire to thank you all is the achilles injured  nothing to speak of sir a little rigging gone and here and there a stick  have you lost any men my lord i desire particularly to know the condition of each ship  some eight or ten poor fellows i believe sir gervaise but we are ready to engage this instant  it is well my lord steady your bowlines and make room for the thunderer  morganic gave the order but as his ship drew ahead he called out in a pertinacious wayi hope sir gervaise you dont mean to give that other lame duck up ive got my first lieutenant on board one of em and confess to a desire to put the second on board another  ayaymorganic we knock down the birds and you bag em ill give you more sport in the same way before ive done with ye  this little concession even sir gervaise oakes a man not accustomed to trifle in matters of duty saw fit to make to the others rank and the achilles withdrew from before the flagship as the curtain is drawn from before the scene  i do believe greenleaf observed lord morganic to his surgeon one of his indulged favourites that sir jarvy is a little jealous of us because daly got into the prize before he could send one of his own boats aboard of her twill tell well in the gazette too will it notthe french ship was taken possession of and brought off by the achilles captain the earl of morganic i hope the old fellow will have the decency to give us our due i rather think it was our last broadside that brought the colours down  a suitable answer was returned but as the ship is drawing ahead we cannot follow her to relate it the vessel that approached the third was the thunderer captain foley this was one of the ships that had received the fire of the three leading french vessels after they had brought the wind abeam and being the leading vessel of the english rear she had suffered more than any other of the british squadron the fact was apparent as she approached by the manner in which her rigging was knotted and the attention that had been paid to her spars even as she closed the men were on the yard bending a new maincourse the old one having been hit on the boltrope and torn nearly from the spar there were also several plugs on her leeside to mark the spots where the french guns had told  the usual greetings passed between the viceadmiral and his captain and the former put his questions  we have not been quite exchanging salutes sir gervaise answered captain foley but the ship is ready for service again should the wind moderate a little i think everything would stand to carry sail hard  im glad to hear it sirrejoiced to hear it sir i feared more for you than for any other vessel i hope youve not suffered materially in your crew  nine killed sir gervaise and the surgeon tells me sixteen wounded  that proves youve not been in port foley well i dare say could the truth be known it would be found that m de vervillins vessels bear your marks in revenge adieuadieugod bless you  the thunderer glided ahead making room for the blenheim captain sterling this was one of your serviceable ships without any show or style about her but a vessel that was always ready to give and take her commander was a regular seadog a little addicted to hard and outlandish oaths a great consumer of tobacco and brandy but who had the discrimination never to swear in the presence of the commanderinchief although he had been known to do so in a church or to drink more than he could well carry when he was in presence of an enemy or a gale of wind he was too firm a man and too good a seaman to use the bottle as a refuge it was the companion of his ease and pleasure and to confess the truth he then treated it with an affectionate benevolence that rendered it exceedingly difficult for others not to entertain some of his own partiality for it in a word captain sterling was a sailor of the old school for there was an old school in manners habits opinions philosophy morals and reason a century since precisely as there is today and probably will be a century hence  the blenheim made a good report not having sustained any serious injury whatever nor had she a man hurt the captain reported his ship as fit for service as she was the hour she lifted her anchor  so much the better sterlingso much the better you shall take the edge off the next affair by way of giving you another chance i rely on the blenheim and on her captain  i thank you sir returned sterling as his ship moved on by the way sir gervaise would it not be fairplay to rummage the prizes lockers before she gets into the hands of the customhouse out here on the high seas there can be no smuggling in that there must be good claret aboard her  there would be plunder of a prize sterling said the viceadmiral laughing for he knew that the question was put more as a joke than a serious proposition and that is death without benefit of clergy move on here is goodfellow close upon your heels  the last ship in the english line was the warspite captain goodfellow an officer remarkable in the service at that day for a religious turn as it was called as is usually the case with men of this stamp captain goodfellow was quiet thoughtful and attentive to his duty there was less of the real tar in him perhaps than in some of his companions but his ship was in good order always did her duty and was remarkably attentive to signals a circumstance that rendered her commander a marked favourite with the viceadmiral after the usual questions were put and answered sir gervaise informed goodfellow that he intended to change the order of sailing so as to bring him near the van  we will give old parker a breathing spell goodfellow added the commanderinchief and you will be my second astern i must go ahead of you all or youll be running down on the frenchman without orders pretending you cant see the signals in the smoke  the warspite drove ahead and the plantagenet was now left to receive the prize and the druid the chloe driver and active not being included in the signal daly had been gradually eating the other ships out of the wind as has been mentioned already and when the order was given to pass within hail he grumbled not a little at the necessity of losing so much of his vantageground nevertheless it would not do to joke with the commanderinchief in a matter of this sort and he was fain to haul up his courses and wait for the moment when he might close by the time the warspite was out of the way his ship had drifted down so near the admiral that he had nothing to do but to haul aboard his tacks again and pass as near as was at all desirable when quite near he hauled up his mainsail by order of the viceadmiral  are you much in want of any thing mr daly demanded sir gervaise as soon as the lieutenant appeared forward to meet his hail the sea is going down so fast that we might now send you some boats  many thanks sir gervaise i want to get rid of a hundred or two frenchmen and to have a hundred englishmen in their places we are but twentyone of the kings subjects here all told  captain blewet is ordered to keep company with you sir and as soon as it is dark i intend to send you into plymouth under the frigates convoy is she a nice ship hey daly  why sir gervaise shes like a piece of broken crockery just now and one cant tell all her merits shes not a bad goer and weatherly i think all will call her but shes thundering french inside  well make her english in due time sir how are the leaks do the pumps work freely  deuce the lake has she sir gervaise and the pumps suck like a nine months babby and if they didnt were scarce the boys to find out the contrary being but nineteen working hands  very well daly you can haul aboard your maintack now remember youre to go into plymouth as soon as it is dark if you see any thing of admiral bluewater tell him i rely on his support and only wait for his appearance to finish monsieur de vervillins job  ill do all that with hearty good will sir pray sir gervaise added daly grinning on the poop of the prize whither he had got by this time having walked aft as his ship went ahead how do you like french signals for want of a better we were driven to the classics  ay youd be bothered to explain all your own flags i fancy the name of the ship is the victory i am told why did you put her in armour and whip a kedge up against the poor woman  its according to the books sir gervaise every word of it out of cicero and cordairy and cornelius nepos and those sort of fellows oh i went to school sir before i went to sea as you say yourself sometimes sir gervaise and literature is the same in ireland as it is all over the world victory needs armour sir in order to be victorious and the anchor is to show that she doesnt belong to the cut and run family i am as sure that all was right as i ever was of my moods and tenses  very well daly answered sir gervaise laughingmy lords shall know your merits in that way and it may get you named a professorkeep your luff or youll be down on our spritsailyardremember and follow the druid  here the gentlemen waved their hands in adieu as usual and la victoire clipped as she was of her wings drew slowly past the druid succeeded and sir gervaise simply gave blewet his orders to see the prize into port and to look after his own foremast this ended the field day the frigate luffing up to windward of the line again leaving the plantagenet in its rear a few minutes later the latter ship filled and stood after her consorts  the viceadmiral having now ascertained in the most direct manner the actual condition of his fleet had data on which to form his plans for the future but for the letter from bluewater he would have been perfectly happy the success of the day having infused a spirit into the different vessels that of itself was a pledge of more important results still he determined to act as if that letter had never been written finding it impossible to believe that one who had so long been true could really fail him in the hour of need i know his heart better than he knows it himself he caught himself mentally exclaiming and before either of us is a day older this will i prove to him to his confusion and my triumph he had several short and broken conversations with wycherly in the course of the afternoon with a view to ascertain if possible the real frame of mind in which his friend had written but without success the young man frankly admitting that owing to a confusion of thought that he modestly attributed to himself but which sir gervaise well knew ought in justice to be imputed to bluewater he had not been able to bring away with him any very clear notions of the rearadmirals intentions  in the mean while the elements were beginning to exhibit another of their changeful humours a gale in summer is seldom of long duration and twentyfour hours would seem to be the period which nature had assigned to this the weather had moderated materially by the time the review had taken place and five hours later not only had the sea subsided to a very reasonable swell but the wind had hauled several points coming out a fresh topgallant breeze at northwest the french fleet wore soon after standing about northeastbynorth on an easy bowline they had been active in repairing damages and the admiral was all atanto again with every thing set that the other ships carried the plight of le scipion was not so easily remedied though even she had two jurymasts rigged assistance having been sent from the other vessels as soon as boats could safely pass as the sun hung in the western sky wanting about an hour of disappearing from one of the long summer days of that high latitude this ship set a mizzentopsail in the place of a main and a foretopgallantsail in lieu of a mizzentopsail thus equipped she was enabled to keep company with her consorts all of which were under easy canvass waiting for the night to cover their movements  sir gervaise oakes had made the signal for his fleet to tack in succession from the rear to the van about an hour before le scipion obtained this additional sail the order was executed with great readiness and as the ships had been looking up as high as westsouthwest before when they got round and headed northnortheast their line of sailing was still quite a league to windward of that of the enemy as each vessel filled on the larboard tack she shortened sail to allow the ships astern to keep away and close to her station it is scarcely necessary to say that this change again brought the plantagenet to the head of the line with the warspite however instead of the carnatic for her second astern the latter vessel being quite in the rear  it was a glorious afternoon and there was every promise of as fine a night still as there were but about six hours of positive darkness at that season of the year and the moon would rise at midnight the viceadmiral knew he had no time to lose if he would effect any thing under the cover of obscurity reefs were no longer used though all the ships were under short canvass in order to accommodate their movements to those of the prize the latter however was now in tow of the druid and as this frigate carried her topgallantsails aided by her own courses la victoire was enabled not only to keep up with the fleet then under whole topsails but to maintain her weatherly position such was the state of things just as the sun dipped the enemy being on the lee bow distant one and a half leagues when the plantagenet showed a signal for the whole fleet to heave to with the maintopsails to the masts this command was scarcely executed when the officers on deck were surprised to hear a boatswains mate piping away the crew of the viceadmirals barge or that of the boat which was appropriated to the particular service of the commanderinchief  did i hear aright sir gervaise inquired greenly with curiosity and interest is it your wish to have your barge manned sir  you heard perfectly right greenly and if disposed for a row this fine evening i shall ask the favour of your company sir wycherly wychecombe as you are an idler here i have a flagofficers right to press yon into my service by the way greenly i have made out and signed an order to this gentleman to report himself to you as attached to my family as the soldiers call it as soon as atwood has copied it it will be handed to him when i beg you will consider him as my first aid  to this no one could object and wycherly made a bow of acknowledgment at that instant the barge was seen swinging off over the ships waist and at the next the yard tackles were heard overhauling themselves the splash of the boat in the water followed the crew was in her with oars on end and poised boathooks in another minute the guard presented the boatswain piped over the drum rolled and wycherly jumped to the gangway and was out of sight quick as thought greenly and sir gervaise followed when the boat shoved off  although the seas had greatly subsided and their combs were no longer dangerous the atlantic was far from being as quiet as a lake in a summer eventide at the very first dash of the oars the barge rose on a long heavy swell that buoyed her up like a bubble and as the water glided from under her again it seemed as if she was about to sink into some cavern of the ocean few things give more vivid impressions of helplessness than boats thus tossed by the waters when not in their raging humours for one is apt to expect better treatment than thus to be made the plaything of the element all however who have ever floated on even the most quiet ocean must have experienced more or less of this helpless dependence the stoutest boat impelled by the lustiest crews appearing half the time like a feather floating in capricious currents of the air  the occupants of the barge however were too familiar with their situation to think much of these matters and as soon as sir gervaise assented to wycherlys offer to take the tiller he glanced upward with a critical eye in order to scan the plantagenets appearance  that fellow morganic has got a better excuse for his xebecrig than i had supposed greenly he said after a minute of observation your foretopmast is at least six inches too far forward and i beg you will have it stayed aft tomorrow morning if the weather permit none of your mediterranean craft for me in the narrow seas  very well sir gervaise the spar shall be righted in the morning watch quietly returned the captain  now theres goodfellow halfparson as he is the man contrives to keep his sticks more upright than any captain in the fleet you never see a spar half an inch out of its place on board the warspite  that is because her captain trims every thing by his own life sir rejoined greenly smiling were we half as good as he is in other matters we might be better than we are in seamanship  i do not think religion hurts a sailor greenlyno not in the least that is to say when he dont wedge his masts too tight but leaves play enough for all weathers there is no cant in goodfellow  not the least of it sir and that it is which makes him so great a favourite the chaplain of the warspite is of some use but one might as well have a bowsprit rigged out of a cabinwindow as have our chap  why we never bury a man greenly without putting him into the water as a christian should be returned sir gervaise with the simplicity of a true believer of the decency school i hate to see a seaman tossed in the ocean like a bag of old clothes  we get along with that part of the duty pretty well but before a man is dead the parson is of opinion that he belongs altogether to the doctor  id bet a hundred guineas magrath has had some influence over him in this mattergive the blenheim a wider berth sir wycherly i wish to see how she looks alofthes a dd fellow that magrathno one swore in sir gervaises boat but himself when the viceadmirals flag was flying in her bowsand hes just the sort of man to put such a notion into the chaplains head  why there i believe youre more than half right sir gervaise i overheard a conversation between them one dark night when they were propping the mizzenmast under the break of the poop and the surgeon did maintain a theory very like that you mention sir  ahhe did did he its just like the scotch rogue who wanted to persuade me that your poor uncle sir wycherly ought not to have been blooded in as clear a case of apoplexy as ever was met with  well i didnt think he could have carried his impudence as far as that observed greenly whose medical knowledge was about on a par with that of sir gervaise i didnt think even a doctor would dare to hold such a doctrine as for the chaplain to him he laid down the principle that religion and medicine never worked well together he said religion was an alterative and would neutralize a salt as quick as fire  hes a great vagabond that magrath when he gets hold of a young hand sir and i wish with all my heart the pretender had him with two or three pounds of his favourite medicines with himi think between the two england might reap some advantage greenlynow to my notion wychecombe the blenheim would make better weather if her masts were shortened at least two feet  perhaps she might sir gervaise but would she be as certain a ship in coming into action in light winds and at critical moments  umph its time for us old fellows to look about us greenly when the boys begin to reason on a line of battle dont blush wychecombe dont blush your remark was sensible and shows reflection no country can ever have a powerful marine or one likely to produce much influence in her wars that does not pay rigid attention to the tactics of fleets your frigate actions and sailing of single ships are well enough as drill but the great practice must be in squadron ten heavy ships in good fleet discipline and kept at sea will do more than a hundred single cruisers in establishing and maintaining discipline and it is only by using vessels together that we find out what both ships and men can do now we owe the success of this day to our practice of sailing in close order and in knowing how to keep our stations else would six ships never have been able to carry away the palm of victory from twelvepalmay thats the very word greenly i was trying to think of this morning dalys paddy should have had a palmbranch in its hand as an emblem of victory     chapter xxvi        he that has sailed upon the darkblue sea          has viewed at times i ween a full fair sight        when the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be          the white sail set the gallant frigate tight          mast spires and strand retiring to the sight        the glorious main expanding oer the bow          the convoy spread like wild swans in their flight        the dullest sailer waring bravely now      so gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow           byron   as sir gervaise oakes active mind was liable to such sudden mutations of thought as that described in the close of the last chapter greenly neither smiled nor dwelt on the subject at all he simply pointed out to his superior the fact that they were now abreast of the thunderer and desired to know whether it was his pleasure to proceed any further  to the carnatic greenly if sir wycherly will have the goodness to shape his course thither i have a word to say to my friend parker before we sleep tonight give us room however to look at morganics fancies for i never pass his ship without learning something new lord morganics vessel is a good school for us old fellows to attendhey greenly  the achilles is certainly a model vessel in some respects sir gervaise though i flatter myself the plantagenets have no great occasion to imitate her in order to gain a character  you imitate morganic in order to know how to keep a ship in orderpoh let morganic come to school to you yet the fellow is not bashful in battle neither keeps his station well and makes himself both heard and felt ah there he is flourishing his hat on the poop and wondering what the deuce sir jarvys after now sheer in wychecombe and let us hear what he has to say  good evening sir gervaise called out the earl as usual taking the initiative in the discourse i was in hopes when i saw your flag in the boat that you were going to do me the favour to open a bottle of claret and to taste some fruit i have still standing on the table  i thank you my lord but business before pleasure we have not been idle today though tomorrow shall be still more busy how does the achilles steer now her foremast is in its place  yaws like a fellow with his grog aboard sir gervaise on my honour we shall never do any thing with her until you consent to let us stay her spars in our own fashion do you intend to send me daly back or am i to play first lieutenant myself admiral  dalys shipped for the cruise and you must do as well as you can without him if you find yourself without a second astern in the course of the night do not fancy she has gone to the bottom keep good lookouts and pay attention to signals  as sir gervaise waved his hand the young noble did not venture to reply much less to ask a question though there was not a little speculation on the poop of the achilles concerning the meaning of his words the boat moved on and five minutes later sir gervaise was on the quarterdeck of the carnatic  parker received the commanderinchief hat in hand with a solicitude and anxiety that were constitutional perhaps and which no consciousness of deserving could entirely appease habit however had its share in it since accustomed to defer to rank from boyhood and the architect of his own little fortune he had ever attached more importance to the commendation of his superior than was usual with those who had other props to lean on than their own services as soon as the honours of the quarterdeck had been duly paidfor these sir gervaise never neglected himself nor allowed others to neglectthe viceadmiral intimated to captain parker a desire to see him in his cabin requesting greenly and wycherly to accompany them below  upon my word parker commenced sir gervaise looking around him at the air of singular domestic comfort that the aftercabin of the ship presented you have the knack of taking a house to sea with you that no other captain of the fleet possesses no finery no morganics but a plain wholesome domestic look that might make a man believe he was in his fathers house i would give a thousand pounds if my vagabonds could give the cabin of the plantagenet such a bowldero look now  less than a hundred sir have done the little you see here mrs parker makes it a point to look to those matters herself and in that lies the whole secret perhaps a good wife is a great blessing sir gervaise though you have never been able to persuade yourself into the notion i believe  i hardly think parker the wife can do it all now theres stowel bluewaters captain he is married as well as yourselfnay by george ive heard the old fellow say he had as much wife as any man in his majestys servicebut his cabin looks like a cobblers barn and his stateroom like a soldiers bunk when we were lieutenants together in the eurydice parker your stateroom had just the same air of comfort about it that this cabin has at this instant nonoits in the grain man or it would never show itself in all times and places  you forget sir gervaise that when i had the honour to be your messmate in the eurydice i was a married man  i beg your pardon my old friend so you were indeed why that was a confounded long time ago hey parker  it was truly sir but i was poor and could not afford the extravagances of a single life i married for the sake of economy admiral oakes  and love answered sir gervaise laughing ill warrant you greenly that he persuaded mrs parker into that notion whether true or not ill warrant you he didnt tell her he married for so sneaking a thing as economy i should like to see your stateroom now parker  nothing easier sir gervaise answered the captain rising and opening the door here it is air though little worthy the attention of the owner of bowldero  a notable place trulyand with a housewifelook about it that must certainly remind you of mrs parkerunless indeed that picture at the foot of your cot puts other notions into your head what young hussy have you got there my old eurydicehey parker  that is a picture of my faithful wife sir gervaise a proper companion i hope of my cruise  hey what that young thing your wife parker how the dl came she to have you  ah sir gervaise she is a young thing no longer but is well turned towards sixty the picture was taken when she was a bride and is all the dearer to me now that i know the original has shared my fortunes so long i never look at it without remembering with gratitude how much she thinks of me in our cruises and how often she prays for our success you are not forgotten either sir in her prayers  i exclaimed the viceadmiral quite touched at the earnest simplicity of the other dye hear that greenly ill engage now this lady is a good womana really excellent creaturejust such another as my poor sainted mother was and a blessing to all around her give me your hand parker and when you write next to your wife tell her from me god bless her and say all you think a man ought to say on such an occasion and now to business let us seat ourselves in this snug domesticlooking cabin of yours and talk our matters over  the two captains and wycherly followed the viceadmiral into the aftercabin where the latter seated himself on a small sofa while the others took chairs in respectful attitudes near him no familiarity or jocularity on the part of a naval superior ever lessening the distance between him and those who hold subordinate commissionsa fact that legislators would do well to remember when graduating rank in a service as soon as all were placed sir gervaise opened his mind  i have a delicate piece of duty captain parker he commenced which i wish entrusted to yourself you must know that we handled the ship which escaped us this morning by running down into her own line pretty roughly in every respect besides cutting two of her masts out of her this ship as you may have seen has got up jurymasts already but they are spars that can only be intended to carry her into port monsieur de vervillin is not the man i take him to be if he intends to leave the quarrel between us where it is still he cannot keep that crippled ship in his fleet any more than we can keep our prize and i make no doubt he will send her off to cherbourg as soon as it is dark most probably accompanied by one of his corvettes or perhaps by a frigate  yes sir gervaise returned parker thoughtfully as soon as his superior ceased to speak what you predict is quite likely to happen  it must happen parker the wind blowing directly for his haven now you may easily imagine what i want of the carnatic  i suppose i understand you sirand yet if i might presume to express a wish  speak out old boyyoure talking to a friend i have chosen you to serve you both as one i like and as the oldest captain in the fleet whoever catches that ship will hear more of it  very true sir but are we not likely to have more work here and would it be altogether prudent to send so fine a ship as the carnatic away when the enemy will count ten to six even if she remain  all this has been thought of and i suppose your own feeling has been anticipated you think it will be more honourable to your vessel to keep her place in the line than to take a ship already half beaten  thats it indeed sir gervaise i do confess some such thoughts were crossing my mind  then see how easy it is to rose them out of it i cannot fight the french in this moderate weather without a reinforcement when the rear joins we shall be just ten to ten without you and with you should be eleven to ten now i confess i dont wish the least odds and shall send away somebody especially when i feel certain a noble twodecked ship will be the reward if a frigate accompany the crippled fellow youll have your hands full and a very fair fight and should you get either it will be a handsome thing what say you now parker  i begin to think better of the plan sir gervaise and am grateful for the selection i wish however i knew your own precise wishesive always found it safe to follow them sir  here they are then get four or five sets of the sharpest eyes you have and send them aloft to keep a steady look on your chap while there is light enough to be certain of him in a little while theyll be able to recognise him in the dark and by keeping your nightglasses well levelled he can scarcely slip off without your missing him the moment he is gone ware short round and make the best of your way for cape la hogue or alderney you will go three feet to his two and my life on it by daylight youll have him to windward of you and then youll be certain of him wait for no signals from me but be off as soon as it is dark when your work is done make the best of your way to the nearest english port and clap a scotchman on your shoulder to keep the kings sword from chafing it they thought me fit for knighthood at threeandtwenty and the deuce is in it parker if you are not worthy of it at threeandsixty  ah sir gervaise every thing you undertook succeeded you never yet failed in any expedition  that has come from attempting much my plans have often failed but as something good has generally followed from them i have the credit of designing to do exactly what ive done  then followed a long detailed discourse on the subject before them in which greenly joined the latter making several useful suggestions to the veteran commander of the carnatic after passing quite an hour in the cabin of parker sir gervaise took his leave and reentered his barge it was now so dark that small objects could not be distinguished a hundred yards and the piles of ships as the boat glided past them resembled black hillocks with clouds floating among their treelike and waving spars no captain presumed to hail the commanderinchief as he rowed down the line again with the exception of the peer of the realm he indeed had always something to say and as he had been conjecturing what could induce the viceadmiral to pay so long a visit to the carnatic he could not refrain from uttering as much aloud when he heard the measured stroke of the oars from the returning barge  we shall all be jealous of this compliment to captain parker sir gervaise he called out unless your favours are occasionally extended to some of us less worthy ones  ayaymorganic youll be remembered in proper time in the mean while keep your peoples eyes open so as not to lose sight of the french we shall have something to say to them in the morning  spare us a nightaction if possible sir gervaise i do detest fighting when sleepy and i like to see my enemy too as much as you please in the daytime but a quiet night i do beseech you sir  ill warrant you now if the opera or ranelagh or a drum or a masquerade were inviting you morganic youd think but little of your pillow answered sir gervaise drily whatever you do yourself my lord dont let the achilles get asleep on duty i may have need of her tomorrow give way wychecombe give way and let us get home again  in fifteen minutes from that instant sir gervaise was once more on the poop of the plantagenet and the barge in its place on deck greenly was attending to the duties of his ship and bunting stood in readiness to circulate such orders as it might suit the commanderinchief to give  it was now nine oclock and it was not easy to distinguish objects on the ocean even as large as a ship at the distance of half a league by the aid of the glasses however a vigilant lookout was kept on the french vessels which by this time were quite two leagues distant drawing more ahead it was necessary to fill away in order to close with them and a nightsignal was made to that effect the whole british line braced forward their mainyards as it might be by a common impulse and had there been one there of sufficiently acute senses he might have heard all six of the maintopsails flapping at the same instant as a matter of course the vessels started ahead and the order being to follow the viceadmiral in a close line ahead when the plantagenet edged off so as to bring the wind abeam each vessel did the same in succession or as soon as in the commanderinchiefs wake as if guided by instinct about ten minutes later the carnatic to the surprise of those who witnessed the manoeuvre in the achilles wore short round and set studdingsails on her starboard side steering large the darkest portion of the horizon being that which lay to the eastward or in the direction of the continent in twenty minutes the pyramid of her shadowy outline was swallowed in the gloom all this time la victoire with the druid leading and towing kept upon a bowline and an hour later when sir gervaise found himself abeam of the french line again and half a league to windward of it no traces were to be seen of the three ships last mentioned  so far all goes well gentlemen observed the viceadmiral to the group around him on the poop and we will now try to count the enemy to make certain he too has no stragglers out to pick up waifs greenly try that glass it is set for the night and your eyes are the best we have be particular in looking for the fellow under jurymasts  i make out but ten ships in the line sir gervaise answered the captain after a long examination of course the crippled ship must have gone to leeward of her certainly i can find no traces  you will oblige me sir wycherly by seeing what you can make out in the same way  after a still longer examination than that of the captain wycherly made the same report adding that he thought he also missed the frigate that had been nearest le foudroyant repeating her signals throughout the day this circumstance gratified sir gervaise as he was pleased to find his prognostics came true and he was not sorry to be rid of one of the enemys light cruisers a species of vessel that often proved embarrassing after a decided affair even to the conqueror  i think sir gervaise wycherly modestly added that the french have boarded their tacks and are pressing up to windward to near us did it not appear so to you captain greenly  not at all if they carry courses the sails have been set within the last five minutesha sir gervaise that is an indication of a busy night  as he spoke greenly pointed to the place where the french admiral was known to be where at that instant appeared a double row of lights proving that the batteries had their lanterns lit and showing a disposition to engage in less than a minute the whole french line was to be traced along the sea by the double rows of illumination the light resembling that which is seen through the window of a room that has a bright fire rather than one in which lamps or candles are actually visible as this was just the species of engagement in which the english had much to risk and little to gain sir gervaise immediately gave orders to brace forward the yards to board foreandmain tacks and to set topgallantsails as a matter of course the ships astern made sail in the same manner and hauled up on taut bowlines following the admiral  this is not our play coolly remarked sir gervaise a crippled ship would drop directly into their arms and as for any success at longshot in a twotoone fight it is not to be looked for nonomonsieur de vervillin show us your teeth if you will and a pretty sight it is but you do not draw a shot from me i hope the order to show no lights is duly attended to  i do not think there is a light visible from any ship in the fleet sir gervaise answered bunting though we are so near there can be no great difficulty in telling where we are  all but the carnatic and the prize bunting the more fuss they make with us the less will they think of them  it is probable the french admiral had been deceived by the near approach of his enemy for whose prowess he had a profound respect he had made his preparations in expectation of an attack but he did not open his fire although heavy shot would certainly have told with effect indisposed to the uncertainty of a nightaction he declined bringing it on and the lights disappeared from his ports an hour later at that time the english ships by carrying sail harder than was usual in so stiff a breeze found themselves out of gunshot on the weatherbow of their enemies then and not till then did sir gervaise reduce his canvass having by means of his glasses first ascertained that the french had again hauled up their courses and were moving along at a very easy rate of sailing  it was now near midnight and sir gervaise prepared to go below previously to quitting the deck however he gave very explicit orders to greenly who transmitted them to the first lieutenant that officer or the captain intending to be on the lookout through the night the movements of the whole squadron being so dependent on those of the flag ship the viceadmiral then retired and went coolly to bed he was not a man to lose his rest because an enemy was just out of gunshot accustomed to be manoeuvring in front of hostile fleets the situation had lost its novelty and he had so much confidence in the practice of his captains that he well knew nothing could occur so long as his orders were obeyed to doubt the latter would have been heresy in his eyes in professional nonchalance no man exceeded our viceadmiral blow high or blow low it never disturbed the economy of his cabinlife beyond what unavoidably was connected with the comfort of his ship nor did any prospect of battle cause a meal to vary a minute in time or a particle in form until the bulkheads were actually knocked down and the batteries were cleared for action although excitable in trifles and sometimes a little irritable sir gervaise in the way of his profession was a great man on great occasions his temperament was sanguine and his spirit both decided and bold and in common with all such men who see the truth at all when he did see it he saw it so clearly as to throw all the doubts that beset minds of a less masculine order into the shade on the present occasion he was sure nothing could well occur to disturb his rest and he took it with the composure of one on terrafirma and in the security of peace unlike those who are unaccustomed to scenes of excitement he quietly undressed himself and his head was no sooner on its pillow than he fell into a profound sleep  it would have been a curious subject of observation to an inexperienced person to note the manner in which the two fleets manoeuvred throughout that night after several hours of ineffectual efforts to bring their enemies fairly within reach of their guns after the moon had risen the french gave the matter up for a time shortening sail while most of their superior officers caught a little rest  the sun was just rising as galleygo laid his hand on the shoulder of the viceadmiral agreeably to orders given the previous night the touch sufficed sir gervaise being wide awake in an instant well he said rising to a sitting attitude and putting the question which first occurs to a seaman hows the weather  a good topgallant breeze sir jarvy and just whats this ships play if youd only let her out and on them johnny crapauds shed be down among em in half an hour like a hawk upon a chicken i ought to report to your honour that the last chicken will be dished for breakfast unless we gives an order to the gunroom steward to turn us over some of his birds as pay for what the pigs eat which were real capons  why you pirate you would not have me commit a robbery on the high seas would ye  what robbery would it be to order the gunroom to sell us some poultry lord sir jarvy im as far from wishing to take a thing without an order as the gunners yeoman but let mr atwood put it in black and white  tush interrupted the master how did the french bear from us when you were last on deck  why there they is sir jarvy answered galleygo drawing the curtain from before the stateroom window and allowing the viceadmiral to see the rear of the french line for himself by turning half round and just where we wants em their leading ship a little abaft our leebeam distant one league thats what i calls satisfactory now  ay that is a good position master galleygo was the prize in sight or were you too chickenheaded to look  i chickenheaded well sir jarvy of all characters and descriptions of me that your honour has seen fit to put abroad this is the most unjustest chickens being a food i never thinks on off soundings pigheaded you might in reason call me sir jarvy for i do looks arter the pigs which is the only real standby in a ship but i never dreams of a chicken except for your happetite when they was eight on em  was the prize in sight demanded sir gervaise a little sharply  no sir jarvy she had disappeared and the druid with her but this isnt all sir for they does say someat has befallen the carnatic she having gone out of our line like a binnaclelamp at eight bells  ay she is not visible either  not so much as a hencoop sir jarvy we all wonders what has become of captain parker no sign of him or of his ship is to be found on the briny ocean the young gentlemen of the watch laugh and say she must have gone up in a waterspout but they laughs so much at misfortins generally that i never minds em  have you had a good lookout at the ocean this morning master galleygo asked sir gervaise drawing his head out of a basin of water for by this time he was halfdressed and making his preparations for the razor you used to have an eye for a chase when we were in a frigate and ought to be able to tell me if bluewater is in sight  admiral bluewell sir jarvy it is remarkable but i had just rubbed his division out of my log and forgotten all about it there was a handful of craft or so off here to the norard at daylight but i never thought it was admiral blue it being more natral to suppose him in his place as usual in the rear of our own line let me see sir jarvy how many ships has we absent under admiral blue  why the five twodeckers of his own division to be sure besides the ranger and the gnat seven sail in all  yes thats just it well your honour there was five sail to be seen out here to the norard as i told you and sure enough it may have been admiral blue with all his craft  by this time sir gervaise had his face covered with lather but he forgot the circumstance in a moment as the wind was at the northwest and the plantagenet was on the larboard tack looking in the direction of the bill of portland though much too far to the southward to allow the land to be seen his own larboard quartergallery window commanded a good view of the whole horizon to windward crossing over from the starboard stateroom which he occupied exofficio he opened the window in question and took a look for himself there sure enough was visible a squadron of five ships in close order edging leisurely down on the two lines under their topsails and just near enough to allow it to be ascertained that their courses were not set this sight produced a sudden change in all the viceadmirals movements the business of the toilet was resumed in haste and the beard was mowed with a slashing hand that might have been hazardous in the motion of a ship but for the long experience of a sailor this important part of the operation was scarcely through when locker announced the presence of captain greenly in the main cabin  what now greenlywhat now called out the viceadmiral puffing as he withdrew his head again from the basinwhat now greenly any news from bluewater  i am happy to tell you sir gervaise he has been in sight more than an hour and is closing with us though shyly and slowly i would not let you be called as all was right and i knew sleep was necessary to a clear head  you have done quite right greenly god willing i intend this to be a busy day the french must see our rear division  beyond a doubt sir but they show no signs of making off m de vervillin will fight i feel certain though the experience of yesterday may render him a little shy as to the mode  and his crippled shipold parkers friendi take it she is not visible  you were quite right in your conjecture sir gervaise the crippled ship is off as is one of the frigates no doubt to see her in blewet too has gone well to windward of the french though he can fetch into no anchorage short of portsmouth if this breeze stand  any haven will do our little success will animate the kings party and give it more √©clat perhaps than it really merits let there be no delay with the breakfast this morning greenly it will be a busy day  ayay sir answered the captain in the sailors usual manner that has been seen to already as i have expected as much admiral bluewater keeps his ships in most beautiful order sir i do not think the c√¶sar which leads is two cableslength from the dublin the sternmost vessel he is driving fourinhand with a tight rein too depend on it sir  at this instant sir gervaise came out of his stateroom his coat in his hand and with a countenance that was thoughtful he finished dressing with an abstracted air and would not have known the last garment was on had not galleygo given a violent pull on its skirts in order to smooth the cloth about the shoulders  it is odd that bluewater should come down nearly before the wind in a line ahead and not in a line abreast sir gervaise rejoined as his steward did this office for him  let admiral blue alone for doing whats right put in galleygo in his usual confident and sellpossessed manner by keeping his ships astern of hisself he can tell where to find em and we understands from experience if admiral blue knows where to find a ship he knows how to use her  instead of rebuking this interference which went a little further than common greenly was surprised to see the viceadmiral look his steward intently in the face as if the man had expressed some shrewd and comprehensive truth then turning to his captain sir gervaise intimated an intention of going on deck to survey the state of things with his own eyes     chapter xxvii      thou shouldst have died o highsould chief       in those bright days of glory fled     when triumph so prevailed oer grief       we scarce would mourn the dead           mrs hemans   the eventful day opened with most of the glories of a summers morning the wind alone prevented it from being one of the finest sunrisings of july that continued fresh at northwest and consequently cool for the season the seas of the southwest gale had entirely subsided and were already succeeded by the regular but comparatively trilling swell of the new breeze for large ships it might be called smooth water though the driver and active showed by their pitching and unsteadiness and even the twodeckers by their waving masts that the unquiet ocean was yet in motion the wind seemed likely to stand and was what seamen would be apt to call a good sixknot breeze  to leeward still distant about a league lay the french vessels drawn up in beautiful array and in an order so close and a line so regular as to induce the belief that m de vervillin had made his dispositions to receive the expected attack in his present position all his maintopsails lay flat aback the topgallantsails were flying loose but with buntlings and clewlines hauled up the jibs were fluttering to leeward of their booms and the courses were hanging in festoons beneath their yards this was gallant fightingcanvass and it excited the admiration of even his enemies to increase this feeling just as sir gervaises foot reached the poop the whole french line displayed their ensigns and le foudroyant fired a gun to windward  hey greenly exclaimed the english commanderinchief this is a manly defiance and coming from m de vervillin it means something he wishes to take the day for it though as i think half that time will answer we will wash up the cups before we go at it make the signals bunting for the ships to heaveto and then to get their breakfasts as fast as possible steady breezesteady breeze greenly and all we want  five minutes later while sir gervaise was running his eye over the signalbook the plantagenets calls were piping the people to their morning meal at least an hour earlier than common the people repaired to their messes with a sort of stern joy every man in the ship understanding the reason of a summons so unusual the calls of the vessels astern were heard soon after and one of the officers who was watching the enemy with a glass reported that he thought the french were breakfasting also orders being given to the officers to employ the next half hour in the same manner nearly everybody was soon engaged in eating few thinking that the meal might probably be their last sir gervaise felt a concern which he succeeded in concealing however at the circumstance that the ships to windward made no more sail though he refrained from signalling the rearadmiral to that effect from tenderness to his friend and a vague apprehension of what might be the consequences while the crews were eating he stood gazing thoughtfully at the noble spectacle the enemy offered to leeward occasionally turning wistful glances at the division that was constantly drawing nearer to windward at length greenly himself reported that the plantagenet had turned the handsto again at this intelligence sir gervaise started as from a reverie smiled and spoke we will here remark that now as on the previous day all the natural excitability of manner had disappeared from the commanderinchief and he was quiet and exceedingly gentle in his deportment this all who knew him understood to denote a serious determination to engage  i have desired galleygo to set my little table half an hour hence in the aftercabin greenly and you will share the meal with me sir wycherly will be of our party and i hope it will not be the last time we may meet at the same board it is necessary every thing should be in fightingorder today  so i understand it sir gervaise we are ready to begin as soon as the order shall be received  wait one moment until bunting comes up from his breakfast ah here he is and we are quite ready for him having benton the signal in his absence show the order bunting for the day advances  the little flags were fluttering at the maintopgallantmasthead of the plantagenet in less than one minute and in another it was repeated by the chloe driver and active all of which were lyingto a quarter of a mile to windward charged in particular with this among other duties so well was this signal known that not a book in the fleet was consulted but all the ships answered the instant the flags could be seen and understood then the shrill whistles were heard along the line calling all hands to clear ship for action ahoy  no sooner was this order given in the plantagenet than the ship became a scene of active but orderly exertion the topmen were on the yards stoppering swinging the yards in chains and lashing in order to prevent shot from doing more injury than was unavoidable bulwarks were knocked down messchest bags and all other domestic appliances disappeared below3 and the decks were cleared of every thing which could be removed and which would not be necessary in an engagement fully a quarter of an hour was thus occupied for there was no haste and as it was no moment of mere parade it was necessary that the work should be effectually done the officers forbade haste and nothing important was reported as effected that some one in authority did not examine with his own eyes to see that no proper care had been neglected then mr bury the first lieutenant went on the mainyard in person to look at the manner in which it had been slung while he sent the boatswain up forward on the same errand these were unusual precautions but the word had passed through the ship that sir jarvy was in earnest and whenever it was known that sir jarvy was in such a humour every one understood that the days work was to be hard if not long  footnote 3 in the action of the nile many of the french ships under the impression that the enemy must engage on the outside put their lumber bags c into the ports and between the guns in the larboard or inshore batteries and when the british anchored inshore of them these batteries could not be used  our breakfast is ready sir jarvy reported galleygo and as the decks is all clear the bys can make a clean run of it from the coppers i only wants to know when to serve it your honour  serve it now my good fellow tell the bowlderos to be nimble and expect us below come greenlycome wychecombewe are the last to eatlet us not be the last at our stations  ships clear sir reported bury to his captain as the three reached the quarterdeck on their way to the cabin  very well bury when the fleet is signalled to go to quarters we will obey with the rest  as this was said greenly looked at the viceadmiral to catch his wishes but sir gervaise had no intention of fatiguing his people unnecessarily he had left his private orders with bunting and he passed down without an answer or a glance the arrangements in the aftercabin were as snug and as comfortable as if the breakfasttable had been set in a private house and the trio took their seats and commenced operations with hearty good will the viceadmiral ordered the doors thrown open and as the portlids were up from the place where he sat he could command glimpses both to leeward and to windward that included a view of the enemy as well as one of his own expected reinforcements the bowlderos were in full livery and more active and attentive than usual even their station in battlefor no man on board a vessel of war is an idler in a combatwas on the poop as musketeers near the person of their master whose colours they wore under the ensign of their prince like vassals of an ancient baron notwithstanding the crisis of the morning however these men performed their customary functions with the precision and method of english menials omitting no luxury or usage of the table on a sofa behind the table was spread the full dresscoat of a viceadmiral then a neat but plain uniform without either lace or epaulettes but decorated with a rich star in brilliants the emblem of the order of the bath this coat sir gervaise always wore in battle unless the weather rendered a stormuniform as he used to term a plainer attire necessary  the breakfast passed off pleasantly the gentlemen eating as if no momentous events were near just at its close however sir gervaise leaned forward and looking through one of the weatherports of the maincabin an expression of pleasure illuminated his countenance as he said  ah there go bluewaters signals at lasta certain proof that he is about to put himself in communication with us  i have been a good deal surprised sir observed greenly a little drily though with great respect of manner that you have not ordered the rearadmiral to make more sail he is jogging along like a heavy wagon and yet i hardly think he can mistake these five ships for frenchmen  he is never in a hurry and no doubt wishes to let his crews breakfast before he closes ill warrant ye now gentlemen that his ships are at this moment all as clear as a church five minutes after the blessing has been pronounced  it will not be one of our virginian churches then sir gervaise observed wycherly smiling they serve for an exchange to give and receive news in after the service is over  ay thats the old rulefirst pray and then gossip well bunting what does the rearadmiral say  upon my word sir gervaise i can make nothing of the signal though it is easy enough to make out the flags answered the puzzled signalofficer will you have the goodness to look at the book yourself sir the number is one hundred and forty  one hundred and forty why that must have something to do with anchoringay here it is anchor i cannot having lost my cables who the devil asked him to anchor  thats just it sir the signalofficer on board the c√¶sar must have made some mistake in his flags for though the distance is considerable our glasses are good enough to read them  perhaps admiral bluewater has set the private personal telegraph at work sir quietly observed greenly  the commanderinchief actually changed colour at this suggestion his face at first flushed to crimson then it became pale like the countenance of one who suffered under acute bodily pain wycherly observed this and respectfully inquired if sir gervaise were ill  i thank you young sir answered the viceadmiral smiling painfully it is over i believe i shall have to go into dock and let magrath look at some of my old hurts which are sometimes troublesome mr bunting do me the favour to go on deck and ascertain by a careful examination if a short red pennant be not set some ten or twelve feet above the uppermost flag now greenly we will take the other cup of tea for there is plenty of leisure  two or three brooding minutes followed then bunting returned to say the pennant was there a fact he had quite overlooked in his former observations confounding the narrow flag in question with the regular pennant of the king this short red pennant denoted that the communication was verbal according to a method invented by bluewater himself and by means of which using the ordinary numbers he was enabled to communicate with his friend without any of the captains or indeed without sir gervaises own signalofficers knowing what was said in a word without having recourse to any new flags but by simply giving new numbers to the old ones and referring to a prepared dictionary it was possible to hold a conversation in sentences that should be a secret to all but themselves sir gervaise took down the number of the signal that was flying and directed bunting to show the answering flag with a similar pennant over it and to continue this operation so long as the rearadmiral might make his signals the numbers were to be sent below as fast as received as soon as bunting disappeared the viceadmiral unlocked a secretary the key of which was never out of his own possession took from it a small dictionary and laid it by his plate all this time the breakfast proceeded signals of this nature frequently occurring between the two admirals in the course of the next ten minutes a quartermaster brought below a succession of numbers written on small pieces of paper after which bunting appeared himself to say that the c√¶sar had stopped signalling  sir gervaise now looked out each word by its proper number and wrote it down with his pencil as he proceeded until the whole readgod sakemake no signal engage not no sooner was the communication understood than the paper was torn into minute fragments the book replaced and the viceadmiral turning with a calm determined countenance to greenly ordered him to beat to quarters as soon as bunting could show a signal to the fleet to the same effect on this hint all but the viceadmiral went on deck and the bowlderos instantly set about removing the table and all the other appliances finding himself annoyed by the movements of the servants sir gervaise walked out into the great cabin which regardless of its present condition he began to pace as was his wont when lost in thought the bulkheads being down and the furniture removed this was in truth walking in sight of the crew all who happened to be on the maindeck could see what passed though no one presumed to enter a spot that was tabooed to vulgar feet even when thus exposed the aspect and manner of sir jarvy however were not overlooked and the men prognosticated a serious time  such was the state of things when the drums beat to quarters throughout the whole line at the first tap the great cabin sunk to the level of an ordinary battery the seamen of two guns with the proper officers entering within the sacred limits and coolly setting about clearing their pieces and making the other preparations necessary for an action all this time sir gervaise continued pacing what would have been the centre of his own cabin had the bulkheads stood the grimlooking sailors avoiding him with great dexterity and invariably touching their hats as they were compelled to glide near his person though every thing went on as if he were not present sir gervaise might have remained lost in thought much longer than he did had not the report of a gun recalled him to a consciousness of the scene that was enacting around him  whats that suddenly demanded the viceadmiralis blue water signalling again  no sir gervaise answered the fourth lieutenant looking out of a lee port it is the french admiral giving us another weathergun as much as to ask why we dont go down this is the second compliment of the same sort that he has paid us already today  these words were not all spoken before the viceadmiral was on the quarterdeck in half a minute more he was on the poop here he found greenly wychecombe and bunting all looking with interest at the beautiful line of the enemy  monsieur de vervillin is impatient to wipe off the disgrace of yesterday observed the first as is apparent by the invitations he gives us to come down i presume admiral bluewater will wake up at this last hint  by heaven he has hauled his wind and is standing to the northward and eastward exclaimed sir gervaise surprise overcoming all his discretion although an extraordinary movement at such a time it is wonderful in what beautiful order bluewater keeps his ships  all that was said was true enough the rearadmirals division having suddenly hauled up in a close line ahead each ship followed her leader as mechanically as if they moved by a common impulse as no one in the least doubted the rearadmirals loyalty and his courage was of proof it was the general opinion that this unusual manoeuvre had some connection with the unintelligible signals and the young officers laughingly inquired among themselves what sir jarvy was likely to do next  it would seem however that monsieur de vervillin suspected a repetition of some of the scenes of the preceding day for no sooner did he perceive that the english rear was hugging the wind than five of his leading ships filled and drew ahead as if to meet that division manoeuvring to double on the head of his line while the remaining five with the foudroyant still lay with their topsails to the mast waiting for their enemy to come down sir gervaise could not stand this long he determined if possible to bring bluewater to terms and he ordered the plantagenet to fill followed by his own division he wore immediately and went off under easy sail quartering towards monsieur de vervillins rear to avoid being raked  the quarter of an hour that succeeded was one of intense interest and of material changes though not a shot was fired as soon as the comte de vervillin perceived that the english were disposed to come nearer he signalled his own division to bear up and to run off dead before the wind under their topsails commencing astern which reversed his order of sailing and brought le foudroyant in the rear or nearest to the enemy this was no sooner done than he settled all his topsails on the caps there could be no mistaking this manoeuvre it was a direct invitation to sir gervaise to come down fairly alongside the bearing up at once removing all risk of being raked in so doing the english commanderinchief was not a man to neglect such a palpable challenge but making a few signals to direct the mode of attack he contemplated he set foresail and maintopgallantsail and brought the wind directly over his own taffrail the vessels astern followed like clockwork and no one now doubted that the mode of attack was settled for that day  as the french with monsieur de vervillin were still half a mile to the southward and eastward of the approaching division of their enemy the comte collected all his frigates and corvettes on his starboard hand leaving a clear approach to sir gervaise on his larboard beam this hint was understood too and the plantagenet steered a course that would bring her up on that side of le foudroyant and at the distance of about one hundred yards from the muzzles of her guns this threatened to be close work and unusual work in fleets at that day but it was the game our commanderinchief was fond of playing and it was one also that promised soonest to bring matters to a result  these preliminaries arranged there was yet leisure for the respective commanders to look about them the french were still fully a mile ahead of their enemies and as both fleets were going in the same direction the approach of the english was so slow as to leave some twenty minutes of that solemn breathing time which reigns in a disciplined ship previous to the commencement of the combat the feelings of the two commandersinchief at this pregnant instant were singularly in contradiction to each other the comte de vervillin saw that the rear division of his force under the comteamiral le vicomte des prez was in the very position he desired it to be having obtained the advantage of the wind by the english divisions coming down and by keeping its own luff between the two french officers there was a perfect understanding as to the course each was to take and both now felt sanguine hopes of being able to obliterate the disgrace of the previous day and that too by means very similar to those by which it had been incurred on the other hand sir gervaise was beset with doubts as to the course bluewater might pursue he could not however come to the conclusion that he would abandon him to the joint efforts of the two hostile divisions and so long as the french rearadmiral was occupied by the english force to windward it left to himself a clear field and no favour in the action with monsieur de vervillin he knew bluewaters generous nature too well not to feel certain his own compliance with the request not to signal his inferior would touch his heart and give him a double chance with all his better feelings nevertheless sir gervaise oakes did not lead into this action without many and painful misgivings he had lived too long in the world not to know that political prejudice was the most demoralising of all our weaknesses veiling our private vices under the plausible concealment of the public weal and rendering even the welldisposed insensible to the wrongs they commit to individuals by means of the deceptive flattery of serving the community as doubt was more painful than the certainty of his worst forebodings however and it was not in his nature to refuse a combat so fairly offered he was resolved to close with the comte at every hazard trusting the issue to god and his own efforts  the plantagenet presented an eloquent picture of order and preparation as she drew near the french line on this memorable occasion her people were all at quarters and as greenly walked through her batteries he found every gun on the starboard side loose levelled and ready to be fired while the opposite merely required a turn or two of the tackles to be cast loose the priming to be applied and the loggerhead to follow in order to be discharged also a deathlike stillness reigned from the poop to the cockpit the older seamen occasionally glancing through their ports in order to ascertain the relative positions of the two fleets that they might be ready for the collision as the english got within musketshot the french ran their topsails to the mastheads and their ships gathered fresher way through the water still the former moved with the greatest velocity carrying the most sail and impelled by the greater momentum when near enough however sir gervaise gave the order to reduce the canvass of his own ship  that will do greenly he said in a mild quiet tone let run the topgallanthalyards and haul up the foresail the way you have will bring you fairly alongside  the captain gave the necessary orders and the master shortened sail accordingly still the plantagenet shot ahead and in three or four minutes more her bows doubled so far on le foudroyants quarter as to permit a gun to bear this was the signal for both sides each ship opening as it might be in the same breath the flash the roar and the eddying smoke followed in quick succession and in a period of time that seemed nearly instantaneous the crash of shot and the shrieks of wounded mingled with the infernal din for nature extorts painful concessions of human weaknesses at such moments even from the bravest and firmest bunting was in the act of reporting to sir gervaise that no signal could yet be seen from the c√¶sar in the midst of this uproar when a small roundshot discharged from the frenchmans poop passed through his body literally driving the heart before it leaving him dead at his commanders feet  i shall depend on you sir wycherly for the discharge of poor buntings duty the remainder of the cruise observed sir gervaise with a smile in which courtesy and regret struggled singularly for the mastery quartermasters lay mr buntings body a little out of the way and cover it with those signals they are a suitable pall for so brave a man  just as this occurred the warspite came clear of the plantagenet on her outside according to orders and she opened with her forward guns taking the second ship in the french line for her target in two minutes more these vessels also were furiously engaged in the hot strife in this manner ship after ship passed on the outside of the plantagenet and sheered into her berth ahead of her who had just been her own leader until the achilles lord morganic the last of the five lay fairly side by side with le conquereur the vessel now at the head of the french line that the reader may understand the incidents more readily we will give the opposing lines in the precise form in which they lay viz      plantagenet    le foudroyant      warspite       le t√©m√©raire      blenheim       le dugay trouin      thunderer      lajax      achilles       le conquereur  the constantly recurring discharges of four hundred pieces of heavy ordnance within a space so small had the effect to repel the regular currents of air and almost immediately to lessen a breeze of six or seven knots to one that would not propel a ship more than two or three this was the first observable phenomenon connected with the action but as it had been expected sir gervaise had used the precaution to lay his ships as near as possible in the positions in which he intended them to fight the battle the next great physical consequence one equally expected and natural but which wrought a great change in the aspect of the battle was the cloud of smoke in which the ten ships were suddenly enveloped at the first broadsides between the two admirals volumes of light fleecy vapour rolled over the sea meeting midway and rising thence in curling wreaths left nothing but the masts and sails of the adversary visible in the hostile ship this of itself would have soon hidden the combatants in the bosom of a nearly impenetrable cloud but as the vessels drove onward they entered deeper beneath the sulphurous canopy until it spread on each side of them shutting out the view of ocean skies and horizon the burning of the priming below contributed to increase the smoke until not only was respiration often difficult but those who fought only a few yards apart frequently could not recognise each others faces in the midst of this scene of obscurity and a din that might well have alarmed the caverns of the ocean the earnest and welldrilled seamen toiled at their ponderous guns and remedied with ready hands the injuries received in the rigging each man as intent on his own particular duty as if he wrought in the occupations of an ordinary gale  sir wycherly observed the viceadmiral when the cannonading had continued some twenty minutes there is little for a flagofficer to do in such a cloud of smoke i would give much to know the exact positions of the divisions of our two rearadmirals  there is but one mode of ascertaining that sir gervaiseif it be your pleasure i will attempt it by going on the maintopgallantyard one might get a clear view perhaps  sir gervaise smiled his approbation and presently he saw the young man ascending the mainrigging though half concealed in smoke just at this instant greenly ascended to the poop from making a tour of observation below without waiting for a question the captain made his report  we are doing pretty well now sir gervaise though the first broadside of the comte treated us roughly i think his fire slackens and bury says he is certain that his foretopmast is already gone at all events our lads are in good spirits and as yet all the sticks keep their places  im glad of this greenly particularly of the latter just at this moment i see you are looking at those signalsthey cover the body of poor bunting  and this train of blood to the ladder siri hope our young baronet is not hurt  no it is one of the bowlderos who has lost a leg i shall have to see that he wants for nothing hereafter  there was a pause then both the gentlemen smiled as they heard the crashing work made by a shot just beneath them which by the sounds and the direction they knew had passed through greenlys crockery still neither spoke after a few more minutes of silent observation sir gervaise remarked that he thought the flashes of the french guns more distant than they had been at first though at that instant not a trace of their enemy was to be discovered except in the roar of the guns and in these very flashes and their effect on the plantagenet  if so sir the comte begins to find his berth too hot for him here is the wind still directly over our taffrail such as it is  nonowe steer as we begani keep my eye on that compass below and am certain we hold a straight course go forward greenly and see that a sharp lookout is kept ahead it is time some of our own ships should be crippled we must be careful not to run into them should such a thing happen sheer hard to starboard and pass inside  ayaysir gervaise your wishes shall be attended to  as this was said greenly disappeared and at the next instant wycherly stood in his place  well siri am glad to see you back safe if greenly were here now he would inquire about his masts but i wish to know the position of the ships  i am the bearer of bad news sir nothing at all could be seen from the top but in the crosstrees i got a good look through the smoke and am sorry to say the french rearadmiral is coming down fast on our larboardquarter with all his force we shall have him abeam in five minutes  and bluewater demanded sir gervaise quick as lightning  i could see nothing of admiral bluewaters ships but knowing the importance of this intelligence i came down immediately and by the backstay  you have done well sir send a midshipman forward for captain greenly then pass below yourself and let the lieutenants in the batteries hear the news they must divide their people and by all means give a prompt and welldirected first broadside  wycherly waited for no more he ran below with the activity of his years the message found greenly between the knightheads but he hurried aft to the poop to ascertain its object it took sir gervaise but a moment to explain it all to the captain  in the name of heaven what can the other division be about exclaimed greenly that it lets the french rearadmiral come upon us in a moment like this  of that sir it is unnecessary to speak now answered the commanderinchief solemnly our present business is to get ready for this new enemy go into the batteries again and as you prize victory be careful not to throw away the first discharge in the smoke  as time pressed greenly swallowed his discontent and departed the five minutes that succeeded were bitter minutes to sir gervaise oakes beside himself there were but five men on the poop viz the quartermaster who tended the signals and three of the bowlderos all of these were using muskets as usual though the viceadmiral never permitted marines to be stationed at a point which he wished to be as clear of smoke and as much removed from bustle as possible he began to pace this comparatively vacant little deck with a quick step casting wistful glances towards the larboardquarter but though the smoke occasionally cleared a little in that direction the firing having much slackened from exhaustion in the men as well as from injuries given and received he was unable to detect any signs of a ship such was the state of things when wycherly returned and reported that his orders were delivered and part of the people were already in the larboardbatteries     chapter xxviii        and oh the little warlike world within         the wellreeved guns the netted canopy       the hoarse command the busy humming din         when at a word the tops are manned on high         hark to the boatswains call the cheering cry       while through the seamans hand the tackle glides         or schoolboy midshipman that standing by       strains his shrill pipe as good or ill betides     and well the docile crew that skilful urchin guides           byron   are you quite sure sir wycherly wychecombe that there is not some mistake about the approach of the rear division of the french inquired the viceadmiral endeavouring to catch some glimpse of the water through the smoke on the larboard hand may not some crippled ship of our own have sheered from the line and been left by us unknowingly on that side  no sir gervaise there is no mistake there can be none unless i may have been deceived a little in the distance i saw nothing but the sails and spars not of a single vessel but of three ships and one of them wore the flag of a french rearadmiral at the mizzen as a proof that i was not mistaken sir there it is this minute  the smoke on the off side of the plantagenet as a matter of course was much less dense than that on the side engaged and the wind beginning to blow in eddies as ever happens in a heavy cannonade there were moments in which it cast aside the shroud of battle at that instant an opening occurred through which a single mast and a single sail were visible in the precise spot where wycherly had stated the enemy might be looked for it was a mizzentopsail beyond a question and above it was fluttering the little square flag of the rearadmiral sir gervaise decided on the character of the vessel and on his own course in an instant stepping to the edge of the poop with his natural voice without the aid of a trumpet of any sort he called out in tones that rose above the roar of the contest the ominous but familiar nautical words of stand by perhaps a call from powerful lungs and the viceadmirals voice when he chose to use it was like the blast of a clarion is clearer and more impressive when unaided by instruments than when it comes disguised and unnatural through a tube at any rate these words were heard even on the lower deck by those who stood near the hatches taking them up they were repeated by a dozen voices with such expressions as look out lads sir jarvys awake sight your guns wait till shes square and other similar admonitions that it is usual for the seaofficer to give as he is about to commence the strife at this critical moment sir gervaise again looked up and caught another glimpse of the little flag as it passed into a vast wreath of smoke he saw that the ship was fairly abeam and as if doubling all his powers he shouted the word fire greenly was standing on the lowerdeck ladder with his head just even with the coamings of the hatch as this order reached him and he repeated it in a voice scarcely less startling the cloud on the larboard side was driven in all directions like dust scattered by wind the ship seemed on fire and the missiles of fortyone guns flew on their deadly errand as it might be at a single flash the old plantagenet trembled to her keel and even bowed a little at the recoils but like one suddenly relieved from a burthen righted and went on her way none the less active that timely broadside saved the english commanderinchiefs ship from an early defeat it took the crew of le pluton her new adversary by surprise for they had not been able to distinguish the precise position of their enemy and besides doing vast injury to both hull and people drew her fire at an unpropitious moment so uncertain and hasty indeed was the discharge the french ship gave in return that no small portion of the contents of her guns passed ahead of the plantagenet and went into the larboard quarter of le t√©m√©raire the french admirals second ahead  that was a timely salute said sir gervaise smiling as soon as the fire of his new enemy had been received without material injury the first blow is always half the battle we may now work on with some hopes of success ah here comes greenly again god be praised unhurt  the meeting of these two experienced seamen was cordial but not without great seriousness both felt that the situation of not only the ship but of the whole fleet was extremely critical the odds being much too great and the position of the enemy too favourable not to render the result to say the very least exceedingly doubtful some advantage had certainly been obtained thus far but there was little hope of preserving it long the circumstances called for very decided and particularly bold measures  my mind is made up greenly observed the viceadmiral we must go aboard of one of these ships and make it a handtohand affair we will take the french commanderinchief he is evidently a good deal cut up by the manner in which his fire slackens and if we can carry him or even force him out of the line it will give us a better chance with the rest as for bluewater god only knows what has become of him he is not here at any rate and we must help ourselves  you have only to order sir gervaise to be obeyed i will lead the boarders myself  it must be a general thing greenly i rather think we shall all of us have to go aboard of le foudroyant go give the necessary orders and when every thing is ready round in a little on the larboard braces clap your helm aport and give the ship a rank sheer to starboard this will bring matters to a crisis at once by letting the foresail fall and setting the spanker you might shove the ship ahead a little faster  greenly instantly left the poop on this new and important duty he sent his orders into the batteries bidding the people remain at their guns however to the last moment and particularly instructing the captain of marines as to the manner in which he was to cover and then follow the boardingparty this done he gave orders to brace forward the yards as directed by sir gervaise  the reader will not overlook the material circumstance that all we have related occurred amid the din of battle guns were exploding at each instant the cloud of smoke was both thickening and extending fire was flashing in the semiobscurity of its volumes shot were rending the wood and cutting the rigging and the piercing shrieks of agony only so much the more appalling by being extorted from the stern and resolute blended their thrilling accompaniments men seemed to be converted into demons and yet there was a lofty and stubborn resolution to conquer mingled with all that ennobled the strife and rendered it heroic the broadsides that were delivered in succession down the line as ship after ship of the rear division reached her station however proclaimed that monsieur des prez had imitated sir gervaises mode of closing the only one by means of which the leading vessel could escape destruction and that the english were completely doubled on at this moment the sailtrimmers of the plantagenet handled their braces the first pull was the last no sooner were the ropes started than the foretopmast went over the bows dragging after it the main with all its hamper the mizzen snapping like a pipestem at the cap by this cruel accident the result of many injuries to shrouds backstays and spars the situation of the plantagenet became worse than ever for not only was the wreck to be partially cleared at least to fight many of the larboard guns but the command of the ship was in a great measure lost in the centre of one of the most infernal m√™l√©es that ever accompanied a combat at sea  at no time does the trained seaman ever appear so great as when he meets sudden misfortunes with the steadiness and quiet which it is a material part of the morale of discipline to inculcate greenly was full of ardour for the assault and was thinking of the best mode of running foul of his adversary when this calamity occurred but the masts were hardly down when he changed all his thoughts to a new current and called out to the sailtrimmers to lay over and clear the wreck  sir gervaise too met with a sudden and violent check to the current of his feelings he had collected his bowlderos and was giving his instructions as to the manner in which they were to follow and keep near his person in the expected handtohand encounter when the heavy rushing of the air and the swoop of the mass from above announced what had occurred turning to the men he calmly ordered them to aid in getting rid of the incumbrances and was in the very act of directing wycherly to join in the same duty when the latter exclaimed  see sir gervaise here comes another of the frenchmen close upon our quarter by heavens they must mean to board  the viceadmiral instinctively grasped his swordhilt tighter and turned in the direction mentioned by his companion there indeed came a fresh ship shoving the cloud aside and by the clearer atmosphere that seemed to accompany her apparently bringing down a current of air stronger than common when first seen the jibboom and bowsprit were both enveloped in smoke but his bellying foretopsail and the canvass hanging in festoons loomed grandly in the vapour the black yards seeming to embrace the wreaths merely to cast them aside the proximity too was fearful her yardarms promising to clear those of the plantagenet only by a few feet as her dark bows brushed along the admirals side  this will be fearful work indeed exclaimed sir gervaise a fresh broadside from a ship so near will sweep all from the spars go wychecombe tell greenly to call inholdtis an english ship no frenchmans bowsprit stands like that almighty god be praised tis the c√¶sarthere is the old romans figurehead just shoving out of the smoke  this was said with a yell rather than a cry of delight and in a voice so loud that the words were heard below and flew through the ship like the hissing of an ascending rocket to confirm the glorious tidings the flash and roar of guns on the offside of the stranger announced the welcome tidings that le pluton had an enemy of her own to contend with thus enabling the plantagenets people to throw all their strength on the starboard guns and pursue their other necessary work without further molestation from the french rearadmiral the gratitude of sir gervaise as the rescuing ship thrust herself in between him and his most formidable assailant was too deep for language he placed his hat mechanically before his face and thanked god with a fervour of spirit that never before had attended his thanksgivings this brief act of devotion over he found the bows of the c√¶sar which ship was advancing very slowly in order not to pass too far ahead just abreast of the spot where he stood and so near that objects were pretty plainly visible between her knightheads stood bluewater conning the ship by means of a line of officers his hat in his hand waving in encouragement to his own people while geoffrey cleveland held the trumpet at his elbow at that moment three noble cheers were given by the crews of the two friendly vessels and mingled with the increasing roar of the c√¶sars artillery then the smoke rose in a cloud over the forecastle of the latter ship and persons could no longer be distinguished  nevertheless like all that thus approached the relieving ship passed slowly ahead until nearly her whole length protected the undefended side of her consort delivering her fire with fearful rapidity the plantagenets seemed to imbibe new life from this arrival and their starboard guns spoke out again as if manned by giants it was five minutes perhaps after this seasonable arrival before the guns of the other ships of the english rear announced their presence on the outside of monsieur des prezs force thus bringing the whole of the two fleets into four lines all steering dead before the wind and as it were interwoven with each other by that time the poops of the plantagenet and c√¶sar became visible from one to the other the smoke now driving principally off from the vessels there again were our two admirals each anxiously watching to get a glimpse of his friend the instant the place was clear sir gervaise applied the trumpet to his mouth and called out  god bless youdick may god for ever bless youyour ship can do itclap your helm hard astarboard and sheer into m des prez youll have him in five minutes  bluewater smiled waved his hand gave an order and laid aside his trumpet two minutes later the c√¶sar sheered into the smoke on her larboard beam and the crash of the meeting vessels was heard by this time the wreck of the plantagenet was cut adrift and she too made a rank sheer though in a direction opposite to that of the c√¶sars as she went through the smoke her guns ceased and when she emerged into the pure air it was found that le foudroyant had set courses and topgallantsails and was drawing so fast ahead as to render pursuit under the little sail that could be set unprofitable signals were out of the question but this movement of the two admirals converted the whole battle scene into one of inexplicable confusion ship after ship changed her position and ceased her fire from uncertainty what that position was until a general silence succeeded the roar of the cannonade it was indispensable to pause and let the smoke blow away  it did not require many minutes to raise the curtain on the two fleets as soon as the firing stopped the wind increased and the smoke was driven off to leeward in a vast straggling cloud that seemed to scatter and disperse in the air spontaneously then a sight of the havoc and destruction that had been done in this short conflict was first obtained  the two squadrons were intermingled and it required some little time for sir gervaise to get a clear idea of the state of his own ships generally it might be said that the vessels were scattering the french sheering towards their own coast while the english were principally coming by the wind on the larboard tack or heading in towards england the c√¶sar and le pluton were still foul of each other though a rearadmirals flag was flying at the mizzen of the first while that which had so lately fluttered at the royalmasthead of the other had disappeared the achilles lord morganic was still among the french more to leeward than any other english ship without a single spar standing her ensigns were flying notwithstanding and the thunderer and dublin both in tolerable order were edging away rapidly to cover their crippled consort though the nearest french vessels seemed more bent on getting out of the m√™l√©e and into their own line again than on securing any advantage already obtained le t√©m√©raire was in the same predicament as the achilles as to spars though much more injured in her hull besides having thrice as many casualties her flag was down the ship having fairly struck to the warspite whose boats were already alongside of her le foudroyant with quite onethird of her crew killed and wounded was running off to leeward with signals flying for her consorts to rally round her but within less than ten minutes after she became visible her main and mizzenmasts both went the blenheim had lost all her topmasts like the plantagenet and neither the elizabeth nor the york had a mizzenmast standing although engaged but a very short time several lower yards were shot away or so much injured as to compel the ships to shorten sail this accident having occurred in both fleets as for the damage done to the standing and running rigging and to the sails it is only necessary to say that shrouds back and headstays braces bowlines and lifts were dangling in all directions while the canvass that was open exhibited all sorts of rents from that which had been torn like cloth in the shopmans hands to the little eyelet holes of the canister and grape it appeared by the subsequent reports of the two parties that in this short but severe conflict the slain and wounded of the english amounted to seven hundred and sixtythree including officers and that of the french to one thousand four hundred and twelve the disparity in this respect would probably have been greater against the latter had it not been for the manner in which m des prez succeeded in doubling on his enemies  little need be said in explanation of the parts of this battle that have not been distinctly related m des prez had manoeuvered in the manner he did at the commencement of the affair in the hope of drawing sir gervaise down upon the division of the comte de vervillin and no sooner did he see the first fairly enveloped in smoke than he wore short round and joined in the affair as has been mentioned at this sight bluewaters loyalty to the stuarts could resist no longer throwing out a general signal to engage he squared away set every thing that would draw on the c√¶sar and arrived in time to save his friend the other ships followed engaging on the outside for want of room to imitate their leader  two more of the french ships at least in addition to le t√©m√©raire and le pluton might have been added to the list of prizes had the actual condition of their fleet been known but at such moments a combatant sees and feels his own injuries while he has to conjecture many of those of his adversaries and the english were too much occupied in making the provisions necessary to save their remaining spars to risk much in order to swell an advantage that was already so considerable some distant firing passed between the thunderer and dublin and lajax le dugay trouin and lhector before the two former succeeded in getting lord morganic out of his difficulties but it led to no material result merely inflicting new injuries on certain spars that were sufficiently damaged before and killing and wounding some fifteen or twenty men quite uselessly as soon as the viceadmiral saw what was likely to be the effects of this episode he called off captain oneil of the dublin by signal he being an officer of a hot temper as the soldier said of himself at waterloo the compliance with this order may be said to have terminated the battle  the reader will remember that the wind at the commencement of the engagement was at northwest it was nearly killed as seamen express it by the cannonade then it revived a little as the concussions of the guns gradually diminished but the combined effect of the advance of the day and the rushing of new currents of air to fill the vacuums produced by the burning of so much powder was a sudden shift of wind a breeze coming out strong and as it might be in an instant from the eastward this unexpected alteration in the direction and power of the wind cost the thunderer her foremast and did other damage to different ships but by dint of great activity and careful handling all the english vessels got their heads round to the northward while the french filled the other way and went off free steering nearly southeast making the best of their way for brest the latter suffered still more than their enemies by the change just mentioned and when they reached port as did all but one the following day no less than three were towed in without a spar standing bowsprits excepted  the exception was le caton which ship m de vervillin set fire to and blew up on account of her damages in the course of the afternoon thus of twelve noble twodecked ships with which this officer sailed from cherbourg only two days before he reached brest with but seven  nor were the english entirely without their embarrassments although the warspite had compelled le t√©m√©raire to strike she was kept afloat herself with a good deal of difficulty and that too not without considerable assistance from the other vessels the leaks however were eventually stopped and then the ship was given up to the care of her own crew other vessels suffered of course but no english ship was in as much jeopardy as this  the first hour after the action ceased was one of great exertion and anxiety to our admiral he called the chloe alongside by signal and attended by wycherly and his own quartermasters galleygo who went without orders and the bowlderos who were unhurt he shifted his flag to that frigate then he immediately commenced passing from vessel to vessel in order to ascertain the actual condition of his command the achilles detained him some time and he was near her or to leeward when the wind shifted which was bringing him to windward in the present stale of things of this advantage he availed himself by urging the different ships off as fast as possible and long before the sun was in the meridian all the english vessels were making the best of their way towards the land with the intention of fetching into plymouth if possible if not into the nearest and best anchorage to leeward the progress of the fleet was relatively slow as a matter of course though it got along at the rate of some five knots by making a free wind of it  the master of the chloe had just taken the sun in order to ascertain his latitude when the viceadmiral commanded denham to set topgallantsails and go within hail of the c√¶sar that ship had got clear of le pluton half an hour after the action ceased and she was now leading the fleet with her three topsails on the caps aloft she had suffered comparatively little but sir gervaise knew that there must have been a serious loss of men in carrying hand to hand a vessel like that of m des prez he was anxious to see his friend and to hear the manner in which his success had been obtained and we might add to remonstrate with bluewater on a course that had led the latter to the verge of a most dangerous abyss  the chloe was half an hour running through the fleet which was a good deal extended and was sailing without any regard to a line sir gervaise had many questions to ask too of the different commanders in passing at last the frigate overtook le t√©m√©raire which vessel was following the c√¶sar under easy canvass as the chloe came up abeam sir gervaise appeared in the gangway of the frigate and hat in hand he asked with an accent that was intelligible though it might not have absolutely stood the test of criticism  le viceadmiral oakes demande comment se porteil le contreamiral le vicomte des prez  a little elderly man dressed with extreme care with a powdered head but of a firm step and perfectly collected expression of countenance appeared on the verge of le t√©m√©raires poop trumpet in hand to reply  le vicomte des prez remercie bien monsieur le chevalier oake et d√©sire vivement de savoir comment se porte monsieur le viceamiral  mutual waves of the trumpets served as replies to the questions and then after taking a moment to muster his french sir gervaise continued  jesp√®re voir monsieur le contreamiral √† d√Æner √† cinq heures pr√©cis  the vicomte smiled at this characteristic manifestation of goodwill and courtesy and after pausing an instant to choose an expression to soften his refusal and to express his own sense of the motive of the invitation he called out  veuillez bien recevoir nos excuses pour aujourdhui mons le chevalier nous navons pas encore dig√©r√© le repas si noble re√ßu √† vos mains comme d√©jeuner  the chloe passing ahead bows terminated the interview sir gervaises french was at fault for what between the rapid neat pronunciation of the frenchman the trumpet and the turn of the expression he did not comprehend the meaning of the contreamiral  what does he say wychecombe he asked eagerly of the young man will he come or not  upon my word sir gervaise french is a sealed language to me never having been a prisoner no opportunity has offered for acquiring the language as i understood you intended to ask him to dinner i rather think from his countenance he meant to say he was not in spirits for the entertainment  pooh we would have put him in spirits and bluewater could have talked to him in his own tongue by the fathom we will close with the c√¶sar to leeward denham never mind rank on an occasion like this its time to let the topgallanthalyards run youll have to settle your topsails too or we shall shoot past her bluewater may take it as a salute to his gallantry in carrying so fine a ship in so handsome a manner  several minutes now passed in silence during which the frigate was less and less rapidly closing with the larger vessel drawing ahead towards the last as it might be foot by foot sir gervaise got upon one of the quarterdeck guns and steadying himself against the hammockcloths he was in readiness to exchange the greetings he was accustomed to give and to receive from his friend in the same heartfelt manner as if nothing had occurred to disturb the harmony of their feelings the single glance of the eye the waving of the hat and the noble manner in which bluewater interposed between him and his most dangerous enemy was still present to his mind and disposed him even more than common to the kindest feelings of his nature stowel was already on the poop of the c√¶sar and as the chloe came slowly on he raised his hat in deference to the commanderinchief it was a point of delicacy with sir gervaise never to interfere with any subordinate flagofficers vessel any more than duty rigidly required consequently his communications with the captain of the c√¶sar had usually been of a general nature verbal orders and criticisms being studiously avoided this circumstance rendered the commanderinchief even a greater favourite than common with stowel who had all his own way in his own ship in consequence of the rearadmirals indifference to such matters  how do you do stowel called out sir gervaise cordially i am delighted to see you on your legs and hope the old roman is not much the worse for this days treatment  i thank you sir gervaise we are both afloat yet though we have passed through warm times the ship is damaged sir as you may suppose and although it stands so bravely and looks so upright that foremast of ours is as good as a condemned spar one thirtytwo through the heart of it about ten feet from the deck an eighteen in the hounds and a doubleheader sticking in one of the hoops a spar cannot be counted for much that has as many holes in it as those sir  deal tenderly with it my old friend and spare the canvass those chaps at plymouth will set all to rights again in a week hoops can be had for asking and as for holes in the heart many a poor fellow has had them and lived through it all you are a case in point mrs stowel not having spared you in that way ill answer for it  mrs stowel commands ashore sir gervaise and i command afloat and in that way we keep a quiet ship and a quiet house i thank you sir and i endeavour to think of her at sea as little as possible  ay thats the way with you doting husbandsalways ashamed of your own lively sensibilities but what has become of bluewaterdoes he know that we are alongside  stowel looked round cast his eyes up at the sails and played with the hilt of his sword the rapid eye of the commanderinchief detected this embarrassment and quick as thought he demanded what had happened  why sir gervaise you know how it is with some admirals who like to be in every thing i told our respected and beloved friend that he had nothing to do with boarding that if either of us was to go i was the proper man but that we ought both to stick by the ship he answered something about lost honour and duty and you know sir what legs he has when he wishes to use them one might as well think of stopping a deserter by a halloo away he went with the first party sword in hand a sight i never saw before and never wish to see again thus you see how it was sir  the commanderinchief compressed his lips until his features and indeed his whole form was a picture of desperate resolution though his face was as pale as death and the muscles of his mouth twitched in spite of all his physical selfcommand  i understand you sir he said in a voice that seemed to issue from his chest you wish to say that admiral bluewater is killed  no thank god sir gervaise not quite as bad as that though sadly hurt yes indeed very sadly hurt  sir gervaise oakes groaned and for a few minutes he leaned his head on the hammockcloths veiling his face from the sight of men then he raised his person erect and said steadily  run your topsails to the masthead captain stowel and round your ship to i will come on board of you  an order was given to denham to take room when the chloe came to the wind on one tack and the c√¶sar on the other this was contrary to rule as it increased the distance between the ships but the viceadmiral was impatient to be in his barge in ten minutes he was mounting the c√¶sars side and in two more he was in bluewaters maincabin geoffrey cleveland was seated by the table with his face buried in his arms touching his shoulder the boy raised his head and showed a face covered with tears  how is he boy demanded sir gervaise hoarsely do the surgeons give any hopes  the midshipman shook his head and then as if the question renewed his grief he again buried his face in his arms at this moment the surgeon of the ship came from the rearadmirals stateroom and following the commanderinchief into the aftercabin they had a long conference together  minute after minute passed and the c√¶sar and chloe still lay with their maintopsails aback at the end of half an hour denham wore round and laid the head of his frigate in the proper direction ship after ship came up and went on to the northward fast as her crippled state would allow yet no sign of movement was seen in the c√¶sar two sail had appeared in the southeastern board and they too approached and passed without bringing the viceadmiral even on deck these ships proved to be the carnatic and her prize le scipion which latter ship had been intercepted and easily captured by the former the steering of m de vervillin to the southwest had left a clear passage to the two ships which were coming down with a free wind at a handsome rate of sailing this news was sent into the c√¶sars cabin but it brought no person and no answer out of it at length when every thing had gone ahead the barge returned to the chloe it merely took a note however which was no sooner read by wycherly than he summoned the bowlderos and galleygo had all the viceadmirals luggage passed into the boat struck his flag and took his leave of denham as soon as the boat was clear of the frigate the latter made all sail after the fleet to resume her ordinary duties of a lookout and a repeatingship  as soon as wycherly reached the c√¶sar that ship hoisted in the viceadmirals barge a report was made to sir gervaise of what had been done and then an order came on deck that occasioned all in the fleet to stare with surprise the red flag of sir gervaise oakes was run up at the foreroyalmasthead of the c√¶sar while the white flag of the rearadmiral was still flying at her mizzen such a thing had never before been known to happen if it has ever happened since and to the time when she was subsequently lost the c√¶sar was known as the double flagship     chapter xxix      he spoke when behold the fair geraldines form       on the canvass enchantingly glowed     his touches they flew like the leaves in a storm     and the pure pearly white and the carnation warm       contending in harmony flowed           alston   we shall now ask permission of the reader to advance the time just eightandforty hours a liberty with the unities which he will do us the justice to say we have not often taken we must also transfer the scene to that already described at wychecombe including the head the station the roads and the inland and seaward views summer weather had returned too the pennants of the ships at anchor scarce streaming from their masts far enough to form curved lines most of the english fleet was among these vessels though the squadron had undergone some changes the druid had got into portsmouth with la victoire the driver and active had made the best of their way to the nearest ports with despatches for the admiralty and the achilles in tow of the dublin with the chloe to take care of both had gone to leeward with square yards in the hope of making falmouth the rest of the force was present the crippled ships having been towed into the roads that morning the picture among the shipping was one of extreme activity and liveliness jurymasts were going up in the warspite lower and topsailyards were down to be fished or new ones were rigging to be sent aloft in their places the plantagenet was all atanto again in readiness for another action with rigging secured and masts fished while none but an instructed eye could have detected at a short distance that the c√¶sar carnatic dover york elizabeth and one or two more had been in action at all the landing was crowded with boats as before and gunroom servants and midshipmens boys were foraging as usual some with honest intent to find delicacies for the wounded but more with the roguish design of contributing to the comforts of the unhurt by making appeals to the sympathies of the women of the neighbourhood in behalf of the hurt  the principal transformation that had been brought about by this state of things however was apparent at the station this spot had the appearance of a place to which the headquarters of an army had been transferred in the vicissitudes of the field warlike sailors if not soldiers flocking to it as the centre of interest and intelligence still there was a singularity observable in the manner in which these heroes of the deck paid their court the cottage being seemingly tabooed or at most approached by very few while the grass at the foot of the flagstaff was already beginning to show proofs of the pressure of many feet this particular spot indeed was the centre of attraction there officers of all ranks and ages were constantly arriving and thence they were as often departing all bearing countenances sobered by anxiety and apprehension notwithstanding the constant mutations there had been no instant since the rising of the sun when some ten or twelve at least including captains lieutenants masters and idlers had not been collected around the bench at the foot of the signalstaff and frequently the number reached even to twenty  a little retired from the crowd and near the verge of the cliff a large tent had been pitched a marine paced in its front as a sentinel another stood near the gate of the little dooryard of the cottage and all persons who approached either with the exception of a few of the privileged were referred to the sergeant who commanded the guard the arms of the latter were stacked on the grass at hand and the men off post were loitering near these were the usual military signs of the presence of officers of rank and may in sooth be taken as clues to the actual state of things on and around the head  admiral bluewater lay in the cottage while sir gervaise oakes occupied the tent the former had been transferred to the place where he was about to breathe his last at his own urgent request while his friend had refused to be separated from him so long as life remained the two flags were still flying at the mastheads of the c√¶sar a sort of melancholy memorial of the tie that had so long bound their gallant owners in the strong sympathies of an enduring personal and professional friendship  persons of the education of mrs dutton and her daughter had not dwelt so long on that beautiful headland without leaving on the spot some lasting impressions of their tastes of the cottage we have already spoken the little garden too then bright with flowers had a grace and refinement about it that we would hardly have expected to meet in such a place and even the paths that led athwart the verdant common which spread over so much of the upland had been directed with an eye to the picturesque and agreeable one of these paths too led to a rustic summerhousea sort of small rude pavilion constructed like the fences of fragments of wrecks and placed on a shelf of the cliff at a dizzy elevation but in perfect security so far from there being any danger in entering this summerhouse indeed wycherly during his six months residence near the head had made a path that descended still lower to a point that was utterly concealed from all eyes above and had actually planted a seat on another shelf with so much security that both mildred and her mother often visited it in company during the young mans recent absence the poor girl indeed had passed much of her time there weeping and suffering in solitude to this seat dutton never ventured the descent though well protected with ropes requiring greater steadiness of foot and head than intemperance had left him once or twice wycherly had induced mildred to pass an hour with him alone in this romantic place and some of his sweetest recollections of this justminded and intelligent girl were connected with the frank communications that had there occurred between them on this bench he was seated at the time of the opening of the present chapter the movement on the head and about the cottage was so great as to deprive him of every chance of seeing mildred alone and he had hoped that led by some secret sympathy she too might seek this perfectly retired seat to obtain a moment of unobserved solitude if not from some still dearer motive he had not waited long ere he heard a heavy foot over his head and a man entered the summerhouse he was yet debating whether to abandon all hopes of seeing mildred when his acute ear caught her light and wellknown footstep as she reached the summerhouse also  father i have come as you desired said the poor girl in those tremulous tones which wycherly too well understood not to imagine the condition of dutton admiral bluewater dozes and mother has permitted me to steal away  ay admiral bluewater is a great man though but little better than a dead one answered dutton as harshly in manner as the language was coarse you and your mother are all attention to him did i lie in his place which of you would be found hanging over my bed with pale cheeks and tearful eyes  both of us father do notdo not think so ill of your wife and daughter as to suppose it possible that either of them could forget her duty  yes duty might do something perhaps what has duty to do with this useless rearadmiral i hate the scoundrelhe was one of the court that cashiered me and one too that i am told was the most obstinate in refusing to help me into this pitiful berth of a master  mildred was silent she could not vindicate her friend without criminating her father as for wycherly he would have given a years income to be at sea yet he shrunk from wounding the poor daughters feelings by letting her know he overheard the dialogue this indecision made him the unwilling auditor of a conversation that he ought not to have heardan occurrence which had there been time for reflection he would have taken means to prevent  sit you down here mildred resumed dutton sternly and listen to what i have to say it is time that there should no longer be any trifling between us you have the fortunes of your mother and myself in your hands and as one of the parties so deeply concerned i am determined mine shall be settled at once  i do not understand you father said mildred with a tremour in her voice that almost induced the young man to show himself though we owe it to truth to say that a lively curiosity now mingled with his other sensations how can i have the keeping of dear mothers fortunes and yours  dear mother trulydear enough has she proved to me but i intend the daughter shall pay for it hark you mildred ill have no more of this triflingbut i ask you in a fathers name if any man has offered you his hand speak plainly and conceal nothingi will be answered  i wish to conceal nothing father that ought to be told but when a young woman declines the honour that another does her in this way ought she to reveal the secret even to her father  she ought and in your case she shall no more hesitation name one of the offers you have had  mildred after a brief pause in a low tremulous voice pronounced the name of mr rotherham  i suspected as much growled dutton there was a time when even he might have answered but we can do better than that now still he may be kept as a reserve the thousand pounds mr thomas says shall be paid and that and the living will make a comfortable port after a stormy life well who next mildred has mr thomas wychecombe ever come to the point  he has asked me to become his wife within the last twentyfour hours if that is what you mean  no affectations milly i cant bear them you know well enough what i mean what was your answer  i do not love him in the least father and of course i told him i could not marry him  that dont follow of course by any means girl the marrying is done by the priest and the love is a very different thing i hope you consider mrs dutton as my wife  what a question murmured mildred  well and do you suppose she loves me can love me now i am a disgraced impoverished man  father  comecomeenough of this mr thomas wychecombe may not be legitimatei rather think he is not by the proofs sir reginald has produced within the last day or two and i understand his own mother is dissatisfied with him and that will knock his claim flat aback notwithstanding mildred tom wychecombe has a good six hundred a year already and sir reginald himself admits that he must take all the personal property the late baronet could leave  you forget father said mildred conscious of the inefficacy of any other appeal that mr thomas has promised to pay the legacies that sir wycherly intended to leave  dont place any expectations on that mildred i dare say he would settle ten of the twenty thousand on you tomorrow if you would consent to have him but now as to this new baronet for it seems he is to have both title and estatehas he ever offered  there was a long pause during which wycherly thought he heard the hard but suppressed breathing of mildred to remain quiet any longer he felt was as impossible as indeed his conscience told him was dishonourable and he sprang along the path to ascend to the summerhouse at the first sound of his footstep a faint cry escaped mildred but when wycherly entered the pavilion he found her face buried in her hands and dutton tottering forward equally in surprise and alarm as the circumstances would not admit of evasion the young man threw aside all reserve and spoke plainly  i have been an unwilling listener to a part of your discourse with mildred mr dutton he said and can answer your last question for myself i have offered my hand to your daughter sir an offer that i now renew and the acceptance of which would make me the happiest man in england if your influence could aid mefor she has refused my hand  refused exclaimed dutton in a surprise that overcame the calculated amenity of manner he had assumed the instant wycherly appearedrefused sir wycherly wychecombe but it was before your rights had been as well established as they are now mildred answer to thishow could younay how dare you refuse such an offer as this  human nature could not well endure more mildred suffered her hands to fall helplessly into her lap and exposed a face that was lovely as that of an angels though pale nearly to the hue of death feeling extorted the answer she made though the words had hardly escaped her ere she repented having uttered them and had again buried her face in her hands  fathershe saidcould idare i to encourage sir wycherly wychecombe to unite himself to a family like ours  conscience smote dutton with a force that nearly sobered him and what explanation might have followed it is hard to say wycherly in an undertone however requested to be left alone with the daughter dutton had sense enough to understand he was de trop and shame enough to wish to escape in half a minute he had hobbled up to the summit of the cliff and disappeared  mildreddearest mildredsaid wycherly tenderly gently endeavouring to draw her attention to himself we are alone now surelysurelyyou will not refuse to look at me  is he gone asked mildred dropping her hands and looking wildly around thank god it is over for this time at least now let us go to the house admiral bluewater may miss me  no mildred not yet you surely can spare meme who have suffered so much of late on your accountnay by your meansyou can in mercy spare me a few short minutes was this the reasonthe only reason dearest girl why you so pertinaciously refused my hand  was it not sufficient wycherly answered mildred afraid the chartered air might hear her secret remember who you are and what i am could i suffer you to become the husband of one to whom such cruel cruel propositions had been made by her own father  i shall not affect to conceal my horror of such principles mildred but your virtues shine all the brighter by having flourished in their company answer me but one question frankly and every other difficulty can be gotten over do you love me well enough to be my wife were you an orphan  mildreds countenance was full of anguish but this question changed its expression entirely the moment was extraordinary as were the feelings it engendered and almost unconsciously to herself she raised the hand that held her own to her lips in a sort of reverence in the next instant she was encircled in the young mans arms and pressed with fervour to his heart  let us gosaid mildred extricating herself from an embrace that was too involuntarily bestowed and too heartfelt to alarm her delicacy i feel certain admiral bluewater will miss me  no mildred we cannot part thus give me at least the poor consolation of knowing that if this difficulty did not existthat if you were an orphan for instanceyou would be mine  oh wycherly how gladlyhow gladlybut say no morenay  this time the embrace was longer more fervent even than before and wycherly was too much of a sailor to let the sweet girl escape from his arms without imprinting on her lips a kiss he had no sooner relinquished his hold of the slight person of mildred ere it vanished with this characteristic leavetaking we change the scene to the tent of sir gervaise oakes  you have seen admiral bluewater demanded the commanderinchief as soon as the form of magrath darkened the entrance and speaking with the sudden earnestness of a man determined to know the worst if so tell me at once what hopes there are for him  of all the human passions sir jairvis answered magrath looking aside to avoid the keen glance of the other hope is generally considered by all rational men as the most treacherous and delusive i may add of all denominations or divisions of hope that which decides on life is the most unsairtain we all hope to live im thinking to a good old age and yet how many of us live just long enough to be disappointed  sir gervaise did not move until the surgeon ceased speaking then he began to pace the tent in mournful silence he understood magraths manner so well that the last faint hope he had felt from seeking his opinion was gone he now knew that his friend must die it required all his fortitude to stand up against this blow for single childless and accustomed to each other almost from infancy these two veteran sailors had got to regard themselves as merely isolated parts of the same being magrath was affected more than he chose to express and he blew his nose several times in a way that an observer would have found suspicious  will you confer on me the favour dr magrath said sir gervaise in a gentle subdued manner to ask captain greenly to come hither as you pass the flagstaff  most willingly sir jairvis and i know hell be any thing but backward in complying  it was not long ere the captain of the plantagenet made his appearance like all around him the recent victory appeared to bring no exultation  i suppose magrath told you all said the viceadmiral squeezing the others hand  he gives no hopes sir gervaise i sincerely regret to say  i knew as much i knew as much and yet he is easy greenlynay even seems happy i did feel a little hope that this absence from suffering might be a favourable omen  i am glad to hear that much sir for i have been thinking that it is my duty to speak to the rearadmiral on the subject of his brothers marriage from his own silence on the subject it is possiblenay from all circumstances it is probable he never knew of it and there may be reasons why he ought to be informed of the affair as you say he is so easy would there be an impropriety in mentioning it to him  greenly could not possibly have made a suggestion that was a greater favour to sir gervaise the necessity of doing his habits of decision and having an object in view contributed to relieve his mind by diverting his thoughts to some active duty and he seized his hat beckoned greenly to follow and moved across the hill with a rapid pace taking the path to the cottage it was necessary to pass the flagstaff as this was done every countenance met the viceadmirals glance with a look of sincere sympathy the bows that were exchanged had more in them than the naked courtesies of such salutations they were eloquent of feeling on both sides  bluewater was awake and retaining the hand of mildred affectionately in his own when his friend entered relinquishing his hold however he grasped the hand of the viceadmiral and looked earnestly at him as if he pitied the sorrow that he knew the survivor must feel  my dear bluewater commenced sir gervaise who acted under a nervous excitement as well as from constitutional decision here is greenly with something to tell you that we both think you ought to know at a moment like this  the rearadmiral regarded his friend intently as if inviting him to proceed  why its about your brother jack i fancy you cannot have known that he was ever married or i think i should have heard you speak of it  married repeated bluewater with great interest and speaking with very little difficulty i think that must be an error inconsiderate and warmhearted he was but there was only one woman he could nay would have married she is long since dead but not as his wife for that her uncle a man of great wealth but of unbending will would never have suffered he survived her though my poor brother did not  this was said in a mild voice for the wounded man spoke equally without effort and without pain  you hear greenly observed sir gervaise and yet it is not probable that you should be mistaken  certainly i am not gentlemen i saw colonel bluewater married as did another officer who is at this moment in this very fleet captain blakely is the person i mean and i know that the priest who performed the ceremony is still living a beneficed clergyman  this is wonderful to me he fervently loved agnes hedworth but his poverty was an obstacle to the union and both died so young that there was little opportunity of conciliating the uncle  that sir is your mistake agnes hedworth was the bride  a noise in the room interrupted the dialogue and the three gentlemen saw wycherly and mildred stooping to pick up the fragments of a bowl that mrs dutton had let fall the latter apparently in alarm at the little accident had sunk back into a seat pale and trembling  my dear mrs dutton take a glass of water said sir gervaise kindly approaching her your nerves have been sorely tried of late else would not such a trifle affect you  it is not that exclaimed the matron huskily it is not that oh the fearful moment has come at last and from my inmost spirit i thank thee my lord and my god that it has come free from shame and disgrace  the closing words were uttered on bended knees and with uplifted hands  motherdearest dearest mother cried mildred falling on her mothers neck what mean you what new misery has happened today  mother yes sweet one thou art thou ever shalt be my child this is the pang i have most dreaded but what is an unknown tie of blood to use and affection and to a mothers care if i did not bear thee mildred no natural mother could have loved thee more or would have died for thee as willingly  distress has disturbed her gentlemen said mildred gently extricating herself from her mothers arms and helping her to rise a few moments of rest will restore her  no darling it must come nowit ought to come nowafter what i have just heard it would be unpardonable not to tell it now did i understand you to say sir that you were present at the marriage of agnes hedworth and that too with the brother of admiral bluewater  of that fact there can be no question madam i and others will testify to it the marriage took place in london in the summer of 1725 while blakely and myself were up from portsmouth on leave colonel bluewater asked us both to be present under a pledge of secresy  and in the summer of 1726 agnes hedworth died in my house and my arms an hour after giving birth to this dear this precious childmildred dutton as she has ever since been calledmildred bluewater as it would seem her name should be  it is unnecessary to dwell on the surprise with which all present or the delight with which bluewater and wycherly heard this extraordinary announcement a cry escaped mildred who threw herself on mrs duttons neck entwining it with her arms convulsively as if refusing to permit the tie that had so long bound them together to be thus rudely torn asunder but half an hour of weeping and of the tenderest consolations calmed the poor girl a little and she was able to listen to the explanations these were exceedingly simple and so clear as in connection with the other evidence to put the facts out of all doubt  miss hedworth had become known to mrs dutton while the latter was an inmate of the house of her patron a year or two after the marriage of the lieutenant and while he was on a distant station agnes hedworth threw herself on the protection of his wife asking a refuge for a woman in the most critical circumstances like all who knew agnes hedworth mrs dutton both respected and loved her but the distance created between them by birth and station was such as to prevent any confidence the former for the few days passed with her humble friend had acted with the quiet dignity of a woman conscious of no wrong and no questions could be asked that implied doubts a succession of fainting fits prevented all communications in the hour of death and mrs dutton found herself left with a child on her hands and the dead body of her friend miss hedworth had come to her dwelling unattended and under a false name these circumstances induced mrs dutton to apprehend the worst and she proceeded to make her arrangements with great tenderness for the reputation of the deceased the body was removed to london and letters were sent to the uncle to inform him where it was to be found with a reference should he choose to inquire into the circumstances of his nieces death mrs dutton ascertained that the body was interred in the usual manner but no inquiry was ever made concerning the particulars the young duchess miss hedworths sister was then travelling in italy whence she did not return for more than a year and we may add though mrs dutton was unable to make the explanation that her inquiries after the fate of a beloved sister were met by a simple statement that she had died suddenly on a visit to a wateringplace whither she had gone with a female friend for her health whether mr hedworth himself had any suspicions of his nieces condition is uncertain but the probabilities were against it for she had offended him by refusing a match equal in all respects to that made by her elder sister with the single exception that the latter had married a man she loved whereas he exacted of agnes a very different sacrifice owing to the alienation produced by this affair there was little communication between the uncle and niece the latter passing her time in retirement and professedly with friends that the former neither knew nor cared to know in short such was the mode of life of the respective parties that nothing was easier than for the unhappy young widow to conceal her state from her uncle the motive was the fortune of the expected child this uncle having it in his power to alienate from it by will if he saw fit certain family property that might otherwise descend to the issue of the two sisters as his coheiresses what might have happened in the end or what poor agnes meditated doing can never be known death closing the secret with his irremovable seal  mrs dutton was the mother of a girl but three months old at the time this little stranger was left on her hands a few weeks later her own child died and having waited several months in vain for tidings from the hedworth family she had the surviving infant christened by the same name as that borne by her own daughter and soon came to love it as much perhaps as if she had borne it three years passed in this manner when the time drew near for the return of her husband from the east indies to be ready to meet him she changed her abode to a naval port and in so doing changed her domestics this left her accidentally but fortunately as she afterwards thought completely mistress of the secret of mildreths birth the one or two others to whom it was known being in stations to render it improbable they should ever communicate any thing on the subject unless it were asked of them her original intention however was to communicate the facts without reserve to her husband but he came back an altered man brutal in manners cold in his affections and the victim of drunkenness by this time the wife was too much attached to the child to think of exposing it to the wayward caprices of such a being and mildred was educated and grew in stature and beauty as the real offspring of her reputed parents  all this mrs dutton related clearly and briefly refraining of course from making any allusion to the conduct of her husband and referring all her own benevolence to her attachment to the child bluewater had strength enough to receive mildred in his arms and he kissed her pale cheek again and again blessing her in the most fervent and solemn manner  my feelings were not treacherous or unfaithful he said i loved thee sweetest from the first sir gervaise oakes has my will made in thy favour before we sailed on this last cruise and every shilling i leave will be thine mr atwood procure that will and add a codicil explaining this recent discovery and confirming the legacy let not the last be touched for it is spontaneous and comes from the heart  and now answered mrs dutton enough has passed for once the sickbed should be more quiet give me my child againi cannot yet consent to part with her for ever  mother mother exclaimed mildred throwing herself on mrs duttons bosomi am yours and yours only  not so i fear mildred if all i suspect be true and this is as proper a moment as another to place that matter also before your honoured uncle come forward sir wycherlyi have understood you to say this minute in my ear that you hold the pledge of this wilful girl to become your wife should she ever be an orphan an orphan she is and has been since the first hour of her birth  nonono murmured mildred burying her face still deeper in her mothers bosom not while you live can i be an orphan not nowanother timethis is unseasonablecruelnay it is not what i said  take her away dearest mrs dutton said bluewater tears of joy forcing themselves from his eyes take her away lest too much happiness come upon me at once my thoughts should be calmer at such a moment  wycherly removed mildred from her mothers arms and gently led her from the room when in mrs duttons apartment he whispered something in the ear of the agitated girl that caused her to turn on him a look of happiness though it came dimmed with tears then he had his turn of holding her for another precious instant to his heart  my dear mrs duttonnay my dear mother he said mildred and myself have both need of parents i am an orphan like herself and we can never consent to part with you look forward i entreat you to making one of our family in all things for never can either mildred or myself cease to consider you as any thing but a parent entitled to more than common reverence and affection  wycherly had hardly uttered this proper speech when he received what he fancied a tenfold reward mildred in a burst of natural feeling without affectation or reserve but yielding to her heart only threw her arms around his neck murmured the word thanks several times and wept freely on his bosom when mrs dutton received the sobbing girl from him wycherly kissed the mothers cheek and he left the room  admiral bluewater would not consent to seek his repose until he had a private conference with his friend and wycherly the latter was frankness and liberality itself but the former would not wait for settlements these he trusted to the young mans honour his own time was short and he should die perfectly happy could he leave his niece in the care of one like our virginian he wished the marriage to take place in his presence on this he even insisted and of course wycherly make no objections but went to state the case to mrs dutton and mildred  it is singular dick said sir gervaise wiping his eyes as he looked from a window that commanded a view of the sea that i have left both our flags flying in the c√¶sar i declare the oddness of the circumstance never struck me till this minute  let them float thus a little longer gervaise they have faced many a gale and many a battle together and may endure each others company a few hours longer     chapter xxx      compound or weakness and of strength       mighty yet ignorant of thy power     loftier than earth or air or sea       yet meaner than the lowliest flower           margaret davidson   not a syllable of explanation reproach or selfaccusation had passed between the commanderinchief and the rearadmiral since the latter received his wound each party appeared to blot out the events of the last few days leaving the long vista of their past services and friendship undisfigured by a single unsightly or unpleasant object sir gervaise while he retained an active superintendence of his fleet and issued the necessary orders right and left hovered around the bed of bluewater with the assiduity and almost with the tenderness of a woman still not the slightest allusion was made to the recent battles or to any thing that had occurred in the short cruise the speech recorded at the close of the last chapter was the first words he had uttered which might in any manner carry the mind of either back to events that both might wish forgotten the rearadmiral felt this forbearance deeply and now that the subject was thus accidentally broached between them he had a desire to say something in continuation still he waited until the baronet had left the window and taken a seat by his bed  gervaise bluewater then commenced speaking low from weakness but speaking distinctly from feeling i cannot die without asking your forgiveness there were several hours when i actually meditated treasoni will not say to my king on that point my opinions are unchangedbut to you  why speak of this dick you did not know yourself when you believed it possible to desert me in the face of the enemy how much better i judged of your character is seen in the fact that i did not hesitate to engage double my force well knowing that you could not fail to come to my rescue  bluewater looked intently at his friend and a smile of serious satisfaction passed over his pallid countenance as he listened to sir gervaises words which were uttered with his usual warmth and sincerity of manner  i believe you know me better than i know myself he answered after a thoughtful pause yes better than i know myself what a glorious close to our professional career would it have been oakes had i followed you into battle as was our old practice and fallen in your wake imitating your own high example  it is better as it is dickif any thing that has so sad a termination can be wellyes it is better as it is you have fallen at my side as it were we will think or talk no more of this  we have been friends and close friends too for a long period gervaise returned bluewater stretching his arm from the bed with the long thin fingers of the hand extended to meet the others grasp yet i cannot recall an act of yours which i can justly lay to heart as unkind or untrue  god forgive me if you cani hope not dick most sincerely do i hope not it would give me great pain to believe it  you have no cause for selfreproach in no one act or thought can you justly accuse yourself with injuring me i should die much happier could i say the same of myself oakes  thoughtdickthought you never meditated aught against me in your whole life the love you bear me is the true reason why you lie there at this blessed moment  it is grateful to find that i have been understood i am deeply indebted to you oakes for declining to signal me and my division down when i foolishly requested that untimely forbearance i was then suffering an anguish of mind to which any pain of the body i may now endure is an elysium your selfdenial gave time  for the heart to prompt you to that which your feelings yearned to do from the first bluewater interrupted sir gervaise and now as your commanding officer i enjoin silence on this subject for ever  i will endeavour to obey it will not be long oakes that i shall remain under your orders added the rearadmiral with a painful smile there should be no charge of mutiny against me in the last act of my life you ought to forgive the one sin of omission when you remember how much and how completely my will has been subject to yours during the last fiveandthirty yearshow little my mind has matured a professional thought that yours has not originated  speak no more of forgive i charge you dick that you have shown a girllike docility in obeying all my orders too is a truth i will aver before god and man but when it comes to mind i am far from asserting that mine has had the mastery i do believe could the truth he ascertained it would be found that i am at this blessed moment enjoying a professional reputation which is more than half due to you  it matters little now gervaiseit matters little now we were two lighthearted and gay lads oakes when we first met as boys fresh from school and merry as health and spirits could make us  we were indeed dickyes we were thoughtless as if this sad moment were never to arrive  there were george anson and peter warren little charley saunders jack byng and a set of us that did indeed live as if we were never to die we carried our lives as it might be in our hands oakes  there is much of that dick in boyhood and youth but he is happiest after all who can meet this moment as you docalmly and yet without any dependence on his own merits  i had an excellent mother oakes little do we think in youth how much we owe to the unextinguishable tenderness and farseeing lessons of our mothers ours both died while we were young yet i do think we were their debtors for far more than we could ever repay  sir gervaise simply assented but making no immediate answer otherwise a long pause succeeded during which the viceadmiral fancied that his friend was beginning to doze he was mistaken  you will be made viscount bowldero for these last affairs gervaise the wounded man unexpectedly observed showing how much his thoughts were still engrossed with the interests of his friend nor do i see why you should again refuse a peerage those who remain in this world may well yield to its usages and opinions while they do not interfere with higher obligations  iexclaimed sir gervaise gloomily the thought of so commemorating what has happened would be worse than defeat to me noi ask no change of name to remind me constantly of my loss  bluewater looked grateful rather than pleased but he made no answer now he fell into a light slumber from which he did not awake until the time he had himself set for the marriage of wycherly and mildred with one uncle dead and still unburied and another about to quit the world for ever a rite that is usually deemed as joyous as it is solemn might seem unseasonable but the dying man had made it a request that he might have the consolation of knowing ere he expired that he left his niece under the legal protection of one as competent as he was desirous of protecting her the reader must imagine the arguments that were used for the occasion but they were such as disposed all in the end to admit the propriety of yielding their ordinary prejudices to the exigencies of the moment it may be well to add also to prevent useless cavilling that the laws of england were not as rigid on the subject of the celebration of marriages in 1745 as they subsequently became and that it was lawful then to perform the ceremony in a private house without a license and without the publishing of banns even restrictions that were imposed a few years later the penalty for dispensing with the publication of banns was a fine of ¬£100 imposed on the clergyman and this fine bluewater chose to pay rather than leave the only great object of life that now remained before him unaccomplished this penalty in no degree impaired the validity of the contract though mrs dutton as a woman felt averse to parting with her beloved without a rigid observance of all the customary forms the point had finally been disposed of by recourse to arguments addressed to the reason of this respectable woman and by urging the necessity of the case her consent however was not given without a proviso that a license should be subsequently procured and a second marriage be had at a more fitting moment should the ecclesiastical authorities consent to the same a most improbable thing in itself  mr rotherham availed himself of the statute inflicting the penalty as an excuse for not officiating his real motive however was understood and the chaplain of the plantagenet a divine of character and piety was substituted in his place bluewater had requested that as many of the captains of the fleet should be present as could be collected and it was the assembling of these warriors of the deep together with the arrival of the clergyman that first gave notice of the approach of the appointed hour  it is not our intention to dwell on the details of a ceremony that had so much that was painful in its solemnities neither wycherly nor mildred made any change in their attire and the lovely bride wept from the time the service began to the moment when she left the arms of her uncle to be received in those of her husband and was supported from the room all seemed sad indeed but bluewater to him the scene was exciting but it brought great relief to his mind  i am now ready to die gentlemen he said as the door closed on the newmarried couple my last worldly care is disposed of and it were better for me to turn all my thoughts to another state of being my niece lady wychecombe will inherit the little i have to leave nor do i know that it is of much importance to substantiate her birth as her uncle clearly bestowed what would have been her mothers property on her aunt the duchess if my dying declaration can be of any use however you hear it and can testify to it now come and take leave of me one by one that i may bless you all and thank you for much undeserved and i fear unrequited love  the scene that followed was solemn and sad one by one the captains drew near the bed and to each the dying man had something kind and affectionate to say even the most coldhearted looked grave and oneil a man remarkable for a gait√© de coeur that rendered the excitement of battle some of the pleasantest moments of his life literally shed tears on the hand he kissed  ah my old friend said the rearadmiral as parker of the carnatic drew near in his customary meek and subdued manner you perceive it is not years alone that bring us to our graves they tell me you have behaved as usual in these late affairs i trust that after a long life of patient and arduous services you are about to receive a proper reward  i will acknowledge admiral bluewater returned parker earnestly that it would be peculiarly grateful to receive some mark of the approbation of my sovereign principally on account of my dear wife and children we are not like yourself descended from a noble family but must carve our rights to distinction and they who have never known honours of this nature prize them highly  ay my good parker interrupted the rearadmiral and they who have ever known them know their emptiness most especially as they approach that verge of existence whence the eye looks in a near and fearful glance over the vast and unknown range of eternity  no doubt sir nor am i so vain as to suppose that hairs which have got to be grey as mine can last for ever but what i was about to say is that precious as honours are to the humble i would cheerfully yield every hope of the sort i have to see you on the poop of the c√¶sar again with mr cornet at your elbow leading the fleet or following the motions of the viceadmiral  thank you my good parker that can never be nor can i say now that i wish it might when we have cast off from the world there is less pleasure in looking back than in looking ahead god bless you parker and keep you as you ever have been an honest man  stowel was the last to approach the bed nor did he do it until all had left the room but sir gervaise and himself  the indomitable goodnature and the professional nonchalance of bluewater by leaving every subordinate undisturbed in the enjoyment of his own personal caprices had rendered the rearadmiral a greater favourite in one sense at least than the commanderinchief stowel by his near connection with bluewater had profited more by these peculiarities than any other officer under him and the effect on his feelings had been in a very just proportion to the benefits he could not refrain it is true from remembering the day when he himself had been a lieutenant in the ship in which the rearadmiral had been a midshipman but he no longer recollected the circumstance with the bitterness that it sometimes drew after it on the contrary it was now brought to his mind merely as the most distant of the many landmarks in their long and joint services  well stowel observed bluewater smiling sadly even the old c√¶sar must be left behind it is seldom a flagcaptain has not some heartburnings on account of his superior and most sincerely do i beg you to forget and forgive any i may have occasioned yourself  heaven help me siri was far just then from thinking of any such thing i was fancying how little i should have thought it probable when we were together in the calypso that i should ever be thus standing at your bedside really admiral bluewater i would rejoice to share with you the remnant of life that is left me  i do believe you would stowel but that can never be i have just performed my last act in this world in giving my niece to sir wycherly wychecombe  yes siryes sirmarriage is no doubt honourable as i often tell mrs stowel and therefore not to be despised and yet it is singular that a gentleman who has lived a bachelor himself should fancy to see a marriage ceremony performed and that too at the cost of ¬£100 if any person choose to complain just at the close of his own cruise however men are no more alike in such matters than women in their domestic qualities and i sincerely hope this young sir wycherly may find as much comfort in the old house i understand he has a little inland here as you and i have had together sir in the old c√¶sar i suppose therell be no coequals in wychecombe hall  i trust not stowel but you must now receive my last orders as to the c√¶sar  the commanderinchief has his own flag flying aboard of us sir interrupted the methodical captain in a sort of admonitory way  never mind that stowelill answer for his acquiescence my body must be received on board and carried round in the ship to plymouth place it on the maindeck where the people can see the coffin i would pass my last hours above ground in their midst  it shall be done siryes sir to the letter sir gervaise not countermanding and ill write this evening to mrs stowel to say she neednt come down as usual as soon as she hears the ship is in but that she must wait until your flag is fairly struck  i should be sorry stowel to cause a moments delay in the meeting of husband and wife  dont name it admiral bluewatermrs stowel will understand that its duty and when we married i fully explained to her that duty with a sailor came before matrimony  a little pause succeeded then bluewater took a final and affectionate leave of his captain some twenty minutes elapsed in a profound silence during which sir gervaise did not stir fancying that his friend again dozed but it was ordered that bluewater was never to sleep again until he took the final rest of the dead it was the mind which had always blazed above the duller lethargy of his body that buoyed him thus up giving an unnatural impulse to his physical powers an impulse however that was but momentary and which by means of the reaction contributed in the end to his more speedy dissolution perceiving at length that his friend did not sleep sir gervaise drew near his bed  richard he said gently there is one without who pines to be admitted i have refused even his tears under the impression that you felt disposed to sleep  never less so my mind appears to become brighter and clearer instead of fading i think i shall never sleep in the sense you mean whoever the person is let him be admitted  receiving this permission sir gervaise opened the door and geoffrey cleveland entered at the same moment galleygo who came and went at pleasure thrust in his own ungainly form the boys face betrayed the nature and the extent of his grief in his mind admiral bluewater was associated with all the events of his own professional life and though the period had in truth been so short in his brief existence the vista through which he looked back seemed quite as long as that which marked the friendship of the two admirals themselves although he struggled manfully for selfcontrol feeling got the better of the lad and he threw himself on his knees at the side of his bed sobbing as if his heart would break bluewaters eye glistened and he laid a hand affectionately on the head of his young relative  gervaise you will take charge of this boy when im gone he said receive him in your own ship i leave him to you as a very near and dear professional legacy cheer upcheer upmy brave boy look upon all this as a sailors fortune our lives are the  the word kings which should have succeeded seemed to choke the speaker casting a glance of meaning at his friend with a painful smile on his face he continued silent  ah dear sir answered the midshipman ingenuously i knew that we might all be killed but it never occurred to me that an admiral could lose his life in battle im sureim sure you are the very first that has met with this accident  not by many my poor geoffrey as there are but few admirals few fall but we are as much exposed as others  if i had only run that monsieur des prez through the body when we closed with him returned the boy grating his teeth and looking all the vengeance for which at the passing instant he felt the desire it would have been something i might have done it too for he was quite unguarded  it would have been a very bad thing boy to have injured a brave man uselessly  of what use was it to shoot you sir we took their ship just the same as if you had not been hurt  i rather think geoffrey their ship was virtually taken before i was wounded returned bluewater smiling but i was shot by a french marine who did no more than his duty  yes sir exclaimed the boy impatiently and he escaped without a scratch he at least ought to have been massacred  thou art bloodyminded child i scarce know thee massacred is not a word for either a british nobleman or a british sailor i saved the life of that marine and when you come to lie like me on your deathbed geoffrey you will learn how sweet a consolation can be derived from the consciousness of such an act we all need mercy and none ought to expect it for themselves who do not yield it to others  the boy was rebuked and his feelings took a better though scarcely a more natural direction bluewater now spoke to him of his newlydiscovered cousin and had a melancholy satisfaction in creating an interest in behalf of mildred in the breast of the noblehearted and ingenuous boy the latter listened with respectful attention as had been his wont until deceived by the tranquil and benevolent manner of bluewater he permitted himself to fall into the natural delusion of believing the wound of the rearadmiral less serious than he had supposed and to begin to entertain hopes that the wounded man might yet survive calmed by these feelings he soon ceased to weep and promising discretion was permitted by sir gervaise to remain in the room where he busied himself in the offices of a nurse  another long pause succeeded this exciting little scene during which bluewater lay quietly communing with himself and his god sir gervaise wrote orders and read reports though his eye was never off the countenance of his friend more than a minute or two at a time at length the rearadmiral aroused himself again and began to take an interest once more in the persons and things around him  galleygo my old fellowcruiser he said i leave sir gervaise more particularly in your care as we advance in life our friends decrease in numbers it is only those that have been well tried that we can rely on  yes admiral blue i knows that and so does sir jarvy yes old shipmates afore young uns any day and old sailors too afore green hands sir jarvys bowlderos are good plateholders and the likes of that but when it comes to heavy weather and a hard strain i thinks but little on em all put together  by the way oakes said bluewater with a sudden interest in such a subject that he never expected to feel again i have heard nothing of the first days work in which through the little i have gleaned by listening to those around me i understand you took a twodecker besides dismasting the french admiral  pardon me dick you had better try and catch a little sleep the subject of those two days work is really painful to me  well then sir jarvy if you has an avarsion to telling the story to admiral blue i can do it your honour put in galleygo who gloried in giving a graphic description of a seafight i thinks now a history of that day will comfort a flaghofficer as has been so badly wounded himself  bluewater offering no opposition galleygo proceeded with his account of the evolutions of the ships as we have already described them succeeding surprisingly well in rendering the narrative interesting and making himself perfectly intelligible and clear by his thorough knowledge and ready use of the necessary nautical terms when he came to the moment in which the english line separated part passing to windward and part to leeward of the two french ships he related the incident in so clear and spirited a manner that the commanderinchief himself dropped his pen and sat listening with pleasure  who could imagine dick sir gervaise observed that those fellows in the tops watch us so closely and could give so accurate an account of what passes  ah gervaise and what is the vigilance of galleygo to that of the allseeing eye it is a terrible thought at an hour like this to remember that nothing can be forgotten i have somewhere read that not an oath is uttered that does not continue to vibrate through all time in the widespreading currents of soundnot a prayer lisped that its record is not also to be found stamped on the laws of nature by the indelible seal of the almightys will  there was little in common between the religious impressions of the two friends they were both sailors and though the word does not necessarily imply that they were sinners in an unusual degree neither does it rigidly imply that they were saints each had received the usual elementary education and then each had been turned adrift as it might be on the ocean of life to suffer the seed to take root and the fruit to ripen as best they might few of those who go down to the great deep in ships and who escape the more brutalizing effects of lives so rude are altogether without religious impressions living so much as it were in the immediate presence of the power of god the sailor is much disposed to reverence his omnipotence even while he transgresses his laws but in nearly all those instances in which nature has implanted a temperament inclining to deep feeling as was the case with bluewater not even the harsh examples nor the loose or irresponsible lives of men thus separated from the customary ties of society can wholly extinguish the reverence for god which is created by constantly dwelling in the presence of his earthly magnificence this sentiment in bluewater had not been altogether without fruits for he both read and reflected much sometimes though at isolated and distant intervals he even prayed and that fervently and with a strong and full sense of his own demerits as a consequence of this general disposition and of the passing convictions his mind was better attuned for the crisis before him than would have been the case with most of his brethren in arms who when overtaken with the fate so common to the profession are usually left to sustain their last moments with the lingering enthusiasm of strife and victory  on the other hand sir gervaise was as simple as a child in matters of this sort he had a reverence for his creator and such general notions of his goodness and love as the welldisposed are apt to feel but all the dogmas concerning the lost condition of the human race the mediation and the power of faith floated in his mind as opinions not to be controverted and yet as scarcely to be felt in short the commanderinchief admitted the practical heresy which overshadows the faith of millions while he deemed himself to be a stout advocate of church and king still sir gervaise oakes on occasions was more than usually disposed to seriousness and was even inclined to be devout but it was without much regard to theories or revelation at such moments while his opinions would not properly admit him within the pale of any christian church in particular his feelings might have identified him with all in a word we apprehend he was a tolerably fair example of what vague generalities when acting on a temperament not indisposed to moral impressions render the great majority of men who flit around the mysteries of a future state without alighting either on the consolations of faith or discovering any of those logical conclusions which half the time unconsciously to themselves they seem to expect when bluewater made his last remark therefore the viceadmiral looked anxiously at his friend and religion for the first time since the other received his hurt mingled with his reflections he had devoutly though mentally returned thanks to god for his victory but it had never occurred to him that bluewater might need some preparation for death  would you like to see the plantagenets chaplain again dick he said tenderly you are no papist of that i am certain  in that you are quite right gervaise i consider all churchesthe one holy catholic church if you will as but a means furnished by divine benevolence to aid weak men in their pilgrimage but i also believe that there is even a shorter way to his forgiveness than through these common avenues how far i am right he added smiling none will probably know better than myself a few hours hence  friends must meet again hereafter bluewater it is irrational to suppose that they who have loved each other so well in this state of being are to be for ever separated in the other  we will hope so oakes taking the viceadmirals hand we will hope so still there will be no ships for usno cruisesno victoriesno triumphs it is only at moments like this at which i have arrived that we come to view these things in their proper light of all the past your constant unwavering friendship gives me the most pleasure  the viceadmiral could resist no longer he turned aside and wept this tribute to nature in one so manly was imposing even to the dying man and galleygo regarded it with awe familiar as the latter had become with his master by use and indulgence no living being in his estimation was as authoritative or as formidable as the commanderinchief and the effect of the present spectacle was to induce him to hide his own face in selfabasement bluewater saw it all but he neither spoke nor gave any token of his observation he merely prayed and that right fervently not only for his friend but for his humble and uncouth follower  a reaction took place in the system of the wounded man about nine oclock that night at this time he believed himself near his end and he sent for wycherly and his niece to take his leave of them mrs dutton was also present as was magrath who remained on shore in attendance mildred lay for half an hour bathing her uncles pillow with her tears until she was removed at the surgeons suggestion  yell see sir gervaise he whisperedor sir jairvis as he always pronounced the nameyell see sir jairvis that its a duty of the faculty to prolong life even when theres no hope of saving it and if yell be regairding the judgment of a professional man lady wychecombe had better withdraw it would really be a matter of honest exultation for us plantagenets to get the rearadmiral through the night seeing that the surgeon of the c√¶sar said he could no survive the setting sun  at the moment of final separation bluewater had little to say to his niece ho kissed and blessed her again and again and then signed that she should be taken away mrs dutton also came in for a full share of his notice he having desired her to remain after wycherly and mildred had quitted the room  to your care and affection excellent woman he said in a voice that had now sunk nearly to a whisperwe owe it that mildred is not unfit for her station her recovery would have been even more painful than her loss had she been restored to her proper family uneducated vulgar and coarse  that could hardly have happened to mildred sir in any circumstances answered the weeping woman nature has done too much for the dear child to render her any thing but delicate and lovely under any tolerable circumstances of depression  she is better as she is and god be thanked that he raised up such a protector for her childhood you have been all in all to her in her infancy and she will strive to repay it to your age  of this mrs dutton felt too confident to need assurances and receiving the dying mans blessing she knelt at his bedside prayed fervently for a few minutes and withdrew after this nothing out of the ordinary track occurred until past midnight and magrath more than once whispered his joyful anticipations that the rearadmiral would survive until morning an hour before day however the wounded man revived in a way that the surgeon distrusted he knew that no physical change of this sort could well happen that did not arise from the momentary ascendency of mind over matter as the spirit is on the point of finally abandoning its earthly tenement a circumstance of no unusual occurrence in patients of strong and active intellectual properties whose faculties often brighten for an instant in their last moments as the lamp flashes and glares as it is about to become extinct going to the bed he examined his patient attentively and was satisfied that the final moment was near  youre a man and a soldier sir jairvis he said in a low voice and itll no be doing good to attempt misleading your judgment in a case of this sort our respectable friend the rearadmiral is articulo mortis as one might almost say he cannot possibly survive half an hour  sir gervaise started he looked around him a little wistfully for at that moment he would have given much to be alone with his dying friend but he hesitated to make a request which it struck him might seem improper from this embarrassment however he was relieved by bluewater himself who had the same desire without the same scruples about confessing it he drew the surgeon to his side and whispered a wish to be left alone with the commanderinchief  well there will be no trespass on the rules of practice in indulging the poor man in his desire muttered magrath as he looked about him to gather the last of his professional instruments like the workman who is about to quit one place of toil to repair to another and ill just be indulging him  so saying he pushed galleygo and geoffrey from the room before him left it himself and closed the door  finding himself alone sir gervaise knelt at the side of the bed and prayed holding the hand of his friend in both his own the example of mrs dutton and the yearnings of his own heart exacted this sacrifice when it was over he felt a great relief from sensations that nearly choked him  do you forgive me gervaise whispered bluewater  name it notname it not my best friend we all have our moments of weakness and our need of pardon may god forget all my sins as freely as i forget your errors  god bless you oakes and keep you the same simpleminded truehearted man you have ever been  sir gervaise buried his face in the bedclothes and groaned  kiss me oakes murmured the rearadmiral  in order to do this the commanderinchief rose from his knees and bent over the body of his friend as he raised himself from the cheek he had saluted a benignant smile gleamed on the face of the dying man and he ceased to breathe near half a minute followed however before the last and most significant breath that is ever drawn from man was given the remainder of that night sir gervaise oakes passed in the chamber alone pacing the floor recalling the many scenes of pleasure danger pain and triumph through which he and the dead had passed in company with the return of light he summoned the attendants and retired to his tent     chapter xxxi      and they came for the buried king that lay       at rest in that ancient fane     for he must be armed on the battle day       with them to deliver spain     then the march went sounding on     and the moors by noontide sun       were dust on tolosas plain           mrs hemans   it remains only to give a rapid sketch of the fortunes of our principal characters and of the few incidents that are more immediately connected with what has gone before the death of bluewater was announced to the fleet at sunrise by hauling down his flag from the mizzen of the c√¶sar the viceadmirals flag came down with it and reappeared at the next minute at the fore of the plantagenet but the little white emblem of rank never went aloft again in honour of the deceased at noon it was spread over his coffin on the maindeck of the ship agreeably to his own request and more than once that day did some rough old tar use it to wipe the tear from his eyes  in the afternoon of the day after the death of one of our heroes the wind came round to the westward and all the vessels lifted their anchors and proceeded to plymouth the crippled ships by this time were in a state to carry more or less sail and a stranger who had seen the melancholylooking line as it rounded the start would have fancied it a beaten fleet on its return to port the only signs of exultation that appeared were the jacks that were flying over the white flags of the prizes and even when all had anchored the same air of sadness reigned among these victorious mariners the body was landed with the usual forms but the procession of warriors of the deep that followed it was distinguished by a gravity that exceeded the ordinary aspects of mere form many of the captains and greenly in particular had viewed the manoeuvring of bluewater with surprise and the latter not altogether without displeasure but his subsequent conduct completely erased these impressions leaving no other recollection connected with his conduct that morning than the brilliant courage and admirable handling of his vessels by which the fortunes of a nearly desperate day were retrieved those who did reflect any longer on the subject attributed the singularity of the course pursued by the rearadmiral to some private orders communicated in the telegraphic signal as already mentioned  it is unnecessary for us to dwell on the particular movements of the fleet after it reached plymouth the ships were repaired the prizes received into the service and in due time all took the sea again ready and anxious to encounter their countrys enemies they ran the careers usual to english heavy cruisers in that age and as ships form characters in this work perhaps it may not be amiss to take a general glance at their several fortunes together with those of their respective commanders sir gervaise fairly wore out the plantagenet which vessel was broken up three years later though not until she had carried a blue flag at her main more than two years greenly lived to be a rearadmiral of the red and died of yellowfever in the island of barbadoes the c√¶sar with stowel still in command of her foundered at sea in a winters cruise in the baltic every soul perishing this calamity occurred the winter succeeding the summer of our legend and the only relieving circumstance connected with the disaster was the fact that her commander got rid of mrs stowel altogether from that day forward the thunderer had her share in many a subsequent battle and foley her captain died rearadmiral of england and a viceadmiral of the red thirty years later the carnatic was commanded by parker until the latter got a right to hoist a blue flag at the mizzen which was done for just one day to comply with form when both ship and admiral were laid aside as too old for further use it should be added however that parker was knighted by the king on board his own ship a circumstance that cast a halo of sunshine over the close of the life of one who had commenced his career so humbly as to render this happy close more than equal to his expectations in direct opposition to this it may be said here that sir gervaise refused for the third time to be made viscount bowldero with a feeling just the reverse of that of parkers for secure of his social position and careless of politics he viewed the elevation with an indifference that was a natural consequence enough of his own birth fortune and high character on this occasionit was after another victorygeorge ii personally alluded to the subject remarking that the success we have recorded had never met with its reward when the old seaman let out the true secret of his pertinaciously declining an honour about which he might otherwise have been supposed to be as indifferent to the acceptance as to the refusal sir he answered to the remark of the king i am duly sensible of your majestys favour but i can never consent to receive a patent of nobility that in my eyes will always seem to be sealed with the blood of my closest and best friend this reply was remembered and the subject was never adverted to again  the fate of the blenheim was one of those impressive blanks that dot the pages of nautical history she sailed for the mediterranean alone and after she had discharged her pilot was never heard of again this did not occur however until captain sterling had been killed on her decks in one of sir gervaises subsequent actions the achilles was suffered to drift in too near to some heavy french batteries before the treaty of aixlachapelle was signed and after every stick had been again cut out of her she was compelled to lower her flag his earldom and his courage saved lord morganic from censure but being permitted to go up to paris previously to his exchange he contracted a matrimonial engagement with a celebrated danseuse a craft that gave him so much future employment that he virtually abandoned his profession nevertheless his name was on the list of viceadmirals of the blue when he departed this life the warspite and captain goodfellow both died natural deaths one as a receivingship and the other as a rearadmiral of the white the dover captain drinkwater was lost in attempting to weather scilly in a gale when her commander and quite half her crew were drowned the york did many a hard days duty before her time arrived but in the end she was so much injured in a general action as to be abandoned and set fire to at sea her commander was lost overboard in the very first cruise she took after that related in this work the elizabeth rotted as a guardship in the medway and captain blakely retired from the service with one arm a yellow admiral the dublin laid her bones in the cove of cork having been condemned after a severe winter passed on the north coast captain oneil was killed in a duel with a french officer after the peace the latter having stated that his ship had run away from two frigates commanded by the chevalier the chloe was taken by an enemys fleet in the next war but captain denham worked his way up to a white flag at the main and a peerage the druid was wrecked that very summer chasing inshore near bordeaux and blewet in a professional point of view never regained the ground he lost on this occasion as for the sloops and cutters they went the way of all small cruisers while their nameless commanders shared the usual fates of mariners  wycherly remained at wychecombe until the interment of his uncle took place at which aided by sir reginalds influence and knowledge and in spite of toms intrigues he appeared as chief mourner the affair of the succession was also so managed as to give him very little trouble tom discovering that his own illegitimacy was known and seeing the hopelessness of a contest against such an antagonist as sir reginald who knew quite as much of the facts as he did of the law of the case was fain to retire from the field from that moment no one heard any thing more of the legacies in the end he received the ¬£20000 in the five per cents and the few chattels sir wycherly had a right to give away but his enjoyment of them was short as he contracted a severe cold that very autumn and died of a malignant fever in a few weeks leaving no will his property escheated but it was all restored to his two uterine brothers by the liberality of the ministry and out of respect to the long services of the baron which two brothers it will he remembered alone had any of the blood of wychecombe in their veins to boast of this was disposing of the savings of both the baronet and the judge with a very suitable regard to moral justice  wycherly also appeared though it was in company with sir gervaise oakes as one of the principal mourners at the funeral obsequies of admiral bluewater these were of a public character and took place in westminster abbey the carriages of that portion of the royal personages who were not restrained by the laws of courtetiquette appeared in the procession and several members of that very family that the deceased regarded as intruders were present incog at his last rites this however was but one of the many illusions that the great masquerade of life is constantly offering to the public gaze  there was little difficulty in establishing the claims of mildred to be considered the daughter of colonel bluewater and agnes hedworth lord bluewater was soon satisfied and as he was quite indifferent to the possession of his kinsmans money an acquisition he neither wished nor expected the most perfect goodwill existed between the parties there was more difficulty with the duchess of glamorgan who had acquired too many of the notions of very high rank to look with complacency on a niece that had been educated as the daughter of a sailingmaster in the navy she raised many objections while she admitted that she had been the confidant of her sisters attachment to john bluewater her second son geoffrey did more to remove her scruples than all the rest united and when sir gervaise oakes in person condescended to make a journey to the park to persuade her to examine the proofs she could not well decline as soon as one of her really candid mind entered into the inquiry the evidence was found to be irresistible and she at once yielded to the feelings of nature wycherly had been indefatigable in establishing his wifes claimsmore so indeed than in establishing his own and at the suggestion of the viceadmiralor admiral of the white as he had become by a recent general promotionhe consented to accompany the latter in this visit waiting at the nearest town however for a summons to the park as soon as it could be ascertained that his presence would be agreeable to its mistress  if my niece prove but half as acceptable in appearance as my nephew sir gervaise observed the duchess when the young virginian was introduced to her and laying stress on the word we have italicisednothing can be wanting to the agreeables of this new connection i am impatient now to see my niece sir wycherly wychecombe has prepared me to expect a young woman of more than common merit  my life on it duchess he has not raised your expectations too high the poor girl is still dwelling in her cottage the companion of her reputed mother but it is time wychecombe that you had claimed your bride  i expect to find her and mrs dutton at the hall on my return sir gervaise it having been thus arranged between us the sad ceremonies through which we have lately been were unsuited to the introduction of the new mistress to her abode and the last had been deferred to a more fitting occasion  let the first visit that lady wychecombe pays be to this place said the duchess i do not command it sir wycherly as one who has some slight claims to her duty but i solicit it as one who wishes to possess every hold upon her love her mother was an only sister and an only sisters child must be very near to one  it would have been impossible for the duchess of glamorgan to have said as much as this before she saw the young virginian but now he had turned out a person so very different from what she expected she had lively hopes in behalf of her niece  wycherly returned to wychecombe after this short visit to mildreds aunt and found his lovely bride in quiet possession accompanied by her mother dutton still remained at the station for he had the sagacity to see that he might not be welcome and modesty enough to act with a cautious reserve but wycherly respected his excellent wife too profoundly not to have a due regard to her feelings in all things and the master was invited to join the party brutality and meanness united like those which belonged to the character of dutton are not easily abashed and he accepted the invitation in the hope that after all he was to reap as many advantages by the marriage of mildred with the affluent baronet as if she had actually been his daughter  after passing a few weeks in sober happiness at home wycherly felt it due to all parties to carry his wife to the park in order that she might make the acquaintance of the near relatives who dwelt there mrs dutton by invitation was of the party but dutton was left behind having no necessary connection with the scenes and the feelings that were likely to occur it would be painting the duchess too much en beau were we to say that she met mildred without certain misgivings and fears but the first glimpse of her lovely niece completely put natural feelings in the ascendency the resemblance to her sister was so strong as to cause a piercing cry to escape her and bursting into tears she folded the trembling young woman to her heart with a fervour and sincerity that set at naught all conventional manners this was the commencement of a close intimacy which lasted but a short time however the duchess dying two years later  wycherly continued in the service until the peace of aixlachapelle when he finally quitted the sea his strong native attachments led him back to virginia where all his own nearest relatives belonged and where his whole heart might be said to be when he saw mildred and his children at his side with him early associations and habits had more strength than traditions and memorials of the past he erected a spacious dwelling on the estate inherited from his father where he passed most of his time consigning wychecombe to the care of a careful steward with the additions and improvements that he was now enabled to make his virginian estate produced even a larger income than his english and his interests really pointed to the choice he had made but no pecuniary considerations lay at the bottom of his selection he really preferred the graceful and courteous ease of the intercourse which characterized the manners of james river in that age they were equally removed from the coarse and boisterous jollity of the english countrysquire and the heartless conventionalities of high life in addition to this his sensitive feelings rightly enough detected that he was regarded in the mothercountry as a sort of intruder he was spoken of alluded to in the journals and viewed even by his tenants as the american landlord and he never felt truly at home in the country for which he had fought and bled in england his rank as a baronet was not sufficient to look down these little peculiarities whereas in virginia it gave him a certain √©clat that was grateful to one of the main weaknesses of human nature at home as the mothercountry was then affectionately termed he had no hope of becoming a privy councillor while in his native colony his rank and fortune almost as a matter of course placed him in the council of the governor in a word while wycherly found most of those worldly considerations which influence men in the choice of their places of residence in favour of the region in which he happened to be born his election was made more from feeling and taste than from any thing else his mind had taken an early bias in favour of the usages and opinions of the people among whom he had received his first impressions and this bias he retained to the hour of his death  like a true woman mildred found her happiness with her husband and children of the latter she had but three a boy and two girls the care of the last was early committed to mrs dutton this excellent woman had remained at wychecombe with her husband until death put an end to his vices though the close of his career was exempt from those scenes of brutal dictation and interference that had rendered the earlier part of her life so miserable apprehension of what might be the consequences to himself acted as a check and he had sagacity enough to see that the physical comforts he now possessed were all owing to the influence of his wife he lived but four years however on his death his widow immediately took her departure for america  it would be substituting pure images of the fancy for a picture of sober realities were we to say that lady wychecombe and her adopted mother never regretted the land of their birth this negation of feeling habits and prejudices is not to be expected even in an esquimaux they both had occasional strictures to make on the climate and this to wycherlys great surprise for he conscientiously believed that of england to be just the worst in the world on the fruits the servants the roads and the difficulty of procuring various little comforts but as this was said goodnaturedly and in pleasantry rather than in the way of complaint it led to no unpleasant scenes or feelings as all three made occasional voyages to england where his estates and more particularly settlements with his factor compelled the baronet to go once in about a lustrum the fruits and the climate were finally given up by the ladies after many years even the slipshod careless but hearty attendance of the negroes came to be preferred to the dogged mannerism of the english domestics perfect as were the latter in their parts and the whole subject got to be one of amusement instead of one of complaint there is no greater mistake than to suppose that the traveller who passes once through a country with his homebred and quite likely provincial notions thick upon him is competent to describe with due discrimination even the usages of which he is actually a witness this truth all the family came in time to discover and while it rendered them more strictly critical in their remarks it also rendered them more tolerant as it was few happier families were to be found in the british empire than that of sir wycherly wychecombe its head retaining his manly and protecting affection for all dependent on him while his wife beautiful as a matron as she had been lovely as a girl clung to him with the tenacity of the vine to its own oak  of the result of the rising in the north it is unnecessary to say much the history of the chevaliers successes in the first year and of his final overthrow at culloden is well known sir reginald wychecombe like hundreds of others played his cards so skilfully that he avoided committing himself and although he lived and eventually died a suspected man he escaped forfeitures and attainder with sir wycherly as the head of his house he maintained a friendly correspondence to the last even taking charge of the paternal estate in its owners absence manifesting to the hour of his death a scrupulous probity in matters of money mingled with an inherent love of management and intrigue in things that related to politics and the succession sir reginald lived long enough to see the hopes of the jacobites completely extinguished and the throne filled by a native englishman  many long years after the events which rendered the week of its opening incidents so memorable among its actors must now be imagined time had advanced with its usual unfaltering tread and the greater part of a generation had been gathered to their fathers george iii had been on the throne not less than three lustrums and most of the important actors of the period of 45 were deadmany of them in a degree forgotten but each age has its own events and its own changes those colonies which in 1745 were so loyal so devoted to the house of hanover in the belief that political and religious liberty depended on the issue had revolted against the supremacy of the parliament of the empire america was already in arms against the mother country and the very day before the occurrence of the little scene we are about to relate the intelligence of the battle of bunker hill had reached london although the gazette and national pride had in a degree lessened the characteristics of this most remarkable of all similar combats by exaggerating the numbers of the colonists engaged and lessening the loss of the royal troops the impression produced by the news is said to have been greater than any known to that age it had been the prevalent opinion of englandan opinion that was then general in europe and which descended even to our own timesthat the animals of the new continent man included had less courage and physical force than those of the old and astonishment mingled with the forebodings of the intelligent when it was found that a body of illarmed countrymen had dared to meet in a singularly bloody combat twice their number of regular troops and that too under the guns of the kings shipping and batteries rumours for the moment were rife in london and the political world was filled with gloomy anticipations of the future  on the morning of the day alluded to westminster abbey as usual was open to the inspection of the curious and interested several parties were scattered among its aisles and chapels some reading the inscriptions on the simple tablets of the dead which illustrate a nation in illustrating themselves others listening to the names of princes who derived their consequence from their thrones and alliances and still other sets who were wandering among the more elaborate memorials that have been raised equally to illustrate insignificance and to mark the final restingplaces of more modern heroes and statesmen the beauty of the weather had brought out more visiters than common and not less than halfadozen equipages were in waiting in and about palace yard among others one had a ducal coronet this carriage did not fail to attract the attention that is more than usually bestowed on rank in england all were empty however and more than one party of pedestrians entered the venerable edifice rejoicing that the view of a duke or a duchess was to be thrown in among the other sights gratuitously all who passed on foot however were not influenced by this vulgar feeling for one group went by that did not even cast a glance at the collection of carriages the seniors of the party being too much accustomed to such things to lend them a thought and the juniors too full of anticipations of what they were about to see to think of other matters this party consisted of a handsome man of fiftyodd a lady some three or four years his junior well preserved and still exceedingly attractive a young man of twentysix and two lovely girls that looked like twins though one was really twentyone and the other but nineteen these were sir wycherly and lady wychecombe wycherly their only son then just returned from a five years peregrination on the continent of europe and mildred and agnes their daughters the rest of the family had arrived in england about a fortnight before to greet the heir on his return from the grand tour as it was then termed the meeting had been one of love though lady wychecombe had to reprove a few innocent foreign affectations as she fancied them to be in her son and the baronet himself laughed at the scraps of french italian and german that quite naturally mingled in the young mans discourse all this however cast no cloud over the party for it had ever been a family of entire confidence and unbroken love  this is a most solemn place to me observed sir wycherly as they entered at the poets corner and one in which a common man unavoidably feels his own insignificance but we will first make our pilgrimage and look at these remarkable inscriptions as we come out the tomb we seek is in a chapel on the other side of the church near to the great doors when i last saw it it was quite alone  on hearing this the whole party moved on though the two lovely young virginians cast wistful and curious eyes behind them at the wonders by which they were surrounded  is not this an extraordinary edifice wycherly half whispered agnes the youngest of the sisters as she clung to one arm of her brother mildred occupying the other can the whole world furnish such another  so much for hominy and james river answered the young man laughingnow could you but see the pile at rouen or that at rheims or that at antwerp or even that at york in this good kingdom old westminster would have to fall back upon its little tablets and big names but sir wycherly stops he must see what he calls his landfall  sir wycherly had indeed stopped it was in consequence of having reached the head of the choeur whence he could see the interior of the recess or chapel towards which he had been moving it still contained but a single monument and that was adorned with an anchor and other nautical emblems even at that distance the words richard bluewater rearadmiral of the white might be read but the baronet had come to a sudden halt in consequence of seeing a party of three enter the chapel in which he wished to be alone with his own family the party consisted of an old man who walked with tottering steps and this so much the more from the circumstance that he leaned on a domestic nearly as old as himself though of a somewhat sturdier frame and of a tall imposinglooking person of middle age who followed the two with patient steps several attendants of the cathedral watched this party from a distance with an air of curiosity and respect but they had been requested not to accompany it to the chapel  they must be some old brotherofficers of my poor uncles visiting his tomb whispered lady wychecombe the very venerable gentleman has naval emblems about his attire  do youcan you forget him love tis sir gervaise oakes the pride of england yet how changed it is now fiveandtwenty years since we last met still i knew him at a glance the servant is old galleygo his steward but the gentleman with him is a stranger let us advance we cannot be intruders in such a place  sir gervaise paid no attention to the entrance of the wychecombes it was evident by the vacant look of his countenance that time and hard service had impaired his faculties though his body remained entire an unusual thing for one who had been so often engaged still there were glimmerings of lively recollections and even of strong sensibilities about his eyes as sudden fancies crossed his mind once a year the anniversary of his friends interment he visited that chapel and he had now been brought here as much from habit as by his own desire a chair was provided for him and he sat facing the tomb with the large letters before his eyes he regarded neither though he bowed courteously to the salute of the strangers his companion at first seemed a little surprised if not offended at the intrusion but when wycherly mentioned that they were relatives of the deceased he also bowed complacently and made way for the ladies  this it is as what you wants to see sir jarvy observed galleygo jogging his masters shoulder by way of jogging his memory them ere cables and hanchors and that ere mizzenmast with a rearadmirals flag aflying is rigged in this old church in honour of our friend admiral blue as was but as is now dead and gone this many a long year  admiral of the blue repeated sir gervaise coldly youre mistaken galleygo im an admiral of the white and admiral of the fleet in the bargain i know my own rank sir  i knows that as well as you does yourself sir jarvy answered galleygo whose grammar had rather become confirmed than improved by time or as well as the first lord himself but admiral blue was once your best friend and i doesnt at all admire at your forgetting himone of these long nights youll be forgetting me  i beg your pardon galleygo i rather think not i remember you when a very young man  well and so you mought remember admiral blue if youd just try i knowd ye both when young luffs myself  this is a painful scene observed the stranger to sir wycherly with a melancholy smile this gentleman is now at the tomb of his dearest friend and yet as you see he appears to have lost all recollection that such a person ever existed for what do we live if a few brief years are to render our memories such vacant spots  has he been long in this way asked lady wychecombe with interest  the stranger started at the sound of her voice he looked intently into the face of the still fair speaker before he answered then he bowed and replied  he has been failing these five years though his last visit here was much less painful than this but are our own memories perfectsurely i have seen that face beforethese young ladies too  geoffreydear cousin geoffrey exclaimed lady wychecombe holding out both her hands it isit must be the duke of glamorgan wycherly  no further explanations were needed all the parties recognised each other in an instant they had not met for manymany years and each had passed the period of life when the greatest change occurs in the physical appearance but now that the ice was broken a flood of recollections poured in the duke or geoffrey cleveland as we prefer to call him kissed his cousin and her daughters with frank affection for no change of condition had altered his simple seahabits and he shook hands with the gentlemen with a cordiality like that of old times all this however was unheeded by sir gervaise who sat looking at the monument in a dull apathy  galleygo he said but galleygo had placed himself before sir wycherly and thrust out a hand that looked like a bunch of knuckles  i knows ye exclaimed the steward with a grin i knowd ye in the offing yonder but i couldnt make out your number lord sir if this doesnt brighten sir jarvy up again and put him in mind of old times i shall begin to think we have run out cable to the better end  i will speak to him duke if you think it advisable said sir wycherly in an inquiring manner  galleygo put in sir gervaise what lubber fitted that cablehe has turned in the clench the wrong way  ayay sir they is great lubbers them stonecutters sir jarvy and they knows about as much of ships as ships knows of them but here is young sir wycherly wychecombe come to see youthe old uns nevy  sir wycherly you are a very welcome guest bowldero is a poor place for a gentleman of your merit but such as it is it is entirely at your service what did you say the gentlemans name was galleygo  sir wycherly wychecombe the young unthe old un slipped the night as we moored in his house  i hope sir gervaise i have not entirely passed from your recollection it would grieve me sadly to think so and my poor uncle too he who died of apoplexy in your presence  nullus nulla nullum thats good latin hey duke nullius nullius nullius my memory is excellent gentlemen nominative penna genitive penn√¶ and so on  now sir jarvy since youre veering out your latin i should likes to know if you can tell a clovehitch from a carrickbend  that is an extraordinary question galleygo to put to an old seaman  well if you remembers that why cant you just as reasonably remember your old friend admiral blue  admiral of the blue i do recollect many admirals of the blue they ought to make me an admiral of the blue duke ive been a rearadmiral long enough  youve been an admiral of the blue once and thats enough for any man interrupted galleygo again in his positive manner and it isnt five minutes since you knowd your own rank as well as the secretary to the admiralty himself he veers and hauls in this fashion on an idee gentlemen until he doesnt know one end of it from tother  this is not uncommon with men of great age observed the duke they sometimes remember the things of their youth while the whole of later life is a blank i have remarked this with our venerable friend in whose mind i think it will not be difficult however to revive the recollection of admiral bluewater and even of yourself sir wycherly let me make the effort galleygo  yes lord geoffrey for so the steward always called the quondam reefer you does handle him more like a quickworking boat than any on us and so ill take an hopportunity of just overhauling our old lieutenants young uns and of seeing what sort of craft he has set afloat for the next generation  sir gervaise said the duke leaning over the chair here is sir wycherly wychecombe who once served a short time with us as a lieutenant it was when you were in the plantagenet you remember the plantagenet i trust my dear sir  the plantagenets certainly duke i read all about them when a boy edwards and henrys and richards at the last name he stopped the muscles of his face twitched memory had touched a sensitive chord but it was too faintly to produce more than a pause  there now growled galleygo in agnes face he being just then employed in surveying her through a pair of silver spectacles that were a present from his master you see he has forgotten the old planter and the next thing hell forget to eat his dinner its wicked sir jarvy to forget such a ship  i trust at least you have not forgotten richard bluewater continued the duke he who fell in our last action with the comte de vervillin  a gleam of intelligence shot into the rigid and wrinkled face the eye lighted and a painful smile struggled around the lips  what dick he exclaimed in a voice stronger than that in which he had previously spoken dick hey duke good excellent dick we were midshipmen together my lord duke and i loved him like a brother  i knew you did and i dare say now you can recollect the melancholy occasion of his death  is dick dead asked the admiral with a vacant gaze  lordlord sir jarvy you knows he is and that ere marvel constructure is his monermentnow you must remember the old planter and the county of fairvillian and the threshing we guvd him  pardon me galleygo there is no occasion for warmth when i was a midshipman warmth of expression was disapproved of by all the elder officers  you cause me to lose ground said the duke looking at the steward by way of bidding him be silent is it not extraordinary sir wycherly how his mind reverts to his youth overlooking the scenes of latter life yes dick is dead sir gervaise he fell in that battle in which you were doubled on by the frenchwhen you had le foudroyant on one side of you and le pluton on the other  i remember it interrupted sir gervaise in a clear strong voice his eye flashing with something like the fire of youthi remember it le foudroyant was on our starboard beam le pluton a little on our larboard bowbunting had gone aloft to look out for bluewaternopoor bunting was killed  sir wycherly wychecombe who afterwards married mildred bluewater dicks niece put in the baronet himself almost as eager as the admiral had now become sir wycherly wychecombe had been aloft but was returned to report the pluton coming down  so he didgod bless him a clever youth and he did marry dicks niece god bless them both well sir youre a stranger but the story will interest you there we lay almost smothered in the smoke with one twodecker at work on our starboard beam and another hammering away on the larboard bow with our topmasts over the side and the guns firing through the wreck  ay now youre getting it like a book exclaimed galleygo exultingly flourishing his stick and strutting about the little chapel thats just the way things was as i knows from seeing em  im quite certain im right galleygo  right your honours righter than any logbook in the fleet give it to em sir jarvy larboard and starboard  that we didthat we didcontinued the old man earnestly becoming even grand in aspect as he rose always gentlemanlike and graceful but filled with native fire that did we de vervillin was on our right and des prez on our leftthe smoke was choking us allbuntingno young wychecombe was at my side he said a fresh frenchman was shoving in between us and le pluton sirgod forbid i thought for we had enough of them us it was there she comes see here is her flyingjibboomendand therehey wychecombethats the old roman shoving through the smokec√¶sar himself and there stands dick and young geoffrey clevelandhe was of your family dukethere stands dick bluewater between the knightheads waving his hathurrahhes true at lasthes true at lasthurrah hurrah  the clarion tones rose like a trumpets blast and the cheering of the old sailor rang in the arches of the abbey church causing all within hearing to start as if a voice spoke from the tombs sir gervaise himself seemed surprised he looked up at the vaulted roof with a gaze halfbewildered halfdelighted  is this bowldero or glamorgan house my lord duke he asked in a whisper  it is neither admiral oakes but westminster abbey and this is the tomb of your friend rearadmiral richard bluewater  galleygo help me to kneel the old man added in the manner of a corrected schoolboy the stoutest of us all should kneel to god in his own temple i beg pardon gentlemen i wish to pray  the duke of glamorgan and sir wycherly wychecombe helped the admiral to his knees and galleygo as was his practice knelt beside his master who bowed his head on his mans shoulders this touching spectacle brought all the others into the same humble attitude wycherly mildred and their children with the noble kneeling and praying in company one by one the latter arose still galleygo and his master continued on the pavement at length geoffrey cleveland stepped forward and raised the old man placing him with wycherlys assistance in the chair here he sat with a calm smile on his aged features his open eyes riveted seemingly on the name of his friend perfectly dead there had been a reaction which suddenly stopped the current of life at the heart  thus expired sir gervaise oakes full of years and of honours one of the bravest and most successful of englands seacaptains he had lived his time and supplied an instance of the insufficiency of worldly success to complete the destiny of man having in a degree survived his faculties and the consciousness of all he had done and all he merited as a small offset to this failing of nature he had regained a glimmering view of one of the most striking scenes and of much the most enduring sentiment of a long life which god in mercy permitted to be terminated in the act of humble submission to his own greatness and glory
