62010001	vailima letters     chapter i    in the mountain apia samoa monday november 2nd 1890   my dear colvin  this is a hard and interesting and  beautiful life that we lead now  our place is in a deep  cleft of vaea mountain some six hundred feet above the sea  embowered in forest which is our strangling enemy and which  we combat with axes and dollars  i went crazy over outdoor  work and had at last to confine myself to the house or  literature must have gone by the board  nothing is so  interesting as weeding clearing and pathmaking the  oversight of labourers becomes a disease it is quite an  effort not to drop into the farmer and it does make you feel  so well  to come down covered with mud and drenched with  sweat and rain after some hours in the bush change rub  down and take a chair in the verandah is to taste a quiet  conscience  and the strange thing that i mark is this if i  go out and make sixpence bossing my labourers and plying the  cutlass or the spade idiot conscience applauds me if i sit  in the house and make twenty pounds idiot conscience wails  over my neglect and the day wasted  for near a fortnight i  did not go beyond the verandah then i found my rush of work  run out and went down for the night to apia put in sunday  afternoon with our consul a nice young man dined with my  friend h j moors in the evening went to church  no less   at the white and halfwhite church  i had never been before  and was much interested the woman i sat next looked a full blood native and it was in the prettiest and readiest  english that she sang the hymns back to moors where we  yarned of the islands being both wide wanderers till bed time bed sleep breakfast horse saddled round to the  mission to get mr clarke to be my interpreter over with  him to the kings whom i have not called on since my return  received by that mild old gentleman have some interesting  talk with him about samoan superstitions and my land  the  scene of a great battle in his malietoa laupepas youth   the place which we have cleared the platform of his fort   the gulley of the stream full of dead bodies  the fight  rolled off up vaea mountainside back with clarke to the  mission had a bit of lunch and consulted over a queer point  of missionary policy just arisen about our new town hall and  the balls there  too long to go into but a quaint example  of the intricate questions which spring up daily in the  missionary path  then off up the hill jack very fresh the sun close on  noon staring hot the breeze very strong and pleasant the  ineffable green country all round  gorgeous little birds i  think they are humming birds but they say not skirmishing  in the wayside flowers  about a quarter way up i met a  native coming down with the trunk of a cocoa palm across his  shoulder his brown breast glittering with sweat and oil  talofa  talofa alii  you see that white man  he speak  for you  white man he gone up here  ioe yes   tofa alii  tofa soifua  i put on jack up the steep  path till he is all as white as shaving stick  browns  euxesis wish i had some  past tanugamanono a bush village   see into the houses as i pass  they are open sheds  scattered on a green  see the brown folk sitting there  suckling kids sleeping on their stiff wooden pillows  then  on through the wood path  and here i find the mysterious  white man poor devil with his twenty years certificate of  good behaviour as a bookkeeper frozen out by the strikes in  the colonies come up here on a chance no work to be found  big hotel bill no ship to leave in  and come up to beg  twenty dollars because he heard i was a scotchman offering  to leave his portmanteau in pledge  settle this and on  again and here my house comes in view and a war whoop  fetches my wife and henry or simele our samoan boy on the  front balcony and i am home again and only sorry that i  shall have to go down again to apia this day week  i could  and would dwell here unmoved but there are things to be  attended to  never say i dont give you details and news  that is a  picture of a letter  i have been hard at work since i came three chapters of the  wrecker and since that eight of the south sea book and  along and about and in between a hatful of verses  some day  ill send the verse to you and youll say if any of it is  any good  i have got in a better vein with the south sea  book as i think you will see i think these chapters will do  for the volume without much change  those that i did in the  janet nicoll under the most ungodly circumstances i fear  will want a lot of suppling and lightening but i hope to  have your remarks in a month or two upon that point  it  seems a long while since i have heard from you  i do hope  you are well  i am wonderful but tired from so much work  tis really immense what i have done in the south sea book i  have fifty pages copied fair some of which has been four  times and all twice written certainly fifty pages of solid  scriving inside a fortnight but i was at it by seven am  till lunch and from two till four or five every day between  whiles verse and blowing on the flageolet never outside   if you could see this place but i dont want any one to see  it till my clearing is done and my house built  it will be  a home for angels  so far i wrote after my bit of dinner some cold meat and  bananas on arrival  then out to see where henry and some of  the men were clearing the garden for it was plain there was  to be no work today indoors and i must set in consequence  to farmering  i stuck a good while on the way up for the  path there is largely my own handiwork and there were a lot  of sprouts and saplings and stones to be removed  then i  reached our clearing just where the streams join in one it  had a fine autumn smell of burning the smoke blew in the  woods and the boys were pretty merry and busy  now i had a  private design  map which cannot be reproduced  the vaitae i had explored pretty far up not yet the other  stream the vaituliga gnasal n as ng in sing and up  that with my wood knife i set off alone  it is here quite  dry it went through endless woods about as broad as a  devonshire lane here and there crossed by fallen trees huge  trees overhead in the sun dripping lianas and tufted with  orchids tree ferns ferns depending with air roots from the  steep banks great arums  i had not skill enough to say if  any of them were the edible kind one of our staples here   hundreds of bananas  another staple  and alas  i had skill  enough to know all of these for the bad kind that bears no  fruit  my henry moralised over this the other day how hard  it was that the bad banana flourished wild and the good must  be weeded and tended and i had not the heart to tell him how  fortunate they were here and how hungry were other lands by  comparison  the ascent of this lovely lane of my dry stream  filled me with delight  i could not but be reminded of old  mayne reid as i have been more than once since i came to the  tropics and i thought if reid had been still living i  would have written to tell him that for me it had come  true and i thought forbye that if the great powers go on  as they are going and the chief justice delays it would  come truer still and the warconch will sound in the hills  and my home will be inclosed in camps before the year is  ended  and all at once  mark you how mayne reid is on the  spot  a strange thing happened  i saw a liana stretch  across the bed of the brook about breasthigh swung up my  knife to sever it and  behold it was a wire  on either  hand it plunged into thick bush tomorrow i shall see where  it goes and get a guess perhaps of what it means  today i  know no more than  there it is  a little higher the brook  began to trickle then to fill  at last as i meant to do  some work upon the homeward trail it was time to turn  i  did not return by the stream knife in hand as long as my  endurance lasted i was to cut a path in the congested bush  at first it went ill with me i got badly stung as high as  the elbows by the stinging plant i was nearly hung in a  tough liana  a rotten trunk giving way under my feet it was  deplorable bad business  and an axe  if i dared swing one   would have been more to the purpose than my cutlass  of a  sudden things began to go strangely easier i found stumps  bushing out again my body began to wonder then my mind i  raised my eyes and looked ahead and by george i was no  longer pioneering i had struck an old track overgrown and  was restoring an old path  so i laboured till i was in such  a state that carolina wilhelmina skeggs could scarce have  found a name for it  thereon desisted returned to the  stream made my way down that stony track to the garden  where the smoke was still hanging and the sun was still in  the high treetops and so home  here fondly supposing my  long day was over i rubbed down exquisite agony water  spreads the poison of these weeds i got it all over my  hands on my chest in my eyes and presently while eating  an orange a la raratonga burned my lip and eye with orange  juice  now all day our three small pigs had been adrift  to the mortal peril of our corn lettuce onions etc and  as i stood smarting on the back verandah behold the three  piglings issuing from the wood just opposite  instantly i  got together as many boys as i could  three and got the  pigs penned against the rampart of the sty till the others  joined whereupon we formed a cordon closed captured the  deserters and dropped them squeaking amain into their  strengthened barracks where please god they may now stay  perhaps you may suppose the day now over you are not the  head of a plantation my juvenile friend  politics  succeeded henry got adrift in his english bene was too  cowardly to tell me what he was after result i have lost  seven good labourers and had to sit down and write to you to  keep my temper  let me sketch my lads  henry  henry has  gone down to town or i could not be writing to you  this  were the hour of his english lesson else when he learns what  he calls long expessions or your chiefs language for the  matter of an hour and a half  henry is a chiefling from  savaii i once loathed i now like and  pending fresh  discoveries  have a kind of respect for henry  he does good  work for us goes among the labourers bossing and watching  helps fanny is civil kindly thoughtful o si sic semper   but will he be his sometime self throughout the year   anyway he has deserved of us and he must disappoint me  sharply ere i give him up  bene  or peniben in plain  english  is supposed to be my ganger the lord love him   god made a truckling coward there is his full history  he  cannot tell me what he wants he dares not tell me what is  wrong he dares not transmit my orders or translate my  censures  and with all this honest sober industrious  miserably smiling over the miserable issue of his own  unmanliness  paul  a german  cook and steward  a glutton  of work  a splendid fellow drawbacks three 1 no cook  2 an inveterate bungler a man with twenty thumbs  continually falling in the dishes throwing out the dinner  preserving the garbage 3 a dr well dont let us say  that  but we darent let him go to town and he  poor good  soul  is afraid to be let go  lafaele raphael a strong  dull deprecatory man splendid with an axe if watched the  better for a rowing when he calls me papa in the most  wheedling tones desperately afraid of ghosts so that he  dare not walk alone up in the banana patch  see map  the  rest are changing labourers and tonight owing to the  miserable cowardice of peni who did not venture to tell me  what the men wanted  and which was no more than fair  all  are gone  and my weeding in the article of being finished   pity the sorrows of a planter  i am sir yours and be jowned to you the planter r l s   tuesday 3rd   i begin to see the whole scheme of letterwriting you sit  down every day and pour out an equable stream of twaddle  this morning all my fears were fled and all the trouble had  fallen to the lot of peni himself who deserved it my field  was full of weeders and i am again able to justify the ways  of god  all morning i worked at the south seas and finished  the chapter i had stuck upon on saturday  fanny awfully  hoveto with rheumatics and injuries received upon the field  of sport and glory chasing pigs was unable to go up and  down stairs so she sat upon the back verandah and my work  was chequered by her cries  paul you take a spade to do  that  dig a hole first  if you do that youll cut your  foot off  here you boy what you do there  you no get  work  you go find simele he give you work  peni you tell  this boy he go find simele suppose simele no give him work  you tell him go way  i no want him here  that boy no  good  peni from the distance in reassuring tones all  right sir  fanny after a long pause peni you tell  that boy go find simele  i no want him stand here all day   i no pay that boy  i see him all day  he no do nothing   luncheon beef sodascones fried bananas pineapple in  claret coffee  try to write a poem no go  play the  flageolet  then sneakingly off to farmering and pioneering   four gangs at work on our place a lively scene axes  crashing and smoke blowing all the knives are out  but i  rob the garden party of one without a stock and you should  see my hand  cut to ribbons  now i want to do my path up  the vaituliga singlehanded and i want it to burst on the  public complete  hence with devilish ingenuity i begin it  at different places so that if you stumble on one section  you may not even then suspect the fulness of my labours   accordingly i started in a new place below the wire and  hoping to work up to it  it was perhaps lucky i had so bad a  cutlass and my smarting hand bid me stay before i had got up  to the wire but just in season so that i was only the  better of my activity not dead beat as yesterday  a strange business it was and infinitely solitary away  above the sun was in the high treetops the lianas noosed  and sought to hang me the saplings struggled and came up  with that sob of death that one gets to know so well great  soft sappy trees fell at a lick of the cutlass little tough  switches laughed at and dared my best endeavour  soon  toiling down in that pit of verdure i heard blows on the far  side and then laughter  i confess a chill settled on my  heart  being so dead alone in a place where by rights none should  be beyond me i was aware upon interrogation if those blows  had drawn nearer i should of course quite unaffectedly  have executed a strategic movement to the rear and only the  other day i was lamenting my insensibility to superstition   am i beginning to be sucked in  shall i become a midnight  twitterer like my neighbours  at times i thought the blows  were echoes at times i thought the laughter was from birds   for our birds are strangely human in their calls  vaea  mountain about sundown sometimes rings with shrill cries  like the hails of merry scattered children  as a matter of  fact i believe stealthy woodcutters from tanugamanono were  above me in the wood and answerable for the blows as for the  laughter a woman and two children had come and asked fannys  leave to go up shrimpfishing in the burn beyond doubt it  was these i heard  just at the right time i returned to  wash down change and begin this snatch of letter before  dinner was ready and to finish it afterwards before henry  has yet put in an appearance for his lesson in long  explessions  dinner stewed beef and potatoes baked bananas new loaf bread hot from the oven pineapple in claret  these are  great days we have been low in the past but now are we as  bellygods enjoying all things   wednesday  hist vailima resumed   a gorgeous evening of afterglow in the great treetops and  behind the mountain and full moon over the lowlands and the  sea inaugurated a night of horrid cold  to you effete  denizens of the socalled temperate zone it had seemed  nothing neither of us could sleep we were up seeking extra  coverings i know not at what hour  it was as bright as day   the moon right over vaea  near due west the birds strangely  silent and the wood of the house tingling with cold i  believe it must have been 60 degrees  consequence fanny has  a headache and is wretched and i could do no work  i am  trying all round for a place to hold my pen you will hear  why later on this to explain penmanship  i wrote two  pages very bad no movement no life or interest then i  wrote a business letter then took to tootling on the  flageolet till glory should call me farmering  i took up at the fit time lafaele and mauga  mauga accent  on the first is a mountain i dont know what mauga means   mind what i told you of the value of g  to the garden and  set them digging then turned my attention to the path  i  could not go into my bush path for two reasons 1st sore  hands 2nd had on my trousers and good shoes  lucky it was   right in the wild lime hedge which cuts athwart us just  homeward of the garden i found a great bed of kuikui   sensitive plant  our deadliest enemy  a fool brought it to  this island in a pot and used to lecture and sentimentalise  over the tender thing  the tender thing has now taken charge  of this island and men fight it with torn hands for bread  and life  a singular insidious thing shrinking and biting  like a weasel clutching by its roots as a limpet clutches to  a rock  as i fought him i bettered some verses in my poem  the woodman the only thought i gave to letters  though the  kuikui was thick there was but a small patch of it and when  i was done i attacked the wild lime and had a handtohand  skirmish with its spines and elastic suckers  all this time  close by in the cleared space of the garden lafaele and  mauga were digging  suddenly quoth lafaele somebody he  sing out  somebody he sing out  all right  i go  and  i went and found they had been whistling and singing out  for long but the fold of the hill and the uncleared bush  shuts in the garden so that no one heard and i was late for  dinner and fannys headache was cross and when the meal was  over we had to cut up a pineapple which was going bad to  make jelly of and the next time you have a handful of broken  bloodblisters apply pineapple juice and you will give me  news of it and i request a specimen of your hand of write  five minutes after  the historic moment when i tackled this  history  my day so far  fanny was to have rested  blessed paul began making a duck house she let him be the duckhouse fell down and she had  to set her hand to it  he was then to make a drinkingplace  for the pigs she let him be again  he made a stair by which  the pigs will probably escape this evening and she was near  weeping  impossible to blame the indefatigable fellow  energy is too rare and goodwill too noble a thing to  discourage but its trying when she wants a rest  then she  had to cook the dinner then of course  like a fool and a  woman  must wait dinner for me and make a flurry of  herself  her day so far  cetera adhuc desunt   friday  i think   i have been too tired to add to this chronicle which will at  any rate give you some guess of our employment  all goes  well the kuikui  think of this mispronunciation having  actually infected me to the extent of misspelling tuitui is  the word by rights  the tuitui is all out of the paddock   a fenced park between the house and boundary penis men  start today on the road the garden is part burned part  dug and henry at the head of a troop of underpaid  assistants is hard at work clearing  the part clearing you  will see from the map from the house run down to the stream  side up the stream nearly as high as the garden then back  to the star which i have just added to the map  my long silent contests in the forest have had a strange  effect on me  the unconcealed vitality of these vegetables  their exuberant number and strength the attempts  i can use  no other word  of lianas to enwrap and capture the intruder  the awful silence the knowledge that all my efforts are only  like the performance of an actor the thing of a moment and  the wood will silently and swiftly heal them up with fresh  effervescence the cunning sense of the tuitui suffering  itself to be touched with windswayed grasses and not minding   but let the grass be moved by a man and it shuts up the  whole silent battle murder and slow death of the contending  forest weigh upon the imagination  my poem the woodman  stands but i have taken refuge in a new story which just  shot through me like a bullet in one of my moments of awe  alone in that tragic jungle   the high woods of ulufanua  1 a south sea bridal 2 under the ban 3 savao and faavao 4 cries in the high wood 5 rumour full of tongues 6 the hour of peril 7 the day of vengeance   it is very strange very extravagant i daresay but its  varied and picturesque and has a pretty love affair and  ends well  ulufanua is a lovely samoan word ulugrove  fanualand groveland  the tops of the high trees   savao sacred to the wood and faavao woodways are the  names of two of the characters ulufanua the name of the  supposed island  i am very tired and rest off today from all but letters   fanny is quite done up she could not sleep last night  something it seemed like asthma  i trust not  i suppose  lloyd will be about so you can give him the benefit of this  long scrawl  never say that i cant write a letter say that  i dont  yours ever my dearest fellow r l s   later on friday   the guid wife had bread to bake and she baked it in a pan  o  but between whiles she was down with me weeding sensitive  in the paddock  the men have but now passed over it i was  round in that very place to see the weeding was done  thoroughly and already the reptile springs behind our heels   tuitui is a truly strange beast and gives food for thought   i am nearly sure  i cannot yet be quite i mean to  experiment when i am less on the hot chase of the beast   that even at the instant he shrivels up his leaves he  strikes his prickles downward so as to catch the uprooting  finger instinctive say the gabies but so is mans impulse  to strike out  one thing that takes and holds me is to see  the strange variation in the propagation of alarm among these  rooted beasts at times it spreads to a radius i speak by  the guess of the eye of five or six inches at times only  one individual plant appears frightened at a time  we tried  how long it took one to recover tis a sanguine creature it  is all abroad again before i guess again two minutes  it  is odd how difficult in this world it is to be armed  the  double armour of this plant betrays it  in a thick tuft  where the leaves disappear i thrust in my hand and the bite  of the thorns betrays the topmost stem  in the open again  and when i hesitate if it be clover a touch on the leaves  and its fine sense and retractile action betrays its identity  at once  yet it has one gift incomparable  rome had virtue  and knowledge rome perished  the sensitive plant has  indigestible seeds  so they say  and it will flourish for  ever  i give my advice thus to a young plant  have a strong  root a weak stem and an indigestible seed so you will  outlast the eternal city and your progeny will clothe  mountains and the irascible planter will blaspheme in vain   the weak point of tuitui is that its stem is strong   supplementary page   here beginneth the third lesson which is not from the  planter but from a less estimable character the writer of  books  i want you to understand about this south sea book  the job  is immense i stagger under material  i have seen the first  big tache  it was necessary to see the smaller ones the  letters were at my hand for the purpose but i was not going  to lose this experience and instead of writing mere  letters have poured out a lot of stuff for the book  how  this works and fits time is to show  but i believe in  time i shall get the whole thing in form  now up to date  that is all my design and i beg to warn you till we have the  whole or much of the stuff together you can hardly judge   and i can hardly judge  such a mass of stuff is to be  handled if possible without repetition  so much foreign  matter to be introduced  if possible with perspicuity  and  as much as can be a spirit of narrative to be preserved   you will find that come stronger as i proceed and get the  explanations worked through  problems of style are as yet  dirt under my feet my problem is architectural creative   to get this stuff jointed and moving  if i can do that i  will trouble you for style anybody might write it and it  would be splendid wellengineered the masses right the  blooming thing travelling  twig  this i wanted you to understand for lots of the stuff sent  home is i imagine rot  and slovenly rot  and some of it  pompous rot and i want you to understand its a layin  soon if the tide of poeshie continues ill send you a whole  lot to damn  you never said thankyou for the handsome  tribute addressed to you from apemama such is the gratitude  of the world to the godsent poick  well well vex not  thou the poicks mind with thy coriaceous ingratitude the  p will be to your faults more than a little blind and yours  is a far from handsome attitude  having thus dropped into  poetry in a spirit of friendship i have the honour to  subscribe myself sir  your obedient humble servant silas wegg   i suppose by this you will have seen the lad  and his feet  will have been in the monument  and his eyes beheld the face  of george  well  there is much eloquence in a well i am sir yours  the epigrammatist  robert louis stevenson  finis  explicit    chapter ii    vailima tuesday november 25th 1890   my dear colvin  i wanted to go out bright and early to go  on with my survey  you never heard of that  the world has  turned and much water run under bridges since i stopped my  diary  i have written six more chapters of the book all  good i potently believe and given up as a deception of the  devils the high woods  i have been once down to apia to a  huge native feast at seumanutafas the chief of apia  there  was a vast mass of food crowds of people the police  charging among them with whips the whole in high good humour  on both sides infinite noise and a historic event  mr  clarke the missionary and his wife assisted at a native  dance  on my return from this function i found work had  stopped no more south seas in my belly  well henry had  cleared a great deal of our bush on a contract and it ought  to be measured  i set myself to the task with a tapeline  it seemed a dreary business then i borrowed a prismatic  compass and tackled the task afresh  i have no books i had  not touched an instrument nor given a thought to the business  since the year of grace 1871 you can imagine with what  interest i sat down yesterday afternoon to reduce my  observations five triangles i had taken all five came  right to my ineffable joy  our dinner  the lowest we have  ever been  consisted of one avocado pear between fanny and  me a ships biscuit for the guidman white bread for the  missis and red wine for the twa  no salt horse even in  all vailima  after dinner henry came and i began to teach  him decimals you wouldnt think i knew them myself after so  long desuetude  i could not but wonder how henry stands his evenings here  the polynesian loves gaiety  i feed him with decimals the  mariners compass derivations grammar and the like  delecting myself after the manner of my race moult  tristement  i suck my paws i live for my dexterities and by  my accomplishments even my clumsinesses are my joy  my  woodcuts my stumbling on the pipe this surveying even  and  even weeding sensitive anything to do with the mind with  the eye with the hand  with a part of me diversion flows  in these ways for the dreary man  but gaiety is what these  children want to sit in a crowd tell stories and pass  jests to hear one another laugh and scamper with the girls   its good fun too i believe but not for r l s aetat  40  which i am now past forty custodian and not one penny  the worse that i can see as amusable as ever to be on board  ship is reward enough for me give me the wages of going on   in a schooner  only if ever i were gay which i  misremember i am gay no more  and here is poor henry  passing his evenings on my intellectual husks which the  professors masticated keeping the accounts of the estate   all wrong i have no doubt  i keep no check beyond a very  rough one marching in with a cloudy brow and the daybook  under his arm tackling decimals coming with cases of  conscience  how would an english chief behave in such a  case etc and i am bound to say on any glimmer of a jest  lapsing into native hilarity as a tree straightens itself  after the wind is by  the other night i remembered my old  friend  i believe yours also  scholastikos and  administered the crow and the anchor  they were quite fresh  to samoan ears this implies a very early severance  and i  thought the anchor would have made away with my simele  altogether  fannys time in this interval has been largely occupied in  contending publicly with wild swine  we have a black sow we  call her jack sheppard impossible to confine her   impossible also for her to be confined  to my sure knowledge  she has been in an interesting condition for longer than any  other sow in story else she had long died the death as soon  as she is brought to bed she shall count her days  i  suppose that sow has cost us in days labour from thirty to  fifty dollars as many as eight boys at a dollar a day have  been twelve hours in chase of her  now it is supposed that  fanny has outwitted her she grins behind broad planks in  what was once the cookhouse  she is a wild pig far  handsomer than any tame and when she found the cookhouse  was too much for her methods of evasion she lay down on the  floor and refused food and drink for a whole sunday  on  monday morning she relapsed and now eats and drinks like a  little man  i am reminded of an incident  two sundays ago  the sad word was brought that the sow was out again this  time she had carried another in her flight  moors and i and  fanny were strolling up to the garden and there by the  waterside we saw the black sow looking guilty  it seemed to  me beyond words but fannys cri du coeur was delicious g rr she cried nobody loves you  i would i could tell you the moving story of our cart and  carthorses the latter are dapplegrey about sixteen hands  and of enormous substance the former was a kind of red and  green shandrydan with a driving bench plainly unfit to  carry lumber or to face our road  remember that the last  third of my road about a mile is all made out of a bridle track by my boys  and my dollars  it was supposed a white  man had been found  an exgerman artilleryman  to drive  this last he proved incapable and drunken the gallant  henry who had never driven before and knew nothing about  horses  except the rats and weeds that flourish on the  islands  volunteered moors accepted proposing to follow  and supervise despatched his work and started after  no  cart he hurried on up the road  no cart  transfer the  scene to vailima where on a sudden to fanny and me the cart  appears apparently at a hard gallop some two hours before  it was expected henry radiantly ruling chaos from the bench   it stopped it was long before we had time to remark that the  axle was twisted like the letter l our first care was the  horses  there they stood black with sweat the sweat  raining from them  literally raining  their heads down  their feet apart  and blood running thick from the nostrils  of the mare  we got out fannys underclothes  couldnt  find anything else but our blankets  to rub them down and  in about half an hour we had the blessed satisfaction to see  one after the other take a bite or two of grass  but it was  a toucher a little more and these steeds would have been  foundered   monday 31st november   near a week elapsed and no journal  on monday afternoon  moors rode up and i rode down with him dined and went over  in the evening to the american consulate present consul general sewall lieut parker and mrs parker lafarge the  american decorator adams an american historian we talked  late and it was arranged i was to write up for fanny and we  should both dine on the morrow  on the friday i was all forenoon in the mission house  lunched at the german consulate went on board the sperber  german war ship in the afternoon called on my lawyer on my  way out to american consulate and talked till dinner time  with adams whom i am supplying with introductions and  information for tahiti and the marquesas  fanny arrived a  wreck and had to lie down  the moon rose one day past  full and we dined in the verandah a good dinner on the  whole talk with lafarge about art and the lovely dreams of  art students  remark by adams which took me briskly home to  the monument  i only liked one young woman  and that was  mrs procter  henry james would like that  back by  moonlight in the consulate boat  fanny being too tired to  walk  to moorss  saturday i left fanny to rest and was  off early to the mission where the politics are thrilling  just now  the native pastors to every ones surprise have  moved of themselves in the matter of the native dances  desiring the restrictions to be removed or rather to be made  dependent on the character of the dance  clarke who had  feared censure and all kinds of trouble is of course  rejoicing greatly  a characteristic feature the argument of  the pastors was handed in in the form of a fictitious  narrative of the voyage of one mr pye an english traveller  and his conversation with a chief there are touches of  satire in this educational romance  mr pye for instance  admits that he knows nothing about the bible  at the mission  i was sought out by henry in a devil of an agitation he has  been made the victim of a forgery   a crime hitherto unknown  in samoa  i had to go to folau the chief judge here in the  matter  folau had never heard of the offence and begged to  know what was the punishment there may be lively times in  forgery ahead  it seems the sort of crime to tickle a  polynesian  after lunch  you can see what a busy three days  i am describing  we set off to ride home  my jack was full  of the devil of corn and too much grass and no work  i had  to ride ahead and leave fanny behind  he is a most gallant  little rascal is my jack and takes the whole way as hard as  the rider pleases  single incident halfway up i find my  boys upon the road and stop and talk with henry in his  character of ganger as long as jack will suffer me  fanny  drones in after we make a show of eating  or i do  she  goes to bed about halfpast six  i write some verses read  irvings washington and follow about halfpast eight  o  one thing more i did in a prophetic spirit  i had made sure  fanny was not fit to be left alone and wrote before turning  in a letter to chalmers telling him i could not meet him in  auckland at this time  by eleven at night fanny got me  wakened  she had tried twice in vain  and i found her very  bad  thence till three we laboured with mustard poultices  laudanum soda and ginger  heavens wasnt it cold the land  breeze was as cold as a river the moon was glorious in the  paddock and the great boughs and the black shadows of our  trees were inconceivable  but it was a poor time  sunday morning found fanny of course a complete wreck and  myself not very brilliant  paul had to go to vailele re  cocoanuts it was doubtful if he could be back by dinner  never mind said i ill take dinner when you return  off  set paul  i did an hours work and then tackled the house  work  i did it beautiful the house was a picture it  resplended of propriety  presently mr moors andrew rode  up i heard the doctor was at the forest house and sent a  note to him and when he came i heard my wife telling him  she had been in bed all day and that was why the house was  so dirty  was it grateful  was it politic  was it true   enough  in the interval up marched little l s one of my  neighbours all in his sunday white linens made a fine  salute and demanded the key of the kitchen in german and  english  and he cooked dinner for us like a little man and  had it on the table and the coffee ready by the hour  paul  had arranged me this surprise  some time later paul  returned himself with a fresh surprise on hand he was almost  sober nothing but a hazy eye distinguished him from paul of  the week days vivat  on the evening i cannot dwell  all the horses got out of the  paddock went across and smashed my neighbours garden into  a big hole  how little the amateur conceives a farmers  troubles  i went out at once with a lantern staked up a gap  in the hedge was kicked at by a chestnut mare who  straightway took to the bush and came back  a little after  they had found another gap and the crowd were all abroad  again  what has happened to our own garden nobody yet knows  fanny had a fair night and we are both tolerable this  morning only the yoke of correspondence lies on me heavy  i  beg you will let this go on to my mother  i got such a good  start in your letter that i kept on at it and i have  neither time nor energy for more  yours ever r l s   something new   i was called from my letters by the voice of mr  who had  just come up with a load of wood roaring henry  henry   bring six boys  i saw there was something wrong and ran  out  the cart half unloaded had upset with the mare in the  shafts she was all cramped together and all tangled up in  harness and cargo the off shaft pushing her over mr   holding her up by main strength and right alongside of her   where she must fall if she went down  a deadly stick of a  tree like a lance  i could not but admire the wisdom and  faith of this great brute i never saw the ridinghorse that  would not have lost its life in such a situation but the  cartelephant patiently waited and was saved  it was a  stirring three minutes i can tell you  i forgot in talking of saturday to tell of one incident which  will particularly interest my mother  i met dr d from  savaii and had an agelong talk about edinburgh folk it was  very pleasant  he has been studying in edinburgh along with  his son a pretty relation  he told me he knew nobody but  college people i was altogether a student he said with  glee  he seems full of cheerfulness and thickset energy  i  feel as if i could put him in a novel with effect and ten to  one if i know more of him the image will be only blurred   tuesday dec 2nd   i should have told you yesterday that all my boys were got up  for their work in moustaches and sidewhiskers of some sort  of blacking  i suppose woodash  it was a sight of joy to  see them return at night axe on shoulder feigning to march  like soldiers a choragus with a loud voice singing out  marchstep  marchstep in imperfect recollection of some  drill  fanny seems much revived  r l s    chapter iii    monday twentysomethingth of december 1890   my dear colvin  i do not say my jack is anything  extraordinary he is only an island horse and the profane  might call him a punch and his face is like a donkeys and  natives have ridden him and he has no mouth in consequence  and occasionally shies  but his merits are equally  surprising and i dont think i should ever have known jacks  merits if i had not been riding up of late on moonless  nights jack is a bit of a dandy he loves to misbehave in a  gallant manner above all on apia street and when i stop to  speak to people they say dr stuebel the german consul said  about three days ago o what a wild horse it cannot be  safe to ride him  such a remark is jacks reward and  represents his ideal of fame  now when i start out of apia  on a dark night you should see my changed horse at a fast  steady walk with his head down and sometimes his nose to  the ground  when he wants to do that he asks for his head  with a little eloquent polite movement indescribable  he  climbs the long ascent and threads the darkest of the wood   the first night i came it was starry and it was singular to  see the starlight drip down into the crypt of the wood and  shine in the open end of the road as bright as moonlight at  home but the crypt itself was proof blackness lived in it   the next night it was raining  we left the lights of apia  and passed into limbo  jack finds a way for himself but he  does not calculate for my height above the saddle and i am  directed forward all braced up for a crouch and holding my  switch upright in front of me  it is curiously interesting   in the forest the dead wood is phosphorescent some nights  the whole ground is strewn with it so that it seems like a  grating over a pale hell doubtless this is one of the things  that feed the night fears of the natives and i am free to  confess that in a night of trackless darkness where all else  is void these pallid ignes suppositi have a fantastic  appearance rather bogey even  one night when it was very  dark a man had put out a little lantern by the wayside to  show the entrance to his ground  i saw the light as i  thought far ahead and supposed it was a pedestrian coming  to meet me i was quite taken by surprise when it struck in  my face and passed behind me  jack saw it and he was  appalled do you think he thought of shying  no sir not in  the dark in the dark jack knows he is on duty and he went  past that lantern steady and swift only as he went he  groaned and shuddered  for about 2500 of jacks steps we  only pass one house  that where the lantern was and about  1500 of these are in the darkness of the pit  but now the  moon is on tap again and the roads lighted  i have been exploring up the vaituliga see your map  it  comes down a wonderful fine glen at least 200 feet of cliffs  on either hand winding like a corkscrew great forest trees  filling it  at the top there ought to be a fine double fall  but the stream evades it by a fault and passes underground   above the fall it runs at this season full and very gaily  in a shallow valley some hundred yards before the head of  the glen  its course is seen full of grasses like a flooded  meadow that is the sink beyond the grave of the grasses  the bed lies dry  near this upper part there is a great show  of ruinous pigwalls a village must have stood near by  to walk from our house to wreck hill when the path is buried  in fallen trees takes one about half an hour i think to  return not more than twenty minutes i daresay fifteen   hence i should guess it was threequarters of a mile  i had  meant to join on my explorations passing eastward by the  sink but lord how it rains  later  i went out this morning with a pocket compass and walked in a  varying direction perhaps on an average s by w 1754  paces  then i struck into the bush nw by n hoping to  strike the vaituliga above the falls  now i have it plotted  out i see i should have gone w or even w by s but it is  not easy to guess  for 600 weary paces i struggled through  the bush and then came on the stream below the gorge where  it was comparatively easy to get down to it  in the place  where i struck it it made cascades about a little isle and  was running about ne 20 to 30 feet wide as deep as to my  knee and piercing cold  i tried to follow it down and keep  the run of its direction and my paces but when i was wading  to the knees and the waist in mud poison brush and rotted  wood bound hand and foot in lianas shovelled  unceremoniously off the one shore and driven to try my luck  upon the other  i saw i should have hard enough work to get  my body down if my mind rested  it was a damnable walk  certainly not half a mile as the crow flies but a real  bucketer for hardship  once i had to pass the stream where  it flowed between banks about three feet high  to get the  easier down i swung myself by a wildcocoanut  so called  it bears bunches of scarlet nutlets  which grew upon the  brink  as i so swung i received a crack on the head that  knocked me all abroad  impossible to guess what tree had  taken a shy at me  so many towered above one over the  other and the missile whatever it was dropped in the  stream and was gone before i had recovered my wits  i  scarce know what i write so hideous a niagara of rain roars  shouts and demonizes on the iron roof  it is pitch dark too   the lamp lit at 5  it was a blessed thing when i struck  my own road and i got home neat for lunch time one of the  most wonderful mud statues ever witnessed  in the afternoon  i tried again going up the other path by the garden but was  early drowned out came home plotted out what i had done  and then wrote this truck to you  fanny has been quite ill with earache  she wont go hating  the sea at this wild season i dont like to leave her so it  drones on steamer after steamer and i guess itll end by no  one going at all  she is in a dreadful misfortune at this  hour a case of kerosene having burst in the kitchen  a  little while ago it was the carpenters horse that trod in a  nest of fourteen eggs and made an omelette of our hopes   the farmers lot is not a happy one  and it looks like some  real uncompromising bad weather too  i wish fannys ear were  well  think of parties in monuments think of me in  skerryvore and now of this  it dont look like a part of  the same universe to me  work is quite laid aside i have  worked myself right out   christmas eve   yesterday who could write  my wife near crazy with ear ache the rain descending in white crystal rods and playing  hells tattoo like a tutti of battering rams on our sheet iron roof the wind passing high overhead with a strange dumb  mutter or striking us full so that all the huge trees in  the paddock cried aloud and wrung their hands and  brandished their vast arms  the horses stood in the shed  like things stupid  the sea and the flagship lying on the  jaws of the bay vanished in sheer rain  all day it lasted i  locked up my papers in the iron box in case it was a  hurricane and the house might go  we went to bed with  mighty uncertain feelings far more than on shipboard where  you have only drowning ahead  whereas here you have a smash  of beams a shower of sheetiron and a blind race in the  dark and through a whirlwind for the shelter of an unfinished  stable  and my wife with earache  well well this  morning we had word from apia a hurricane was looked for  the ships were to leave the bay by 10 am it is now 330  and the flagship is still a fixture and the wind round in  the blessed east so i suppose the danger is over  but  heaven is still laden the day dim with frequent rattling  bucketfuls of rain and just this moment as i write a  squall went overhead scarce striking us with that singular  solemn noise of its passage which is to me dreadful  i have  always feared the sound of wind beyond everything  in my  hell it would always blow a gale  i have been all day correcting proofs and making out a new  plan for our house  the other was too dear to be built now  and it was a hard task to make a smaller house that would  suffice for the present and not be a mere waste of money in  the future  i believe i have succeeded i have taken care of  my study anyway  two favours i want to ask of you  first i wish you to get  pioneering in new guinea by j chalmers  its a  missionary book and has less pretensions to be literature  than spurgeons sermons  yet i think even through that you  will see some of the traits of the hero that wrote it a man  that took me fairly by storm for the most attractive simple  brave and interesting man in the whole pacific  he is away  now to go up the fly river a desperate venture it is  thought he is quite a livingstone card  second try and keep yourself free next winter and if my  means can be stretched so far ill come to egypt and well  meet at shepheards hotel and youll put me in my place  which i stand in need of badly by this time  lord what  bully times  i suppose ill come per british asia or  whatever you call it and avoid all cold and might be in  egypt about november as ever was  eleven months from now or  rather less  but do not let us count our chickens  last night three piglings were stolen from one of our pig pens  the great lafaele appeared to my wife uneasy so she  engaged him in conversation on the subject and played upon  him the following engaging trick  you advance your two  forefingers towards the sitters eyes he closes them  whereupon you substitute on his eyelids the fore and middle  fingers of the left hand and with your right which he  supposes engaged you tap him on the head and back  when you  let him open his eyes he sees you withdrawing the two  forefingers  what that asked lafaele  my devil says  fanny  i wake um my devil  all right now  he go catch  the man that catch my pig  about an hour afterwards  lafaele came for further particulars  o all right my  wife says  by and by that man he sleep devil go sleep  same place  by and by that man plenty sick  i no care   what for he take my pig  lafaele cares plenty i dont  think he is the man though he may be but he knows him and  most likely will eat some of that pig tonight  he will not  eat with relish   saturday 27th   it cleared up suddenly after dinner and my wife and i  saddled up and off to apia whence we did not return till  yesterday morning  christmas day i wish you could have seen  our party at table  h j moors at one end with my wife i  at the other with mrs m between us two native women  carruthers the lawyer moorss two shopboys  walters and a  m the quadroon  and the guests of the evening shirley  baker the defamed and muchaccused man of tonga and his  son with the artificial joint to his arm  where the  assassins shot him in shooting at his father  bakers  appearance is not unlike john bull on a cartoon he is highly  interesting to speak to as i had expected i found he and i  had many common interests and were engaged in puzzling over  many of the same difficulties  after dinner it was quite  pretty to see our christmas party it was so easily pleased  and prettily behaved  in the morning i should say i had been  to lunch at the german consulate where i had as usual a very  pleasant time  i shall miss dr stuebel much when he leaves  and when adams and lafarge go also it will be a great blow   i am getting spoiled with all this good society  on friday morning i had to be at my house affairs before  seven and they kept me in apia till past ten disputing and  consulting about brick and stone and native and hydraulic  lime and cement and sand and all sorts of otiose details  about the chimney  just what i fled from in my fathers  office twenty years ago i should have made a languid  engineer  rode up with the carpenter  ah my wicked jack  on christmas eve as i was taking the saddle bag off he  kicked at me and fetched me too right on the shin  on  friday being annoyed at the carpenters horse having a  longer trot he uttered a shrill cry and tried to bite him   alas alas these are like old days my dear jack is a bogue  but i cannot strangle jack into submission  i have given up the big house for just now we go ahead right  away with a small one which should be ready in two months  and i suppose will suffice for just now  o i know i havent told you about our aitu have i  it is a  lady aitu fafine she lives on the mountainside her  presence is heralded by the sound of a gust of wind a sound  very common in the high woods when she catches you i do not  know what happens but in practice she is avoided so i  suppose she does more than pass the time of day  the great  aitu saumaiafe was once a living woman and became an aitu  no one understands how she lives in a stream at the well head her hair is red she appears as a lovely young lady  her bust particularly admired to handsome young men these  die her love being fatal  as a handsome youth she has been  known to court damsels with the like result but this is very  rare as an old crone she goes about and asks for water and  woe to them who are uncivil  saumaiafe means literally  come here a thousand  a good name for a lady of her  manners  my aitu fafine does not seem to be in the same line  of business  it is unsafe to be a handsome youth in samoa a  young man died from her favours last month  so we said on  this side of the island on the other where he died it was  not so certain  i for one blame it on madam saumaiafe  without hesitation  example of the farmers sorrows  i slipped out on the  balcony a moment ago  it is a lovely morning cloudless  smoking hot the breeze not yet arisen  looking west in  front of our new house i saw two heads of indian corn  wagging and the rest and all nature stock still  as i  looked one of the stalks subsided and disappeared  i dashed  out to the rescue two small pigs were deep in the grass   quite hid till within a few yards  gently but swiftly  demolishing my harvest  never be a farmer   1230 pm   i while away the moments of digestion by drawing you a  faithful picture of my morning  when i had done writing as  above it was time to clean our house  when i am working it  falls on my wife alone but today we had it between us she  did the bedroom i the sittingroom in fiftyseven minutes  of really most unpalatable labour  then i changed every  stitch for i was wet through and sat down and played on my  pipe till dinner was ready mighty pleased to be in a mildly  habitable spot once more  the house had been neglected for  near a week and was a hideous spot my wifes ear and our  visit to apia being the causes our paul we prefer not to see  upon that theatre and god knows he has plenty to do  elsewhere  i am glad to look out of my back door and see the boys  smoothing the foundations of the new house this is all very  jolly but six months of it has satisfied me we have too  many things for such close quarters to work in the midst of  all the myriad misfortunes of the planters life seated in a  dyonisius cant spell him ear whence i catch every  complaint mishap and contention is besides the devil and  the hope of a cave of my own inspires me with lust  o to be  able to shut my own door and make my own confusion  o to  have the brown paper and the matches and make a hell of my  own once more  i do not bother you with all my troubles in these  outpourings the troubles of the farmer are inspiriting   they are like difficulties out hunting  a fellow rages at  the time and rejoices to recall and to commemorate them  my  troubles have been financial  it is hard to arrange wisely  interests so distributed  america england samoa sydney  everywhere i have an end of liability hanging out and some  shelf of credit hard by and to juggle all these and build a  dwellingplace here and check expense  a thing i am ill  fitted for  you can conceive what a nightmare it is at  times  then god knows i have not been idle  but since the  master nothing has come to raise any coins  i believe the  springs are dry at home and now i am worked out and can no  more at all  a holiday is required  dec 28th  i have got unexpectedly to work again and feel  quite dandy  goodbye  r l s    chapter iv    s s lubeck between apia and sydney jan 17th 1891   my dear colvin  the faamasino sili or chief justice to  speak your low language has arrived  i had ridden down with  henry and lafaele the sun was down the night was close at  hand so we rode fast just as i came to the corner of the  road before apia i heard a gun fire and lo there was a  great crowd at the end of the pier and the troops out and a  chief or two in the height of samoa finery and seumanu  coming in his boat the oarsmen all in uniform bringing the  faamasino sili sure enough  it was lucky he was no longer  the natives would not have waited many weeks  but think of  it as i sat in the saddle at the outside of the crowd  looking the english consul said as if i were commanding  the manoeuvres i was nearly knocked down by a stampede of  the three consuls they had been waiting their guest at the  matafele end and some wretched intrigue among the whites had  brought him to apia and the consuls had to run all the  length of the town and come too late  the next day was a long one i was at a marriage of g the  banker to fanua the virgin of apia  bride and bridesmaids  were all in the old high dress the ladies were all native  the men with the exception of seumanu all white  it was quite a pleasant party and while we were writing we  had a birdseye view of the public reception of the chief  justice  the best part of it were some natives in war array  with blacked faces turbans tapa kilts and guns they  looked very manly and purposelike  no the best part was  poor old drunken joe the portuguese boatman who seemed to  think himself specially charged with the reception and ended  by falling on his knees before the chief justice on the end  of the pier and in full view of the whole town and bay  the  natives pelted him with rotten bananas how the chief justice  took it i was too far off to see but it was highly absurd  i have commemorated my genial hopes for the regimen of the  faamasino sili in the following canine verses which if you  at all guess how to read them are very pretty in movement  and unless he be a mighty good man too true in sense   were quarrelling the villages weve beaten the wooden  drums sa femisai o nuu sa taia o pate is expounded there by the justice ua atuatuvale a le faamasino e the chief justice the terrified justice le faamasino sili le faamasino se is

well after this excursion into tongues that have never been  alive  though i assure you we have one capital book in the  language a book of fables by an old missionary of the  unpromising name of pratt which is simply the best and the  most literary version of the fables known to me  i suppose i  should except la fontaine but l f takes a long time these  are brief as the books of our childhood and full of wit and  literary colour and o colvin what a tongue it would be to  write if one only knew it  and there were only readers   its curse in common use is an incredible lefthanded  wordiness but in the hands of a man like pratt it is  succinct as latin compact of long rolling polysyllables and  little and often pithy particles and for beauty of sound a  dream  listen i quote from pratt  this is good samoan not  canine    o le afa  1    2     3 ua taalili ai          4 le ulu vao  1 ua pa mai   le faititili    1 almost wa 2 the two as just distinguished 3 the ai is  practically suffixed to the verb 4 almost vow  the  excursion has prolonged itself  i started by the lubeck to meet lloyd and my mother there  were many reasons for and against the main reason against  was the leaving of fanny alone in her blessed cabin which  has been somewhat remedied by my carter mr  putting up in  the stable and messing with her but perhaps desire of change  decided me not well though i do think i ought to see an  oculist being very blind indeed and sometimes unable to  read  anyway i left the only cabin passenger four and a  kid in the second cabin and a dear voyage it had like to  have proved  close to fiji choose a worse place on the map  we broke our shaft early one morning and when or where we  might expect to fetch land or meet with any ship i would  like you to tell me  the pacific is absolutely desert  i  have sailed there now some years and scarce ever seen a ship  except in port or close by i think twice  it was the  hurricane season besides and hurricane waters  well our  chief engineer got the shaft  it was the middle crank shaft   mended thrice it was mended and twice broke down but now  keeps up  only we dare not stop for it is almost impossible  to start again  the captain in the meanwhile crowded her  with sail fifteen sails in all every stay being gratified  with a staysail a boatboom sent aloft for a maintop gallant yard and the derrick of a crane brought in service  as bowsprit  all the time we have had a fine fair wind and  a smooth sea today at noon our run was 203 miles if you  please and we are within some 360 miles of sydney   probably there has never been a more gallant success and i  can say honestly it was well worked for  no flurry no high  words no long faces only hard work and honest thought a  pleasant manly business to be present at  all the chances  were we might have been six weeks  ay or three months at  sea  or never turned up at all and now it looks as though  we should reach our destination some five days too late     chapter v    on board ship between sydney and apia feb 1891   my dear colvin  the janet nicoll stuff was rather worse  than i had looked for you have picked out all that is fit to  stand bar two others which i dont dislike  the port of  entry and the house of temoana that is for a present  opinion i may condemn these also ere i have done  by this  time you should have another marquesan letter the worst of  the lot i think and seven paumotu letters which are not  far out of the vein as i wish it i am in hopes the hawaiian  stuff is better yet time will show and time will make  perfect  is something of this sort practicable for the  dedication   terra marique per pericula per ardua amicae comiti dd amans viator   tis a first shot concocted this morning in my berth i had  always before been trying it in english which insisted on  being either insignificant or fulsome i cannot think of a  better word than comes there being not the shadow of a latin  book on board yet sure there is some other  then viator  though it sounds all right is doubtful it has too much  perhaps the sense of wayfarer  last will it mark  sufficiently that i mean my wife  and first how about  blunders  i scarce wish it longer  have had a swingeing sharp attack in sydney beating the  fields for two nights saturday and sunday  wednesday was  brought on board tel quel a wonderful wreck and now  wednesday week am a good deal picked up but yet not quite a  samson being still groggy afoot and vague in the head  my  chess for instance which is usually a pretty strong game  and defies all rivalry aboard is vacillating devoid of  resource and observation and hitherto not covered with  customary laurels  as for work it is impossible  we shall  be in the saddle before long no doubt and the pen once more  couched  you must not expect a letter under these  circumstances but be very thankful for a note  once at  samoa i shall try to resume my late excellent habits and  delight you with journals you unaccustomed i unaccustomed  but it is never too late to mend  it is vastly annoying that i cannot go even to sydney without  an attack and heaven knows my life was anodyne  i only once  dined with anybody at the club with wise worked all morning   a terrible dead pull a month only produced the imperfect  embryos of two chapters lunched in the boardinghouse  played on my pipe went out and did some of my messages  dined at a french restaurant and returned to play draughts  whist or van john with my family  this makes a cheery life  after samoa but it isnt what you call burning the candle at  both ends is it  it appears to me not one word of this  letter will be legible by the time i am done with it this  dreadful ink rubs off  i have a strange kind of novel under  construction it begins about 1660 and ends 1830 or perhaps  i may continue it to 1875 or so with another life  one  two three four five six generations perhaps seven  figure therein two of my old stories delafield and  shovel are incorporated it is to be told in the third  person with some of the brevity of history some of the  detail of romance  the shovels of newton french will be the  name  the idea is an old one it was brought to birth by an  accident a friend in the islands who picked up f jenkin  read a part and said do you know thats a strange book   i like it i dont believe the public will but i like it   he thought it was a novel  very well said i well see  whether the public will like it or not they shall have the  chance  yours ever r l s    chapter vi    friday march 19th   my dear s c  you probably expect that now i am back at  vailima i shall resume the practice of the diary letter  a  good deal is changed  we are more solitude does not attend  me as before the night is passed playing van john for  shells and what is not less important i have just  recovered from a severe illness and am easily tired  i will give you today  i sleep now in one of the lower  rooms of the new house where my wife has recently joined me   we have two beds an empty case for a table a chair a tin  basin a bucket and a jug next door in the diningroom the  carpenters camp on the floor which is covered with their  mosquito nets  before the sun rises at 545 or 550 paul  brings me tea bread and a couple of eggs and by about six  i am at work  i work in bed  my bed is of mats no  mattress sheets or filth  mats a pillow and a blanket   and put in some three hours  it was 95 this morning when i  set off to the streamside to my weeding where i toiled  manuring the ground with the best enricher human sweat till  the conchshell was blown from our verandah at 1030  at  eleven we dine about halfpast twelve i tried by exception  to work again could make nothing ont and by one was on my  way to the weeding where i wrought till three  halfpast  five is our next meal and i read flauberts letters till the  hour came round dined and then fanny having a cold and i  being tired came over to my den in the unfinished house  where i now write to you to the tune of the carpenters  voices and by the light  i crave your pardon  by the  twilight of three vile candles filtered through the medium of  my mosquito bar  bad ink being of the party i write quite  blindfold and can only hope you may be granted to read that  which i am unable to see while writing  i said i was tired it is a mild phrase my back aches like  toothache when i shut my eyes to sleep i know i shall see  before them  a phenomenon to which both fanny and i are  quite accustomed  endless vivid deeps of grass and weed  each plant particular and distinct so that i shall lie inert  in body and transact for hours the mental part of my day  business choosing the noxious from the useful  and in my  dreams i shall be hauling on recalcitrants and suffering  stings from nettles stabs from citron thorns fiery bites  from ants sickening resistances of mud and slime evasions  of slimy roots dead weight of heat sudden puffs of air  sudden starts from birdcalls in the contiguous forest  some  mimicking my name some laughter some the signal of a  whistle and living over again at large the business of my  day  though i write so little i pass all my hours of fieldwork  in continual converse and imaginary correspondence  i scarce  pull up a weed but i invent a sentence on the matter to  yourself it does not get written autant en emportent les  vents but the intent is there and for me in some sort the  companionship  today for instance we had a great talk  i  was toiling the sweat dripping from my nose in the hot fit  after a squall of rain methought you asked me  frankly was  i happy  happy said i i was only happy once that was at  hyeres it came to an end from a variety of reasons decline  of health change of place increase of money age with his  stealing steps since then as before then i know not what  it means  but i know pleasure still pleasure with a  thousand faces and none perfect a thousand tongues all  broken a thousand hands and all of them with scratching  nails  high among these i place this delight of weeding out  here alone by the garrulous water under the silence of the  high wood broken by incongruous sounds of birds  and take  my life all through look at it fore and back and upside  down  though i would very fain change myself  i would not  change my circumstances unless it were to bring you here   and yet god knows perhaps this intercourse of writing serves  as well and i wonder were you here indeed would i commune  so continually with the thought of you  i say i wonder for  a form i know and i know i should not  so far and much further the conversation went while i  groped in slime after viscous roots nursing and sparing  little spears of grass and retreating even with outcry  from the prod of the wild lime  i wonder if any one had ever  the same attitude to nature as i hold and have held for so  long  this business fascinates me like a tune or a passion  yet all the while i thrill with a strong distaste  the  horror of the thing objective and subjective is always  present to my mind the horror of creeping things a  superstitious horror of the void and the powers about me the  horror of my own devastation and continual murders  the life  of the plants comes through my fingertips their struggles go  to my heart like supplications  i feel myself blood boltered then i look back on my cleared grass and count  myself an ally in a fair quarrel and make stout my heart  it is but a little while since i lay sick in sydney beating  the fields about the navy and dean swift and drydens latin  hymns judge if i love this reinvigorating climate where i  can already toil till my head swims and every string in the  poor jumping jack as he now lies in bed aches with a kind  of yearning strain difficult to suffer in quiescence  as for my damned literature god knows what a business it is  grinding along without a scrap of inspiration or a note of  style  but it has to be ground and the mill grinds  exceeding slowly though not particularly small  the last two  chapters have taken me considerably over a month and they  are still beneath pity  this i cannot continue time not  sufficing and the next will just have to be worse  all the  good i can express is just this some day when style  revisits me they will be excellent matter to rewrite  of  course my old cure of a change of work would probably  answer but i cannot take it now  the treadmill turns and  with a kind of desperate cheerfulness i mount the idle  stair  i havent the least anxiety about the book unless i  die i shall find the time to make it good but the lord  deliver me from the thought of the letters  however the  lord has other things on hand and about six tomorrow i  shall resume the consideration practically and face as best  i may the fact of my incompetence and disaffection to the  task  toil i do not spare but fortune refuses me success   we can do more whateverhisnamewas we can deserve it   but my misdesert began long since by the acceptation of a  bargain quite unsuitable to all my methods  today i have had a queer experience  my carter has from the  first been using my horses for his own ends when i left for  sydney i put him on his honour to cease and my back was  scarce turned ere he was forfeit  i have only been waiting  to discharge him and today an occasion arose  i am so much  the old man virulent so readily stumble into anger that i  gave a deal of consideration to my bearing and decided at  last to imitate that of the late   whatever he might have  to say this eminently effective controversialist maintained  a frozen demeanour and a jeering smile  the frozen demeanour  is beyond my reach but i could try the jeering smile did  so perceived its efficacy kept in consequence my temper  and got rid of my friend myself composed and smiling still  he white and shaking like an aspen  he could explain  everything i said it did not interest me  he said he had  enemies i said nothing was more likely  he said he was  calumniated with all my heart said i but there are so many  liars that i find it safer to believe them  he said in  justice to himself he must explain god forbid i should  interfere with you said i with the same factitious grin  but it can change nothing  so i kept my temper rid myself  of an unfaithful servant found a method of conducting  similar interviews in the future and fell in my own liking   one thing more i learned a fresh tolerance for the dead   he too had learned  perhaps had invented  the trick of this  manner god knows what weakness what instability of feeling  lay beneath  ce que cest que de nous poor human nature  that at past forty i must adjust this hateful mask for the  first time and rejoice to find it effective that the effort  of maintaining an external smile should confuse and embitter  a mans soul  today i have not weeded i have written instead from six  till eleven from twelve till two with the interruption of  the interview aforesaid a damned letter is written for the  third time i dread to read it for i dare not give it a  fourth chance  unless it be very bad indeed  now i write  you from my mosquito curtain to the song of saws and planes  and hammers and wood clumping on the floor above in a day  of heavenly brightness a bird twittering near by my eye  through the open door commanding green meads two or three  forest trees casting their boughs against the sky a forest clad mountainside beyond and close in by the doorjamb a  nick of the blue pacific  it is march in england bleak  march and i lie here with the great sliding doors wide open  in an undershirt and pjama trousers and melt in the closure  of mosquito bars and burn to be out in the breeze  a few  torn clouds  not white the sun has tinged them a warm pink   swim in heaven  in which blessed and fair day i have to  make faces and speak bitter words to a man  who has deceived  me it is true  but who is poor and older than i and a  kind of a gentleman too  on the whole i prefer the massacre  of weeds   sunday   when i had done talking to you yesterday i played on my pipe  till the conch sounded then went over to the old house for  dinner and had scarce risen from table ere i was submerged  with visitors  the first of these despatched i spent the  rest of the evening going over the samoan translation of my  bottle imp with claxton the missionary then to bed but  being upset i suppose by these interruptions and having  gone all day without my weeding not to sleep  for hours i  lay awake and heard the rain fall and saw faint faraway  lightning over the sea and wrote you long letters which i  scorn to reproduce  this morning paul was unusually early  the dawn had scarce begun when he appeared with the tray and  lit my candle and i had breakfasted and read with  indescribable sinkings the whole of yesterdays work before  the sun had risen  then i sat and thought and sat and  better thought  it was not good enough nor good it was as  slack as journalism but not so inspired it was excellent  stuff misused and the defects stood gross on it like humps  upon a camel  but could i in my present disposition do  much more with it in my present pressure for time were i  not better employed doing another one about as ill than  making this some thousandth fraction better  yes i thought  and tried the new one and behold i could do nothing my  head swims words do not come to me nor phrases and i  accepted defeat packed up my traps and turned to  communicate the failure to my esteemed correspondent  i  think it possible i overworked yesterday  well well see  tomorrow  perhaps try again later  it is indeed the hope  of trying later that keeps me writing to you  if i take to  my pipe i know myself  all is over for the morning   hurray ill correct proofs   pagopago wednesday   after i finished on sunday i passed a miserable day went out  weeding but could not find peace  i do not like to steal my  dinner unless i have given myself a holiday in a canonical  manner and weeding after all is only fun the amount of its  utility small and the thing capable of being done faster and  nearly as well by a hired boy  in the evening sewall came up  american consul and proposed to take me on a malaga which  i accepted  monday i rode down to apia was nearly all day  fighting about drafts and money the silver problem does not  touch you but it is in a strange and i hope passing phase  making my situation difficult in apia  about eleven the  flags were all halfmasted it was old captain hamilton  samesoni the natives called him who had passed away  in  the evening i walked round to the us consulate it was a  lovely night with a full moon and as i got round to the hot  corner of matautu i heard hymns in front  the balcony of the  dead mans house was full of women singing mary the widow  a native sat on a chair by the doorstep and i was set  beside her on a bench and next to paul the carpenter as i  sat down i had a glimpse of the old captain who lay in a  sheet on his own table  after the hymn was over a native  pastor made a speech which lasted a long while the light  poured out of the door and windows the girls were sitting  clustered at my feet it was choking hot  after the speech  was ended mary carried me within the captains hands were  folded on his bosom his face and head were composed he  looked as if he might speak at any moment i have never seen  this kind of waxwork so express or more venerable and when i  went away i was conscious of a certain envy for the man who  was out of the battle  all night it ran in my head and the  next day when we sighted tutuila and ran into this beautiful  landlocked loch of pago pago whence i write captain  hamiltons folded hands and quiet face said a great deal more  to me than the scenery  i am living here in a traders house we have a good table  sewall doing things in style and i hope to benefit by the  change and possibly get more stuff for letters  in the  meanwhile i am seized quite malapropos with desire to  write a story the bloody wedding founded on fact  very  possibly true being an attempt to read a murder case  not  yet months old in this very place and house where i now  write  the indiscretion is what stops me but if i keep on  feeling as i feel just now it will have to be written  three  star nettison kit nettison field the sailor these are the  main characters old nettison and the captain of the man of  war the secondary  possible scenario  chapter i     chapter vii    saturday april 18th   my dear colvin  i got back on monday night after twenty three hours in an open boat the keys were lost the consul  who had promised us a bottle of burgundy nobly broke open  his storeroom and we got to bed about midnight  next  morning the blessed consul promised us horses for the  daybreak forgot all about it worthy man set us off at last  in the heat of the day and by a short cut which caused  infinite trouble and we were not home till dinner  i was  extenuated and have had a high fever since or should have  been writing before  today for the first time i risk it   tuesday i was pretty bad wednesday had a fever to kill a  horse thursday i was better but still out of ability to do  aught but read awful trash  this is the time one misses  civilisation i wished to send out for some police novels  montepin would have about suited my frozen brain  it is a  bother when all ones thought turns on ones work in some  sense or other could not even think yesterday i took to  inventing dishes by way of entertainment  yesterday while i  lay asleep in the afternoon a very lucky thing happened the  chief justice came to call met one of our employes on the  road and was shown what i had done to the road  is this the road across the island he asked  the only one said innes  and has one man done all this  three times said the trusty innes  it has had to be made  three times and when mr stevenson came it was a track like  what you see beyond  this must be put right said the chief justice   sunday   the truth is i broke down yesterday almost as soon as i  began and have been surreptitiously finishing the entry to day  for all that i was much better ate all the time and  had no fever  the day was otherwise uneventful  i am  reminded i had another visitor on friday and fanny and  lloyd as they returned from a forest raid met in our  desert untrodden road first father didier keeper of the  conscience of mataafa the rising star and next the chief  justice sole stay of laupepa the present and unsteady star  and remember a few days before we were close to the sick bed  and entertained by the amateur physician of tamasese the  late and sunken star  that is the fun of this place  observed lloyd everybody you meet is so important   everybody is also so gloomy  it will come to war again is  the opinion of all the well informed  and before that to  many bankruptcies and after that as usual to famine   here under the microscope we can see history at work   wednesday   i have been very neglectful  a return to work perhaps  premature but necessary has used up all my possible  energies and made me acquainted with the living headache  i  just jot down some of the past notabilia  yesterday b a  carpenter and k my unsuccessful white man were absent  all morning from their work i was working myself where i  hear every sound with morbid certainty and i can testify  that not a hammer fell  upon inquiry i found they had passed  the morning making ice with our ice machine and taking the  horizon with a spirit level  i had no sooner heard this than   a violent headache set in i am a real employer of labour  now and have much of the ship captain when aroused and if i  had a headache i believe both these gentlemen had aching  hearts  i promise you the late  was to the front and k  who was the most guilty yet in a sense the least  blameable having the brains and character of a canarybird  fared none the better for bs repartees  i hear them hard  at work this morning so the menace may be blessed  it was  just after my dinner just before theirs that i administered  my redoubtable tongue  it is really redoubtable  to these  skulkers paul used to triumph over mr j for weeks  i am  very sorry for you he would say youre going to have a  talk with mr stevenson when he comes home you dont know  what that is  in fact none of them do till they get it   i have known k for instance for months he has never heard  me complain or take notice unless it were to praise i have  used him always as my guest and there seems to be something  in my appearance which suggests endless ovine long suffering  we sat in the upper verandah all evening and  discussed the price of iron roofing and the state of the  draughthorses with innes a new man we have taken and who  seems to promise well  one thing embarrasses me  no one ever seems to understand my  attitude about that book the stuff sent was never meant for  other than a first state i never meant it to appear as a  book  knowing well that i have never had one hour of  inspiration since it was begun and have only beaten out my  metal by brute force and patient repetition i hoped some day  to get a spate of style and burnish it  fine mixed  metaphor  i am now so sick that i intend when the letters  are done and some more written that will be wanted simply to  make a book of it by the pruningknife  i cannot fight longer i am sensible of having done worse  than i hoped worse than i feared all i can do now is to do  the best i can for the future and clear the book like a  piece of bush with axe and cutlass  even to produce the ms  of this will occupy me at the most favourable opinion till  the middle of next year really five years were wanting when  i could have made a book but i have a family and  perhaps  i could not make the book after all    chapter viii    april 29th 91   my dear colvin   i begin again  i was awake this morning  about halfpast four  it was still night but i made my  fire which is always a delightful employment and read  lockharts scott until the day began to peep  it was a  beautiful and sober dawn a dovecoloured dawn insensibly  brightening to gold  i was looking at it some while over the  downhill profile of our eastern road when i chanced to  glance northward and saw with extraordinary pleasure the sea  lying outspread  it seemed as smooth as glass and yet i  knew the surf was roaring all along the reef and indeed if  i had listened i could have heard it  and saw the white  sweep of it outside matautu  i am out of condition still and can do nothing and toil to  be at my pen and see some ink behind me  i have taken up  again the high woods of ulufanua  i still think the fable  too fantastic and farfetched  but on a rereading fell in  love with my first chapter and for good or evil i must  finish it  it is really good well fed with facts true to  the manners and for once in my works rendered pleasing by  the presence of a heroine who is pretty  miss uma is pretty  a fact  all my other women have been as ugly as sin and  like falconets horse i have just been reading the anecdote  in lockhart mortes forbye  news our old house is now half demolished it is to be  rebuilt on a new site now we look down upon and through the  open posts of it like a birdcage to the woods beyond  my  poor paulo has lost his father and succeeded to thirty  thousand thalers i think he had to go down to the  consulate yesterday to send a legal paper got drunk of  course and is still this morning in so bemused a condition  that our breakfasts all went wrong  lafaele is absent at the  deathbed of his fair spouse fair she was but not in deed  acting as harlot to the wreckers at work on the warships to  which society she probably owes her end having fallen off a  cliff or been thrust off it inter pocula  henry is the  same our standby  in this transition stage he has been  living in apia but the other night he stayed up and sat  with us about the chimney in my room  it was the first time  he had seen a fire in a hearth he could not look at it  without smiles and was always anxious to put on another  stick  we entertained him with the fairy tales of  civilisation  theatres london blocks in the street  universities  the underground newspapers etc and  projected once more his visit to sydney  if we can manage  it will be next christmas  i see it will be impossible for  me to afford a further journey this winter  we have spent  since we have been here about 2500 pounds which is not much  if you consider we have built on that three houses one of  them of some size and a considerable stable made two miles  of road some three times cleared many acres of bush made  some miles of path planted quantities of food and enclosed  a horse paddock and some acres of pig run but tis a good  deal of money regarded simply as money  k is bosh i have  no use for him but we must do what we can with the fellow  meanwhile he is goodhumoured and honest but inefficient  idle himself the cause of idleness in others grumbling a  selfexcuser  all the faults in a bundle  he owes us thirty  weeks service  the wretched paul about half as much  henry  is almost the only one of our employes who has a credit   may 17th   well am i ashamed of myself  i do not think so  i have  been hammering letters ever since and got three ready and a  fourth about half through all four will go by the mail  which is what i wish for so i keep at least my start  days  and days of unprofitable stubbing and digging and the result  still poor as literature lefthanded heavy unillumined  but i believe readable and interesting as matter  it has  been no joke of a hard time and when my task was done i had  little taste for anything but blowing on the pipe  a few  necessary letters filled the bowl to overflowing  my mother has arrived young well and in good spirits  by  desperate exertions which have wholly floored fanny her  room was ready for her and the diningroom fit to eat in   it was a famous victory  lloyd never told me of your  portrait till a few days ago fortunately i had no pictures  hung yet and the space over my chimney waits your  counterfeit presentment  i have not often heard anything  that pleased me more your severe head shall frown upon me  and keep me to the mark  but why has it not come  have you  been as forgetful as lloyd   18th   miserable comforters are ye all  i read your esteemed pages  this morning by lamplight and the glimmer of the dawn and as  soon as breakfast was over i must turn to and tackle these  despised labours  some courage was necessary but not  wanting  there is one thing at least by which i can avenge  myself for my drubbing for on one point you seem  impenetrably stupid  can i find no form of words which will  at last convey to your intelligence the fact that these  letters were never meant and are not now meant to be other  than a quarry of materials from which the book may be drawn   there seems something incommunicable in this to me simple  idea i know lloyd failed to comprehend it i doubt if he has  grasped it now and i despair after all these efforts that  you should ever be enlightened  still oblige me by reading  that form of words once more and see if a light does not  break  you may be sure after the friendly freedoms of your  criticism necessary i am sure and wholesome i know but  untimely to the poor labourer in his landslip that mighty  little of it will stand  our paul has come into a fortune and wishes to go home to  the hie germanie  this is a tile on our head and if a  shower which is now falling lets up i must go down to  apia and see if i can find a substitute of any kind  this  is from any point of view disgusting above all from that  of work for whatever the result the mill has to be kept  turning apparently dust and not flour is the proceed   well there is gold in the dust which is a fine consolation  since  well i cant help it night or morning i do my  darndest and if i cannot charge for merit i must een  charge for toil of which i have plenty and plenty more ahead  before this cup is drained sweat and hyssop are the  ingredients  we are clearing from carruthers road to the pig fence  twentyeight powerful natives with catholic medals about  their necks all swiping in like trojans long may the sport  continue  the invoice to hand  ere this goes out i hope to see your  expressive but surely not benignant countenance  adieu o  culler of offensive expressions  and a   to be a posy to  your ain dear may  fanny seems a little revived again  after her spasm of work  our books and furniture keep slowly  draining up the road in a sad state of scatterment and  disrepair i wish the devil had had k by his red beard  before he had packed my library  odd leaves and sheets and  boards  a thing to make a bibliomaniac shed tears  are  fished out of odd corners  but i am no bibliomaniac praise  heaven and i bear up and rejoice when i find anything safe   19th   however i worked five hours on the brute and finished my  letter all the same and couldnt sleep last night by  consequence  havent had a bad night since i dont know  when dreamed a large handsome man a new orleans planter  had insulted my wife and do what i pleased i could not  make him fight me and woke to find it was the eleventh  anniversary of my marriage  a letter usually takes me from a  week to three days but im sometimes two days on a page  i  was once three  and then my friends kick me  cestybete   i wish letters of that charming quality could be so timed as  to arrive when a fellow wasnt working at the truck in  question but of course that cant be  did not go down  last night  it showered all afternoon and poured heavy and  loud all night  you should have seen our twentyfive popes the samoan phrase  for a catholic lay or cleric squatting when the days work  was done on the ground outside the verandah and pouring in  the rays of fortyeight eyes through the back and the front  door of the diningroom while henry and i and the boss pope  signed the contract  the second boss an old man wore a  kilt as usual and a balmoral bonnet with a little tartan  edging and the tails pulled off  i told him that hat belong  to my country  sekotia and he said yes that was the place  that he belonged to right enough  and then all the papists  laughed till the woods rang he was slashing away with a  cutlass as he spoke  the pictures have decidedly not come they may probably  arrive sunday    chapter ix    june 1891   sir  to you under your portrait which is in expression  your true breathing self and up to now saddens me in time  and soon i shall be glad to have it there it is still only  a reminder of your absence  fanny wept when we unpacked it  and you know how little she is given to that mood i was  scarce roman myself but that does not count  i lift up my  voice so readily  these are good compliments to the artist   i write in the midst of a wreck of books which have just  come up and have for once defied my labours to get straight   the whole floor is filled with them and whats worse most  of the shelves forbye and where they are to go to and what  is to become of the librarian god knows  it is hot to night and has been airless all day and i am out of sorts  and my work sticks the devil fly away with it and me  we  had an alarm of war since last i wrote my screeds to you and  it blew over and is to blow on again and the rumour goes  they are to begin by killing all the whites  i have no  belief in this and should be infinitely sorry if it came to  pass  i do not mean for us that were otiose  but for the  poor deluded schoolboys who should hope to gain by such a  step   letter resumed june 20th   no diary this time  why you ask  i have only sent out four  letters and two chapters of the wrecker  yes but to get  these i have written 132 pp 66000 words in thirty days  2200 words a day the labours of an elephant  god knows what  its like and dont ask me but nobody shall say i have  spared pains  i thought for some time it wouldnt come at  all  i was days and days over the first letter of the lot   days and days writing and deleting and making no headway  whatever till i thought i should have gone bust but it came  at last after a fashion and the rest went a thought more  easily though i am not so fond as to fancy any better  your opinion as to the letters as a whole is so damnatory  that i put them by  but there is a hell of a want of money  this year  and these gilbert island papers being the most  interesting in matter and forming a compact whole and being  well illustrated i did think of as a possible resource  it would be called   six months in melanesia two island kings  monarchies gilbert island kings  monarchies   and i daresay ill think of a better yet  and would divide  thus   butaritati   i    a town asleep ii   the three brothers iii  around our house iv   a tale of a tapu v    the five days festival vi   domestic life  which might be omitted but not well  better be recast   the king of apemama   vii  the royal traders viii foundation of equator town ix   the palace of mary warren x    equator town and the palace xi   king and commons xii  the devil work box xiii the three corslets xiv  tail piece the court upon a journey   i wish you to watch these closely judging them as a whole  and treating them as i have asked you and favour me with  your damnatory advice  i look up at your portrait and it  frowns upon me  you seem to view me with reproach  the  expression is excellent fanny wept when she saw it and you  know she is not given to the melting mood  she seems really  better i have a touch of fever again i fancy overwork and  today when i have overtaken my letters i shall blow on my  pipe  tell mrs s i have been playing le chant damour  lately and have arranged it after awful trouble rather  prettily for two pipes and it brought her before me with an  effect scarce short of hallucination  i could hear her voice  in every note yet i had forgot the air entirely and began  to pipe it from notes as something new when i was brought up  with a round turn by this reminiscence  we are now very much  installed the diningroom is done and looks lovely  soon  we shall begin to photograph and send you our circumstances   my room is still a howling wilderness  i sleep on a platform  in a window and strike my mosquito bar and roll up my  bedclothes every morning so that the bed becomes by day a  divan  a great part of the floor is kneedeep in books yet  nearly all the shelves are filled alas  it is a place to  make a pig recoil yet here are my interminable labours begun  daily by lamplight and sometimes not yet done when the lamp  has once more to be lighted  the effect of pictures in this  place is surprising  they give great pleasure   june 21st   a word more  i had my breakfast this morning at 430  my  new cook has beaten me and as lloyd says revenged all the  cooks in the world  i have been hunting them to give me  breakfast early since i was twenty and now here comes mr  ratke and i have to plead for mercy  i cannot stand 430 i  am a mere fevered wreck it is now halfpast eight and i can  no more and four hours divide me from lunch the devil take  the man  yesterday it was about 530 which i can stand day  before 5 which is bad enough today i give out  it is  like a london season and as i do not take a siesta once in a  month and then only five minutes i am being worn to the  bones and look aged and anxious  we have rider haggards brother here as a land commissioner  a nice kind of a fellow indeed all the three land  commissioners are very agreeable    chapter x    sunday sept 5  1891   my dear colvin  yours from lochinver has just come  you  ask me if i am ever homesick for the highlands and the isles   conceive that for the last month i have been living there  between 1786 and 1850 in my grandfathers diaries and  letters  i had to take a rest no use talking so i put in a  month over my lives of the stevensons with great pleasure and  profit and some advance one chapter and a part drafted  the  whole promises well chapter i domestic annals  chapter ii   the northern lights  chapter iii the bell rock  chapter  iv a family of boys  chap  v the grandfather  vi alan  stevenson  vii thomas stevenson  my materials for my  greatgrandfather are almost null for my grandfather copious  and excellent  name a puzzle  a scottish family a family  of engineers northern lights the engineers of the northern  lights a family history  advise but it will take long   now imagine if i have been homesick for barrahead and island  glass and kirkwall and cape wrath and the wells of the  pentland firth i could have wept  now for politics  i am much less alarmed i believe the malo  raj government will collapse and cease like an overlain  infant without a shot fired  they have now been months here  on their big salaries  and cedarcrantz whom i specially  like as a man has done nearly nothing and the baron who is  wellmeaning has done worse  they have these large  salaries and they have all the taxes they have made scarce  a foot of road they have not given a single native a  position  all to white men they have scarce laid out a  penny on apia and scarce a penny on the king they have  forgot they were in samoa or that such a thing as samoans  existed and had eyes and some intelligence  the chief  justice has refused to pay his customs  the president  proposed to have an expensive house built for himself while  the king his master has none  i had stood aside and been  a loyal and above all a silent subject up to then but  now i snap my fingers at their malo  it is damned and im  damned glad of it  and this is not all  last wainiu when  i sent fanny off to fiji i hear the wonderful news that the  chief justice is going to fiji and the colonies to improve  his mind  i showed my way of thought to his guest count  wachtmeister whom i have sent to you with a letter  he will  tell you all the news  well the chief justice stayed but  they said he was to leave yesterday  i had intended to go  down and see and warn him  but the presidents house had  come up in the meanwhile and i let them go to their doom  which i am only anxious to see swiftly and if it may be  bloodlessly fall  thus i have in a way withdrawn my unrewarded loyalty  lloyd  is down today with moors to call on mataafa the news of the  excursion made a considerable row in apia and both the  german and the english consuls besought lloyd not to go  but  he stuck to his purpose and with my approval  its a poor  thing if people are to give up a pleasure party for a malo  that has never done anything for us but draw taxes and is  going to go pop and leave us at the mercy of the identical  mataafa whom i have not visited for more than a year and  who is probably furious  the sense of my helplessness here has been rather bitter i  feel it wretched to see this dance of folly and injustice and  unconscious rapacity go forward from day to day and to be  impotent  i was not consulted  or only by one man and that  on particular points i did not choose to volunteer advice  till some pressing occasion i have not even a vote for i am  not a member of the municipality  what ails you miserable man to talk of saving material  i  have a whole world in my head a whole new society to work  but i am in no hurry you will shortly make the acquaintance  of the island of ulufanua on which i mean to lay several  stories the bloody wedding possibly the high woods  o  its so good the high woods but the story is craziness  thats the trouble  a political story the labour slave  etc  ulufanua is an imaginary island the name is a  beautiful samoan word for the top of a forest ulu  leaves  or hair fanualand  the ground or country of the leaves   ulufanua the isle of the sea read that verse dactylically  and you get the beat the us are like our double oo did  ever you hear a prettier word  i do not feel inclined to make a volume of essays but if i  did and perhaps the idea is good  and any idea is better  than south seas  here would be my choice of the scribner  articles dreams beggars lanternbearers random memories   there was a paper called the old pacific capital in fraser  in tullochs time which had merit there were two on  fontainebleau in the magazine of art in henleys time  i  have no idea if theyre any good then theres the emigrant  train  pulvis et umbra is in a different key and wouldnt  hang on with the rest  i have just interrupted my letter and read through the  chapter of the high woods that is written a chapter and a  bit some sixteen pages really very fetching but what do  you wish the story is so wilful so steep so silly  its a  hallucination i have outlived and yet i never did a better  piece of work horrid and pleasing and extraordinarily  true its sixteen pages of the south seas their essence   what am i to do  lose this little gem  for ill be bold  and thats what i think it  or go on with the rest which i  dont believe in and dont like and which can never make  aught but a silly yarn  make another end to it  ah yes  but thats not the way i write the whole tale is implied i  never use an effect when i can help it unless it prepares  the effects that are to follow thats what a story consists  in  to make another end that is to make the beginning all  wrong  the denouement of a long story is nothing it is just  a full close which you may approach and accompany as you  please  it is a coda not an essential member in the rhythm  but the body and end of a short story is bone of the bone and  blood of the blood of the beginning  well i shall end by  finishing it against my judgment that fragment is my  delilah  golly its good  i am not shining by modesty but  i do just love the colour and movement of that piece so far  as it goes  i was surprised to hear of your fishing  and you saw the  pharos thrice fortunate man i wish i dared go home i  would ask the commissioners to take me round for old sakes  sake and see all my family pictures once more from the mull  of galloway to unst  however all is arranged for our  meeting in ceylon except the date and the blooming pounds   i have heard of an exquisite hotel in the country airy  large rooms good cookery not dear we shall have a couple  of months there if we can make it out and converse or  as  my grandfather always said  commune  communings with mr  kennedy as to lighthouse repairs  he was a fine old fellow  but a droll   evening   lloyd has returned  peace and war were played before his  eyes at heads or tails  a german was stopped with levelled  guns he raised his whip had it fallen we might have been  now in war  excuses were made by mataafa himself  doubtless  the thing was done  i mean the stopping of the german  a  little to show off before lloyd  meanwhile  was up here  telling how the chief justice was really gone for five or  eight weeks and begging me to write to the times and  denounce the state of affairs many strong reasons he  advanced and lloyd and i have been since his arrival and s  departure near half an hour debating what should be done   cedarcrantz is gone it is not my fault he knows my views on  that point  alone of all points  he leaves me with my  mouth sealed  yet this is a nice thing that because he is  guilty of a fresh offence  his flight  the mouth of the  only possible influential witness should be closed  i do not  like this argument  i look like a cad if i do in the mans  absence what i could have done in a more manly manner in his  presence  true but why did he go  it is his last sin  and  i who like the man extremely  that is the word  i love his  society  he is intelligent pleasant even witty a  gentleman  and you know how that attaches  i loathe to seem  to play a base part but the poor natives  who are like  other folk false enough lazy enough not heroes not saints   ordinary men damnably misused  are they to suffer because  i like cedarcrantz and cedarcrantz has cut his lucky  this  is a little tragedy observe well  a tragedy  i may be  right i may be wrong in my judgment but i am in treaty with  my honour  i know not how it will seem tomorrow  lloyd  thought the barrier of honour insurmountable and it is an  ugly obstacle  he cedarcrantz will likely meet my wife  three days from now may travel back with her will be  charming if he does suppose this and suppose him to arrive  and find that i have sprung a mine  or the nearest approach  to it i could find  behind his back  my position is pretty   yes i am an aristocrat  i have the old petty personal view  of honour  i should blush till i die if i do this yet it is  on the cards that i may do it  so much i have written you in  bed as a man writes or talks in a bittre wahl  now i  shall sleep and see if i am more clear  i will consult the  missionaries at least  i place some reliance in m also  or  i should if he were not a partisan but a partisan he is   theres the pity  to sleep  a fund of wisdom in the  prostrate body and the fed brain  kindly observe r l s in  the talons of politics  tis funny  tis sad  nobody but  these cursed idiots could have so driven me i cannot bear  idiots  my dear colvin i must go to sleep it is long past ten  a  dreadful hour for me  and here am i lingering so i feel in  the diningroom at the monument talking to you across the  table both on our feet and only the two stairs to mount  and get to bed and sleep and be waked by dear old george   to whom i wish my kindest remembrances  next morning  i  look round and there is my blue room and my long lines of  shelves and the door gaping on a moonless night and no word  of s c but his twa portraits on the wall  goodbye my  dear fellow and goodnight  queer place the world   monday   no clearness of mind with the morning i have no guess what i  should do  tis easy to say that the public duty should  brush aside these little considerations of personal dignity  so it is that politicians begin and in a month you find them  rat and flatter and intrigue with brows of brass  i am  rather of the old view that a mans first duty is to these  little laws the big he does not he never will understand  i may be wrong about the chief justice and the baron and the  state of samoa i cannot be wrong about the vile attitude i  put myself in if i blow the gaff on cedarcrantz behind his  back   tuesday   one more word about the south seas in answer to a question i  observe i have forgotten to answer  the tahiti part has  never turned up because it has never been written  as for  telling you where i went or when or anything about honolulu  i would rather die that is fair and plain  how can anybody  care when or how i left honolulu  a man of upwards of forty  cannot waste his time in communicating matter of that  indifference  the letters it appears are tedious they  would be more tedious still if i wasted my time upon such  infantile and suckingbottle details  if ever i put in any  such detail it is because it leads into something or serves  as a transition  to tell it for its own sake never  the  mistake is all through that i have told too much i had not  sufficient confidence in the reader and have overfed him  and here are you anxious to learn how i  o colvin  suppose  it had made a book all such information is given to one  glance of an eye by a map with a little dotted line upon it   but let us forget this unfortunate affair   wednesday   yesterday i went down to consult clarke who took the view of  delay  has he changed his mind already  i wonder here at  least is the news  some little while back some men of manono   what is manono  a samoan rotten borough a small isle of  huge political importance heaven knows why where a handful  of chiefs make half the trouble in the country  some men of  manono which is strong mataafa burned down the houses and  destroyed the crops of some malietoa neighbours  the  president went there the other day and landed alone on the  island which to give him his due was plucky  moreover he  succeeded in persuading the folks to come up and be judged on  a particular day in apia  that day they did not come but  did come the next and to their vast surprise were given  six months imprisonment and clapped in gaol  those who had  accompanied them cried to them on the streets as they were  marched to prison shall we rescue you  the condemned  marching in the hands of thirty men with loaded rifles cried  out no  and the trick was done  but it was ardently  believed a rescue would be attempted the gaol was laid about  with armed men day and night but there was some question of  their loyalty and the commandant of the forces a very nice  young beardless swede became nervous and conceived a plan   how if he should put dynamite under the gaol and in case of  an attempted rescue blow up prison and all  he went to the  president who agreed he went to the american manofwar for  the dynamite and machine was refused and got it at last  from the wreckers  the thing began to leak out and there  arose a muttering in town  people had no fancy for amateur  explosions for one thing  for another it did not clearly  appear that it was legal the men had been condemned to six  months prison which they were peaceably undergoing they  had not been condemned to death  and lastly it seemed a  somewhat advanced example of civilisation to set before  barbarians  the mutter in short became a storm and  yesterday while i was down a cutter was chartered and the  prisoners were suddenly banished to the tokelaus  who has  changed the sentence  we are going to stir in the dynamite  matter we do not want the natives to fancy us consenting to  such an outrage  fanny has returned from her trip and on the whole looks  better  the high woods are under way and their name is now  the beach of falesa and the yarn is cured  i have about  thirty pages of it done it will be fifty to seventy i  suppose  no supernatural trick at all and escaped out of it  quite easily cant think why i was so stupid for so long   mighty glad to have fanny back to this hell of the south  seas as the german captain called it  what will  cedarcrantz think when he comes back  to do him justice had  he been here this manono hash would not have been  here is a pretty thing  when fanny was in fiji all the samoa  and tokelau folks were agog about our flash house but the  whites had never heard of it   robert louis stevenson author of the beach of falesa    chapter xi    sept 28   my dear colvin   since i last laid down my pen i have  written and rewritten the beach of falesa something like  sixty thousand words of sterling domestic fiction the story  you will understand is only half that length and now i  dont want to write any more again for ever or feel so and  ive got to overhaul it once again to my sorrow  i was all  yesterday revising and found a lot of slacknesses and what  is worse in this kind of thing some literaryisms  one of  the puzzles is this it is a first person story  a trader  telling his own adventure in an island  when i began i  allowed myself a few liberties because i was afraid of the  end now the end proved quite easy and could be done in the  pace so the beginning remains about a quarter tone out in  places but i have rather decided to let it stay so  the  problem is always delicate it is the only thing that worries  me in first person tales which otherwise quo alan set  better wi my genius  there is a vast deal of fact in the  story and some pretty good comedy  it is the first  realistic south sea story i mean with real south sea  character and details of life  everybody else who has tried  that i have seen got carried away by the romance and ended  in a kind of sugarcandy sham epic and the whole effect was  lost  there was no etching no human grin consequently no  conviction  now i have got the smell and look of the thing a  good deal  you will know more about the south seas after you  have read my little tale than if you had read a library  as  to whether any one else will read it i have no guess  i am  in an off time but there is just the possibility it might  make a hit for the yarn is good and melodramatic and there  is quite a love affair  for me and mr wiltshire the  narrator is a huge lark though i say it  but there is  always the exotic question and everything the life the  place the dialects  traders talk which is a strange  conglomerate of literary expressions and english and american  slang and beach de mar or native english  the very trades  and hopes and fears of the characters are all novel and may  be found unwelcome to that great hulking bullering whale  the public  since i wrote i have been likewise drawing up a document to  send it to the president it has been dreadfully delayed not  by me but today they swear it will be sent in  a list of  questions about the dynamite report are herein laid before  him and considerations suggested why he should answer   october 5th   ever since my last snatch i have been much chivied about over  the president business his answer has come and is an  evasion accompanied with schoolboy insolence and we are  going to try to answer it  i drew my answer and took it down  yesterday but one of the signatories wants another paragraph  added which i have not yet been able to draw and as to the  wisdom of which i am not yet convinced   next day oct 7th the right day   we are all in rather a muddled state with our president  affair  i do loathe politics but at the same time i cannot  stand by and have the natives blown in the air treacherously  with dynamite  they are still quiet how long this may  continue i do not know though of course by mere prescription  the government is strengthened and is probably insured till  the next taxes fall due  but the unpopularity of the whites  is growing  my native overseer the great henry simele  announced today that he was weary of whites upon the beach   all too proud said this veracious witness  one of the  proud ones had threatened yesterday to cut off his head with  a bush knife  these are native outrages honour bright  and setting theft aside in which the natives are active  this is the main stream of irritation  the natives are  generally courtly far from always civil but really gentle  and with a strong sense of honour of their own and certainly  quite as much civilised as our dynamiting president  we shall be delighted to see kipling  i go to bed usually  about halfpast eight and my lamp is out before ten i  breakfast at six  we may say roughly we have no soda water  on the island and just now truthfully no whisky  i have  heard the chimes at midnight now no more i guess  but   fanny and i as soon as we can get coins for it are coming  to europe not to england i am thinking of royat  bar wars   if not perhaps the apennines might give us a mountain refuge  for two months or three in summer  how is that for high   but the money must be all in hand first   october 13th   how am i to describe my life these last few days  i have  been wholly swallowed up in politics a wretched business  with fine elements of farce in it too which repay a man in  passing involving many dark and many moonlight rides secret  counsels which are at once divulged sealed letters which are  read aloud in confidence to the neighbours and a mass of  fudge and fun which would have driven me crazy ten years  ago and now makes me smile  on friday henry came and told us he must leave and go to my  poor old family in savaii why  i do not quite know  but  i suspect to be tattooed  if so then probably to be  married and we shall see him no more  i told him he must do  what he thought his duty we had him to lunch drank his  health and he and i rode down about twelve  when i got  down i sent my horse back to help bring down the family  later  my own afternoon was cut out for me my last draft  for the president had been objected to by some of the  signatories  i stood out and one of our small number  accordingly refused to sign  him i had to go and persuade  which went off very well after the first hottish moments you  have no idea how stolid my temper is now  by about five the  thing was done and we sat down to dinner at the chinamans   the verrey or doyens of apia  g and i at each end as  hosts gs wife  fanua late maid of the village her  adopted father and mother seumanu and faatulia fanny  belle lloyd austin and henry simele his last appearance   henry was in a kilt of gray shawl with a blue jacket white  shirt and black necktie and looked like a dark genteel guest  in a highland shootingbox  seumanu opposite fanny next  g is chief of apia a rather big gun in this place looking  like a large fatted military englishman bar the colour   faatulia next me is a bigger chief than her husband  henry  is a chief too  his chief name iiga eeeenga he has not  yet taken because of his youth  we were in fine society  and had a pleasant mealtime with lots of fun  then to the  opera  i beg your pardon i mean the circus  we occupied  the first row in the reserved seats and there in the row  behind were all our friends  captain foss and his captain lieutenant three of the american officers very nice  fellows the dr etc so we made a fine show of what an  embittered correspondent of the local paper called the  shoddy aristocracy of apia and you should have seen how we  carried on and how i clapped and captain foss hollered  wunderschon and threw himself forward in his seat and how  we all in fact enjoyed ourselves like schoolchildren austin  not a shade more than his neighbours  then the circus broke  up and the party went home but i stayed down having  business on the morrow  yesterday october 12th great news reaches me and lloyd and  i with the mail just coming in must leave all saddle and  ride down  true enough the president had resigned  sought  to resign his presidency of the council and keep his  advisership to the king given way to the consuls objections  and resigned all  then fell out with them about the  disposition of the funds and was now trying to resign from  his resignation  sad little president so trim to look at  and i believe so kind to his little wife  not only so but i  meet d on the beach  d calls me in consultation and we  make with infinite difficulty a draft of a petition to the  king    then to dinner at ms a very merry meal  interrupted before it was over by the arrival of the  committee  slight sketch of procedure agreed upon self  appointed spokesman and the deputation sets off  walk all  through matafele all along mulinuu come to the kings  house he has verbally refused to see us in answer to our  letter swearing he is gasegase chiefsickness not common  mans and indeed we see him inside in bed  it is a  miserable low house better houses by the dozen in the little  hamlet tanugamanono of bushmen on our way to vailima and  the presidents house in process of erection just opposite   we are told to return tomorrow i refuse and at last we are  very sourly received sit on the mats and i open out  through a very poor interpreter and sometimes hampered by  unacceptable counsels from my backers  i can speak fairly  well in a plain way now  c asked me to write out my  harangue for him this morning i have done so and couldnt  get it near as good  i suppose talking and interpreting i  was twenty minutes or halfanhour on the deck then his  majesty replied in the dying whisper of a big chief a few  words of rejoinder approving and the deputation withdrew  rather well satisfied  a few days ago this intervention would have been a deportable  offence not now i bet i would like them to try  a little  way back along mulinuu mrs g met us with her husbands  horse and he and she and lloyd and i rode back in a heavenly  moonlight  here ends a chapter in the life of an island  politician  catch me at it again tis easy to go in but it  is not a pleasant trade  i have had a good team as good as  i could get on the beach but what trouble even so and what  fresh troubles shaping  but i have on the whole carried all  my points i believe all but one and on that which did not  concern me i had no right to interfere  i am sure you would  be amazed if you knew what a good hand i am at keeping my  temper talking people over and giving reasons which are not  my reasons but calculated for the meridian of the particular  objection so soon does falsehood await the politician in his  whirling path    chapter xii    may october 24th   my dear carthew  see what i have written but its colvin  im after  i have written two chapters about thirty pages  of wrecker since the mail left which must be my excuse and  the bother ive had with it is not to be imagined you might  have seen me the day before yesterday weighing british sovs  and chili dollars to arrange my treasure chest  and there  was such a calculation not for that only but for the ships  position and distances when  but i am not going to tell you  the yarn  and then as my arithmetic is particularly lax  lloyd had to go over all my calculations and then as i had  changed the amount of money he had to go over all his as to  the amount of the lay and altogether a bank could be run  with less effusion of figures than it took to shore up a  single chapter of a measly yarn  however its done and i  have but one more or at the outside two to do and i am  free and can do any damn thing i like  before falling on politics i shall give you my day  awoke  somewhere about the first peep of day came gradually to and  had a turn on the verandah before 555 when the child an  enormous wallis islander brings me an orange at 6  breakfast 610 to work which lasts till at 1030 austin  comes for his history lecture this is rather dispiriting  but education must be gone about in faith  and charity both  of which pretty nigh failed me today about of all things  carthage 11 luncheon after luncheon in my mothers room i  read chapter xxiii of the wrecker then belle lloyd and i  go up and make music furiously till about 2 i suppose when  i turn into work again till 4 fool from 4 to halfpast  tired out and waiting for the bath hour 430 bath 440  eat two heavenly mangoes on the verandah and see the boys  arrive with the packhorses 5 dinner smoke chat on  verandah then hand of cards and at last at 8 come up to my  room with a pint of beer and a hard biscuit which i am now  consuming and as soon as they are consumed i shall turn in  such are the innocent days of this ancient and outworn  sportsman today there was no weeding usually there is  however edge in somewhere  my books for the moment are a  crib to phaedo and the second book of montaigne and a  little while back i was reading frederic harrison choice of  books etc  very good indeed a great deal of sense and  knowledge in the volume and some very true stuff contra  carlyle about the eighteenth century  a hideous idea came  over me that perhaps harrison is now getting old  perhaps  you are  perhaps i am  oh this infidelity must be stared  firmly down  i am about twentythree  say twentyeight you  about thirty or byr lady thirtyfour and as harrison  belongs to the same generation there is no good bothering  about him  here has just been a fine alert i gave my wife a dose of  chlorodyne  something wrong says she  nonsense said  i  embrocation said she  i smelt it and  it smelt very  funny  i think its just gone bad and tomorrow will  tell  proved to be so   wednesday   history of tuesday  woke at usual time very little work  for i was tired and had a job for the evening  to write  parts for a new instrument a violin  lunch chat and up to  my place to practise but there was no practising for me  my  flageolet was gone wrong and i had to take it all to pieces  clean it and put it up again  as this is a most intricate  job  the thing dissolves into seventeen separate members  most of these have to be fitted on their individual springs  as fine as needles and sometimes two at once with the  springs shoving different ways  it took me till two  then  lloyd and i rode forth on our errands first to motootua  where we had a really instructive conversation on weeds and  grasses  thence down to apia where we bought a fresh bottle  of chlorodyne and conversed on politics  my visit to the king which i thought at the time a  particularly nugatory and even schoolboy step and only  consented to because i had held the reins so tight over my  little band before has raised a deuce of a row  new  proclamation no one is to interview the sacred puppet  without consuls permission two days notice and an  approved interpreter  read i suppose spy  then back i  should have said i was trying the new horse a tallish  piebald bought from the circus he proved steady and safe  but in very bad condition and not so much the wild arab  steed of the desert as had been supposed  the height of his  back after commodious jack astonished me and i had a great  consciousness of exercise and florid action as i posted to  his long emphatic trot  we had to ride back easy even so  he was hot and blown and when we set a boy to lead him to  and fro our last character for sanity perished  we returned  just neat for dinner and in the evening our violinist  arrived a young lady no great virtuoso truly but plucky  industrious and a good reader and we played five pieces  with huge amusement and broke up at nine  this morning i  have read a splendid piece of montaigne written this page of  letter and now turn to the wrecker  wednesday  november 16th or 17th  and i am ashamed to say  mail day  the wrecker is finished that is the best of my  news it goes by this mail to scribners and i honestly  think it a good yarn on the whole and of its measly kind   the part that is genuinely good is nares the american  sailor that is a genuine figure had there been more nares  it would have been a better book but of course it didnt set  up to be a book only a long tough yarn with some pictures of  the manners of today in the greater world  not the shoddy  sham world of cities clubs and colleges but the world  where men still live a mans life  the worst of my news is  the influenza apia is devastate the shops closed a ball  put off etc  as yet we have not had it at vailima and who  knows we may escape  none of us go down but of course the  boys come and go  your letter had the most wonderful i told you so i ever  heard in the course of my life  why you madman i wouldnt  change my present installation for any post dignity honour  or advantage conceivable to me  it fills the bill i have  the loveliest time  and as for wars and rumours of wars you  surely know enough of me to be aware that i like that also a  thousand times better than decrepit peace in middlesex  i do  not quite like politics i am too aristocratic i fear for  that  god knows i dont care who i chum with perhaps like  sailors best but to go round and sue and sneak to keep a  crowd together  never  my imagination which is not the  least damped by the idea of having my head cut off in the  bush recoils aghast from the idea of a life like  gladstones and the shadow of the newspaper chills me to the  bone  hence my late eruption was interesting but not what i  like  all else suits me in this killed a mosquito a1  abode  about politics  a determination was come to by the president  that he had been an idiot emissaries came to g and me to  kiss and be friends  my man proposed i should have a  personal interview i said it was quite useless i had  nothing to say i had offered him the chance to inform me  had pressed it on him and had been very unpleasantly  received and now time was  then it was decided that i was  to be made a culprit against germany the german captain  a  delightful fellow and our constant visitor  wrote to say  that as a german officer he could not come even to say  farewell  we all wrote back in the most friendly spirit  telling him politely that some of these days he would be  sorry and we should be delighted to see our friend again   since then i have seen no german shadow  mataafa has been proclaimed a rebel the president did this  act and then resigned  by singular good fortune mataafa  has not yet moved no thanks to our idiot governors  they  have shot their bolt they have made a rebel of the only man  to their own knowledge on the report of their own spy who  held the rebel party in check and having thus called on war  to fall they can do no more sit equally expertes of vis  and counsel regarding their handiwork  it is always a cry  with these folk that he mataafa had no ammunition  i  always said it would be found and we know of five boatloads  that have found their way to malie already  where there are  traders there will be ammunition aphorism by r l s  now what am i to do next  lives of the stevensons  historia samoae  a history for  children  fiction  i have had two hard months at fiction i  want a change  stevensons  i am expecting some more  material perhaps better wait  samoa rather tempting might  be useful to the islands  and to me for it will be written  in admirable temper i have never agreed with any party and  see merits and excuses in all should do it if i did very  slackly and easily as if half in conversation  history for  children  this flows from my lessons to austin no book is  any good  the best i have seen is freemans old english  history but his style is so rasping and a child can learn  more if hes clever  i found my sketch of general aryan  history given in conversation to have been practically  correct  at least what i mean is freeman had very much the  same stuff in his early chapters only not so much and i  thought not so well placed and the child remembered some of  it  now the difficulty is to give this general idea of main  place growth and movement it is needful to tack it on a  yarn  now scotch is the only history i know it is the only  history reasonably represented in my library it is a very  good one for my purpose owing to two civilisations having  been face to face throughout  or rather roman civilisation  face to face with our ancient barbaric life and government  down to yesterday to 1750 anyway  but the tales of a  grandfather stand in my way i am teaching them to austin  now and they have all scotts defects and all scotts  hopeless merit  i cannot compete with that and yet so far  as regards teaching history how he has missed his chances   i think ill try i really have some historic sense i feel  that in my bones  then theres another thing  scott never  knew the highlands he was always a borderer  he has missed  that whole long strange pathetic story of our savages  and besides his style is not very perspicuous to childhood   gad i think ill have a flutter  buridans ass  whether to  go what to attack  must go to other letters shall add to  this if i have time    chapter xiii    nov 25th 1891   my dear colvin my dear colvin  i wonder how often im  going to write it  in spite of the loss of three days as i  have to tell and a lot of weeding and cacao planting i have  finished since the mail left four chapters fortyeight pages  of my samoa history  it is true that the first three had  been a good deal drafted two years ago but they had all to  be written and rewritten and the fourth chapter is all new   chapter i elements of discordnative  ii elements of  discordforeign  iii the success of laupepa  iv brandeis   v will probably be called the rise of mataafa  vi furor  consularis  a devil of a long chapter  vii stuebel the  pacificator  viii government under the treaty of berlin   ix practical suggestions  say threesixths of it are done  maybe more by this mail five chapters should go and that  should be a good half of it say sixty pages  and if you  consider that i sent by last mail the end of the wrecker  coming on for seventy or eighty pages and the mail before  that the entire tale of the beach of falesa i do not think i  can be accused of idleness  this is my season i often work  six and seven and sometimes eight hours and the same day i  am perhaps weeding or planting for an hour or two more  and  i daresay you know what hard work weeding is  and it all  agrees with me at this time of the year  like  like  idleness if a man of my years could be idle  my first visit to apia was a shock to me every second person  the ghost of himself and the place reeking with infection   but i have not got the thing yet and hope to escape  this  shows how much stronger i am think of me flitting through a  town of influenza patients seemingly unscathed  we are all  on the cacao planting  the next day my wife and i rode over to the german  plantation vailele whose manager is almost the only german  left to speak to us  seventy labourers down with influenza   it is a lovely ride halfway down our mountain towards apia  then turn to the right ford the river and three miles of  solitary grass and cocoa palms to where the sea beats and  the wild wind blows unceasingly about the plantation house   on the way down fanny said now what would you do if you saw  colvin coming up  next day we rode down to apia to make calls  yesterday the mail came and the fat was in the fire   nov 29th   book  all right  i must say i like your order  and the  papers are some of them up to dick and no mistake  i agree  with you the lights seem a little turned down  the truth is  i was far through if you understand scots and came none  too soon to the south seas where i was to recover peace of  body and mind  no man but myself knew all my bitterness in  those days  remember that the next time you think i regret  my exile  and however low the lights are the stuff is true  and i believe the more effective after all what i wish to  fight is the best fought by a rather cheerless presentation  of the truth  the world must return some day to the word  duty and be done with the word reward  there are no  rewards and plenty duties  and the sooner a man sees that  and acts upon it like a gentleman or a fine old barbarian  the better for himself  there is my usual puzzle about publishers  chatto ought to  have it as he has all the other essays these all belong to  me and chatto publishes on terms  longman has forgotten the  terms we are on let him look up our first correspondence  and he will see i reserved explicitly as was my habit the  right to republish as i choose  had the same arrangement  with henley magazine of art and with tulloch frasers   for any necessary note or preface it would be a real service  if you would undertake the duty yourself  i should love a  preface by you as short or as long as you choose three  sentences thirty pages the thing i should like is your  name  and the excuse of my great distance seems sufficient   i shall return with this the sheets corrected as far as i  have them the rest i will leave if you will to you  entirely let it be your book and disclaim what you dislike  in the preface  you can say it was at my eager prayer  i  should say i am the less willing to pass chatto over because  he behaved the other day in a very handsome manner  he asked  leave to reprint damien i gave it to him as a present  explaining i could receive no emolument for a personal  attack  and he took out my share of profits and sent them  in my name to the leper fund  i could not bear after that to  take from him any of that class of books which i have always  given him  tell him the same terms will do  clark to print  uniform with the others  i have lost all the days since this letter began rehandling  chapter iv of the samoa racket  i do not go in for  literature address myself to sensible people rather than to  sensitive  and indeed it is a kind of journalism i have  no right to dally if it is to help it must come soon  in  two months from now it shall be done and should be published  in the course of march  i propose cassell gets it  i am  going to call it a footnote to history eight years of  trouble in samoa i believe  i recoil from serious names  they seem so much too pretentious for a pamphlet  it will be  about the size of treasure island i believe  of course as  you now know my case of conscience cleared itself off and i  began my intervention directly to one of the parties  the  other the chief justice i am to inform of my book the first  occasion  god knows if the book will do any good  or harm  but i judge it right to try  there is one mans life  certainly involved and it may be all our lives  i must not  stand and slouch but do my best as best i can  but you may  conceive the difficulty of a history extending to the present  week at least and where almost all the actors upon all  sides are of my personal acquaintance  the only way is to  judge slowly and write boldly and leave the issue to fate     i am far indeed from wishing to confine myself to  creative work that is a loss the other repairs the one  chance for a man and above all for one who grows elderly  ahem is to vary drainage and repair  that is the one thing  i understand  the cultivation of the shallow solum of my  brain  but i would rather from soon on be released from  the obligation to write  in five or six years this  plantation  suppose it and us still to exist  should pretty  well support us and pay wages not before and already the  six years seem long to me  if literature were but a pastime  i have interrupted myself to write the necessary notification  to the chief justice  i see in looking up longmans letter that it was as usual the  letter of an obliging gentleman so do not trouble him with  my reminder  i wish all my publishers were not so nice  and  i have a fourth and a fifth baying at my heels but for  these of course they must go wanting   dec 2nd   no answer from the chief justice which is like him but  surely very wrong in such a case  the lunch bell  i have  been off work playing patience and weeding all morning   yesterday and the day before i drafted eleven and revised  nine pages of chapter v and the truth is i was extinct by  lunchtime and played patience sourly the rest of the day   tomorrow or next day i hope to go in again and win  lunch  2nd bell   dec 2nd afternoon   i have kept up the idleness blew on the pipe to belles  piano then had a ride in the forest all by my nainsel back  and piped again and now dinner nearing  take up this sheet  with nothing to say  the weird figure of faauma is in the  room washing my windows in a black lavalava kilt with a  red handkerchief hanging from round her neck between her  breasts not another stitch her hair close cropped and  oiled when she first came here she was an angelic little  stripling but she is now in full flower  or halfflower   and grows buxom  as i write i hear her wet cloth moving and  grunting with some industry for i had a word this day with  her husband on the matter of work and mealtime when she is  always late  and she has a vague reverence for papa as she  and her enormous husband address me when anything is wrong   her husband is lafaele sometimes called the archangel of  whom i have writ you often  rest of our household talolo  cook pulu kitchen boy good steady industrious lads  henry back again from savaii where his love affair seems  not to have prospered with what looks like a spearwound in  the back of his head of which mr reticence says nothing  simi manuele and two other labourers outdoors  lafaele is  provost of the livestock whereof now three milkcows one  bullcalf one heifer jack macfarlane the mare harold  tifaga jack donald and edinburgh  seven horses  o and the  stallion  eight horses five cattle total if my arithmetic  be correct thirteen head of beasts i dont know how the  pigs stand or the ducks or the chickens but we get a good  many eggs and now and again a duckling or a chickling for  the table the pigs are more solemn and appear only on  birthdays and sich   monday dec 7   on friday morning about eleven 1500 cacao seeds arrived and  we set to and toiled from twelve that day to six and went to  bed pretty tired  next day i got about an hour and a half at  my history and was at it again by 810 and except an hour  for lunch kept at it till four pm  yesterday i did some  history in the morning and slept most of the afternoon and  today being still averse from physical labour and the mail  drawing nigh drew out of the squad and finished for press  the fifth chapter of my history fiftynine pages in one  month which you will allow me to say is a devil of a large  order it means at least 177 pages of writing 89000 words  and hours going to and fro among my notes  however this is  the way it has to be done the job must be done fast or it  is of no use  and it is a curious yarn  honestly i think  people should be amused and convinced if they could be at  the pains to look at such a damned outlandish piece of  machinery which of course they wont  and much i care  when i was filling baskets all saturday in my dull mulish  way perhaps the slowest worker there surely the most  particular and the only one that never looked up or knocked  off i could not but think i should have been sent on  exhibition as an example to young literary men  here is how  to learn to write might be the motto  you should have seen  us the verandah was like an irish bog our hands and faces  were bedaubed with soil and faauma was supposed to have  struck the right note when she remarked a propos of  nothing too much eleele soil for me  the cacao you  must understand has to be planted at first in baskets of  plaited cocoaleaf  from four to ten natives were plaiting  these in the woodshed  four boys were digging up soil and  bringing it by the boxful to the verandah  lloyd and i and  belle and sometimes s who came to bear a hand were  filling the baskets removing stones and lumps of clay  austin and faauma carried them when full to fanny who  planted a seed in each and then set them packed close in  the corners of the verandah  from twelve on friday till five  pm on saturday we planted the first 1500 and more than 700  of a second lot  you cannot dream how filthy we were and we  were all properly tired  they are all at it again today  bar belle and me not required and glad to be out of it   the chief justice has not yet replied and i have news that  he received my letter  what a man  i have gone crazy over bourgets sensations ditalie hence  the enclosed dedications a mere cry of gratitude for the  best fun ive had over a new book this ever so    chapter xiv    tuesday dec 1891   sir  i have the honour to report further explorations of  the course of the river vaea with accompanying sketch plan   the party under my command consisted of one horse and was  extremely insubordinate and mutinous owing to not being used  to go into the bush and being halfbroken anyway  and that  the wrong half  the route indicated for my party was up the  bed of the socalled river vaea which i accordingly followed  to a distance of perhaps two or three furlongs eastward from  the house of vailima where the stream being quite dry the  bush thick and the ground very difficult i decided to leave  the main body of the force under my command tied to a tree  and push on myself with the point of the advance guard  consisting of one man  the valley had become very narrow and  airless foliage close shut above dry bed of the stream much  excavated so that i passed under fallen trees without  stooping  suddenly it turned sharply to the north at right  angles to its former direction i heard living water and  came in view of a tall face of rock and the stream spraying  down it it might have been climbed but it would have been  dangerous and i had to make my way up the steep earth banks  where there is nowhere any footing for man only fallen  trees which made the rounds of my ladder  i was near the  top of this climb which was very hot and steep and the  pulses were buzzing all over my body when i made sure there  was one external sound in my ears and paused to listen  no  mistake a sound of a millwheel thundering i thought close  by yet below me a huge millwheel yet not going steadily  but with a schottische movement and at each fresh impetus  shaking the mountain  there where i was i just put down  the sound to the mystery of the bush where no sound now  surprises me  and any sound alarms i only thought it would  give jack a fine fright down where he stood tied to a tree  by himself and he was badly enough scared when i left him   the good folks at home identified it it was a sharp  earthquake  at the top of the climb i made my way again to the water course it is here running steady and pretty full strange  these intermittencies  and just a little below the main  stream is quite dry and all the original brook has gone down  some lava gallery of the mountain  and just a little further  below it begins picking up from the left hand in little  boggy tributaries and in the inside of a hundred yards has  grown a brook again  the general course of the brook was i  guess se the valley still very deep and whelmed in wood   it seemed a swindle to have made so sheer a climb and still  find yourself at the bottom of a well  but gradually the  thing seemed to shallow the trees to seem poorer and  smaller i could see more and more of the silver sprinkles of  sky among the foliage instead of the sombre piling up of  tree behind tree  and here i had two scares  first away up  on my right hand i heard a bull low i think it was a bull  from the quality of the low which was singularly songful and  beautiful the bulls belong to me but how did i know that  the bull was aware of that and my advance guard not being at  all properly armed we advanced with great precaution until i  was satisfied that i was passing eastward of the enemy  it  was during this period that a pool of the river suddenly  boiled up in my face in a little fountain  it was in a very  dreary marshy part among dilapidated trees that you see  through holes in the trunks of and if any kind of beast or  elf or devil had come out of that sudden silver ebullition i  declare i do not think i should have been surprised  it was  perhaps a thing as curious  a fish with which these head  waters of the stream are alive  they are some of them as  long as my finger should be easily caught in these shallows  and some day ill have a dish of them  very soon after i came to where the stream collects in  another banana swamp with the bananas bearing well  beyond  the course is again quite dry it mounts with a sharp turn a  very steep face of the mountain and then stops abruptly at  the lip of a plateau i suppose the top of vaea mountain  plainly no more springs here  there was no smallest furrow  of a watercourse beyond  and my task might be said to be  accomplished  but such is the animated spirit in the service  that the whole advance guard expressed a sentiment of  disappointment that an exploration so far successfully  conducted should come to a stop in the most promising view  of fresh successes  and though unprovided either with  compass or cutlass it was determined to push some way along  the plateau marking our direction by the laborious process  of bending down sitting upon and thus breaking the wild  cocoanut trees  this was the less regretted by all from a  delightful discovery made of a huge banyan growing here in  the bush with flyingbuttressed flying buttresses and huge  arcs of trunk hanging high overhead and trailing down new  complications of root  i climbed some way up what seemed the  original beginning it was easier to climb than a ships  rigging even rattled everywhere there was foothold and  handhold  it was judged wise to return and rally the main  body who had now been left alone for perhaps forty minutes  in the bush  the return was effected in good order but unhappily i only  arrived like so many other explorers to find my main body  or rearguard in a condition of mutiny the work it is to be  supposed of terror  it is right i should tell you the vaea  has a bad name an aitu fafine  female devil of the woods   succubus  haunting it and doubtless jack had heard of her  perhaps during my absence saw her lucky jack  anyway he  was neither to hold nor to bind and finally after nearly  smashing me by accident and from mere scare and  insubordination several times deliberately set in to kill  me but poor jack the tree he selected for that purpose was  a banana  i jumped off and gave him the heavy end of my whip  over the buttocks  then i took and talked in his ear in  various voices you should have heard my alto  it was a  dreadful devilish note  i knew jack knew it was an aitu   then i mounted him again and he carried me fairly steadily   hell learn yet  he has to learn to trust absolutely to his  rider till he does the risk is always great in thick bush  where a fellow must try different passages and put back and  forward and pick his way by hairsbreadths  the expedition returned to vailima in time to receive the  visit of the r c bishop  he is a superior man much above  the average of priests   thursday   yesterday the same expedition set forth to the southward by  what is known as carruthers road  at a fallen tree which  completely blocks the way the main body was as before left  behind and the advance guard of one now proceeded with the  exploration  at the great tree known as mepi tree after  maben the surveyor the expedition struck forty yards due  west till it struck the top of a steep bank which it  descended  the whole bottom of the ravine is filled with  sharp lava blocks quite unrolled and very difficult and  dangerous to walk among no water in the course scarce any  sign of water  and yet surely water must have made this bold  cutting in the plateau  and if so why is the lava sharp   my science gave out but i could not but think it ominous and  volcanic  the course of the stream was tortuous but with a  resultant direction a little by west of north the sides the  whole way exceeding steep the expedition buried under  fathoms of foliage  presently water appeared in the bottom  a good quantity perhaps thirty or forty cubic feet with  pools and waterfalls  a tree that stands all along the banks  here must be very fond of water its roots lie closepacked  down the stream like hanks of guts so as to make often a  corrugated walk each root ending in a blunt tuft of  filaments plainly to drink water  twice there came in small  tributaries from the left or western side  the whole plateau  having a smartish inclination to the east one of the  tributaries in a handsome little web of silver hanging in the  forest  twice i was startled by birds one that barked like  a dog another that whistled loud ploughmans signals so  that i vow i was thrilled and thought i had fallen among  runaway blacks and regretted my cutlass which i had lost and  left behind while taking bearings  a good many fishes in the  brook and many crayfish one of the last with a queer glow worm head  like all our brooks the water is pure as air  and runs over red stones like rubies  the foliage along both  banks very thick and high the place close the walking  exceedingly laborious  by the time the expedition reached  the fork it was felt exceedingly questionable whether the  moral of the force were sufficiently good to undertake more  extended operations  a halt was called the men refreshed  with water and a bath and it was decided at a drumhead  council of war to continue the descent of the embassy water  straight for vailima whither the expedition returned in  rather poor condition and wet to the waist about 4 pm  thus in two days the two main watercourses of this country  have been pretty thoroughly explored and i conceive my  instructions fully carried out  the main body of the second  expedition was brought back by another officer despatched for  that purpose from vailima  casualties one horse wounded  one man bruised no deaths  as yet but the bruised man  feels today as if his case was mighty serious   dec 25 91   your note with a very despicable bulletin of health arrived  only yesterday the mail being a day behind  it contained  also the excellent times article which was a sight for sore  eyes  i am still taboo the blessed germans will have none  of me and i only hope they may enjoy the times article   tis my revenge  i wish you had sent the letter too as i  have no copy and do not even know what i wrote the last day  with a bad headache and the mail going out  however it  must have been about right for the times article was in the  spirit i wished to arouse  i hope we can get rid of the man  before it is too late  he has set the natives to war but  the natives by gods blessing do not want to fight and i  think it will fizzle out  no thanks to the man who tried to  start it  but i did not mean to drift into these politics  rather to tell you what i have done since i last wrote  well i worked away at my history for a while and only got  one chapter done no doubt this spate of work is pretty low  now and will be soon dry but god bless you what a lot i  have accomplished wrecker done beach of falesa done half  the history cest etonnant  i hear from burlingame by the  way that he likes the end of the wrecker tis certainly a  violent dark yarn with interesting plain turns of human  nature then lloyd and i went down to live in haggards  rooms where fanny presently joined us  haggards rooms are  in a strange old building  old for samoa and has the effect  of the antique like some strange monastery i would tell you  more of it but i think im going to use it in a tale  the  annexe close by had its door sealed poor dowdney lost at sea  in a schooner  the place is haunted  the vast empty sheds  the empty store the airless hot long low rooms the claps  of wind that set everything flying  a strange uncanny house  to spend christmas in   jan 1st 92   for a day or two i have sat close and wrought hard at the  history and two more chapters are all but done  about  thirty pages should go by this mail which is not what should  be but all i could overtake  will any one ever read it  i  fancy not people dont read history for reading but for  education and display  and who desires education in the  history of samoa with no population no past no future or  the exploits of mataafa malietoa and consul knappe   colkitto and galasp are a trifle to it  well it cant be  helped and it must be done and better or worse its  capital fun  there are two to whom i have not been kind   german consul becker and english captain hand rn  on dec 30th i rode down with belle to go to if you please  the fancy ball  when i got to the beach i found the  barometer was below 29 degrees the wind still in the east  and steady but a huge offensive continent of clouds and  vapours forming to leeward  it might be a hurricane i dared  not risk getting caught away from my work and leaving  belle returned at once to vailima  next day  yesterday   it was a tearer we had storm shutters up i sat in my room  and wrote by lamplight  ten pages if you please seven of  them draft and some of these compiled from as many as seven  different and conflicting authorities so that was a brave  days work  about two a huge tree fell within sixty paces of  our house a little after a second went and we sent out  boys with axes and cut down a third which was too near the  house and buckling like a fishing rod  at dinner we had the  front door closed and shuttered the back door open the lamp  lit  the boys in the cookhouse were all out at the cook house door where we could see them looking in and smiling   lauilo and faauma waited on us with smiles  the excitement  was delightful  some very violent squalls came as we sat  there and every one rejoiced it was impossible to help it  a soul of putty had to sing  all night it blew the roof was  continually sounding under missiles in the morning the  verandahs were half full of branches torn from the forest   there was a last very wild squall about six the rain like a  thick white smoke flying past the house in volleys and as  swift it seemed as rifle balls all with a strange  strident hiss such as i have only heard before at sea and  indeed thought to be a marine phenomenon  since then the  wind has been falling with a few squalls mostly rain  but  our road is impassable for horses we hear a schooner has  been wrecked and some native houses blown down in apia where  belle is still and must remain a prisoner  lucky i returned  while i could  but the great good is this much breadfruit  and bananas have been destroyed if this be general through  the islands famine will be imminent and whoever blows the  coals there can be no war  do i then prefer a famine to a  war you ask  not always but just now  i am sure the  natives do not want a war i am sure a war would benefit no  one but the white officials and i believe we can easily meet  the famine  or at least that it can be met  that would give  our officials a legitimate opportunity to cover their past  errors   jan 2nd   i woke this morning to find the blow quite ended  the heaven  was all a mottled gray even the east quite colourless the  downward slope of the island veiled in wafts of vapour blue  like smoke not a leaf stirred on the tallest tree only  three miles away below me on the barrier reef i could see  the individual breakers curl and fall and hear their  conjunct roaring rise as it still rises at 1 pm like the  roar of a thoroughfare close by  i did a good mornings  work correcting and clarifying my draft and have now  finished for press eight chapters ninetyone pages of this  piece of journalism  four more chapters say fifty pages  remain to be done i should gain my wager and finish this  volume in three months that is to say the end should leave  me per february mail i cannot receive it back till the mail  of april  yes it can be out in time pray god that it be in  time to help  how do journalists fetch up their drivel  i aim only at  clearness and the most obvious finish positively at no  higher degree of merit not even at brevity  i am sure it  could have been all done with double the time in twothirds  of the space  and yet it has taken me two months to write  45500 words and be damned to my wicked prowess i am proud  of the exploit  the real journalist must be a man not of  brass only but bronze  chapter ix gapes for me but i  shrink on the margin and go on chattering to you  this last  part will be much less offensive strange to say to the  germans  it is becker they will never forgive me for knappe  i pity and do not dislike becker i scorn and abominate   here is the tableau  i elements of discord native  ii  elements of discord foreign   iii the sorrows of laupepa   iv brandeis  v the battle of matautu  vi last exploits  of becker  vii the samoan camps  viii affairs of lautii  and fangalii  ix furor consularis  x the hurricane   xi stuebel recluse  xii the present government  i  estimate the whole roughly at 70000 words  should anybody  ever dream of reading it it would be found amusing  70000300233 printed pages a respectable little fivebob  volume to bloom unread in shop windows  after that ill  have a spank at fiction  and rest  i shall rest in the  grave or when i come to italy  if only the public will  continue to support me  i lost my chance not dying there  seems blooming little fear of it now  i worked close on five  hours this morning the day before close on nine and unless  i finish myself off with this letter ill have another hour  and a half or aiblins twa before dinner  poor man how you  must envy me as you hear of these orgies of work and you  scarce able for a letter  but lord colvin how lucky the  situations are not reversed for i have no situation nor am  fit for any  life is a steigh brae  here have at knappe  and no more clavers   3rd   there was never any man had so many irons in the fire except  jim pinkerton  i forgot to mention i have the most gallant  suggestion from lang with an offer of ms authorities which  turns my brain  its all about the throne of poland and  buried treasure in the mackay country and alan breck can  figure there in glory  yesterday j and i set off to blacklocks american consul  who lives not far from that little village i have so often  mentioned as lying between us and apia  i had some questions  to ask him for my history thence we must proceed to vailele  where i had also to crossexamine the plantation manager  about the battle there  we went by a track i had never  before followed down the hill to vaisigano which flows here  in a deep valley and was unusually full so that the horses  trembled in the ford  the whole bottom of the valley is full  of various streams posting between strips of forest with a  brave sound of waters  in one place we had a glimpse of a  fall some way higher up and then sparkling in sunlight in  the midst of the green valley  then up by a winding path  scarce accessible to a horse for steepness to the other  side and the open cocoanut glades of the plantation  here  we rode fast did a mighty satisfactory afternoons work at  the plantation house and still faster back  on the return  jack fell with me but got up again when i felt him  recovering i gave him his head and he shoved his foot  through the rein i got him by the bit however and all was  well he had mud over all his face but his knees were not  broken  we were scarce home when the rain began again that  was luck  it is pouring now in torrents we are in the  height of the bad season  lloyd leaves along with this  letter on a change to san francisco he had much need of it  but i think this will brace him up  i am as you see a  tower of strength  i can remember riding not so far and not  near so fast when i first came to samoa and being shattered  next day with fatigue now i could not tell i have done  anything have rehandled my battle of fangalii according to  yesterdays information  four pages rewritten and written  already some halfdozen pages of letters  i observe with disgust that while of yore when i own i was  guilty you never spared me abuse but now when i am so  virtuous where is the praise  do admit that i have become  an excellent letterwriter  at least to you and that your  ingratitude is imbecile  yours ever  r l s    chapter xv    jan 31st 92   my dear colvin  no letter at all from you and this scratch  from me  here is a year that opens ill  lloyd is off to  the coast sick  the coast means california over most of  the pacific  i have been down all month with influenza and  am just recovering  i am overlaid with proofs which i am  just about half fit to attend to  one of my horses died this  morning and another is now dying on the front lawn  lloyds  horse and fannys  such is my quarrel with destiny  but i  am mending famously come and go on the balcony have  perfectly good nights and though i still cough have no  oppression and no hemorrhage and no fever  so if i can find  time and courage to add no more you will know my news is not  altogether of the worst a year or two ago and what a state  i should have been in now  your silence i own rather  alarms me  but i tell myself you have just miscarried had  you been too ill to write some one would have written me   understand i send this brief scratch not because i am unfit  to write more but because i have 58 galleys of the wrecker  and 102 of the beach of falesa to get overhauled somehow or  other in time for the mail and for three weeks i have not  touched a pen with my finger   feb 1st   the second horse is still alive but i still think dying   the first was buried this morning  my proofs are done it  was a rough two days of it but done  consummatum est na  uma  i believe the wrecker ends well if i know what a good  yarn is the last four chapters make a good yarn  but pretty  horrible  the beach of falesa i still think well of but it  seems its immoral and theres a todo and financially it  may prove a heavy disappointment  the plaintive request sent  to me to make the young folks married properly before that  night i refused you will see what would be left of the  yarn had i consented  this is a poison bad world for the  romancer this anglosaxon world i usually get out of it by  not having any women in it at all but when i remember i had  the treasure of franchard refused as unfit for a family  magazine i feel despair weigh upon my wrists  as i know you are always interested in novels i must tell  you that a new one is now entirely planned  it is to be  called sophia scarlet and is in two parts  part i the  vanilla planter  part ii the overseers  no chapters i  think just two dense blocks of narrative the first of which  is purely sentimental but the second has some rows and  quarrels and winds up with an explosion if you please  i  am just burning to get at sophia but i must do this samoan  journalism  thats a cursed duty  the first part of sophia  bar the first twenty or thirty pages writes itself the  second is more difficult involving a good many characters   about ten i think  who have to be kept all moving and give  the effect of a society  i have three women to handle out  and wellaway but only sophia is in full tone  sophia and  two men windermere the vanilla planter who dies at the end  of part i and rainsforth who only appears in the beginning  of part ii  the fact is i blush to own it but sophia is a  regular novel heroine and hero and false accusation and  love and marriage and all the rest of it  all planted in a  big south sea plantation run by exenglish officers  a la  stewarts plantation in tahiti  there is a strong  undercurrent of labour trade which gives it a kind of uncle  tom flavour absit omen  the first start is hard it is hard  to avoid a little tedium here but i think by beginning with  the arrival of the three miss scarlets hot from school and  society in england i may manage to slide in the information   the problem is exactly a balzac one and i wish i had his  fist  for i have already a better method  the kinetic  whereas he continually allowed himself to be led into the  static  but then he had the fist and the most i can hope is  to get out of it with a modicum of grace and energy but for  sure without the strong impression the full dark brush   three people have had it the real creators brush scott  see much of the antiquary and the heart of midlothian  especially all round the trial before during and after   balzac  and thackeray in vanity fair  everybody else either  paints thin or has to stop to paint or paints excitedly so  that you see the author skipping before his canvas  here is  a long way from poor sophia scarlet  this day is published sophia scarlet by robert louis stevenson    chapter xvi    feb 1892   my dear colvin  this has been a busyish month for a sick  man  first faauma  the bronze candlestick whom otherwise  i called my butler  bolted from the bed and bosom of  lafaele the archangel hercules prefect of the cattle   there was the deuce to pay and hercules was inconsolable  and immediately started out after a new wife and has had one  up on a visit but says she has no conversation and i  think he will take back the erring and possibly repentant  candlestick whom we all devoutly prefer as she is not only  highly decorative but goodnatured and if she does little  work makes no rows  i tell this lightly but it really was a  heavy business many were accused of complicity and rafael  was really very sorry  i had to hold beds of justice   literally  seated in my bed and surrounded by lying samoans  seated on the floor and there were many picturesque and  still inexplicable passages  it is hard to reach the truth  in these islands  the next incident overlapped with this  s and fanny found  three strange horses in the paddock for long now the boys  have been forbidden to leave their horses here one hour  because our grass is overgrazed  s came up with the news  and i saw i must now strike a blow  to the pound with the  lot said i  he proposed taking the three himself but i  thought that too dangerous an experiment said i should go  too and hurried into my boots so as to show decision taken  in the necessary interviews  they came of course  the  interviews  and i explained what i was going to do at huge  length and stuck to my guns  i am glad to say the natives  with their usual purely speculative sense of justice highly  approved the step after reflection  meanwhile off went s  and i with the three corpora delicti and a good job i went   once when our circus began to kick we thought all was up  but we got them down all sound in wind and limb  i judged i  was much fallen off from my elliott forefathers who managed  this class of business with neatness and despatch  halfway  down it came on to rain tropic style and i came back from my  outing drenched liked a drowned man  i was literally blinded  as i came back among these sheets of water and the  consequence was i was laid down with diarrhoea and  threatenings of samoa colic for the inside of another week  i have a confession to make  when i was sick i tried to get  to work to finish that samoa thing wouldnt go and at last  in the colic time i slid off into david balfour some 50  pages of which are drafted and like me well  really i think  it is spirited and theres a heroine that up to now seems  to have attractions absit omen  david on the whole seems  excellent  alan does not come in till the tenth chapter and  i am only at the eighth so i dont know if i can find him  again but david is on his feet and doing well and very  much in love and mixed up with the lord advocate and the  untitled lord lovat and all manner of great folk  and the  tale interferes with my eating and sleeping  the join is  bad i have not thought to strain too much for continuity so  this part be alive i shall be content  but theres no doubt  david seems to have changed his style deil hae him  and  much i care if the tale travel   friday feb  19th   two incidents today which i must narrate  after lunch it  was raining pitilessly we were sitting in my mothers  bedroom and i was reading aloud kinglakes charge of the  light brigade and we had just been all seized by the horses  aligning with lord george paget when a figure appeared on  the verandah a little slim small figure of a lad with  blond ie limed hair a propitiatory smile and a nose  that alone of all his features grew pale with anxiety  i  come here stop was about the outside of his english and i  began at once to guess that he was a runaway labourer and  that the bushknife in his hand was stolen  it proved he had  a mate who had lacked his courage and was hidden down the  road they had both made up their minds to run away and had  come here stop  i could not turn out the poor rogues one  of whom showed me marks on his back into the drenching  forest i could not reason with them for they had not enough  english and not one of our boys spoke their tongue so i  bade them feed and sleep here tonight and tomorrow i must  do what the lord shall bid me  near dinner time i was told that a friend of lafaeles had  found human remains in my bush  after dinner a figure was  seen skulking across towards the waterfall which produced  from the verandah a shout in my most stentorian tones o ai  le ingoa literally who the name which serves here for  whats your business as well  it proved to be lafaeles  friend i bade a kitchen boy lauilo go with him to see the  spot for though it had ceased raining the whole island ran  and dripped  lauilo was willing enough but the friend of  the archangel demurred he had too much business he had no  time  all right i said you too much frightened i go  along which of course produced the usual shout of delight  from all those who did not require to go  i got into my  saranac snow boots  lauilo got a cutlass mary carter our  sydney maid joined the party for a lark and off we set  i  tell you our guide kept us moving for the dusk fell swift   our woods have an infamous reputation at the best and our  errand to say the least of it was grisly  at last they  found the remains they were old which was all i cared to be  sure of it seemed a strangely small picklebanes to stand  for a big flourishing buckislander and their situation in  the darkening and dripping bush was melancholy  all at once  i found there was a second skull with a bullethole i could  have stuck my two thumbs in  say anybody elses one thumb   my samoans said it could not be there were not enough bones  i put the two pieces of skull together and at last convinced  them  whereupon in a flash they found the not unromantic  explanation  this poor brave had succeeded in the height of  a samoan warriors ambition he had taken a head which he was  never destined to show to his applauding camp  wounded  himself he had crept here into the bush to die with his  useless trophy by his side  his date would be about fifteen  years ago in the great battle between laupepa and talavou  which took place on my land sir  tomorrow we shall bury  the bones and fire a salute in honour of unfortunate courage  do you think i have an empty life or that a man jogging to  his club has so much to interest and amuse him  touch and  try him too but that goes along with the others no pain no  pleasure is the iron law  so here i stop again and leave  as i left yesterday my political business untouched  and  lo here comes my pupil i believe so i stop in time   march 2nd   since i last wrote fifteen chapters of david balfour have  been drafted and five tires au clair  i think it pretty  good theres a blooming maiden that costs anxiety  she is  as virginal as billy but david seems there and alive and  the lord advocate is good and so i think is an episodic  appearance of the master of lovat  in chapter xvii i shall  get david abroad  alan went already in chapter xii  the  book should be about the length of kidnapped this early part  of it about ds evidence in the appin case is more of a  story than anything in kidnapped but there is no doubt there  comes a break in the middle and the tale is practically in  two divisions  in the first james more and the mgregors  and catriona only show in the second the appin case being  disposed of and james stewart hung they rule the roast and  usurp the interest  should there be any left  why did i  take up david balfour  i dont know  a sudden passion  monday i went down in the rain with a colic to take the  chair at a public meeting dined with haggard sailed off to  my meeting and fought with wild beasts for three anxious  hours  all was lost that any sensible man cared for but the  meeting did not break up  thanks a good deal to r l s   and the man who opposed my election and with whom i was all  the time wrangling proposed the vote of thanks to me with a  certain handsomeness i assure you i had earned it      haggard and the great abdul his highcaste indian servant  imported by my wife were sitting up for me with supper and  i suppose it was twelve before i got to bed  tuesday  raining my mother rode down and we went to the consulate to  sign a factory and commission  thence i to the lawyers to  the printing office and to the mission  it was dinner time  when i returned home  this morning our cookboy having suddenly left  injured  feelings  the archangel was to cook breakfast  i found him  lighting the fire before dawn his eyes blazed he had no  word of any language left to use and i saw in him to my  wonder the strongest workings of gratified ambition   napoleon was no more pleased to sign his first treaty with  austria than was lafaele to cook that breakfast  all  morning when i had hoped to be at this letter i slept like  one drugged and you must take this which is all i can give  you for what it is worth    db  memoirs of his adventures at home and abroad  the second  part wherein are set forth the misfortunes in which he was  involved upon the appin murder his troubles with lord  advocate prestongrange captivity on the bass rock journey  into france and holland and singular relations with james  more drummond or macgregor a son of the notorious rob roy    chapters  i a beggar on horseback  ii the highland  writer  iii i go to pilrig  iv lord advocate  prestongrange  v butter and thunder  vi i make a fault in  honour  vii the bravo  viii the heather on fire  ix i  begin to be haunted with a redheaded man  x the wood by  silvermills  xi on the march again with alan  xii gillane  sands  xiii the bass rock  xiv black andies tale of tod  lapraik  xv i go to inveraray  that is it as far as drafted  chapters iv v vii ix and  xiv i am specially pleased with the last being an  episodical bogie story about the bass rock told there by the  keeper    chapter xvii    march 9th   my dear s c  take it not amiss if this is a wretched  letter  i am eaten up with business  every day this week i  have had some business impediment  i am even now waiting a  deputation of chiefs about the road  and my precious morning  was shattered by a polite old scourge of a faipule   parliament man  come begging  all the time david balfour is  skelping along  i began it the 13th of last month i have  now 12 chapters 79 pages ready for press or within an ace  and by the time the month is out onehalf should be  completed and ill be back at drafting the second half   what makes me sick is to think of scott turning out guy  mannering in three weeks  what a pull of work heavens what  thews and sinews  and here am i my head spinning from  having only rewritten seven not very difficult pages  and  not very good when done  weakling generation  it makes me  sick of myself to make such a fash and bobbery over a rotten  end of an old nursery yarn not worth spitting on when done   still there is no doubt i turn out my work more easily than  of yore and i suppose i should be singly glad of that  and  if i got my book done in six weeks seeing it will be about  half as long as a scott and i have to write everything  twice it would be about the same rate of industry  it is my  fair intention to be done with it in three months which  would make me about onehalf the man sir walter was for  application and driving the dull pen  of the merit we shall  not talk but i dont think davie is without merit   march 12th   and i have this day triumphantly finished 15 chapters 100  pages  being exactly onehalf as near as anybody can guess  of david balfour the book to be about a fifth as long again  altogether as treasure island could i but do the second  half in another month  but i cant i fear i shall have  some belated material arriving by next mail and must go  again at the history  is it not characteristic of my broken  tenacity of mind that i should have left davie balfour some  five years in the british linen companys office and then  follow him at last with such vivacity  but i leave you  again the last 15th chapter ought to be rewrote or part  of it and i want the half completed in the month and the  month is out by midnight though to be sure last month was  february and i might take grace  these notes are only to  show i hold you in mind though i know they can have no  interest for man or god or animal  i should have told you about the club  we have been asked to  try and start a sort of weekly ball for the halfcastes and  natives ourselves to be the only whites and we consented  from a very heavy sense of duty and with not much hope  two  nights ago we had twenty people up received them in the  front verandah entertained them on cake and lemonade and i  made a speech  embodying our proposals or conditions if  you like  for i suppose thirty minutes  no joke to speak to  such an audience but it is believed i was thoroughly  intelligible  i took the plan of saying everything at least  twice in a different form of words so that if the one  escaped my hearers the other might be seized  one white man  came with his wife and was kept rigorously on the front  verandah below  you see what a sea of troubles this is like  to prove but it is the only chance  and when it blows up  it must blow up  i have no more hope in anything than a dead  frog i go into everything with a composed despair and dont  mind  just as i always go to sea with the conviction i am to  be drowned and like it before all other pleasures  but you  should have seen the return voyage when nineteen horses had  to be found in the dark and nineteen bridles all in a  drench of rain and the club just constituted as such  sailed away in the wet under a cloudy moon like a bad  shilling and to descend a road through the forest that was  at that moment the image of a respectable mountain brook  my  wife who is president with power to expel had to begin her  functions      25th march   heaven knows what day it is but i am ashamed all the more  as your letter from bournemouth of all places  poor old  bournemouth  is to hand and contains a statement of  pleasure in my letters which i wish i could have rewarded  with a long one  what has gone on  a vast of affairs of a  mingled strenuous inconclusive desultory character much  waste of time much riding to and fro and little transacted  or at least peracted  let me give you a review of the present state of our live  stock  six boys in the bush six souls about the house   talolo the cook returns again today after an absence  which has cost me about twelve hours of riding and i suppose  eight hours solemn sitting in council  i am sorry indeed  for the chief justice of samoa i said it is more than i  am fit for to be chief justice of vailima  lauilo is  steward  both these are excellent servants we gave a  luncheon party when we buried the samoan bones and i assure  you all was in good style yet we never interfered  the food  was good the wine and dishes went round as by mechanism   stewards assistant and washman arrick a new hebridee black  boy hired from the german firm not so ugly as most but not  pretty neither not so dull as his sort are but not quite a  crichton  when he came first he ate so much of our good  food that he got a prominent belly  kitchen assistant tomas  thomas in english a fiji man very tall and handsome  moving like a marionette with sudden bounds and rolling his  eyes with sudden effort  washerwoman and precentor helen  tomass wife  this is our weak point we are ashamed of  helen the cookhouse blushes for her they murmur there at  her presence  she seems all right she is not a badlooking  strapping wench seems chaste is industrious has an  excellent taste in hymns  you should have heard her read one  aloud the other day she marked the rhythm with so much  gloating dissenter sentiment  what is wrong then says  you  low in your ear  and dont let the papers get hold of  it  she is of no family  none they say literally a common  woman  of course we have outislanders who may be  villeins but we give them the benefit of the doubt which is  impossible with helen of vailima our blot our pitted speck   the pitted speck i have said is our precentor  it is always  a woman who starts samoan song the men who sing second do  not enter for a bar or two  poor dear faauma the unchaste  the extruded eve of our paradise knew only two hymns but  helen seems to know the whole repertory and the morning  prayers go far more lively in consequence  lafaele provost  of the cattle  the cattle are jack my horse quite  converted my wife rides him now and he is as steady as a  doctors cob tifaga jack a circus horse my mothers  piebald bought from a passing circus belles mare now in  childbed or next door confound the slut  musu  amusingly  translated the other day dont want to literally cross  but always in the sense of stubbornness and resistance  my  wifes little darkbrown mare with a white star on her  forehead whom i have been riding of late to steady her  she  has no vices but is unused skittish and uneasy and wants a  lot of attention and humouring lastly of saddle horses  luna  not the latin moon the hawaiian overseer but its  pronounced the same  a pretty little mare too but scarce at  all broken a bad bucker and has to be ridden with a stock whip and be brought back with her rump crisscrossed like a  clan tartan the two cart horses now only used with pack saddles two cows one in the straw i trust tomorrow a  third cow the jersey  whose milk and temper are alike  subjects of admiration  she gives good exercise to the  farming saunterer and refreshes him on his return with  cream two calves a bull and a cow god knows how many  ducks and chickens and for a wager not even god knows how  many cats twelve horses seven horses five kine is not  this babylon the great which i have builded  call it  subpriorsford  two nights ago the club had its first meeting only twelve  were present but it went very well  i was not there i had  ridden down the night before after dinner on my endless  business took a cup of tea in the mission like an ass then  took a cup of coffee like a fool at haggards then fell into  a discussion with the american consul    i went to bed at  haggards came suddenly broad awake and lay sleepless the  live night  it fell chill i had only a sheet and had to  make a light and range the house for a cover  i found one in  the hall a macintosh  so back to my sleepless bed and to  lie there till dawn  in the morning i had a longish ride to  take in a day of a blinding staggering sun and got home by  eleven our luncheon hour with my head rather swimmy the  only time i have feared the sun since i was in samoa   however i got no harm but did not go to the club lay off  lazied played the pipe and read  a novel by james payn   sometimes quite interesting and in one place really very  funny with the quaint humour of the man  much interested the  other day  as i rode past a house i saw where a samoan had  written a word on a board and there was an a perfectly  formed but upside down  you never saw such a thing in  europe but it is as common as dirt in polynesia  mens  names are tattooed on the forearm it is common to find a  subverted letter tattooed there  here is a tempting problem  for psychologists  i am now on terms again with the german consulate i know not  for how long not of course with the president which i  find a relief still with the chief justice and the english  consul  for haggard i have a genuine affection he is a  loveable man  wearyful man  here is the yarn of loudon dodd not as he  told it but as it was afterwards written  these words were  left out by some carelessness and i think i have been thrice  tackled about them  grave them in your mind and wear them on  your forehead  the lang story will have very little about the treasure the  master will appear and it is to a great extent a tale of  prince charlie after the 45 and a love story forbye the  hero is a melancholy exile and marries a young woman who  interests the prince and there is the devil to pay  i think  the master kills him in a duel but dont know yet not  having yet seen my second heroine  no  the master doesnt  kill him they fight he is wounded and the master plays  deus ex machina  i think just now of calling it the tail of  the race no  heavens  i never saw till this moment  but  of course nobody but myself would ever understand millrace  they would think of a quartermile  so  i am nameless  again  my melancholy young man is to be quite a romeo  yes  ill name the book from him dyce of ythan  pronounce  eethan   dyce of ythan by r l s   o shovel  shovel waits his turn he and his ancestors  i  would have tackled him before but my state trials have never  come  so that i have now quite planned   dyce of ythan historical 1750 sophia scarlet today the shovels of newton french historical 1650 to 1830  and quite planned and part written  the pearl fisher today with lloyd a machine david balfour historical 1751  and by a strange exception for r l s all in the third  person except d b  i dont know what day this is now the 29th but i have  finished my two chapters ninth and tenth of samoa in time  for the mail and feel almost at peace  the tenth was the  hurricane a difficult problem it so tempted one to be  literary and i feel sure the less of that there is in my  little handbook the more chance it has of some utility   then the events are complicated seven ships to tell of and  sometimes three of them together o it was quite a job  but  i think i have my facts pretty correct and for once in my  sickening yarn they are handsome facts creditable to all  concerned not to be written of  and i should think scarce  to be read  without a thrill  i doubt i have got no  hurricane into it the intricacies of the yarn absorbing me  too much  but there  its done somehow and time presses  hard on my heels  the book with my best expedition may  come just too late to be of use  in which case i shall have  made a handsome present of some months of my life for nothing  and to nobody  well through her the most ancient heavens  are fresh and strong   30th   after i had written you i reread my hurricane which is  very poor the life of the journalist is hard another couple  of writings and i could make a good thing i believe and it  must go as it is  but of course this book is not written  for honour and glory and the few who will read it may not  know the difference  very little time  i go down with the  mail shortly dine at the chinese restaurant and go to the  club to dance with islandresses  think of my going out once  a week to dance  politics are on the full job again and we dont know what is  to come next  i think the whole treaty raj seems quite  played out  they have taken to bribing the faipule men  parliament men to stay in mulinuu we hear but i have not  yet sifted the rumour  i must say i shall be scarce  surprised if it prove true these rumours have the knack of  being right  our weather this last month has been  tremendously hot not by the thermometer which sticks at 86  degrees but to the sensation no rain no wind and this the  storm month  it looks ominous and is certainly  disagreeable  no time to finish yours ever r l s    chapter xviii    may 1st 1892   my dear colvin  as i rode down last night about six i saw  a sight i must try to tell you of  in front of me right  over the top of the forest into which i was descending was a  vast cloud  the front of it accurately represented the  somewhat rugged longnosed and beetlebrowed profile of a  man crowned by a huge kalmuck cap the flesh part was of a  heavenly pink the cap the moustache the eyebrows were of a  bluish gray to see this with its childish exactitude of  design and colour and hugeness of scale  it covered at  least 25 degrees  held me spellbound  as i continued to  gaze the expression began to change he had the exact air of  closing one eye dropping his jaw and drawing down his nose  had the thing not been so imposing i could have smiled and  then almost in a moment a shoulder of leadencoloured bank  drove in front and blotted it  my attention spread to the  rest of the cloud and it was a thing to worship  it rose  from the horizon and its top was within thirty degrees of  the zenith the lower parts were like a glacier in shadow  varying from dark indigo to a clouded white in exquisite  gradations  the sky behind so far as i could see was all  of a blue already enriched and darkened by the night for the  hill had what lingered of the sunset  but the top of my  titanic cloud flamed in broad sunlight with the most  excellent softness and brightness of fire and jewels  enlightening all the world  it must have been far higher  than mount everest and its glory as i gazed up at it out of  the night was beyond wonder  close by rode the little  crescent moon and right over its western horn a great  planet of about equal lustre with itself  the dark woods  below were shrill with that noisy business of the birds  evening worship  when i returned after eight the moon was  near down she seemed little brighter than before but now  that the cloud no longer played its part of a nocturnal sun  we could see that sight so rare with us at home that it was  counted a portent so customary in the tropics of the dark  sphere with its little gilt band upon the belly  the planet  had been setting faster and was now below the crescent   they were still of an equal brightness  i could not resist trying to reproduce this in words as a  specimen of these incredibly beautiful and imposing meteors  of the tropic sky that make so much of my pleasure here  though a ships deck is the place to enjoy them  o what  awful scenery from a ships deck in the tropics  people  talk about the alps but the clouds of the trade wind are  alone for sublimity  now to try and tell you what has been happening  the state  of these islands and of mataafa and laupepa malietoas  ambo had been much on my mind  i went to the priests and  sent a message to mataafa at a time when it was supposed he  was about to act  he did not act delaying in true native  style and i determined i should go to visit him  i have  been very good not to go sooner to live within a few miles  of a rebel camp to be a novelist to have all my family  forcing me to go and to refrain all these months counts for  virtue  but hearing that several people had gone and the  government done nothing to punish them and having an errand  there which was enough to justify myself in my own eyes i  half determined to go and spoke of it with the halfcaste  priest  and here confound it up came laupepa and his  guards to call on me we kept him to lunch and the old  gentleman was very good and amiable  he asked me why i had  not been to see him  i reminded him a law had been made and  told him i was not a small boy to go and ask leave of the  consuls and perhaps be refused  he told me to pay no  attention to the law but come when i would and begged me to  name a day to lunch  the next day i think it was early in  the morning a man appeared he had metal buttons like a  policeman  but he was none of our apia force he was a rebel  policeman and had been all night coming round inland through  the forest from malie  he brought a letter addressed  i laua susuga         to his excellency misi mea             mr thingumbob  so as not to compromise me  i can read samoan now though  not speak it  it was to ask me for last wednesday  my  difficulty was great i had no man here who was fit or who  would have cared to write for me and i had to postpone the  visit  so i gave up halfaday with a groan went down to  the priests arranged for monday week to go to malie and  named thursday as my day to lunch with laupepa  i was  sharply ill on wednesday mail day  but on thursday i had to  trail down and go through the dreary business of a feast in  the kings wretched shanty full in view of the presidents  fine new house it made my heart burn  this gave me my chance to arrange a private interview with  the king and i decided to ask mr whitmee one of our  missionaries to be my interpreter  on friday being too  much exhausted to go down i begged him to come up  he did  i told him the heads of what i meant to say and he not only  consented but said if we got on well with the king he  would even proceed with me to malie  yesterday in  consequence i rode down to ws house by eight in the  morning waited till ten received a message that the king  was stopped by a meeting with the president and faipule made  another engagement for seven at night came up went down  waited till eight and came away again bredouille and a  dead body  the poor weak enslaved king had not dared to  come to me even in secret  now i have today for a rest and  tomorrow to malie  shall i be suffered to embark  it is  very doubtful they are on the trail  on thursday a  policeman came up to me and began that a boy had been to see  him and said i was going to see mataafa   and what did  you say said i  i told him i did not know about where  you were going said he  a very good answer said i and  turned away  it is lashing rain today but tomorrow rain  or shine i must at least make the attempt and i am so  weary and the weather looks so bad  i could half wish they  would arrest me on the beach  all this bother and pother to  try and bring a little chance of peace all this opposition  and obstinacy in people who remain here by the mere  forbearance of mataafa who has a great force within six  miles of their government buildings which are indeed only  the residences of white officials  to understand how i have  been occupied you must know that misi mea has had another  letter and this time had to answer himself think of doing  so in a language so obscure to me with the aid of a bible  concordance and dictionary  what a wonderful baboo  compilation it must have been  i positively expected to hear  news of its arrival in malie by the sound of laughter  i  doubt if you will be able to read this scrawl but i have  managed to scramble somehow up to date and tomorrow one  way or another should be interesting  but as for me i am a  wreck as i have no doubt style and handwriting both testify   8 pm   wonderfully rested feel almost fit for tomorrows dreary  excursion  not that it will be dreary if the weather favour  but otherwise it will be death and a native feast and i  fear i am in for a big one is a thing i loathe  i wonder if  you can really conceive me as a politician in this extra mundane sphere  presiding at public meetings drafting  proclamations receiving misaddressed letters that have been  carried all night through tropical forests  it seems strange  indeed and to you who know me really must seem stranger   i do not say i am free from the itch of meddling but god  knows this is no tempting job to meddle in i smile at  picturesque circumstances like the misi mea monsieur chose  is the exact equivalent correspondence but the business as  a whole bores and revolts me  i do nothing and say nothing  and then a day comes and i say this can go on no longer   930 p m   the wretched native dilatoriness finds me out  news has just  come that we must embark at six tomorrow i have divided the  night in watches and hope to be called tomorrow at four and  get under way by five  it is a great chance if it be  managed but i have given directions and lent my own clock to  the boys and hope the best  if i get called at four we  shall do it nicely  goodnight i must turn in   may 3rd   well we did get off by about 530 or byr lady quarter of  six myself on donald the huge grey carthorse with a ship bag across my saddle bow fanny on musu and belle on jack   we were all feeling pretty tired and sick and i looked like  heaven knows what on the cart horse death on the pale  horse i suggested  and young hunt the missionary who met  me today on the same charger squinted up at my perch and  remarked theres a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft   the boat was ready and we set off down the lagoon about  seven four oars and talolo my cook steering   may 9th monday anyway   and see what good resolutions came to  here is all this time  past and no speed made  well we got to malie and were  received with the most friendly consideration by the rebel  chief  belle and fanny were obviously thought to be my two  wives they were served their kava together as were mataafa  and myself  talolo utterly broke down as interpreter long  speeches were made to me by mataafa and his orators of which  he could make nothing but they were very much surprised   his way of pronouncing obliged  and as he could understand  nothing that fell from me except the same form of words the  dialogue languished and all business had to be laid aside   we had kava and then a dish of arrowroot one end of the  house was screened off for us with a fine tapa and we lay  and slept the three of us heads and tails upon the mats  till dinner  after dinner his illegitimate majesty and  myself had a walk and talked as well as my twopenny samoan  would admit  then there was a dance to amuse the ladies  before the house and we came back by moonlight the sky  piled full of high faint clouds that long preserved some of  the radiance of the sunset  the lagoon was very shallow we  continually struck for the moon was young and the light  baffling and for a long time we were accompanied by and  passed and repassed a huge whaleboat from savaii pulling  perhaps twelve oars and containing perhaps forty people who  sang in time as they went so to the hotel where we slept  and returned the next tuesday morning on the three same  steeds  meanwhile my business was still untransacted  and on  saturday morning i sent down and arranged with charlie  taylor to go down that afternoon  i had scarce got the  saddle bags fixed and had not yet mounted when the rain  began  but it was no use delaying now off i went in a wild  waterspout to apia found charlie sale taylor  a  sesquipedalian young halfcaste  not yet ready had a snack  of bread and cheese at the hotel while waiting him and then  off to malie  it rained all the way seven miles the road  which begins in triumph dwindles down to a nasty boggy  rocky footpath with weeds up to a horsemans knees and there  are eight pig fences to jump nasty beastly jumps  the next  morning we found one all messed with blood where a horse had  come to grief  but my jack is a clever fencer and  altogether we made good time and got to malie about dark   it is a village of very fine native houses high domed oval  buildings open at the sides or only closed with slatted  venetians  to be sure mataafas is not the worst  it was  already quite dark within only a little fire of cocoashell  blazed in the midst and showed us four servants the chief  was in his chapel whence we heard the sound of chaunting   presently he returned taylor and i had our soaking clothes  changed family worship was held kava brewed i was  exhibited to the chiefs as a man who had ridden through all  that rain and risked deportation to serve their master they  were bidden learn my face and remember upon all occasions to  help and serve me  then dinner and politics and fine  speeches until twelve at night  o and some more kava  when  i could sit up no longer my usual bedtime is eight you  must remember  then one end of the house was screened off  for me alone and a bed made  you never saw such a couch  i  believe of nearly fifty half at least fine mats by  mataafas daughter kalala  here i reposed alone and on the  other side of the tafa majesty and his household  armed  guards and a drummer patrolled about the house all night  they had no shift poor devils but stood to arms from sun down to sunup  about four in the morning i was awakened by the sound of a  whistle pipe blown outside on the dark very softly and to a  pleasing simple air i really think i have hit the first  phrase  fragment of music score which cannot be reproduced  it sounded very peaceful sweet and strange in the dark and  i found this was a part of the routine of my rebels night  and it was done he said to give good dreams  by a little  before six taylor and i were in the saddle again fasting   my riding boots were so wet i could not get them on so i  must ride barefoot  the morning was fair but the roads very  muddy the weeds soaked us nearly to the waist sale was  twice spilt at the fences and we got to apia a bedraggled  enough pair  all the way along the coast the pate small  wooden drum was beating in the villages and the people  crowding to the churches in their fine clothes  thence  through the mangrove swamp among the black mud and the green  mangroves and the black and scarlet crabs to mulinuu to  the doctors where i had an errand and so to the inn to  breakfast about nine  after breakfast i rode home  conceive  such an outing remember the pallid brute that lived in  skerryvore like a weevil in a biscuit and receive the  intelligence that i was rather the better for my journey   twenty miles ride sixteen fences taken ten of the miles in  a drenching rain seven of them fasting and in the morning  chill and six stricken hours political discussions by an  interpreter to say nothing of sleeping in a native house at  which many of our excellent literati would look askance of  itself  you are to understand if i take all this bother it is not  only from a sense of duty or a love of meddling  damn the  phrase take your choice  but from a great affection for  mataafa  he is a beautiful sweet old fellow and he and i  grew quite fulsome on saturday night about our sentiments  i  had a messenger from him today with a flannel undershirt  which i had left behind like a gibbering idiot and  perpetrated in reply another baboo letter  it rains again  today without mercy blessed welcome rains making up for  the paucity of the late wet season and when the showers  slacken i can hear my stream roaring in the hollow and tell  myself that the cacaos are drinking deep  i am desperately  hunted to finish my samoa book before the mail goes this  last chapter is equally delicate and necessary  the prayers  of the congregation are requested  eheu and it will be  ended before this letter leaves and printed in the states ere  you can read this scribble  the first dinner gong has  sounded je vous salue monsieur et cher confrere  tofa  soifua  sleep long life as our samoan salutation of  farewell runs   friday may 13th   well the last chapter by far the most difficult and  ungrateful is well under way i have been from six to seven  hours upon it daily since i last wrote and that is all i  have done forbye working at samoan rather hard and going  down on wednesday evening to the club  i make some progress  now at the language i am teaching belle which clears and  exercises myself  i am particularly taken with the finesse  of the pronouns  the pronouns are all dual and plural and  the first person both in the dual and plural has a special  exclusive and inclusive form  you can conceive what fine  effects of precision and distinction can be reached in  certain cases  take ruth i vv 8 to 13 and imagine how  those pronouns come in it is exquisitely elegant and makes  the mouth of the litterateur to water  i am going to  exercitate my pupil over those verses today for pronoun  practice   tuesday   yesterday came yours  well well if the dears prefer a  week why ill give them ten days but the real document  from which i have scarcely varied ran for one night  i  think you seem scarcely fair to wiltshire who had surely  under his beastignorant ways right noble qualities  and i  think perhaps you scarce do justice to the fact that this is  a place of realism a outrance nothing extenuated or  coloured  looked at so is it not with all its tragic  features wonderfully idyllic with great beauty of scene and  circumstance  and will you please to observe that almost all  that is ugly is in the whites  ill apologise for papa  randal if you like but if i told you the whole truth  for i  did extenuate there  and he seemed to me essential as a  figure and essential as a pawn in the game wiltshires  disgust for him being one of the small efficient motives in  the story  now it would have taken a fairish dose to disgust  wiltshire  again the idea of publishing the beach  substantively is dropped  at once both on account of  expostulation and because it measured shorter than i had  expected  and it was only taken up when the proposed  volume beach de mar petered out  it petered out thus the  chief of the short stories got sucked into sophia scarlet   and sophia is a book i am much taken with and mean to get  to as soon as  but not before  i have done david balfour  and the young chevalier  so you see you are like to hear no  more of the pacific or the nineteenth century for a while   the young chevalier is a story of sentiment and passion  which i mean to write a little differently from what i have  been doing  if i can hit the key rather more of a  sentimental tremolo to it  it may thus help to prepare me  for sophia which is to contain three ladies and a kind of a  love affair between the heroine and a dying planter who is a  poet large orders for r l s  o the german taboo is quite over no soul attempts to support  the c j or the president they are past hope the whites  have just refused their taxes  i mean the council has  refused to call for them and if the council consented  nobody would pay tis a farce and the curtain is going to  fall briefly  consequently in my history i say as little as  may be of the two dwindling stars  poor devils  i liked the  one and the other has a little wife now lying in  there  was no man born with so little animosity as i when i heard  the c j was in low spirits and never left his house i  could scarce refrain from going to him  it was a fine feeling to have finished the history there  ought to be a future state to reward that grind  its not  literature you know only journalism and pedantic  journalism  i had but the one desire to get the thing as  right as might be and avoid false concords  even if that   and it was more than there was time for  however there it  is done  and if samoa turns up again my book has to be  counted with being the only narrative extant  milton and i   if you kindly excuse the juxtaposition  harnessed  ourselves to strange waggons and i at least will be found to  have plodded very soberly with my load  there is not even a  good sentence in it but perhaps  i dont know  it may be  found an honest clear volume   wednesday   never got a word set down and continues on thursday 19th  may his own marriage day as ever was  news yes  the c j  came up to call on us  after five months cessation on my  side and a decidedly painful interchange of letters i could  not go down  could not  to see him  my three ladies  received him however he was very agreeable as usual but  refused wine beer water lemonade chocolate and at last a  cigarette  then my wife asked him so you refuse to break  bread and he waved his hands amiably in answer  all my  three ladies received the same impression that he had serious  matters in his mind now we hear he is quite cockahoop  since the mail came and going about as before his troubles  darkened  but what did he want with me  tis thought he had  received a despatch  and that he misreads it so we fully  believe to the effect that they are to have war ships at  command and can make their little war after all  if it be  so and they do it it will be the meanest wanton slaughter  of poor men for the salaries of two white failures  but what  was his errand with me perhaps to warn me that unless i  behave he now hopes to be able to pack me off in the curacoa  when she comes  i have celebrated my holiday from samoa by a plunge at the  beginning of the young chevalier  i am afraid my touch is a  little broad in a love story i cant mean one thing and  write another  as for women i am no more in any fear of  them i can do a sort all right age makes me less afraid of  a petticoat but i am a little in fear of grossness   however this david balfours love affair thats all right   might be read out to a mothers meeting  or a daughters  meeting  the difficulty in a love yarn which dwells at all  on love is the dwelling on one string it is manifold i  grant but the root fact is there unchanged and the  sentiment being very intense and already very much handled  in letters positively calls for a little pawing and gracing   with a writer of my prosaic literalness and pertinency of  point of view this all shoves toward grossness  positively  even towards the far more damnable closeness  this has kept  me off the sentiment hitherto and now i am to try lord  of  course meredith can do it and so could shakespeare but with  all my romance i am a realist and a prosaist and a most  fanatical lover of plain physical sensations plainly and  expressly rendered hence my perils  to do love in the same  spirit as i did for instance d balfours fatigue in the  heather my dear sir there were grossness  ready made  and  hence how to sugar  however i have nearly done with marie madeleine and am in good hopes of mariesalome the real  heroine the other is only a prologuial heroine to introduce  the hero   friday   anyway the first prologuial episode is done and fanny likes  it  there are only four characters francis blair of balmile  jacobite lord gladsmuir my hero the master of ballantrae  paradon a wineseller of avignon mariemadeleine his wife   these two last i am now done with and i think they are  successful and i hope i have balmile on his feet and the  style seems to be found  it is a little charged and violent  sins on the side of violence but i think will carry the  tale  i think it is a good idea so to introduce my hero  being made love to by an episodic woman  this queer tale  i  mean queer for me  has taken a great hold upon me  where  the devil shall i go next  this is simply the tale of a coup  de tete of a young man and a young woman with a nearly  perhaps a wholly tragic sequel which i desire to make  thinkable right through and sensible to make the reader as  far as i shall be able eat and drink and breathe it  marie salome des saintesmaries is i think the heroines name  she has got to be yet sursum corda  so has the young  chevalier whom i have not yet touched and who comes next in  order  characters balmile or lord gladsmuir comme vous  voulez prince charlie earl marischal master of ballantrae  and a spy and dr archie campbell and a few nondescripts  then of women mariesalome and flora blair seven at the  outside really four full lengths and i suppose a halfdozen  episodic profiles  how i must bore you with these  ineptitudes  have patience  i am going to bed it is of  all hours eleven  i have been forced in since i began to  write to you to blatter to fanny on the subject of my  heroine there being two cruces as to her life and history  how came she alone and how far did she go with the  chevalier  the second must answer itself when i get near  enough to see  the first is a backbreaker  yet i know  there are many reasons why a fille de famine romantic  adventurous ambitious innocent of the world might run from  her home in these days might she not have been threatened  with a convent might there not be some huguenot business  mixed in  here am i far from books if you can help me with  a suggestion i shall say god bless you  she has to be new  run away from a strict family welljustified in her own wild  but honest eyes and meeting these three men charles edward  marischal and balmile through the accident of a fire at an  inn  she must not run from a marriage i think it would  bring her in the wrong frame of mind  once i can get her  sola on the highway all were well with my narrative   perpend  and help if you can  lafaele long i hope familiar to you has this day received  the visit of his son from tonga and the son proves to be a  very pretty attractive young daughter  i gave all the boys  kava in honour of her arrival along with a lean side whiskered tongan dimly supposed to be lafaeles stepfather  and they have been having a good time in the end of my  verandah i hear simi my present incapable steward talking  tongan with the nondescript papa  simi our outdoor boy  burst a succession of bloodvessels over our work and i had  to make a position for the wreck of one of the noblest  figures of a man i ever saw  i believe i may have mentioned  the other day how i had to put my horse to the trot the  canter and at last the gallop to run him down  in a  photograph i hope to send you perhaps with this you will  see simi standing in the verandah in profile  as a steward  one of his chief points is to break crystal he is great on  fracture  what do i say  explosion  he cleans a glass  and the shards scatter like a comets bowels  nb  if i should by any chance be deported the first of  the rules hung up for that occasion is to communicate with  you by telegraph  mind i do not fear it but it is  possible   monday 25th   we have had a devil of a morning of upset and bustle the  bronze candlestick faauma has returned to the family in time  to take her position of stepmamma and it is pretty to see  how the child is at once at home and all her terrors ended   27th  mail day   and i dont know that i have much to report  i may have to  leave for malie as soon as these mail packets are made up   tis a necessity if it be one i rather deplore  i think i  should have liked to lazy but i daresay all it means is the  delay of a day or so in harking back to david balfour that  respectable youth chides at being left where he is now in  glasgow with the lord advocate and after five years in the  british linen who shall blame him  i was all forenoon  yesterday down in apia dictating and lloyd typewriting  the conclusion of samoa and then at home correcting till the  dinner bell and in the evening again till eleven of the  clock  this morning i have made up most of my packets and i  think my mail is all ready but two more and the tag of this   i would never deny as d b might say that i was rather  tired of it  but i have a damned good dose of the devil in  my pipestem atomy i have had my little holiday outing in my  kick at the young chevalier and i guess i can settle to  david balfour tomorrow or friday like a little man  i  wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so little  strength  i know there is a frost the samoa book can only  increase that  i cant help it that book is not written for  me but for miss manners but i mean to break that frost  inside two years and pull off a big success and vanity  whispers in my ear that i have the strength  if i havent  whistle ower the lave ot  i can do without glory and  perhaps the time is not far off when i can do without corn   it is a time coming soon enough anyway and i have endured  some two and forty years without public shame and had a good  time as i did it  if only i could secure a violent death  what a fine success  i wish to die in my boots no more land  of counterpane for me  to be drowned to be shot to be  thrown from a horse  ay to be hanged rather than pass  again through that slow dissolution  i fancy this gloomy ramble is caused by a twinge of age i  put on an undershirt yesterday it was the only one i could  find that barely came under my trousers and just below it  a fine healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in my  hip  from such small causes do these valuable considerations  flow  i shall now say adieu dear sir having ten rugged miles  before me and the horrors of a native feast and parliament  without an interpreter for today i go alone  yours ever r l s    chapter xix    sunday 29th may   how am i to overtake events  on wednesday as soon as my  mail was finished i had a wild whirl to look forward to   immediately after dinner belle lloyd and i set out on  horseback they to the club i to haggards thence to the  hotel where i had supper ready for them  all next day we  hung round apia with our whole housecrowd in sunday array  hoping for the mail steamer with a menagerie on board  no  such luck the ship delayed and at last about three i had  to send them home again a failure of a days pleasuring that  does not bear to be discussed  lloyd was so sickened that he  returned the same night to vailima belle and i held on sat  most of the evening on the hotel verandah stricken silly with  fatigue and disappointment and genuine sorrow for our poor  boys and girls and got to bed with rather dismal  appreciations of the morrow  these were more than justified and yet i never had a jollier  day than friday 27th  by 730 belle and i had breakfast we  had scarce done before my mother was at the door on  horseback and a boy at her heels to take her not very  dashing charger home again  by 810 we were all on the  landing pier and it was 920 before we had got away in a  boat with two inches of green wood on the keel of her no  rudder no mast no sail no boat flag two defective  rowlocks two wretched apologies for oars and two boys  one  a tongan halfcaste one a white lad son of the tonga  schoolmaster and a sailor lad  to pull us  all this was  our first taste of the tender mercies of taylor the  sesquipidalian halfcaste introduced two letters back i  believe  we had scarce got round mulinuu when sale taylors  heart misgave him he thought we had missed the tide called  a halt and set off ashore to find canoes  two were found  in one my mother and i were embarked with the two biscuit  tins my present to the feast and the bag with our dry  clothes on which my mother was perched  and her cap was on  the top of it  feminine hearts please sympathise all under  the guidance of sale  in the other belle and our guest  tauilo a chiefwoman the mother of my cook were to have  followed  and the boys were to have been left with the boat   but tauilo refused  and the four belle tauilo frank the  sailorboy and jimmie the tongan halfcaste set off in the  boat across that rapidly shoaling bay of the lagoon  how long the next scene lasted i could never tell  sale was  always trying to steal away with our canoe and leave the  other four probably for six hours in an empty leaky boat  without so much as an orange or a cocoanut on board and  under the direct rays of the sun  i had at last to stop him  by taking the spare paddle off the outrigger and sticking it  in the ground  depth perhaps two feet  width of the bay  say three miles  at last i bid him land me and my mother and  go back for the other ladies  the coast is so rugged said  sale  what i said all these villages and no landing  place  such is the nature of samoans said he  well  ill find a landingplace i thought and presently i said  now we are going to land there  we can but try said  the bland sale with resignation  never saw a better  landingplace in my life  here the boat joined us  my  mother and sale continued in the canoe alone and belle and i  and tauilo set off on foot for malie  tauilo was about the  size of both of us put together and a piece over she used us  like a mouse with children  i had started barefoot belle  had soon to pull off her gala shoes and stockings the mud  was as deep as to our knees and so slippery that moving as  we did in indian file between dense scratching tufts of  sensitive belle and i had to take hands to support each  other and tauilo was steadying belle from the rear  you can  conceive we were got up to kill belle in an embroidered  white dress and white hat i in a suit of bedford cords hot  from the sydney tailors and conceive us below inkblack to  the knees with adhesive clay and above streaming with heat   i suppose it was better than three miles but at last we made  the end of malie  i asked if we could find no water to wash  our feet and our nursemaid guided us to a pool  we sat down  on the pool side and our nursemaid washed our feet and legs  for us  ladies first i suppose out of a sudden respect to  the insane european fancies such a luxury as you can scarce  imagine  i felt a new man after it  but before we got to  the kings house we were sadly muddied once more  it was 1  pm when we arrived the canoe having beaten us by about  five minutes so we made fair time over our bogholes  but the war dances were over and we came in time to see only  the tail end some two hours of the food presentation  in  mataafas house three chairs were set for us covered with  fine mats  of course a native house without the blinds down  is like a verandah  all the green in front was surrounded  with sheds some of flapping canvas some of green palm  boughs where in three sides of a huge oblong the natives  sat by villages in a fine glow of manyhued array  there  were folks in tapa and folks in patchwork there was every  colour of the rainbow in a spot or a cluster there were men  with their heads gilded with powdered sandalwood others  with heads all purple stuck full of the petals of a flower   in the midst there was a growing field of outspread food  gradually covering acres the gifts were brought in now by  chanting deputations now by carriers in a file they were  brandished aloft and declaimed over with polite sacramental  exaggerations by the official receiver  he a stalwart  welloiled quadragenarian shone with sweat from his  exertions brandishing cooked pigs  at intervals from one  of the squatted villages an orator would arise  the field  was almost beyond the reach of any human speaking voice the  proceedings besides continued in the midst yet it was  possible to catch snatches of this elaborate and cutanddry  oratory  it was possible for me for instance to catch the  description of my gift and myself as the alii tusitala o le  alii o malo tetele  the chief white information the chief  of the great governments  gay designation  in the house in  our three curule chairs we sat and looked on  on our left a  little group of the family  in front of us at our feet an  ancient talkingman crowned with green leaves his profile  almost exactly dantes popo his name  he had worshipped  idols in his youth he had been full grown before the first  missionary came hither from tahiti this makes him over  eighty  near by him sat his son and colleague  in the group  on our left his little grandchild sat with her legs crossed  and her hands turned the model already at some three years  old of samoan etiquette  still further off to our right  mataafa sat on the ground through all the business and still  i saw his lips moving and the beads of his rosary slip  stealthily through his hand  we had kava and the kings  drinking was hailed by the popos father and son with a  singular ululation perfectly new to my ears it means to  the expert long live tuiatua to the inexpert is a mere  voice of barbarous wolves  we had dinner retired a bit  behind the central pillar of the house and when the king  was done eating the ululation was repeated  i had my eyes  on mataafas face and i saw pride and gratified ambition  spring to life there and be instantly sucked in again  it  was the first time since the difference with laupepa that  popo and his son had openly joined him and given him the due  cry as tuiatua  one of the eight royal names of the islands  as i hope you will know before this reaches you  not long after we had dined the foodbringing was over  the  gifts carefully noted and tallied as they came in were now  announced by a humorous orator who convulsed the audience  introducing singing notes now on the name of the article  now on the number six thousand odd heads of taro three  hundred and nineteen cooked pigs and one thing that  particularly caught me by good luck a single turtle for  the king  le tasi mo le tupu  then came one of the  strangest sights i have yet witnessed  the two most  important persons there bar mataafa were popo and his son   they rose holding their long shod rods of talking men  passed forth from the house broke into a strange dance the  father capering with outstretched arms and rod the son  crouching and gambolling beside him in a manner  indescribable and presently began to extend the circle of  this dance among the acres of cooked food  whatever they  leaped over whatever they called for became theirs  to see  mediaeval dante thus demean himself struck a kind of a chill  of incongruity into our philistine souls but even in a great  part of the samoan concourse these antique and i  understand quite local manners awoke laughter  one of my  biscuit tins and a live calf were among the spoils he  claimed but the large majority of the cooked food having  once proved his dignity he represented to the king  then came the turn of le alii tusitala  he would not dance  but he was given  five live hens four gourds of oil four  fine tapas a hundred heads of taro two cooked pigs a  cooked shark two or three cocoanut branches strung with  kava and the turtle who soon after breathed his last i  believe from sunstroke  it was a royal present for the  chief of the great powers  i should say the gifts were on  the proper signal dragged out of the field of food by a  troop of young men all with their lavalavas kilted almost  into a loincloth  the art is to swoop on the foodfield  pick up with unerring swiftness the right things and  quantities swoop forth again on the open and separate  leaving the gifts in a new pile so you may see a covey of  birds in a cornfield  this reminds me of a very inhumane  but beautiful passage i had forgotten in its place  the  giftgiving was still in full swing when there came a troop  of some ninety men all in tafa lavalavas of a purplish  colour they paused and of a sudden there went up from them  high into the air a flight of live chickens which as they  came down again were sent again into the air for perhaps a  minute from the midst of a singular turmoil of flying arms  and shouting voices i assure you it was very beautiful to  see but how many chickens were killed  no sooner was my food set out than i was to be going  i had  a little serious talk with mataafa on the floor and we went  down to the boat where we got our food aboard such a cargo   like the swiss family robinson we said  however a squall  began tauilo refused to let us go and we came back to the  house for halfanhour or so when my ladies distinguished  themselves by walking through a fono council my mother  actually taking up a position between mataafa and popo  it  was about five when we started  turtle pigs taro etc my  mother belle myself tauilo a portly friend of hers with  the voice of an angel and a pronunciation so delicate and  true that you could follow samoan as she sang and the two  tired boys frank and jimmie with the two bad oars and the  two slippery rowlocks to impel the whole  sale taylor took  the canoe and a strong samoan to paddle him  presently after  he went inshore and passed us a little after with his arms  folded and two strong samoans impelling him apiaward  this  was too much for belle who hailed taunted him and made him  return to the boat with one of the samoans setting jimmie  instead in the canoe  then began our torment sale and the  samoan took the oars sat on the same thwart where they  could get no swing on the boat had they tried and  deliberately ladled at the lagoon  we lay enchanted  night  fell there was a light visible on shore it did not move   the two women sang belle joining them in the hymns she has  learned at family worship  then a squall came up we sat a  while in roaring midnight under rivers of rain and when it  blew by there was the light again immovable  a second  squall followed one of the worst i was ever out in we could  scarce catch our breath in the cold dashing deluge  when it  went we were so cold that the water in the bottom of the  boat which i was then baling seemed like a warm footbath in  comparison and belle and i who were still barefoot were  quite restored by laving in it  all this time i had kept my temper and refrained as far as  might be from any interference for i saw in our friends  mulish humour he always contrived to twist it to our  disadvantage  but now came the acute point  young frank now  took an oar  he was a little fellow near as frail as  myself and very short if he weighed nine stone it was the  outside but his blood was up  he took stroke moved the big  samoan forward to bow and set to work to pull him round in  fine style  instantly a kind of race competition  almost  race hatred  sprang up  we jeered the samoan  sale  declared it was the trim of the boat if this lady was aft  tauilos portly friend he would row round frank  we  insisted on her coming aft and frank still rowed round the  samoan  when the samoan caught a crab the thing was  continual with these wretched oars and rowlocks we shouted  and jeered when frank caught one sale and the samoan jeered  and yelled  but anyway the boat moved and presently we got  up with mulinuu where i finally lost my temper when i found  that sale proposed to go ashore and make a visit  in fact  we all three did  it is not worth while going into but i  must give you one snatch of the subsequent conversation as we  pulled round apia bay  this samoan said sale received  seven german bullets in the field of fangalii  i am  delighted to hear it said belle  his brother was killed  there pursued sale and belle prompt as an echo then  there are no more of the family how delightful  sale was  sufficiently surprised to change the subject he began to  praise franks rowing with insufferable condescension but  it is after all not to be wondered at said he because he  has been for some time a sailor  my good man is it three or  five years that you have been to sea  and frank in a  defiant shout two whereupon so high did the illfeeling  run that we three clapped and applauded and shouted so that  the president whose house we were then passing doubtless  started at the sounds  it was nine when we got to the hotel  at first no food was to be found but we skirmished up some  bread and cheese and beer and brandy and having changed our  wet clothes for the rather less wet in our bags supped on  the verandah  saturday 28th  i was wakened about 630 long past my usual  hour by a benevolent passerby  my turtle lay on the  verandah at my door and the man woke me to tell me it was  dead as it had been when we put it on board the day before   all morning i ran the gauntlet of men and women coming up to  me mr stevenson your turtle is dead  i gave half of it  to the hotel keeper so that his cook should cut it up and  we got a damaged shell and two splendid meals beefsteak one  day and soup the next  the horses came for us about 930   it was waterspouting we were drenched before we got out of  the town the road was a fine going highland trout stream it  thundered deep and frequent and my mothers horse would not  better on a walk  at last she took pity on us and very  nobly proposed that belle and i should ride ahead  we were  mighty glad to do so for we were cold  presently i said i  should ride back for my mother but it thundered again belle  is afraid of thunder and i decided to see her through the  forest before i returned for my other hen  i may say my  other wet hen  about the middle of the wood where it is  roughest and steepest we met three packhorses with barrels  of limejuice  i piloted belle past these  it is not very  easy in such a road  and then passed them again myself to  pilot my mother  this effected it began to thunder again  so i rode on hard after belle  when i caught up with her  she was singing samoan hymns to support her terrors  we were  all back changed and at table by lunch time 11 am  nor  have any of us been the worse for it sinsyne  that is pretty  good for a woman of my mothers age and an invalid of my  standing above all as tauilo was laid up with a bad cold  probably increased by rage   friday 3rd june   on wednesday the club could not be held and i must ride down  town and to and fro all afternoon delivering messages then  dined and rode up by the young moon  i had plenty news when  i got back there is great talk in town of my deportation it  is thought they have written home to downing street  requesting my removal which leaves me not much alarmed what  i do rather expect is that h j moors and i may be haled up  before the c j to stand a trial for lesemajesty  well  well try and live it through  the rest of my history since monday has been unadulterated  david balfour  in season and out of season night and day  david and his innocent harem  let me be just he never has  more than the two  are on my mind  think of david balfour  with a pair of fair ladies  very nice ones too  hanging  round him  i really believe david is as a good character as  anybody has a right to ask for in a novel  i have finished  drafting chapter xx today and feel it all ready to froth  when the spigot is turned  o i forgot  and do forget  what did i mean  a waft of  cloud has fallen on my mind and i will write no more   wednesday i believe 8th june   lots of david and lots of david and the devil any other  news  yesterday we were startled by great guns firing a  salute and today whitmee missionary rode up to lunch and  we learned it was the curacoa come in the ship according to  rumour in which i was to be deported  i went down to meet  my fate and the captain is to dine with me saturday so i  guess i am not going this voyage  even with the  particularity with which i write to you how much of my life  goes unexpressed my troubles with a madman by the name of   a genuine living lunatic i believe and jolly dangerous my  troubles about poor  all these have dropped out yet for  moments they were very instant and one of them is always  present with me  i have finished copying chapter xxi of david  solus cum  sola we travel together  chapter xxii solus cum sola  we keep house together is already drafted  to the end of  xxi makes more than 150 pages of my manuscript  damn this  hair  and i only designed the book to run to about 200 but  when you introduce the female sect a book does run away with  you  i am very curious to see what you will think of my two  girls  my own opinion is quite clear i am in love with  both  i foresee a few pleasant years of spiritual  flirtations  the creator if i may name myself for the sake  of argument by such a name is essentially unfaithful  for  the duration of the two chapters in which i dealt with miss  grant i totally forgot my heroine and even  but this is a  flat secret  tried to win away david  i think i must try  some day to marry miss grant  im blest if i dont think  ive got that hair out which seems triumph enough so i  conclude   tuesday   your infinitesimal correspondence has reached me and i have  the honour to refer to it with scorn  it contains only one  statement of conceivable interest that your health is  better the rest is null and so far as disquisitory unsound   i am all right but david balfour is ailing this came from  my visit to the manofwar where i had a cup of tea and the  most of that night walked the verandah with extraordinary  convictions of guilt and ruin many of which but not all  proved to have fled with the day taking david along with  them he rip in chapter xxii  on saturday i went down to the town and fetched up captain  gibson to dinner sunday i was all day at samoa and had a  pile of visitors  yesterday got my mail including your  despicable sheet was fooled with a visit from the high chief  asi went down at 4 pm to my samoan lesson from whitmee  i  think i shall learn from him he does not fool me with  cockshot rules that are demolished next day but professes  ignorance like a man the truth is the grammar has still to  be expiscated  dined with haggard and got home about nine   wednesday   the excellent clarke up here almost all day yesterday a man  i esteem and like to the soles of his boots i prefer him to  anyone in samoa and to most people in the world a real good  missionary with the inestimable advantage of having grown up  a layman  pity they all cant get that  it recalls my old  proposal which delighted lady taylor so much that every  divinity student should be thirty years old at least before  he was admitted  boys switched out of college into a pulpit  what chance have they  that any should do well amazes me  and the most are just what was to be expected   saturday   i must tell you of our feast  it was long promised to the  boys and came off yesterday in one of their new houses  my  good simele arrived from savaii that morning asking for  political advice then we had tauilo elenas father a  talking man of tauilos family talolos cousin and a boy of  simeles family who attended on his dignity then metu the  meatman  you have never heard of him but he is a great  person in our household  brought a lady and a boy  and  there was another infant  eight guests in all  and we sat  down thirty strong  you should have seen our procession  going about two oclock all in our best clothes to the  hall of feasting  all in our sundays best  the new house  had been hurriedly finished the rafters decorated with  flowers the floor spread native style with green leaves  we had given a big porker twentyfive pounds of fresh beef  a tin of biscuit cocoanuts etc  our places were all  arranged with much care the native ladies of the house  facing our party the sides filled up by the men the guests  please observe the two chief people male and female were  placed with our family the rest between s and the native  ladies  after the feast was over we had kava and the  calling of the kava was a very elaborate affair and i  thought had like to have made simele very angry he is really  a considerable chief but he and tauilo were not called till  after all our family and the guests i suppose the principle  being that he was still regarded as one of the household  i  forgot to say that our black boy did not turn up when the  feast was ready  off went the two cooks found him  decorated him with huge red hibiscus flowers  he was in a  very dirty under shirt  brought him back between them like a  reluctant maid and thrust him into a place between faauma  and elena where he was petted and ministered to  when his  turn came in the kava drinking  and you may be sure in  their contemptuous affectionate kindness for him as for a  good dog it came rather earlier than it ought  he was cried  under a new name  aleki is what they make of his own name  arrick but instead of    the cup of  le ipu o       aleki it was called le ipu o vailima and it was explained  that he had taken his chiefname a jest at which the  plantation still laughs  kava done i made a little speech  henry translating  if i had been well i should have alluded  to all but i was scarce able to sit up so only alluded to  my guest of all this month the tongan tomas and to simele  partly for the jest of making him translate compliments to  himself  the talking man replied with many handsome  compliments to me in the usual flood of samoan fluent  neatness and we left them to an afternoon of singing and  dancing  must stop now as my right hand is very bad again   i am trying to write with my left   sunday   about halfpast eight last night i had gone to my own room  fanny and lloyd were in fannys every one else in bed only  two boys on the premises  the two little brown boys mitaiele  michael age i suppose 11 or 12 and the new steward a  wallis islander speaking no english and about fifty words of  samoan recently promoted from the bush work and a most  good anxious timid lad of 15 or 16  looks like 17 or 18  of course  they grow fast here  in comes mitaiele to lloyd  and told some rigmarole about paatalise the stewards name  wanting to go and see his family in the bush  but he has  no family in the bush said lloyd  no said mitaiele   they went to the boys bed they sleep in the walledin  compartment of the verandah once my dressingroom and  called at once for me  he lay like one asleep talking in  drowsy tones but without excitement and at times cheeping  like a frightened mouse he was quite cool to the touch and  his pulse not fast his breathing seemed wholly ventral the  bust still the belly moving strongly  presently he got from  his bed and ran for the door with his head down not three  feet from the floor and his body all on a stretch forward  like a striking snake i say ran but this strange movement  was not swift  lloyd and i mastered him and got him back in  bed  soon there was another and more desperate attempt to  escape in which lloyd had his ring broken  then we bound  him to the bed humanely with sheets ropes boards and  pillows  he lay there and sometimes talked sometimes  whispered sometimes wept like an angry child his principal  word was faamolemole  please  and he kept telling us at  intervals that his family were calling him  during this  interval by the special grace of god my boys came home we  had already called in arrick the black boy now we had that  hercules lafaele and a man savea who comes from  paatalises own island and can alone communicate with him  freely  lloyd went to bed i took the first watch and sat  in my room reading while lafaele and arrick watched the  madman  suddenly arrick called me i ran into the verandah  there was paatalise free of all his bonds and lafaele holding  him  to tell what followed is impossible  we were five  people at him  lafaele and savea very strong men lloyd i  and arrick and the struggle lasted until 1 am before we  had him bound  one detail for a specimen lloyd and i had  charge of one leg we were both sitting on it and lo we  were both tossed into the air  i i daresay a couple of  feet  at last we had him spreadeagled to the iron bedstead  by his wrists and ankles with matted rope a most inhumane  business but what could we do it was all we could do to  manage it even so  the strength of the paroxysms had been  steadily increasing and we trembled for the next  and now i  come to pure rider haggard  lafaele announced that the boy  was very bad and he would get some medicine which was a  family secret of his own  some leaves were brought  mysteriously in chewed placed on the boys eyes dropped in  his ears see hamlet and stuck up his nostrils as he did  this the weird doctor partly smothered the patient with his  hand and by about 2 am he was in a deep sleep and from  that time he showed no symptom of dementia whatever  the  medicine says lafaele is principally used for the wholesale  slaughter of families he himself feared last night that his  dose was fatal only one other person on this island knows  the secret and she lafaele darkly whispers has abused it   this remarkable tree we must try to identify  the manofwar doctor came up today gave us a strait waistcoat taught us to bandage examined the boy and saw he  was apparently well  he insisted on doing his work all  morning poor lad and when he first came down kissed all the  family at breakfast  the doctor was greatly excited as may  be supposed about lafaeles medicine   tuesday   all yesterday writing my mail by the hand of belle to save  my wrist  this is a great invention to which i shall stick  if it can be managed  we had some alarm about paatalise but  he slept well all night for a benediction  this lunatic  asylum exercise has no attractions for any of us  i dont know if i remembered to say how much pleased i was  with across the plains in every way inside and out and you  and me  the critics seem to taste it too as well as could  be hoped and i believe it will continue to bring me in a few  shillings a year for a while  but such books pay only  indirectly  to understand the full horror of the mad scene and how well  my boys behaved remember that they believed ps ravings  they knew that his dead family thirty strong crowded the  front verandah and called on him to come to the other world   they knew that his dead brother had met him that afternoon in  the bush and struck him on both temples  and remember we  are fighting the dead and they had to go out again in the  black night which is the dead mans empire  yet last  evening when i thought p was going to repeat the  performance i sent down for lafaele who had leave of  absence and he and his wife came up about eight oclock with  a lighted brand  these are the things for which i have to  forgive my old cattleman his manifold shortcomings they are  heroic  so are the shortcomings to be sure  it came over me the other day suddenly that this diary of  mine to you would make good pickings after i am dead and a  man could make some kind of a book out of it without much  trouble  so for gods sake dont lose them and they will  prove a piece of provision for my poor old family as  simele calls it  about my coming to europe i get more and more doubtful and  rather incline to ceylon again as place of meeting  i am so  absurdly well here in the tropics that it seems like  affectation  yet remember i have never once stood sydney   anyway i shall have the money for it all ahead before i  think of such a thing  we had a bowl of punch on your birthday which my incredible  mother somehow knew and remembered  i sometimes sit and yearn for anything in the nature of an  income that would come in  mine has all got to be gone and  fished for with the immortal mind of man  what i want is the  income that really comes in of itself while all you have to  do is just to blossom and exist and sit on chairs  think how  beautiful it would be not to have to mind the critics and  not even the darkest of the crowd  sidney colvin  i should  probably amuse myself with works that would make your hair  curl if you had any left   r l s    chapter xx    saturday 2nd july 1892   the character of my handwriting is explained alas by  scriveners cramp  this also explains how long i have let  the paper lie plain   1 p m   i was busy copying david balfour with my left hand  a most  laborious task  fanny was down at the native house  superintending the floor lloyd down in apia and belle in  her own house cleaning when i heard the latter calling on my  name  i ran out on the verandah and there on the lawn  beheld my crazy boy with an axe in his hand and dressed out  in green ferns dancing  i ran downstairs and found all my  house boys on the back verandah watching him through the  diningroom  i asked what it meant  dance belong his  place they said  i think this no time to dance said i   has he done his work  no they told me away bush all  morning  but there they all stayed on the back verandah  i  went on alone through the diningroom and bade him stop  he  did so shouldered the axe and began to walk away but i  called him back walked up to him and took the axe out of  his unresisting hands  the boy is in all things so good  that i can scarce say i was afraid only i felt it had to be  stopped ere he could work himself up by dancing to some  craziness  our house boys protested they were not afraid  all i know is they were all watching him round the back door  and did not follow me till i had the axe  as for the out  boys who were working with fanny in the native house they  thought it a very bad business and made no secret of their  fears   wednesday 6th   i have no account to give of my stewardship these days and  theres a day more to account for than mere arithmetic would  tell you  for we have had two monday fourths to bring us at  last on the right side of the meridian having hitherto been  an exception in the world and kept our private date   business has filled my hours sans intermission   tuesday 12th   i am doing no work and my mind is in abeyance  fanny and  belle are sewingmachining in the next room i have been  pulling down their hair and fanny has been kicking me and  now i am driven out  austin i have been chasing about the  verandah now he has gone to his lessons and i make believe  to write to you in despair  but there is nothing in my mind  i swim in mere vacancy my head is like a rotten nut i shall  soon have to begin to work again or i shall carry away some  part of the machinery  i have got your insufficient letter  for which i scorn to thank you  i have had no review by  gosse none by birrell another time if i have a letter in  the times you might send me the text as well also please  send me a cricket bat and a cake and when i come home for  the holidays i should like to have a pony  i am sir your obedient servant  jacob tonson   ps  i am quite well i hope you are quite well  the world  is too much with us and my mother bids me bind my hair and  lace my bodice blue    chapter xxi    my dear colvin  this is friday night the i believe 18th  or 20th august or september  i shall probably regret to morrow having written you with my own hand like the apostle  paul  but i am alone over here in the workmans house where  i and belle and lloyd and austin are pigging the rest are at  cards in the main residence  i have not joined them because  belly belong me has been kicking up and i have just taken  15 drops of laudanum  on tuesday the party set out  self in white cap velvet  coat cords and yellow half boots belle in a white kind of  suit and white cap to match mine lloyd in white clothes and  long yellow boots and a straw hat graham in khakis and  gaiters henry my old overseer in blue coat and black kilt  and the great lafaele with a big shipbag on his saddlebow   we left the mail at the  p o had lunch at the hotel and  about 150 set out westward to the place of tryst  this was  by a little shrunken brook in a deep channel of mud on the  far side of which in a thicket of low trees all full of  moths of shadow and butterflies of sun we lay down to await  her ladyship  whiskey and water then a sketch of the  encampment for which we all posed to belle passed off the  time until 330  then i could hold on no longer  30 minutes  late  had the secret oozed out  were they arrested  i got  my horse crossed the brook again and rode hard back to the  vaea cross roads whence i was aware of white clothes  glancing in the other long straight radius of the quadrant   i turned at once to return to the place of tryst but d  overtook me and almost bore me down shouting ride ride  like a hero in a ballad  lady margaret and he were only come  to shew the place they returned and the rest of our party  reinforced by captain leigh and lady jersey set on for  malie  the delay was due to ds infinite precautions  leading them up lanes by back ways and then down again to  the beach road a hundred yards further on  it was agreed that lady jersey existed no more she was now  my cousin amelia balfour  that relative and i headed the  march she is a charming woman all of us like her extremely  after trial on this somewhat rude and absurd excursion  and  we ameliad or miss balfourd her with great but intermittent  fidelity  when we came to the last village i sent henry on  ahead to warn the king of our approach and amend his  discretion if that might be  as he left i heard the  villagers asking which was the great lady  and a little  further at the borders of malie itself we found the guard  making a music of bugles and conches  then i knew the game  was up and the secret out  a considerable guard of honour  mostly children accompanied us but for our good fortune  we had been looked for earlier and the crowd was gone  dinner at the kings he asked me to say grace i could think  of none  never could graham suggested benedictus benedicat  at which i leaped  we were nearly done when old popo  inflicted the atua howl of which you have heard already  right at lady jerseys shoulder  she started in fine style   there i said we have been giving you a chapter of  scott but this goes beyond the waverley novels  after  dinner kava  lady j was served before me and the king  drank last it was the least formal kava i ever saw in that  house  no names called no show of ceremony  all my ladies  are well trained and when belle drained her bowl the king  was pleased to clap his hands  then he and i must retire for  our private interview to another house  he gave me his own  staff and made me pass before him and in the interview  which was long and delicate he twice called me afioga  ah  that leaves you cold but i am samoan enough to have been  moved  susuga is my accepted rank to be called afioga   heavens what an advance  and it leaves europe cold  but it  staggered my henry  the first time it was complicated lana  susuga ma lana afioga  his excellency and his majesty  the  next time plain majesty  henry then begged to interrupt the  interview and tell who he was  he is a small family chief in  sawaii not very small  i do not wish the king says he  to think me a boy from apia  on our return to the palace  we separated  i had asked for the ladies to sleep alone   that was understood but that tusitala  his afioga tusitala   should go out with the other young men and not sleep with  the highborn females of his family  was a doctrine received  with difficulty  lloyd and i had one screen graham and  leigh another and we slept well  in the morning i was first abroad before dawn not very long  already there was a stir of birds  a little after i heard  singing from the kings chapel  exceeding good  and went  across in the hour when the east is yellow and the morning  bank is breaking up to hear it nearer  all about the  chapel the guards were posted and all saluted tusitala  i  could not refrain from smiling so there is a place too i  thought where sentinels salute me  mine has been a queer  life  drawing in book reproduced here in characters              y2             x   x  x          h              x     g                    x   f                       x  e                the      x d       i         kava     x a                          x  b

great house now  finished  recall your earlier letters to see a royal kava   this function is of rare use i know grown samoans who have  never witnessed it  it is besides as you are to hear a  piece of prehistoric history crystallised in figures and  the facts largely forgotten an acted hieroglyph  the house  is really splendid in the rafters in the midst two carved  and coloured model birds are posted the only thing of the  sort i have ever remarked in samoa the samoans being literal  observers of the second commandment  at one side of the egg  our party sat amataafa blady j cbelle dtusitala  egraham flloyd gcaptain leigh hhenry ipopo  the xs  round are the high chiefs each man in his historical  position  one side of the house is set apart for the king  alone we were allowed there as his guests and henry as our  interpreter  it was a huge trial to the lad when a speech  was made to me which he must translate and i made a speech  in answer which he had to orate fullbreathed to that big  circle he blushed through his dark skin but looked and  acted like a gentleman and a young fellow of sense then the  kava came to the king he poured one drop in libation drank  another and flung the remainder outside the house behind  him  next came the turn of the old shapeless stone marked t   it stands for one of the kings titles tamasoalii mataafa  is tamasoalii this day but cannot drink for it and the  stone must first be washed with water and then have the bowl  emptied on it  then  the order i cannot recall  came the  turn of y and z two orators of the name of malietoa the  first took his kava down plain like an ordinary man the  second must be packed to bed under a big sheet of tapa and  be massaged by anxious assistants and rise on his elbow  groaning to drink his cup  w a great hereditary war man  came next five times the cupbearers marched up and down the  house and passed the cup on five times it was filled and the  generals name and titles heralded at the bowl and five  times he refused it after examination as too small  it is  said this commemorates a time when malietoa at the head of  his army suffered much for want of supplies  then this same  military gentleman must drink five cups one from each of the  great names all which took a precious long time  he acted  very well haughtily and in a society tone outlining the  part  the difference was marked when he subsequently made a  speech in his own character as a plain godfearing chief  a  few more high chiefs then tusitala one more and then lady  jersey one more and then captain leigh and so on with the  rest of our party  henry of course excepted  you see in  public lady jersey followed me  just so far was the secret  kept  then we came home belle graham and lloyd to the chinamans  i with lady jersey to lunch so severally home  thursday i  have forgotten saturday i began again on davie on sunday  the jersey party came up to call and carried me to dinner   as i came out to ride home the searchlights of the curacoa  were lightening on the horizon from many miles away and next  morning she came in  tuesday was huge fun a reception at  haggards  all our party dined there lloyd and i in the  absence of haggard and leigh had to play aidedecamp and  host for about twenty minutes and i presented the population  of apia at random but luck helping without one mistake   wednesday we had two middies to lunch  thursday we had eeles  and hoskyn lieutenant and doctor  very very nice fellows   simple good and not the least dull to dinner  saturday  graham and i lunched on board graham belle lloyd dined at  the gs and austin and the whole of our servants went with  them to an evening entertainment the more bold returning by  lanternlight  yesterday sunday belle and i were off by  about half past eight left our horses at a public house and  went on board the curacoa in the wardroom skiff were  entertained in the wardroom thence on deck to the service  which was a great treat three fiddles and a harmonium and  excellent choir and the great ships company joining on  shore in haggards big boat to lunch with the party  thence  all together to vailima where we read aloud a ouida romance  we have been secretly writing in which haggard was the hero  and each one of the authors had to draw a portrait of him or  herself in a ouida light  leigh lady j fanny rls  belle and graham were the authors  in the midst of this gay life i have finally recopied two  chapters and drafted for the first time three of davie  balfour  but it is not a life that would continue to suit  me and if i have not continued to write to you you will  scarce wonder  and today we all go down again to dinner  and tomorrow they all come up to lunch  the world is too  much with us  but it now nears an end today already the  curacoa has sailed and on saturday or sunday lady jersey  will follow them in the mail steamer  i am sending you a  wire by her hands as far as sydney that is to say either you  or cassell about falesa i will not allow it to be called  uma in book form that is not the logical name of the story   nor can i have the marriage contract omitted and the thing  is full of misprints abominable  in the picture uma is rot  so is the old man and the negro but wiltshire is splendid  and case will do  it seems badly illuminated but this may  be printing  how have i seen this first number  not through  your attention guilty one  lady jersey had it and only  mentioned it yesterday  i ought to say how much we all like the jersey party  my boy  henry was enraptured with the manners of the tawaitai sili  chief lady  among our other occupations i did a bit of a  supposed epic describing our tryst at the ford of the  gasegase and belle and i made a little book of caricatures  and verses about incidents on the visit   tuesday   the wild round of gaiety continues  after i had written to  you yesterday the brain being wholly extinct i played  piquet all morning with graham  after lunch down to call on  the us consul hurt in a steeplechase thence back to the  new girls school which lady j was to open and where my  ladies met me  lady j is really an orator with a voice of  gold the rest of us played our unremarked parts  missionaries haggard myself a samoan chief holding forth  in turn myself with at least a golden brevity  thence  fanny belle and i to town to our billiard room in  haggards back garden where we found lloyd and where graham  joined us  the three men first dressed with the ladies in a  corner and then to leave them a free field we went off to  haggard and leighs quarters where  after all to dinner  where our two parties a brother of colonel kitcheners a  passing globetrotter and clarke the missionary  a very gay  evening with all sorts of chaff and mirth and a moonlit  ride home and to bed before 1230  and now today we have  the jerseyhaggard troupe to lunch and i must pass the  morning dressing ship   thursday sept 1st   i sit to write to you now 715 all the world in bed except  myself accounted for and belle and graham down at  haggards at dinner  not a leaf is stirring here but the  moon overhead now of a good bigness is obscured and partly  revealed in a whirling covey of thin stormclouds  by jove  it blows above  from 8 till 1115 on tuesday i dressed ship and in  particular cleaned crystal my specially  about 1130 the  guests began to arrive before i was dressed and between  while i had written a parody for lloyd to sing  yesterday  wednesday i had to start out about 3 for town had a long  interview with the head of the german firm about some work in  my new house got over to lloyds billiardroom about six on  the way whither i met fanny and belle coming down with one  kitchener a brother of the colonels  dined in the  billiardroom discovered we had forgot to order oatmeal  whereupon in the moonlit evening i set forth in my tropical  array mess jacket and such to get the oatmeal and meet a  young fellow c  and not a bad young fellow either only an  idiot  as drunk as croesus  he wept with me he wept for  me he talked like a bad character in an impudently bad  farce i could have laughed aloud to hear and could make you  laugh by repeating but laughter was not uppermost  this morning at about seven i set off after the lost sheep   i could have no horse all that could be mounted  we have  one girthsore and one deadlame in the establishment  were  due at a picnic about 1030  the morning was very wet and i  set off barefoot with my trousers over my knees and a  macintosh  presently i had to take a side path in the bush  missed it came forth in a great oblong patch of taro  solemnly surrounded by forest  no soul no sign no sound   and as i stood there at a loss suddenly between the showers  out broke the note of a harmonium and a womans voice singing  an air that i know very well but have as usual forgot the  name of  twas from a great way off but seemed to fill the  world  it was strongly romantic and gave me a point which  brought me by all sorts of forest wading to an open space  of palms  these were of all ages but mostly at that age  when the branches arch from the ground level range  themselves with leaves exquisitely green  the whole  interspace was overgrown with convolvulus purple yellow and  white often as deep as to my waist in which i floundered  aimlessly  the very mountain was invisible from here  the  rain came and went now in sunlit april showers now with the  proper tramp and rattle of the tropics  all this while i met  no sight or sound of man except the voice which was now  silent and a damned pigfence that headed me off at every  corner  do you know barbed wire  think of a fence of it on  rotten posts and you barefoot  but i crossed it at last  with my heart in my mouth and no harm done  thence at last  to cs no c  next place i came to was in the zone of  woods  they offered me a buggy and set a black boy to wash  my legs and feet  washum legs belong that fellow whiteman  was the command  so at last i ran down my son of a gun in  the hotel sober and with no story to tell penitent i  think  home by buggy and my poor feet up three miles of  root boulder gravel and liquid mud slipping back at every  step   sunday sept 4th   hope you will be able to read a word of the last no joke  writing by a bad lantern with a groggy hand and your glasses  mislaid  not that the hand is not better as you see by the  absence of the amanuensis hitherto  mail came friday and a  communication from yourself much more decent than usual for  which i thank you  glad the wrecker should so hum but lord  what fools these mortals be  so far yesterday the citation being wrung from me by  remembrance of many reviews  i have now received all falesa  and my admiration for that tale rises i believe it is in  some ways my best work i am pretty sure at least i have  never done anything better than wiltshire   monday 13th september 1892   on wednesday the spinsters of apia gave a ball to a select  crowd  fanny belle lloyd and i rode down met haggard by  the way and joined company with him  dinner with haggard  and thence to the ball  the chief justice appeared it was  immediately remarked and whispered from one to another that  he and i had the only red sashes in the room  and they were  both of the hue of blood sir blood  he shook hands with  myself and all the members of my family  then the cream  came and i found myself in the same set of a quadrille with  his honour  we dance here in apia a most fearful and  wonderful quadrille i dont know where the devil they fished  it from but it is rackety and prancing and embraceatory  beyond words perhaps it is best defined in haggards  expression of a gambado  when i and my great enemy found  ourselves involved in this gambol and crossing hands and  kicking up and being embraced almost in common by large and  quite respectable females we  or i  tried to preserve some  rags of dignity but not for long  the deuce of it is that  personally i love this man his eye speaks to me i am  pleased in his society  we exchanged a glance and then a  grin the man took me in his confidence and through the  remainder of that prance we pranced for each other  hard to  imagine any position more ridiculous a week before he had  been trying to rake up evidence against me by browbeating  and threatening a halfwhite interpreter that very morning i  had been writing most villainous attacks upon him for the  times and we meet and smile and  damn it  like each  other  i do my best to damn the man and drive him from these  islands but the weakness endures  i love him  this is a  thing i would despise in anybody else but he is so jolly  insidious and ingratiating  no sir i cant dislike him  but if i dont make hay of him it shall not be for want of  trying  yesterday we had two germans and a young american boy to  lunch and in the afternoon vailima was in a state of siege  ten white people on the front verandah at least as many  brown in the cook house and countless blacks to see the  black boy arrick  which reminds me arrick was sent friday was a week to the  german firm with a note and was not home on time  lloyd and  i were going bedward it was late with a bright moon  ah  poor dog you know no such moons as these  when home came  arrick with his head in a white bandage and his eyes shining   he had had a fight with other blacks malaita boys many  against one and one with a knife i knicked em down three  four he cried and had himself to be taken to the doctors  and bandaged  next day he could not work glory of battle  swelled too high in his threadpaper breast he had made a  onestringed harp for austin borrowed it came to fannys  room and sang warsongs and danced a war dance in honour of  his victory  and it appears by subsequent advices that it  was a serious victory enough four of his assailants went to  hospital and one is thought in danger  all vailima rejoiced  at this news  five more chapters of david 22 to 27 go to baxter  all  love affair seems pretty good to me  will it do for the  young person  i dont know since the beach i know nothing  except that men are fools and hypocrites and i know less of  them than i was fond enough to fancy    chapter xxii    thursday 15th september   my dear colvin  on tuesday we had our young adventurer  ready and fanny belle he and i set out about three of a  dark deadly hot and deeply unwholesome afternoon  belle  had the lad behind her i had a pint of champagne in either  pocket a parcel in my hands and as jack had a girth sore  and i rode without a girth i might be said to occupy a very  unstrategic position  on the way down a little dreary  beastly drizzle beginning to come out of the darkness fanny  put up an umbrella her horse bounded reared cannoned into  me cannoned into belle and the lad and bolted for home  it  really might and ought to have been an a1 catastrophe but  nothing happened beyond fannys nerves being a good deal  shattered of course she could not tell what had happened to  us until she got her horse mastered  next day haggard went off to the commission and left us in  charge of his house all our people came down in wreaths of  flowers we had a boat for them haggard had a flag in the  commission boat for us and when at last the steamer turned  up the young adventurer was carried on board in great style  with a new watch and chain and about three pound ten of  tips and five big baskets of fruit as freewill offerings to  the captain  captain morse had us all to lunch champagne  flowed so did compliments and i did the affable celebrity  lifesized  it made a great sendoff for the young  adventurer  as the boat drew off he was standing at the  head of the gangway supported by three handsome ladies  one  of them a real fullblown beauty madame green the singer   and looking very engaging himself between smiles and tears   not that he cried in public  my but we were a tired crowd  however it is always a  blessing to get home and this time it was a sort of wonder  to ourselves that we got back alive  casualties fannys  back jarred horse incident belle bad headache tears and  champagne self idiocy champagne fatigue lloyd ditto  ditto  as for the adventurer i believe he will have a  delightful voyage for his little start in life  but there is  always something touching in a mites first launch   date unknown   i am now well on with the third part of the debacle  the two  first i liked much the second completely knocking me so far  as it has gone this third part appears the ramblings of a  dull man who has forgotten what he has to say  he reminds me  of an mp  but sedan was really great and i will pick no  holes  the batteries under fire the redcross folk the  county charge  perhaps above all major bouroche and the  operations all beyond discussion and every word about the  emperor splendid   september 30th   david balfour done and its author along with it or nearly  so  strange to think of even our doctor here repeating his  nonsense about debilitating climate  why the work i have  been doing the last twelve months in one continuous spate  mostly with annoying interruptions and without any collapse  to mention would be incredible in norway  but i have broken  down now and will do nothing as long as i possibly can   with david balfour i am very well pleased in fact these  labours of the last year  i mean falesa and d b not  samoa of course  seem to me to be nearer what i mean than  anything i have ever done nearer what i mean by fiction the  nearest thing before was kidnapped  i am not forgetting the  master of ballantrae but that lacked all pleasurableness  and hence was imperfect in essence  so you see if i am a  little tired i do not repent  the third part of the debacle may be all very fine but i  cannot read it  it suffers from impaired vitality and  uncertain aim two deadly sicknesses  vital  thats what i  am at first wholly vital with a buoyancy of life  then  lyrical if it may be and picturesque always with an epic  value of scenes so that the figures remain in the minds eye  for ever   october 8th   suppose you sent us some of the catalogues of the parties  what vends statutes  i dont want colossal herculeses but  about quarter size and less  if the catalogues were  illustrated it would probably be found a help to weak  memories  these may be found to alleviate spare moments  when we sometimes amuse ourselves by thinking how fine we  shall make the palace if we do not go pop  perhaps in the  same way it might amuse you to send us any pattern of wall  paper that might strike you as cheap pretty and suitable for  a room in a hot and extremely bright climate  it should be  borne in mind that our climate can be extremely dark too   our sittingroom is to be in varnished wood  the room i have  particularly in mind is a sort of bed and sittingroom  pretty large lit on three sides and the colour in favour of  its proprietor at present is a topazy yellow  but then with  what colour to relieve it  for a little workroom of my own  at the back  i should rather like to see some patterns of  unglossy  well ill be hanged if i can describe this red   its not turkish and its not roman and its not indian but  it seems to partake of the two last and yet it cant be  either of them because it ought to be able to go with  vermilion  ah what a tangled web we weave  anyway with  what brains you have left choose me and send me some  many   patterns of this exact shade  a few days ago it was haggards birthday and we had him and  his cousin to dinner  bless me if i ever told you of his  cousin  he is here anyway and a fine pleasing specimen  so that we have concluded after our own happy experience  that the climate of samoa must be favourable to cousins   then we went out on the verandah in a lovely moonlight  drinking port hearing the cousin play and sing till  presently we were informed that our boys had got up a siva in  lafaeles house to which we were invited  it was entirely  their own idea  the house you must understand is onehalf  floored and onehalf bare earth and the dais stands a  little over knee high above the level of the soil  the dais  was the stage with three footlights  we audience sat on  mats on the floor and the cook and three of our workboys  sometimes assisted by our two ladies took their places  behind the footlights and began a topical vailima song  the  burden was of course that of a samoan popular song about a  white man who objects to all that he sees in samoa  and  there was of course a special verse for each one of the party   lloyd was called the dancing man practically the chiefs  handsome son of vailima he was also in his character i  suppose of overseer compared to a policeman  belle had that  day been the almoner in a semicomic distribution of wedding  rings and thimbles bought cheap at an auction to the whole  plantation company fitting a ring on every mans finger and  a ring and a thimble on both the womens  this was very much  in character with her native name teuila the adorner of the  ugly  so of course this was the point of her verse and at a  given moment all the performers displayed the rings upon  their fingers  pelema the cousin  our cousin was  described as watching from the house and whenever he saw any  boy not doing anything running and doing it himself   fannys verse was less intelligible but it was accompanied  in the dance with a pantomime of terror wellfitted to call  up her haunting indefatigable and diminutive presence in a  blue gown    chapter xxiii    vailima october 28th 1892   my dear colvin  this is very late to begin the monthly  budget but i have a good excuse this time for i have had a  very annoying fever with symptoms of sore arm and in the  midst of it a very annoying piece of business which suffered  no delay or idleness    the consequence of all this was  that my fever got very much worse and your letter has not  been hitherto written  but my dear fellow do compare these  little larky fevers with the fine healthy prostrating colds  of the dear old dead days at home  here was i in the middle  of a pretty bad one and i was able to put it in my pocket  and go down day after day and attend to and put my strength  into this beastly business  do you see me doing that with a  catarrh  and if i had done so what would have been the  result  last night about four oclock belle and i set off to apia  whither my mother had preceded us  she was at the mission  we went to haggards  there we had to wait the most  unconscionable time for dinner  i do not wish to speak  lightly of the amanuensis who is unavoidably present but i  may at least say for myself that i was as cross as two  sticks  dinner came at last we had the tinned soup which is  usually the piece de resistance in the halls of haggard and  we pitched into it  followed an excellent salad of tomatoes  and crayfish a good indian curry a tender joint of beef a  dish of pigeons a pudding cheese and coffee  i was so  overeaten after this hunger and burst that i could  scarcely move and it was my sad fate that night in the  character of the local author to eloquute before the public   mr stevenson will read a selection from his own works  a  degrading picture  i had determined to read them the account  of the hurricane i do not know if i told you that my book  has never turned up here or rather only one copy has and  that in the unfriendly hands of   it has therefore only  been seen by enemies and this combination of mystery and  evil report has been greatly envenomed by some illjudged  newspaper articles from the states  altogether this specimen  was listened to with a good deal of uncomfortable expectation  on the part of the germans and when it was over was  applauded with unmistakable relief  the public hall where  these revels came off seems to be unlucky for me i never go  there but to some stonebreaking job  last time it was the  public meeting of which i must have written you this time it  was this uneasy but not on the whole unsuccessful experiment   belle my mother and i rode home about midnight in a fine  display of lightning and witchfires  my mother is absent  so that i may dare to say that she struck me as voluble  the  amanuensis did not strike me the same way she was probably  thinking but it was really rather a weird business and i  saw what i have never seen before the witchfires gathered  into little bright blue points almost as bright as a night light   saturday   this is the day that should bring your letter it is gray and  cloudy and windless thunder rolls in the mountain it is a  quarter past six and i am alone sir alone in this  workmans house belle and lloyd having been down all  yesterday to meet the steamer they were scarce gone with  most of the horses and all the saddles than there began a  perfect picnic of the sick and maim iopu with a bad foot  faauma with a bad shoulder fanny with yellow spots  it was  at first proposed to carry all these to the doctor  particularly faauma whose shoulder bore an appearance of  erysipelas that sent the amateur below  no horses no  saddle  now i had my horse and i could borrow lafaeles  saddle and if i went alone i could do a job that had long  been waiting and that was to interview the doctor on another  matter  off i set in a hazy moonlight night windless like  today the thunder rolling in the mountain as today in  the still groves these little mushroom lamps glowing blue  and steady singly or in pairs  well i had my interview  said everything as i had meant and with just the result i  hoped for  the doctor and i drank beer together and  discussed german literature until nine and we parted the  best of friends  i got home to a silent house of sleepers  only fanny awaiting me we talked awhile in whispers on the  interview then i got a lantern and went across to the  workmans house now empty and silent myself sole occupant   so to bed prodigious tired but mighty content with my  nights work and today with a headache and a chill have  written you this page while my new novel waits  of this i  will tell you nothing except the various names under  consideration  first it ought to be called  but of course  that is impossible    braxfield then it is to be called either weir of hermiston the lordjustice clerk the two kirsties of the cauldstaneslap or four black brothers  characters  adam weir lordjustice clerk called lord hermiston archie his son aunt kirstie elliott his housekeeper at hermiston elliott of the cauldstaneslap her brother kirstie elliott his daughter jim     gib     hob      his sons         dandie  patrick innes a young advocate the lordjustice general  scene about hermiston in the lammermuirs and in edinburgh   temp 1812 so you see you are to have another holiday from  copra  the rain begins softly on the iron roof and i will  do the reverse and  dry up   sunday   yours with the diplomatic private opinion received  it is  just what i should have supposed  ca mest bien egal  the  name is to be  the lordjustice clerk  none others are genuine  unless it be  lordjustice clerk hermiston   nov 2nd   on saturday we expected captain morse of the alameda to come  up to lunch and on friday with genuine south sea hospitality  had a pig killed  on the saturday morning no pig  some of  the boys seemed to give a doubtful account of themselves our  next neighbour below in the wood is a bad fellow and very  intimate with some of our boys for whom his confounded house  is like a flypaper for flies  to add to all this there was  on the saturday a great public presentation of food to the  king and parliament men an occasion on which it is almost  dignified for a samoan to steal anything and entirely  dignified for him to steal a pig  the amanuensis went to the talolo as it is called and saw  something so very pleasing she begs to interrupt the letter  to tell it  the different villagers came in in bands  led  by the maid of the village followed by the young warriors   it was a very fine sight for some three thousand people are  said to have assembled  the men wore nothing but magnificent  headdresses and a bunch of leaves and were oiled and  glistening in the sunlight  one band had no maid but was led  by a tiny child of about five  a serious little creature  clad in a ribbon of grass and a fine headdress who skipped  with elaborate leaps in front of the warriors like a little  kid leading a band of lions  am  the am being done i go on again  all this made it very  possible that even if none of our boys had stolen the pig  some of them might know the thief  besides the theft as it  was a theft of meat prepared for a guest had something of  the nature of an insult and my face in native phrase  was ashamed  accordingly we determined to hold a bed of  justice  it was done last night after dinner  i sat at the  head of the table graham on my right hand henry simele at  my left lloyd behind him  the house company sat on the  floor around the walls  twelve all told  i am described as  looking as like braxfield as i could manage with my  appearance graham who is of a severe countenance looked  like rhadamanthus lloyd was hideous to the view and simele  had all the fine solemnity of a samoan chief  the  proceedings opened by my delivering a samoan prayer which  may be translated thus  our god look down upon us and  shine into our hearts  help us to be far from falsehood so  that each one of us may stand before thy face in his  integrity  then beginning with simele every one came up  to the table laid his hand on the bible and repeated clause  by clause after me the following oath  i fear it may sound  even comic in english but it is a very pretty piece of  samoan and struck direct at the most lively superstitions of  the race  this is the holy bible here that i am touching   behold me o god  if i know who it was that took away the  pig or the place to which it was taken or have heard  anything relating to it and shall not declare the same  be  made an end of by god this life of mine  they all took it  with so much seriousness and firmness that as graham said  if they were not innocent they would make invaluable  witnesses  i was so far impressed by their bearing that i  went no further and the funny and yet strangely solemn scene  came to an end   sunday no 6th   here is a long story to go back upon and i wonder if i have  either time or patience for the task  wednesday i had a great idea of matchmaking and proposed to  henry that faale would make a good wife for him  i wish i  had put this down when it was fresher in my mind it was so  interesting an interview  my gentleman would not tell if i  were on or not  i do not know yet i will tell you next  week  may i tell the sister of my father  no better not  tell her when it is done  but will not your family be  angry if you marry without asking them  my village  what  does my village want  mats  i said i thought the girl  would grow up to have a great deal of sense and my gentleman  flew out upon me she had sense now he said  thursday we were startled by the note of guns and presently  after heard it was an english war ship  graham and i set off  at once and as soon as we met any townsfolk they began  crying to me that i was to be arrested  it was the vossische  zeitung article which had been quoted in a paper  went on  board and saw captain bourke he did not even know  not even  guess  why he was here having been sent off by cablegram  from auckland  it is hoped the same ship that takes this off  europewards may bring his orders and our news  but which is  it to be  heads or tails  if it is to be german i hope  they will deport me i should prefer it so i do not think  that i could bear a german officialdom and should probably  have to leave sponte mea which is only less picturesque and  more expensive   8th   mail day  all well not yet put in prison whatever may be  in store for me  no time even to sign this lame letter    chapter xxiv    dec 1st   my dear colvin  another grimy little odd and end of paper  for which you shall be this month repaid in kind and serve  you jolly well right    the new house is roofed it will  be a braw house and what is better i have my yearly bill  in and i find i can pay for it  for all which mercies etc   i must have made close on 4000 pounds this year all told  but what is not so pleasant i seem to have come near to  spending them  i have been in great alarm with this new  house on the cards all summer and came very near to taking  in sail but i live here so entirely on credit that i  determined to hang on   dec 1st   i was saying yesterday that my life was strange and did not  think how well i spoke  yesterday evening i was briefed to  defend a political prisoner before the deputy commissioner   what do you think of that for a vicissitude   dec 3rd   now for a confession  when i heard you and cassells had  decided to print the bottle imp along with falesa i was too  much disappointed to answer  the bottle imp was the piece de  resistance for my volume island nights entertainments   however that volume might have never got done and i send  you two others in case they should be in time  first have the beach of falesa  then a fresh false title island nights entertainments and  then  the bottle imp a cue from an old melodrama  the isle of voices  the waif woman a cue from a saga  of course these two others are not up to the mark of the  bottle imp but they each have a certain merit and they fit  in style  by saying a cue from an old melodrama after the  b i you can get rid of my note  if this is in time it  will be splendid and will make quite a volume  should you and cassells prefer you can call the whole volume  i n e  though the beach of falesa is the child of a quite  different inspiration  they all have a queer realism even  the most extravagant even the isle of voices the manners  are exact  should they come too late have them typewritten and return  to me here the typewritten copies   sunday dec 4th   3rd start  but now more humbly and with the aid of an  amanuensis  first one word about page 2  my wife protests  against the waifwoman and i am instructed to report the same  to you      dec 5th   a horrid alarm rises that our october mail was burned  crossing the plains  if so you lost a beautiful long letter   i am sure it was beautiful though i remember nothing about  it  and i must say i think it serves you properly well   that i should continue writing to you at such length is  simply a vicious habit for which i blush  at the same time  please communicate at once with charles baxter whether you  have or have not received a letter posted here oct 12th as  he is going to cable me the fate of my mail  now to conclude my news  the german firm have taken my book  like angels and the result is that lloyd and i were down  there at dinner on saturday where we partook of fifteen  several dishes and eight distinct forms of intoxicating  drink  to the credit of germany i must say there was not a  shadow of a headache the next morning  i seem to have done  as well as my neighbours for i hear one of the clerks  expressed the next morning a gratified surprise that mr  stevenson stood his drink so well  it is a strange thing  that any race can still find joy in such athletic exercises   i may remark in passing that the mail is due and you have had  far more than you deserve r l s    chapter xxv    january 1893   my dear colvin  you are properly paid at last and it is  like you will have but a shadow of a letter  i have been  pretty thoroughly out of kilter first a fever that would  neither come on nor go off then acute dyspepsia in the  weakening grasp of which i get wandering between the waking  state and one of nightmare  why the devil does no one send  me atalanta  and why are there no proofs of d balfour   sure i should have had the whole at least the half of them  by now and it would be all for the advantage of the  atalantans  i have written to cassell  co matter of  falesa you will please arrange with him meaning you   what he may decide i shall abide  so consider your hand  free and act for me without fear or favour  i am greatly  pleased with the illustrations  it is very strange to a  southseayer to see hawaiian women dressed like samoans but  i guess thats all one to you in middlesex  its about the  same as if london city men were shown going to the stock  exchange as pifferari but no matter none will sleep worse  for it  i have accepted cassells proposal as an amendment  to one of mine that d b is to be brought out first under  the title catriona without pictures and when the hour  strikes kidnapped and catriona are to form vols i and ii  of the heavily illustrated adventures of david balfour at  7s 6d each sold separately  s letter was vastly sly and dry and shy  i am not afraid  now  two attempts have been made both have failed and i  imagine these failures strengthen me  above all this is true  of the last where my weak point was attempted  on every  other i am strong  only force can dislodge me for public  opinion is wholly on my side  all races and degrees are  united in heartfelt opposition to the men of mulinuu  the  news of the fighting was of no concern to mortal man it was  made much of because men love talk of battles and because  the government pray god daily for some scandal not their own  but it was only a brisk episode in a clan fight which has  grown apparently endemic in the west of tutuila  at the best  it was a twopenny affair and never occupied my mind five  minutes  i am so weary of reports that are without foundation and  threats that go without fulfilment and so much occupied  besides by the raging troubles of my own wame that i have  been very slack on politics as i have been in literature   with incredible labour i have rewritten the first chapter of  the justice clerk it took me about ten days and requires  another athletic dressing after all  and that is my story  for the month  the rest is grunting and grutching  consideranda for the beach  i whether to add one or both the tales i sent you ii whether to call the whole volume island nights  entertainments iii whether having waited so long it would not be better to  give me another mail in case i could add another member to  the volume and a little better justify the name  if i possibly can draw up another story i will  what  annoyed me about the use of the bottle imp was that i had  always meant it for the centrepiece of a volume of marchen  which i was slowly to elaborate  you always had an idea that  i depreciated the b i i cant think wherefore i always  particularly liked it  one of my best works and ill to  equal and that was why i loved to keep it in portfolio till  i had time to grow up to some other fruit of the same venue   however that is disposed of now and we must just do the  best we can  i am not aware that there is anything to add the weather is  hellish waterspouts mists chills the foul fiends own  weather following on a week of expurgated heaven so it goes  at this bewildering season  i write in the upper floor of my  new house of which i will send you some day a plan to  measure  tis an elegant structure surely and the proid of  me oi  was asked to pay for it just now and genteelly  refused and then agreed in view of general goodwill to  pay a half of what is still due   24th january 1893   this ought to have gone last mail and was forgotten  my best  excuse is that i was engaged in starting an influenza to  which class of exploit our household has been since then  entirely dedicated  we had eight cases one of them very  bad and one  mine  complicated with my old friend bluidy  jack  luckily neither fanny lloyd or belle took the  confounded thing and they were able to run the household and  nurse the sick to admiration  some of our boys behaved like real trumps  perhaps the  prettiest performance was that of our excellent henry simele  or as we sometimes call him davy balfour  henry i maun  premeese is a chief the humblest samoan recoils from  emptying slops as you would from cheating at cards now the  last nights of our bad time when we had seven down together  it was enough to have made anybody laugh or cry to see henry  going the rounds with a slopbucket and going inside the  mosquito net of each of the sick protestant and catholic  alike to pray with them  i must tell you that in my sickness i had a huge alleviation  and began a new story  this i am writing by dictation and  really think it is an art i can manage to acquire  the  relief is beyond description it is just like a schooltreat  to me and the amanuensis bears up extraordinar  the story  is to be called st ives i give you your choice whether or  not it should bear the subtitle experiences of a french  prisoner in england  we were just getting on splendidly  with it when this cursed mail arrived and requires to be  attended to  it looks to me very like as if st ives would  be ready before any of the others but you know me and how  impossible it is i should predict  the amanuensis has her  head quite turned and believes herself to be the author of  this novel and is to some extent  and as the creature   has not been wholly useless in the matter i told you so   am i propose to foster her vanity by a little  commemoration gift  the name of the hero is anne de st yves   he englishes his name to st ives during his escape  it is  my idea to get a ring made which shall either represent anne  or a s y a of course would be amethyst and s sapphire  which is my favourite stone anyway and was my fathers before  me  but what would the exslade professor do about the  letter y  or suppose he took the other version how would he  meet the case the two ns  these things are beyond my  knowledge which it would perhaps be more descriptive to call  ignorance  but i place the matter in the meanwhile under  your consideration and beg to hear your views  i shall tell  you on some other occasion and when the am is out of  hearing how very much i propose to invest in this  testimonial but i may as well inform you at once that i  intend it to be cheap sir damned cheap  my idea of running  amanuenses is by praise not pudding flattery and not coins   i shall send you when the time is ripe a ring to measure by  to resume our sad tale  after the other seven were almost  wholly recovered henry lay down to influenza on his own  account  he is but just better and it looks as though fanny  were about to bring up the rear  as for me i am all right  though i was reduced to dictating anne in the deaf and dumb  alphabet which i think you will admit is a comble  politics leave me extraordinary cold  it seems that so much  of my purpose has come off and cedarcrantz and pilsach are  sacked  the rest of it has all gone to water  the triple headed ass at home in his plenitude of ignorance prefers to  collect the taxes and scatter the mataafas by force or the  threat of force  it may succeed and i suppose it will  it  is none the less for that expensive harsh unpopular and  unsettling  i am young enough to have been annoyed and  altogether eject and renegate the whole idea of political  affairs  success in that field appears to be the  organisation of failure enlivened with defamation of  character and much as i love pickles and hot water in your  true phrase i shall take my pickles in future from crosse  and blackwell and my hot water with a dose of good glenlivat  do not bother at all about the wallpapers  we have had the  whole of our new house varnished and it looks beautiful  i  wish you could see the hall poor room it had to begin life  as an infirmary during our recent visitation but it is  really a handsome comely place and when we get the  furniture and the pictures and what is so very much more  decorative the picture frames will look sublime   jan 30th   i have written to charles asking for rowlandsons syntax and  dance of death out of our house and begging for anything  about fashions and manners fashions particularly for 1814   can you help  both the justice clerk and st ives fall in  that fated year  indeed i got into st ives while going over  the annual register for the other  there is a kind of fancy  list of chaps of st ives  it begins in edinburgh castle  i story of a lion rampant that was a toy he had made and  given to a girl visitor  ii  story of a pair of scissors   iii st ives receives a bundle of money  iv st ives is

anything in my way  i want in particular to know  about them and the napoleonic functionaries and officers and  to get the colour and some vital details of the business of  exchange of departments from one side to the other  ten  chapters are drafted and viii recopied by me but will  want another dressing for luck  it is merely a story of  adventure rambling along but that is perhaps the guard that  sets my genius best as alan might have said  i wish i  could feel as easy about the other  but there all novels  are a heavy burthen while they are doing and a sensible  disappointment when they are done  for gods sake let me have a copy of the new german samoa  white book  r l s    chapter xxvi    at sea ss  mariposa feb 19th 93   my dear colvin  you will see from this heading that i am  not dead yet nor likely to be  i was pretty considerably out  of sorts and that is indeed one reason why fanny belle and  i have started out for a months lark  to be quite exact i  think it will be about five weeks before we get home  we  shall stay between two and three in sydney  already though  we only sailed yesterday i am feeling as fit as a fiddle   fanny ate a whole fowl for breakfast to say nothing of a  tower of hot cakes  belle and i floored another hen betwixt  the pair of us and i shall be no sooner done with the  present amanuensing racket than i shall put myself outside a  pint of guinness  if you think this looks like dying of  consumption in apia i can only say i differ from you  in the  matter of david i have never yet received my proofs at all  but shall certainly wait for your suggestions  certainly  chaps 17 to 20 are the hitch and i confess i hurried over  them with both wings spread  this is doubtless what you  complain of  indeed i placed my single reliance on miss  grant  if she couldnt ferry me over i felt i had to stay  there  about island nights entertainments all you say is highly  satisfactory  go in and win  the extracts from the times i really cannot trust myself to  comment upon  they were infernally satisfactory so and  perhaps still more so was a letter i had at the same time  from lord pembroke  if i have time as i go through auckland  i am going to see sir george grey  now i really think thats all the business  i have been  rather sick and have had two small hemorrhages but the  second i believe to have been accidental  no good denying  that this annoys because it do  however you must expect  influenza to leave some harm and my spirits appetite peace  on earth and goodwill to men are all on a rising market   during the last week the amanuensis was otherwise engaged  whereupon i took up pitched into and about one half  demolished another tale once intended to be called the pearl  fisher but now razeed and called the schooner farralone  we  had a capital start the steamer coming in at sunrise and  just giving us time to get our letters ere she sailed again   the manager of the german firm o strange changed days  danced attendance upon us all morning his boat conveyed us  to and from the steamer   feb 21st   all continues well  amanuensis bowled over for a day but  afoot again and jolly fanny enormously bettered by the  voyage i have been as jolly as a sandboy as usual at sea   the amanuensis sits opposite to me writing to her offspring   fanny is on deck  i have just supplied her with the canadian  pacific agent and so left her in good hands  you should  hear me at table with the ulster purser and a little punning  microscopist called davis  belle does some kind of abstruse  boswellising after the first meal having gauged the kind of  jests that would pay here i observed boswell is barred  during this cruise   23rd   we approach auckland and i must close my mail  all goes well  with the trio  both the ladies are hanging round a beau   the same  that i unearthed for them i am general provider  and especially great in the beaux business  i corrected some  proofs for fanny yesterday afternoon fell asleep over them  in the saloon  and the whole ship seems to have been down  beholding me  after i woke up had a hot bath a whiskey  punch and a cigarette and went to bed and to sleep too at  830 a recrudescence of vailima hours  awoke today and  had to go to the saloon clock for the hour  no sign of dawn   all heaven grey rainy fog  have just had breakfast  written up one letter register and close this    chapter xxvii    bad pen bad ink bad light bad blottingpaper  s s mariposa at sea apia due by daybreak tomorrow 9 pm   my dear colvin  have had an amusing but tragic holiday  from which we return in disarray  fanny quite sick but i  think slowly and steadily mending belle in a terrific state  of dentistry troubles which now seem calmed and myself with  a succession of gentle colds out of which i at last succeeded  in cooking up a fine pleurisy  by stopping and stewing in a  perfectly airless stateroom i seem to have got rid of the  pleurisy  poor fanny had very little fun of her visit  having been most of the time on a diet of maltine and slops   and this while the rest of us were rioting on oysters and  mushrooms  belles only devil in the hedge was the dentist   as for me i was entertained at the general assembly of the  presbyterian church likewise at a sort of artistic club  made speeches at both and may therefore be said to have  been like saint paul all things to all men  i have an  account of the latter racket which i meant to have enclosed  in this    had some splendid photos taken likewise a  medallion by a french sculptor met graham who returned with  us as far as auckland  have seen a good deal too of sir  george grey what a wonderful old historic figure to be  walking on your arm and recalling ancient events and  instances  it makes a man small and yet the extent to which  he approved what i had done  or rather have tried to do   encouraged me  sir george is an expert at least he knows  these races he is not a small employe with an inkpot and a  whittaker  take it for all in all it was huge fun even fanny had some  lively sport at the beginning belle and i all through  we  got fanny a dress on the sly gaudy black velvet and duchesse  lace  and alas she was only able to wear it once  but  well hope to see more of it at samoa it really is lovely   both dames are royally outfitted in silk stockings etc  we  return as from a raid with our spoils and our wounded  i  am now very dandy i announced two years ago that i should  change  slovenly youth all right  not slovenly age  so  really now i am pretty spruce always a white shirt white  necktie fresh shave silk socks o a great sight  no more  possible r l s    chapter xxviii    april 1893   1 slip 3  davie would be attracted into a similar dialect  as he is later  eg with doig chapter xix  this is truly  scottish  4 to lightly correct to lightly is a good regular scots  verb  15 see allan ramsays works  15 16 ay and that is one of the pigments with which i am  trying to draw the character of prestongrange  tis a most  curious thing to render that kind insignificant mask  to  make anything precise is to risk my effect  and till the day  he died davie was never sure of what p was after  not only  so very often p didnt know himself  there was an element  of mere liking for davie there was an element of being  determined in case of accidents to keep well with him  he  hoped his barbara would bring him to her feet besides and  make him manageable  that was why he sent him to hope park  with them  but davie cannot know i give you the inside of  davie and my method condemns me to give only the outside  both of prestongrange and his policy   ill give my mind to the technicalities  yet to me they  seem a part of the story which is historical after all   i think they wanted alan to escape  but when or where to  say so  i will try   20 dean  ill try and make that plainer  chap xiii i fear it has to go without blows  if i could  get the pair  no cant be   xiv  all right will abridge   xv  id have to put a note to every word and he who cant  read scots can never enjoy tod lapraik   xvii  quite right  i can make this plainer and will   xviii  i know but i have to hurry here this is the  broken back of my story some business briefly transacted i  am leaping for barbaras apronstrings  slip 57  quite right again i shall make it plain  chap xx  i shall make all these points clear  about lady  prestongrange not lady grant only miss grant my dear  though lady prestongrange quoth the dominie i am taken with  your idea of her death and have a good mind to substitute a  featureless aunt  slip 78  i dont see how to lessen this effect  there is  really not much said of it and i know catriona did it  but  ill try   89  i know  this is an old puzzle of mine  you see cs  dialect is not wholly a bed of roses  if only i knew the  gaelic  well ill try for another expression  the end  i shall try to work it over  james was at dunkirk  ordering posthorses for his own retreat  catriona did have  her suspicions aroused by the letter and careless  gentleman i told you so  or she did at least  yes the  blood money i am bothered about the portmanteau it is the  presence of catriona that bothers me the rape of the  pockmantie is historic     to me i own it seems in the proof a very pretty piece of  workmanship  david himself i refuse to discuss he is  the  lord advocate i think a strong sketch of a very difficult  character james more sufficient and the two girls very  pleasing creatures  but o dear me i came near losing my  heart to barbara  i am not quite so constant as david and  even he  well he didnt know it anyway  tod lapraik is a  piece of living scots if i had never writ anything but that  and thrawn janet still id have been a writer  the defects  of db are inherent i fear  but on the whole i am far  indeed from being displeased with the tailie  they want more  alan  well they cant get it  i found my fame much grown on this return to civilisation   digito monstrari is a new experience people all looked at me  in the streets in sydney and it was very queer  here of  course i am only the white chief in the great house to the  natives and to the whites either an ally or a foe  it is a  much healthier state of matters  if i lived in an atmosphere  of adulation i should end by kicking against the pricks  o  my beautiful forest o my beautiful shining windy house  what a joy it was to behold them again  no chance to take  myself too seriously here  the difficulty of the end is the mass of matter to be  attended to and the small time left to transact it in  i  mean from alans danger of arrest  but i have just seen my  way out i do believe   easter sunday   i have now got as far as slip 28 and finished the chapter of  the law technicalities  well these seemed to me always of  the essence of the story which is the story of a cause  celebre moreover they are the justification of my  inventions if these men went so far granting davie sprung  on them would they not have gone so much further  but of  course i knew they were a difficulty determined to carry  them through in a conversation approached this it seems  with cowardly anxiety and filled it with gabble sir  gabble  i have left all my facts but have removed 42 lines   i should not wonder but what ill end by rewriting it  it  is not the technicalities that shocked you it was my bad  art  it is very strange that x should be so good a chapter  and ix and xi so uncompromisingly bad  it looks as if xi  also would have to be reformed  if x had not cheered me  up i should be in doleful dumps but x is alive anyway and  life is all in all   thursday april 5th   well theres no disguise possible fanny is not well and we  are miserably anxious      friday 7th   i am thankful to say the new medicine relieved her at once   a crape has been removed from the day for all of us  to make  things better the morning is ah such a morning as you have  never seen heaven upon earth for sweetness freshness depth  upon depth of unimaginable colour and a huge silence broken  at this moment only by the faraway murmur of the pacific and  the rich piping of a single bird  you cant conceive what a  relief this is it seems a new world  she has such  extraordinary recuperative power that i do hope for the best   i am as tired as man can be  this is a great trial to a  family and i thank god it seems as if ours was going to bear  it well  and o if it only lets up it will be but a  pleasant memory  we are all seedy bar lloyd fanny as per  above self nearly extinct belle utterly overworked and bad  toothache cook down with a bad foot butler prostrate with  a bad leg  eh what a faimly   sunday   grey heaven raining torrents of rain occasional thunder and  lightning  everything to dispirit but my invalids are  really on the mend  the rain roars like the sea in the  sound of it there is a strange and ominous suggestion of an  approaching tramp something nameless and measureless seems  to draw near and strikes me cold and yet is welcome  i lie  quiet in bed today and think of the universe with a good  deal of equanimity  i have at this moment but the one  objection to it the fracas with which it proceeds  i do not  love noise i am like my grandfather in that and so many  years in these still islands has ingrained the sentiment  perhaps  here are no trains only men pacing barefoot  no  carts or carriages at worst the rattle of a horses shoes  among the rocks  beautiful silence and so soon as this  robustious rain takes off i am to drink of it again by  oceanfuls   april 16th   several pages of this letter destroyed as beneath scorn the  wailings of a crushed worm matter in which neither you nor i  can take stock  fanny is distinctly better i believe all  right now i too am mending though i have suffered from  crushed wormery which is not good for the body and  damnation to the soul  i feel tonight a baseless anxiety to  write a lovely poem a propos des bottes de ma grandmere  i  see i am idiotic  ill try the poem   17th   the poem did not get beyond plovers and lovers  i am still  however harassed by the unauthentic muse if i cared to  encourage her  but i have not the time and anyway we are at  the vernal equinox  it is funny enough but my pottering  verses are usually made like the godgifted organ voices  at the autumnal and this seems to hold at the antipodes   there is here some odd secret of nature  i cannot speak of  politics we wait and wonder  it seems this is partly a  guess ide wont take the c j ship unless the islands are  disarmed and that england hesitates and holds off  by my  own idea strongly corroborated by sir george i am writing  no more letters  but i have put as many irons in against  this folly of the disarming as i could manage  it did not  reach my ears till nearly too late  what a risk to take   what an expense to incur  and for how poor a gain  apart  from the treachery of it  my dear fellow politics is a vile  and a bungling business  i used to think meanly of the  plumber but how he shines beside the politician   thursday   a general steady advance fanny really quite chipper and  jolly  self on the rapid mend and with my eye on forests  that are to fall  and my finger on the axe which wants  stoning   saturday 22   still all for the best but i am having a heartbreaking time  over david  i have nearly all corrected  but have to  consider the heather on fire the wood by silvermills and  the last chapter  they all seem to me off colour and i am  not fit to better them yet  no proof has been sent of the  title contents or dedication    chapter xxix    25th april   my dear colvin  today early i sent down to maben  secretary of state an offer to bring up people from malie  keep them in my house and bring them down day by day for so  long as the negotiation should last  i have a favourable  answer so far  this i would not have tried had not old sir  george grey put me on my mettle never despair was his  word and i am one of the few people who have lived long  enough to see how true that is  well thereupon i plunged  in and the thing may do me great harm but yet i do not  think so  for i think jealousy will prevent the trial being  made  and at any rate it is another chance for this  distracted archipelago of children sat upon by a clique of  fools  if by the gift of god i can do  i am allowed to  try to do  and succeed but no the prospect is too bright  to be entertained  today we had a ride down to tanugamanono and then by the  new wood paths  one led us to a beautiful clearing with  four native houses taro yams and the like excellently  planted and old folau  the samoan jew  sitting and  whistling there in his newfound and welldeserved well being  it was a good sight to see a samoan thus before the  world  further up on our way home we saw the world clear  and the wide die of the shadow lying broad we came but a  little further and found in the borders of the bush a  banyan  it must have been 150 feet in height the trunk and  its acolytes occupied a great space above that in the  peaks of the branches quite a forest of ferns and orchids  were set and over all again the huge spread of the boughs  rose against the bright west and sent their shadow miles to  the eastward  i have not often seen anything more satisfying  than this vast vegetable   sunday   a heavenly day again the world all dead silence save when  from far down below us in the woods comes up the crepitation  of the little wooden drum that beats to church  scarce a  leaf stirs only now and again a great cool gush of air that  makes my papers fly and is gone  the king of samoa has  refused my intercession between him and mataafa and i do not  deny this is a good riddance to me of a difficult business  in which i might very well have failed  what else is to be  done for these silly folks   may 12th   and this is where i had got to before the mail arrives with  i must say a real gentlemanly letter from yourself  sir  that is the sort of letter i want  now ill make my little  proposal  i will accept childs play and pans pipes then i  want pastoral the manse the islet leaving out if you like  all the prefacial matter and beginning at i then the  portrait of robert hunter beginning whether he was  originally big or little and ending fearless and gentle   so much for mem and portraits  beggars sections i and  ii random memories ii and lantern bearers im agreeable   these are my selections  i dont know about pulvis et umbra  either but must leave that to you  but just what you  please  about davie i elaborately wrote last time but still davie is  not done i am grinding singly at the ebb tide as we now  call the farallone the most of it will go this mail  about  the following let there be no mistake i will not write the  abstract of kidnapped write it who will i will not   boccaccio must have been a clever fellow to write both  argument and story i am not et je me recuse  we call it the ebb tide a trio and quartette but that  secondary name you may strike out if it seems dull to you   the book however falls in two halves when the fourth  character appears  i am on p 82 if you want to know and  expect to finish on i suppose 110 or so but it goes slowly  as you may judge from the fact that this three weeks past i  have only struggled from p 58 to p 82 twentyfour pages  et encore sure to be rewritten in twentyone days  this is  no prizetaker not much waverley novels about this    may 16th   i believe it will be ten chapters of the ebb tide that go to  you the whole thing should be completed in i fancy twelve  and the end will follow punctually next mail  it is my great  wish that this might get into the illustrated london news for  gordon browne to illustrate  for whom in case he should get  the job i give you a few notes  a purao is a tree giving  something like a fig with flowers  he will find some  photographs of an old marine curiosity shop in my collection  which may help him  attwaters settlement is to be entirely  overshadowed everywhere by tall palms see photographs of  fakarava the verandahs of the house are 12 ft wide  dont  let him forget the figure head for which i have a great use  in the last chapter  it stands just clear of the palms on  the crest of the beach at the head of the pier the flag staff not far off the pier he will understand is perhaps  three feet above high water not more at any price  the  sailors of the farallone are to be dressed like white sailors  of course  for other things i remit this excellent artist  to my photographs  i cant think what to say about the tale but it seems to me  to go off with a considerable bang in fact to be an  extraordinary work but whether popular  attwater is a no  end of a courageous attempt i think you will admit how far  successful is another affair  if my island aint a thing of  beauty ill be damned  please observe wiseman and wishart  for incidental grimness they strike me as in it  also  kindly observe the captain and adar i think that knocks  spots  in short as you see im a trifle vainglorious  but  o it has been such a grind  the devil himself would allow a  man to brag a little after such a crucifixion  and indeed  im only bragging for a change before i return to the darned  thing lying waiting for me on p 88 where i last broke down   i break down at every paragraph i may observe and lie here  and sweat till i can get one sentence wrung out after  another  strange doom after having worked so easily for so  long  did ever anybody see such a story of four characters   later 230   it may interest you to know that i am entirely tapu and live  apart in my chambers like a caged beast  lloyd has a bad  cold and graham and belle are getting it  accordingly i  dwell here without the light of any human countenance or  voice and strap away at the ebb tide until as now i can no  more  fanny can still come but is gone to glory now or to  her garden  page 88 is done and must be done over again to morrow and i confess myself exhausted  pity a man who cant  work on along when he has nothing else on earth to do  but i  have ordered jack and am going for a ride in the bush  presently to refresh the machine then back to a lonely  dinner and durance vile  i acquiesce in this hand of fate  for i think another cold just now would just about do for me   i have scarce yet recovered the two last   may 18th   my progress is crabwise and i fear only ix chapters will be  ready for the mail  i am on p 88 again and with half an  idea of going back again to 85  we shall see when we come to  read i used to regard reading as a pleasure in my old light  days  all the house are down with the influenza in a body  except fanny and me the influenza appears to become endemic  here but it has always been a scourge in the islands   witness the beginning of the ebb tide which was observed  long before the iffle had distinguished himself at home by  such napoleonic conquests  i am now of course quite a  recluse and it is very stale and there is no amanuensis to  carry me over my mail to which i shall have to devote many  hours that would have been more usefully devoted to the ebb  tide  for you know you can dictate at all hours of the day  and at any odd moment but to sit down and write with your  red right hand is a very different matter   may 20th   well i believe ive about finished the thing i mean as far  as the mail is to take it  chapter x is now in lloyds  hands for remarks and extends in its present form to p 93  incl  on the 12th of may i see by looking back i was on p  82 not for the first time so that i have made 11 pages in  nine livelong days  well up a high hill he heaved a huge  round stone  but this flaubert business must be resisted in  the premises  or is it the result of influenza  god forbid   fanny is down now and the last link that bound me to my  fellow men is severed  i sit up here and write and read  renans origines which is certainly devilish interesting i  read his nero yesterday it is very good o very good  but  he is quite a michelet the general views and such a piece  of character painting excellent but his method sheer  lunacy  you can see him take up the block which he had just  rejected and make of it the cornerstone a maddening way to  deal with authorities and the result so little like history  that one almost blames oneself for wasting time  but the  time is not wasted the conspectus is always good and the  blur that remains on the mind is probably just enough  i  have been enchanted with the unveiling of revelations  and  how picturesque that return of the false nero  the apostle  john is rather discredited  and to think how one had read  the thing so often and never understood the attacks upon st  paul  i remember when i was a child and we came to the four  beasts that were all over eyes the sickening terror with  which i was filled  if that was heaven what in the name of  davy jones and the aboriginal nightmare could hell be   take it for all in all lantechrist is worth reading  the  histoire disrael did not surprise me much i had read those  hebrew sources with more intelligence than the new testament  and was quite prepared to admire ahab and jezebel etc   indeed ahab has always been rather a hero of mine i mean  since the years of discretion   may 21st   and here i am back again on p 85 the last chapter demanding  an entire revision which accordingly it is to get  and  where my mail is to come in god knows  this forced  violent alembicated style is most abhorrent to me it cant  be helped the note was struck years ago on the janet nicoll  and has to be maintained somehow and i can only hope the  intrinsic horror and pathos and a kind of fierce glow of  colour there is to it and the surely remarkable wealth of  striking incident may guide our little shallop into port   if gordon browne is to get it he should see the brassey  photographs of papeete  but mind the three waifs were never  in the town only on the beach and in the calaboose  by  george but its a good thing to illustrate for a man like  that  fanny is all right again  false alarm  i was down  yesterday afternoon at paupata and heard much growling of  war and the delightful news that the c j and the president  are going to run away from mulinuu and take refuge in the  tivoli hotel   23rd  mail day   and lots of pleasures before me no doubt  among others the  attempt to extract an answer from  before mail time which  may succeed or may not  the ebb tide all but i take it fifteen pages is now in  your hands  possibly only about eleven pp  it is hard to  say  but there it is and you can do your best with it   personally i believe i would in this case make even a  sacrifice to get gordon browne and copious illustration  i  guess in ten days i shall have finished with it then i go  next to d balfour and get the proofs ready a nasty job for  me as you know  and then  well perhaps ill take a go at  the family history  i think that will be wise as i am so  much off work  and then i suppose weir of hermiston but  it may be anything  i am discontented with the ebb tide  naturally there seems such a veil of words over it and i  like more and more naked writing and yet sometimes one has a  longing for full colour and there comes the veil again  the  young chevalier is in very full colour and i fear it for  that reason  ever r l s    chapter xxx    29th may   my dear colvin  still grinding at chap xi  i began many  days ago on p 93 and am still on p 93 which is  exhilarating but the thing takes shape all the same and  should make a pretty lively chapter for an end of it  for  xii is only a footnote ad explicandum   june the 1st   back on p 93  i was on 100 yesterday but read it over and  condemned it   10 a m   i have worked up again to 97 but how  the deuce fly away  with literature for the basest sport in creation  but its  got to come straight and if possible so that i may finish  d balfour in time for the same mail  what a getting  upstairs  this is flaubert outdone  belle graham and  lloyd leave today on a malaga down the coast to be absent a  week or so this leaves fanny me and  who seems a nice  kindly fellow   june 2nd   i am nearly dead with dyspepsia oversmoking and  unremunerative overwork  last night i went to bed by seven  woke up again about ten for a minute to find myself light headed and altogether off my legs went to sleep again and  woke this morning fairly fit  i have crippled on to p 101  but i havent read it yet so do not boast  what kills me is  the frame of mind of one of the characters i cannot get it  through  of course that does not interfere with my total  inability to write so that yesterday i was a living half hour upon a single clause and have a gallery of variants that  would surprise you  and this sort of trouble which i cannot  avoid unfortunately produces nothing when done but  alembication and the farfetched  well read it with mercy   8 am   going to bed  have read it and believe the chapter  practically done at last  but lord it has been a business   july 3rd 815   the draft is finished the end of chapter ii and the tale  and i have only eight pages wiederzuarbeiten  this is just a  cry of joy in passing   1030   knocked out of time  did 101 and 102  alas no more today  as i have to go down town to a meeting  just as well though  as my thumb is about done up   sunday june 4th   now for a little snippet of my life  yesterday 1230 in a  heavenly day of sun and trade i mounted my horse and set  off  a boy opens my gate for me  sleep and long life  a  blessing on your journey says he  and i reply sleep long  life  a blessing on the house  then on down the lime  lane a rugged narrow winding way that seems almost as if  it was leading you into lyonesse and you might see the head  and shoulders of a giant looking in  at the corner of the  road i meet the inspector of taxes and hold a diplomatic  interview with him he wants me to pay taxes on the new  house i am informed i should not till next year and we  part re infecta he promising to bring me decisions i  assuring him that if i find any favouritism he will find me  the most recalcitrant taxpayer on the island  then i have a  talk with an old servant by the wayside  a little further i  pass two children coming up  love say i are you two  chieflyproceeding inland and they say love yes and  the interesting ceremony is finished  down to the post  office where i find vitrolles and heaven reward you the  white book just arrived per upolu having gone the wrong way  round by australia also six copies of island nights  entertainments  some of weatheralls illustrations are very  clever but o lord the lagoon  i did say it was shallow  but o dear not so shallow as that a man could stand up in  it  i had still an hour to wait for my meeting so  postmaster davis let me sit down in his room and i had a  bottle of beer in and read a gentleman of france  have you  seen it coming out in longmans  my dear colvin tis the  most exquisite pleasure a real chivalrous yarn like the  dumas and yet unlike  thereafter to the meeting of the five  newspaper proprietors  business transacted i have to gallop  home and find the boys waiting to be paid at the doorstep    monday 5th   yesterday sunday the rev dr browne secretary to the  wesleyan mission and the man who made the war in the western  islands and was tried for his life in fiji came up and we  had a long important talk about samoa  o if i could only  talk to the home men  but what would it matter none of them  know none of them care  if we could only have macgregor  here with his schooner you would hear of no more troubles in  samoa  that is what we want a man that knows and likes the  natives qui paye de sa personne and is not afraid of  hanging when necessary  we dont want bland swedish humbugs  and fussy fostering german barons  that way the maelstrom  lies and we shall soon be in it  i have today written 103 and 104 all perfectly wrong and  shall have to rewrite them  this tale is devilish and  chapter xi the worst of the lot  the truth is of course  that i am wholly worked out but its nearly done and shall  go somehow according to promise  i go against all my gods  and say it is not worth while to massacre yourself over the  last few pages of a rancid yarn that the reviewers will  quite justly tear to bits  as for db no hope i fear  this mail but well see what the afternoon does for me   415   well its done  those tragic 16 pp are at last finished  and i have put away thirtytwo pages of chips and have spent  thirteen days about as nearly in hell as a man could expect  to live through  its done and of course it aint worth  while and who cares  there it is and about as grim a tale  as was ever written and as grimy and as hateful   sacred to the memory of j l huish born 1856 at hackney london accidentally killed upon this island 10th september 1889   tuesday 6   i am exulting to do nothing  it pours with rain from the  westward very unusual kind of weather i was standing out on  the little verandah in front of my room this morning and  there went through me or over me a wave of extraordinary and  apparently baseless emotion  i literally staggered  and  then the explanation came and i knew i had found a frame of  mind and body that belonged to scotland and particularly to  the neighbourhood of callander  very odd these identities of  sensation and the world of connotations implied highland  huts and peat smoke and the brown swirling rivers and wet  clothes and whiskey and the romance of the past and that  indescribable bite of the whole thing at a mans heart which  is  or rather lies at the bottom of  a story  i dont know if you are a barbey daurevillyan  i am  i  have a great delight in his norman stories  do you know the  chevalier des touches and lensorcelee  they are admirable  they reek of the soil and the past  but i was rather  thinking just now of le rideau cramoisi and its adorable  setting of the stopped coach the dark street the homegoing  in the inn yard and the red blind illuminated  without  doubt there was an identity of sensation one of those  conjunctions in life that had filled barbey full to the brim  and permanently bent his memory  i wonder exceedingly if i have done anything at all good and  who can tell me and why should i wish to know  in so little  a while i and the english language and the bones of my  descendants will have ceased to be a memory  and yet  and  yet  one would like to leave an image for a few years upon  mens minds  for fun  this is a very dark frame of mind  consequent on overwork and the conclusion of the excruciating  ebb tide  adieu  what do you suppose should be done with the ebb tide  it  would make a volume of 200 pp on the other hand i might  likely have some more stories soon the owl death in the  pot the sleeper awakened all these are possible  the owl  might be half as long the sleeper awakened ditto death in  the pot a deal shorter i believe  then theres the go between which is not impossible altogether  the owl the  sleeper awakened and the gobetween end reasonably well  death in the pot is an ungodly massacre  o well the owl  only ends well in so far as some lovers come together and  nobody is killed at the moment but you know they are all  doomed they are chouan fellows   friday 9th   well the mail is in no bluebook depressing letter from  c a long amusing ramble from my mother vast masses of  romeike they are going to war now and what will that lead  to and what has driven them to it but the persistent  misconduct of these two officials  i know i ought to rewrite  the end of this bluidy ebb tide well i cant  cest plus  fort que moi it has to go the way it is and be jowned to  it  from what i make out of the reviews i think it would be  better not to republish the ebb tide but keep it for other  tales if they should turn up  very amusing how the reviews  pick out one story and damn the rest i and it is always a  different one  be sure you send me the article from le  temps   saturday 17th   since i wrote this last i have written a whole chapter of my  grandfather and read it tonight it was on the whole much  appreciated and i kind of hope it aint bad myself  tis a  third writing but it wants a fourth  by next mail i  believe i might send you 3 chapters  that is to say family  annals the service of the northern lights and the building  of the bell rock  possibly even 4  a houseful of boys  i  could finish my grandfather very easy now my father and  uncle alan stop the way  i propose to call the book  northern lights memoirs of a family of engineers  i tell  you it is going to be a good book  my idea in sending ms  would be to get it set up two proofs to me one to professor  swan ardchapel helensburgh  mark it private and  confidential  one to yourself and come on with criticisms   but ill have to see  the total plan of the book is this   i domestic annals ii the service of the northern lights iii the building of the bell rock iv a houseful of boys or the family in baxters place v education of an engineer vi the grandfather vii alan stevenson viii thomas stevenson  there will be an introduction the surname of stevenson  which has proved a mighty queer subject of inquiry  but  lord if i were among libraries   sunday 18th   i shall put in this envelope the end of the evertobe execrated ebb tide or stevensons blooming error  also a  paper apart for david balfour  the slips must go in another  enclosure i suspect owing to their beastly bulk  anyway  there are two pieces of work off my mind and though i could  wish i had rewritten a little more of david yet it was  plainly to be seen it was impossible  all the points  indicated by you have been brought out but to rewrite the  end in my present state of overexhaustion and fiction   phobia would have been madness and i let it go as it stood   my grandfather is good enough for me these days i do not  work any less on the whole if anything a little more  but  it is different  the slips go to you in four packets i hope they are what  they should be but do not think so  i am at a pitch of  discontent with fiction in all its form  or my forms  that  prevents me being able to be even interested  i have had to  stop all drink smoking i am trying to stop also  it annoys  me dreadfully and yet if i take a glass of claret  i have  a headache the next day  o and a good headache too none of  your trifles  well sir heres to you and farewell  yours ever r l s    chapter xxxi    saturday 24th  june   my dear colvin  yesterday morning after a day of absolute  temperance i awoke to the worst headache i had had yet   accordingly temperance was said farewell to quinine  instituted and i believe my pains are soon to be over  we  wait with a kind of sighing impatience for war to be  declared or to blow finally off living in the meanwhile in  a kind of childrens hour of firelight and shadow and  preposterous tales the king seen at night galloping up our  road upon unknown errands and covering his face as he passes  our cook mataafa daily surrounded when he awakes with  fresh white mans boxes query ammunition and professing  to be quite ignorant of where they come from marches of  bodies of men across the island concealment of ditto in the  bush the coming on and off of different chiefs and such a  mass of ravelment and ragtag as the devil himself could not  unwind   wednesday 28th june   yesterday it rained with but little intermission but i was  jealous of news  graham and i got into the saddle about 1  oclock and off down to town  in town there was nothing but  rumours going in the night drums had been beat the men had  run to arms on mulinuu from as far as vaiala and the alarm  proved false  there were no signs of any gathering in apia  proper and the secretary of state had no news to give  i  believed him too for we are brither scots  then the  temptation came upon me strong to go on to the ford and see  the mataafa villages where we heard there was more afoot   off we rode  when we came to vaimusu the houses were very  full of men but all seemingly unarmed  immediately beyond  is that river over which we passed in our scamper with lady  jersey it was all solitary  three hundred yards beyond is a  second ford and there  i came face to face with war  under  the trees on the further bank sat a picket of seven men with  winchesters their faces bright their eyes ardent  as we  came up they did not speak or move only their eyes followed  us  the horses drank and we passed the ford  talofa i  said and the commandant of the picket said talofa and  then when we were almost by remembered himself and asked  where we were going  to faamuina i said and we rode on   every house by the wayside was crowded with armed men  there  was the european house of a chinaman on the righthand side  a flag of truce flying over the gate  indeed we saw three of  these in what little way we penetrated into mataafas lines   all the foreigners trying to protect their goods and the  chinamans verandah overflowed with men and girls and  winchesters  by the way we met a party of about ten or a  dozen marching with their guns and cartridgebelts and the  cheerful alacrity and brightness of their looks set my head  turning with envy and sympathy  arrived at vaiusu the  houses about the malae village green were thronged with  men all armed  on the outside of the councilhouse which  was all full within there stood an orator he had his back  turned to his audience and seemed to address the world at  large all the time we were there his strong voice continued  unabated and i heard snatches of political wisdom rising and  falling  the house of faamuina stands on a knoll in the malae   thither we mounted a boy ran out and took our horses and we  went in  faamuina was there himself his wife pelepa three  other chiefs and some attendants and here again was this  exulting spectacle as of people on their marriage day   faamuina when i last saw him was an elderly limping  gentleman with much of the debility of age it was a bright eyed boy that greeted me the lady was no less excited all  had cartridgebelts  we stayed but a little while to smoke a  sului i would not have kava made as i thought my escapade  was already dangerous perhaps even blameworthy enough  on  the way back we were much greeted and on coming to the  ford the commandant came and asked me if there were many on  the other side  very many said i not that i knew but i  would not lead them on the ice  that is well said he and  the little picket laughed aloud as we splashed into the  river  we returned to apia through apia and out to  windward as far as vaiala where the word went that the men  of the vaimauga had assembled  we met two boys carrying  pigs and saw six young men busy cooking in a cookhouse but  no sign of an assembly no arms no blackened faces  i  forgot  as we turned to leave faamuinas there ran forward  a man with his face blackened and the back of his lavalava  girded up so as to show his tattooed hips naked he leaped  before us cut a wonderful caper and flung his knife high in  the air and caught it  it was strangely savage and  fantastic and highspirited  i have seen a child doing the  same antics long before in a dance so that it is plainly an  accepted solemnity  i should say that for weeks the children  have been playing with spears  up by the plantation i took a  short cut which shall never be repeated through grass and  weeds over the horses heads and among rolling stones i  thought we should have left a horse there but fortune  favoured us  so home a little before six in a dashing  squall of rain to a bowl of kava and dinner  but the  impression on our minds was extraordinary the sight of that  picket at the ford and those ardent happy faces whirls in  my head the old aboriginal awoke in both of us and knickered  like a stallion  it is dreadful to think that i must sit apart here and do  nothing i do not know if i can stand it out  but you see i  may be of use to these poor people if i keep quiet and if i  threw myself in i should have a bad job of it to save  myself  there i have written this to you and it is still  but 730 in the day and the sun only about one hour up can  i go back to my old grandpapa and men sitting with  winchesters in my minds eye  no war is a huge  entrainement there is no other temptation to be compared to  it not one  we were all wet we had been about five hours  in the saddle mostly riding hard and we came home like  schoolboys with such a lightness of spirits and i am sure  such a brightness of eye as you could have lit a candle at   thursday 29th   i had two priests to luncheon yesterday the bishop and pere  remy  they were very pleasant and quite clean too which  has been known sometimes not to be  even with bishops   monseigneur is not unimposing with his white beard and his  violet girdle he looks splendidly episcopal and when our  three waiting lads came up one after another and kneeled  before him in the big hall and kissed his ring it did me  good for a piece of pageantry  remy is very engaging he is  a little nervous eager man like a governess and brimful  of laughter and small jokes  so is the bishop indeed and  our luncheon party went off merrily  far more merrily than  many a german spread though with so much less liquor  one  trait was delicious  with a complete ignorance of the  protestant that i would scarce have imagined he related to  us as news little stories from the gospels and got the  names all wrong  his comments were delicious and to our  ears a thought irreverent  ah il connaissait son monde  allez  il etait fin notre seigneur etc   friday   down with fanny and belle to lunch at the international   heard there about the huge folly of the hour all the mulinuu  ammunition having been yesterday marched openly to vaults in  matafele and this morning on a cry of protest from the  whites openly and humiliatingly disinterred and marched back  again  people spoke of it with a kind of shrill note that  did not quite satisfy me  they seemed not quite well at  ease  luncheon over we rode out on the malie road  all was  quiet in vaiusu and when we got to the second ford alas  there was no picket  which was just what belle had come to  sketch  on through quite empty roads the houses deserted  never a gun to be seen and at last a drum and a penny  whistle playing in vaiusu and a cricket match on the malae   went up to faamuinas he is a trifle uneasy though he gives  us kava  i cannot see what ails him then it appears that he  has an engagement with the chief justice at halfpast two to  sell a piece of land  is this the reason why war has  disappeared  we ride back stopping to sketch here and there  the fords a flag of truce etc  i ride on to public hall  committee and pass an hour with my committees very heavily   to the hotel to dinner then to the ball and home by eleven  very tired  at the ball i heard some news of how the chief  of letonu said that i was the source of all this trouble and  should be punished and my family as well  this and the  rudeness of the man at the ford of the gasegase looks but  ill i should have said that faamuina as he approached the  first ford was spoken to by a girl and immediately said  goodbye and plunged into the bush the girl had told him  there was a war party out from mulinuu and a little further  on as we stopped to sketch a flag of truce the beating of  drums and the sound of a bugle from that direction startled  us  but we saw nothing and i believe mulinuu is at least  at present incapable of any act of offence  one good job  these threats to my home and family take away all my childish  temptation to go out and fight  our force must be here to  protect ourselves  i see panic rising among the whites i  hear the shrill note of it in their voices and they talk  already about a refuge on the war ships  there are two here  both german and the orlando is expected presently   sunday 9th july   well the war has at last begun  for four or five days apia  has been filled by these poor children with their faces  blacked and the red handkerchief about their brows that  makes the malietoa uniform and the boats have been coming in  from the windward some of them 50 strong with a drum and a  bugle on board  the bugle always illplayed  and a sort of  jester leaping and capering on the sparred nose of the boat  and the whole crew uttering from time to time a kind of  menacing ululation  friday they marched out to the bush and  yesterday morning we heard that some had returned to their  houses for the night as they found it so uncomfortable   after dinner a messenger came up to me with a note that the  wounded were arriving at the mission house  fanny lloyd and  i saddled and rode off with a lantern it was a fine starry  night though pretty cold  we left the lantern at tanuga manono and then down in the starlight  i found apia and  myself in a strange state of flusteration my own excitement  was gloomy and i may say truculent others appeared  imbecile some sullen  the best place in the whole town was  the hospital  a longish framehouse it was with a big table  in the middle for operations and ten samoans each with an  average of four sympathisers stretched along the walls   clarke was there steady as a die miss large little  spectacled angel showed herself a real trump the nice  clean german orderlies in their white uniforms looked and  meant business  i hear a fine story of miss large  a cast iron teetotaller  going to the publichouse for a bottle of  brandy  the doctors were not there when i arrived but presently it  was observed that one of the men was going cold  he was a  magnificent samoan very dark with a noble aquiline  countenance like an arab i suppose and was surrounded by  seven people fondling his limbs as he lay he was shot  through both lungs  and an orderly was sent to the town for  the german naval doctors who were dining there  meantime  i found an errand of my own  both clarke and miss large  expressed a wish to have the public hall of which i am  chairman and i set off down town and woke people out of  their beds and got a committee together and with a great  deal of difficulty from one man whom we finally overwhelmed  got the public hall for them  bar the one man the committee  was splendid and agreed in a moment to share the expense if  the shareholders object  back to the hospital about 1130  found the german doctors there  two men were going now one  that was shot in the bowels  he was dying rather hard in a  gloomy stupor of pain and laudanum silent with contorted  face  the chief shot through the lungs was lying on one  side awaiting the last angel his family held his hands and  legs they were all speechless only one woman suddenly  clasped his knee and keened for the inside of five  seconds and fell silent again  went home and to bed about  two am  what actually passed seems undiscoverable but the  mataafas were surely driven back out of vaitele that is a  blow to them and the resistance was far greater than had  been anticipated  which is a blow to the laupepas  all  seems to indicate a long and bloody war  franks house in mulinuu was likewise filled with wounded  many dead bodies were brought in i hear with certainty of  five wrapped in mats and a pastor goes tomorrow to the  field to bring others  the laupepas brought in eleven heads  to mulinuu and to the great horror and consternation of the  native mind one proved to be a girl and was identified as  that of a taupou  or maid of the village  from savaii  i  hear this morning with great relief that it has been  returned to malie wrapped in the most costly silk  handkerchiefs and with an apologetic embassy  this could  easily happen  the girl was of course attending on her  father with ammunition and got shot her hair was cut short  to make her fathers war headdress  even as our own sinas  is at this moment and the decollator was probably in his  red flurry of fight wholly unconscious of her sex  i am  sorry for him in the future he must make up his mind to many  bitter jests  perhaps to vengeance  but what an end to one  chosen for her beauty and in the time of peace watched over  by trusty crones and hunchbacks   evening   can i write or not  i played lawn tennis in the morning and  after lunch down with graham to apia  ulu he that was shot  in the lungs still lives he that was shot in the bowels is  gone to his fathers poor fierce child  i was able to be of  some very small help and in the way of helping myself to  information to prove myself a mere gazer at meteors  but  there seems no doubt the mataafas for the time are scattered  the most of our friends are involved in this disaster and  mataafa himself  who might have swept the islands a few  months ago  for him to fall so poorly doubles my regret   they say the taupou had a gun and fired probably an excuse  manufactured ex post facto  i go down tomorrow at 12 to  stay the afternoon and help miss large  in the hospital to day when i first entered it there were no attendants only  the wounded and their friends all equally sleeping and their  heads poised upon the wooden pillows  there is a pretty  enough boy there slightly wounded whose fate is to be  envied two girls and one of the most beautiful with  beaming eyes tend him and sleep upon his pillow  in the  other corner another young man very patient and brave lies  wholly deserted  yet he seems to me far the better of the  two but not so pretty  heavens what a difference that  makes in our not very well proportioned bodies and our  finely hideous faces the 132nd  rather the 164th  this  way or that  sixteen heads in all at mulinuu  i am so stiff  i can scarce move without a howl   monday 10th   some news that mataafa is gone to savaii by way of manono  this may mean a great deal more warfaring and no great  issue  when sosimo came in this morning with my breakfast  he had to lift me up  it is no joke to play lawn tennis  after carrying your right arm in a sling so many years   what a hard unjust business this is  on the 28th if  mataafa had moved he could have still swept mulinuu  he  waited and i fear he is now only the stick of a rocket   wednesday 12th   no more political news but many rumours  the government  troops are off to manono no word of mataafa  o there is a  passage in my mothers letter which puzzles me as to a date   is it next christmas you are coming or the christmas after   this is most important and must be understood at once  if  it is next christmas i could not go to ceylon for lack of  gold and you would have to adopt one of the following  alternatives 1st either come straight on here and pass a  month with us tis the rainy season but we have often  lovely weather  or 2nd come to hawaii and i will meet you  there  hawaii is only a weeks sail from s francisco  making only about sixteen days on the heaving ocean and the  steamers run once a fortnight so that you could turn round  and you could thus pass a day or two in the states  a  fortnight even  and still see me  but i have sworn to take  no further excursions till i have money saved to pay for  them and to go to ceylon and back would be torture unless i  had a lot  you must answer this at once please so that i  may know what to do  we would dearly like you to come on  here  ill tell you how it can be done i can come up and  meet you at hawaii and if you had at all got over your sea sickness i could just come on board and we could return  together to samoa and you could have a month of our life  here which i believe you could not help liking  our horses  are the devil of course miserable screws and some of them  a little vicious  i had a dreadful fright  the passage in  my mothers letter is recrossed and i see it says the end of  94 so much the better then but i would like to submit to  you my alternative plan  i could meet you at hawaii and  reconduct you to hawaii so that we could have a full six  weeks together and i believe a little over and you would see  this place of mine and have a sniff of native life native  foods native houses  and perhaps be in time to see the  german flag raised who knows  and we could generally yarn  for all we were worth  i should like you to see vailima and  i should be curious to know how the climate affected you  it  is quite hit or miss it suits me it suits graham it suits  all our family others it does not suit at all  it is either  gold or poison  i rise at six the rest at seven lunch is  at 12 at five we go to lawn tennis till dinner at six and  to roost early  a man brought in a head to mulinuu in great glory they  washed the black paint off and behold it was his brother   when i last heard he was sitting in his house with the head  upon his lap and weeping  barbarous war is an ugly  business but i believe the civilised is fully uglier but  lord what fun  i should say we now have definite news that there are three  womens heads it was difficult to get it out of the natives  who are all ashamed and the women all in terror of  reprisals  nothing has been done to punish or disgrace these  hateful innovators  it was a false report that the head had  been returned   thursday 13th   mataafa driven away from savaii  i cannot write about this  and do not know what should be the end of it   monday 17th   haggard and ahrens a german clerk to lunch yesterday   there is no real certain news yet i must say no man could  swear to any result but the sky looks horribly black for  mataafa and so many of our friends along with him  the thing  has an abominable a beastly nightmare interest  but its  wonderful generally how little one cares about the wounded  hospital sights etc things that used to murder me  i was  far more struck with the excellent way in which things were  managed as if it had been a peepshow i held some of the  things at an operation and did not care a dump   tuesday 18th   sunday came the katoomba captain bickford cmg   yesterday graham and i went down to call and find he has  orders to suppress mataafa at once and has to go down today  before daybreak to manono  he is a very capable energetic  man if he had only come ten days ago all this would have  gone by but now the questions are thick and difficult  1  will mataafa surrender  2 will his people allow themselves  to be disarmed  3 what will happen to them if they do   4 what will any of them believe after former deceptions   the three consuls were scampering on horseback to leulumoega  to the king no cusacksmith without whose accession i could  not send a letter to mataafa  i rode up here wrote my  letter in the sweat of the concordance and with the able bodied help of lloyd  and dined  then down in continual  showers and pitchy darkness and to cusacksmiths not re returned  back to the inn for my horse and to css when  i find him just returned and he accepts my letter  thence  home by 1230 jolly tired and wet  and today have been in  a crispation of energy and illtemper raking my wretched  mail together  it is a hateful business waiting for the  news it may come to a fearful massacre yet  yours ever  r l s    chapter xxxii    august 1893   my dear colvin  quite impossible to write  your letter is  due today a nasty rainylike morning with huge blue  clouds and a huge indigo shadow on the sea and my lamp  still burning at near 7  let me humbly give you news  fanny  seems on the whole the most or the only powerful member of  the family for some days she has been the flower of the  flock  belle is begging for quinine  lloyd and graham have  both been down with belly belong him black boy speech   as for me i have to lay aside my lawn tennis having as was  to be expected had a smart but eminently brief hemorrhage   i am also on the quinine flask  i have been recasting the  beginning of the hanging judge or weir of hermiston then i  have been cobbling on my grandfather whose last chapter  there are only to be four is in the form of pieces of  paper a huge welter of inconsequence and that glimmer of  faith or hope which one learns at this trade that somehow  and some time by perpetual staring and glowering and  rewriting order will emerge  it is indeed a queer hope  there is one piece for instance that i want in  i cannot put  it one place for a good reason  i cannot put it another for  a better  and every time i look at it i turn sick and put  the ms away  well your letter hasnt come and a number of others are  missing  it looks as if a mailbag had gone on so ill  blame nobody and proceed to business  it looks as if i was going to send you the first three  chapters of my grandfather     if they were set up it  would be that much anxiety off my mind  i have a strange  feeling of responsibility as if i had my ancestors souls in  my charge and might miscarry with them  theres a lot of work gone into it and a lot more is needed   still chapter i seems about right to me and much of chapter  ii  chapter iii i know nothing of as i told you  and  chapter iv is at present all ends and beginnings but it can  be pulled together  this is all i have been able to screw up to you for this  month and i may add that it is not only more than you  deserve but just about more than i was equal to  i have  been and am entirely useless just able to tinker at my  grandfather  the three chapters  perhaps also a little of  the fourth  will come home to you next mail by the hand of  my cousin graham balfour a very nice fellow whom i recommend  to you warmly  and whom i think you will like  this will  give you time to consider my various and distracted schemes  all our wars are over in the meantime to begin again as soon  as the warships leave  adieu  r l s    chapter xxxiii    23rd august   my dear colvin  your pleasing letter re the ebb tide to  hand  i propose if it be not too late to delete lloyds  name  he has nothing to do with the last half  the first we  wrote together as the beginning of a long yarn  the second  is entirely mine and i think it rather unfair on the young  man to couple his name with so infamous a work  above all  as you had not read the two last chapters which seem to me  the most ugly and cynical of all  you will see that i am not in a good humour and i am not   it is not because of your letter but because of the  complicated miseries that surround me and that i choose to  say nothing of  life is not all beer and skittles  the  inherent tragedy of things works itself out from white to  black and blacker and the poor things of a day look ruefully  on  does it shake my castiron faith  i cannot say it does   i believe in an ultimate decency of things ay and if i woke  in hell should still believe it  but it is hard walking  and i can see my own share in the missteps and can bow my  head to the result like an old stern unhappy devil of a  norseman as my ultimate character is     well il faut cultiver son jardin  that last expression of  poor unhappy human wisdom i take to my heart and go to st  ives   24th aug   and did and worked about 2 hours and got to sleep ultimately  and a the clouds has blawn away  be sure well have some  pleisand weather when a the clouds storms has blawn  gone away  verses that have a quite inexplicable  attraction for me and i believe had for burns  they have no  merit but are somehow good  i am now in a most excellent  humour  i am deep in st ives which i believe will be the next  novel done  but it is to be clearly understood that i  promise nothing and may throw in your face the very last  thing you expect  or i expect  st ives will to my mind  not be wholly bad  it is written in rather a funny style a  little stilted and lefthanded the style of st ives also  to some extent the style of r l s dictating  st  ives  is unintellectual and except as an adventure novel dull   but the adventures seem to me sound and pretty probable and  it is a love story  speed his wings   sunday night   de coeur un peu plus dispos monsieur et cher confrere je me  remets a vous ecrire  st ives is now in the 5th chapter  copying in the 14th chapter of the dictated draft  i do not  believe i shall end by disliking it   monday   well here goes again for the news  fanny is very well  indeed and in good spirits i am in good spirits but not  very well lloyd is in good spirits and very well belle has  a real good fever which has put her pipe out wholly  graham  goes back this mail  he takes with him three chapters of the  family and is to go to you as soon as he can  he cannot be  much the master of his movements but you grip him when you  can and get all you can from him as he has lived about six  months with us and he can tell you just what is true and what  is not  and not the dreams of dear old ross  he is a good  fellow is he not  since you rather revise your views of the ebb tide i think  lloyds name might stick but ill leave it to you  ill  tell you just how it stands  up to the discovery of the  champagne the tale was all planned between us and drafted by  lloyd from that moment he has had nothing to do with it  except talking it over  for we changed our plan gave up the  projected monte cristo and cut it down for a short story   my jmpression  i beg your pardon  this is a local joke  a  firm here had on its beer labels sole jmporters  is that  it will never be popular but might make a little succes de  scandale  however im done with it now and not sorry and  the crowd may rave and mumble its bones for what i care  hole essential  i am sorry about the maps but i want em  for next edition so see and have proofs sent  you are quite  right about the bottle and the great huish i must try to  make it clear  no i will not write a play for irving nor  for the devil  can you not see that the work of  falsification which a play demands is of all tasks the most  ungrateful  and i have done it a long while  and nothing  ever came of it  consider my new proposal i mean honolulu  you would get the  atlantic and the rocky mountains would you not for bracing   and so much less sea  and then you could actually see  vailima which i would like you to for its beautiful and my  home and tomb that is to be though its a wrench not to be  planted in scotland  that i can never deny  if i could only  be buried in the hills under the heather and a table  tombstone like the martyrs where the whaups and plovers are  crying  did you see a man who wrote the stickit minister  and dedicated it to me in words that brought the tears to my  eyes every time i looked at them where about the graves of  the martyrs the whaups are crying  his heart remembers how   ah by god it does  singular that i should fulfil the scots  destiny throughout and live a voluntary exile and have my  head filled with the blessed beastly place all the time  and now a word as regards the delusions of the dear ross who  remembers i believe my letters and fannys when we were  first installed and were really hoeing a hard row  we have  salad beans cabbages tomatoes asparagus kohlrabi  oranges limes barbadines pineapples cape gooseberries   galore pints of milk and cream fresh meat five days a week   it is the rarest thing for any of us to touch a tin and the  gnashing of teeth when it has to be done is dreadful  for no  one who has not lived on them for six months knows what the  hatred of the tin is  as for exposure my weakness is  certainly the reverse i am sometimes a month without leaving  the verandah  for my sins be it said  doubtless when i go  about and as the doctor says expose myself to malaria i  am in far better health and i would do so more too  for i  do not mean to be silly  but the difficulties are great   however you see how much the dear doctor knows of my diet  and habits  malaria practically does not exist in these  islands it is a negligeable quantity  what really bothers  us a little is the mosquito affair  the socalled  elephantiasis  ask ross about it  a real romance of natural  history quoi  hi stop you say the ebb tide is the working out of an  artistic problem of a kind  well i should just bet it was   you dont like attwater  but look at my three rogues  theyre all there ill go bail  three types of the bad man  the weak man and the strong man with a weakness that are  gone through and lived out  yes of course i was sorry for mataafa but a good deal  sorrier and angrier about the mismanagement of all the white  officials  i cannot bear to write about that  manono all  destroyed one house standing in apolima the women stripped  the prisoners beaten with whips  and the womens heads taken   all under white auspices  and for upshot and result of so  much shame to the white powers  tamasese already conspiring  as i knew and preached in vain must be the case  well well  it is no fun to meddle in politics  i suppose youre right about simon  but it is symon  throughout in that blessed little volume my father bought for  me in inverness in the year of grace 81 i believe  the  trial of james stewart with the jacobite pamphlet and the  dying speech appended  out of which the whole of davie has  already been begotten and which i felt it a kind of loyalty  to follow  i really ought to have it bound in velvet and  gold if i had any gratitude and the best of the lark is  that the name of david balfour is not anywhere within the  bounds of it  a pretty curious instance of the genesis of a book  i am  delighted at your good word for david i believe the two  together make up much the best of my work and perhaps of what  is in me  i am not ashamed of them at least  there is one  hitch instead of three hours between the two parts i fear  there have passed three years over davies character but do  not tell anybody see if they can find it out for themselves  and no doubt his experiences in kidnapped would go far to  form him  i would like a copy to go to g meredith   wednesday   well here is a new move  it is likely i may start with  graham next week and go to honolulu to meet the other steamer  and return i do believe a fortnight at sea would do me good  yet i am not yet certain  the crowded upsteamer sticks in  my throat   tuesday 12th sept   yesterday was perhaps the brightest in the annals of vailima   i got leave from captain bickford to have the band of the  katoomba come up and they came fourteen of em with drum  fife cymbals and bugles blue jackets white caps and  smiling faces  the house was all decorated with scented  greenery above and below  we had not only our own nine out door workers but a contract party that we took on in charity  to pay their warfine the band besides as it came up the  mountain had collected a following of children by the way  and we had a picking of samoan ladies to receive them   chicken ham cake and fruits were served out with coffee  and lemonade and all the afternoon we had rounds of claret  negus flavoured with rum and limes  they played to us they  danced they sang they tumbled  our boys came in the end of  the verandah and gave them a dance for a while  it was  anxious work getting this stopped once it had begun but i  knew the band was going on a programme  finally they gave  three cheers for mr and mrs stevens shook hands formed up  and marched off playing  till a kicking horse in the paddock  put their pipes out something of the suddenest  we thought  the big drum was gone but simele flew to the rescue  and so  they wound away down the hill with ever another call of the  bugle leaving us extinct with fatigue but perhaps the most  contented hosts that ever watched the departure of successful  guests  simply impossible to tell how well these blue jackets behaved a most interesting lot of men this  education of boys for the navy is making a class wholly  apart  how shall i call them  a kind of lowerclass public  school boy wellmannered fairly intelligent sentimental as  a sailor  what is more shall be writ on board ship if  anywhere  please send catriona to g meredith   s s mariposa   tomorrow i reach honolulu  goodmorning to your honour  r  l s    chapter xxxiv    waikiki honolulu h 1 oct 23rd 1893   dear colvin  my wife came up on the steamer and we go home  together in 2 days  i am practically all right only sleepy  and tired easily slept yesterday from 11 to 1145 from 1 to  250 went to bed at 8 pm and with an hours interval  slept till 6 am close upon 14 hours out of the 24  we  sail tomorrow  i am anxious to get home though this has  been an interesting visit and politics have been curious  indeed to study  we go to ppc on the queen this  morning poor recluse lady abreuvee dinjures quelle est   had a rather annoying lunch on board the american manofwar  with a member of the pg provincial government and a good  deal of antiroyalist talk which i had to sit out  not only  for my hosts sake but my fellow guests  at last i took  the lead and changed the conversation  r l s  i am being busted here by party named hutchinson  seems  good   vailima  november   home again and found all well thank god  i am perfectly  well again and ruddier than the cherry  please note that  8000 is not bad for a volume of short stories the merry men  did a good deal worse the short story never sells  i hope  catriona will do that is the important  the reviews seem  mixed and perplexed and one had the peculiar virtue to make  me angry  i am in a fair way to expiscate my family history   fanny and i had a lovely voyage down with our new c j and  the american land commissioner and on the whole and for  these disgusting steamers a pleasant ships company  i  cannot understand why you dont take to the hawaii scheme   do you understand  you cross the atlantic in six days and  go from frisco to honolulu in seven  thirteen days at sea  in all  i have no wish to publish the ebb tide as a book  let it wait  it will look well in the portfolio  i would  like a copy of course for that end and to look upont  again  which i scarce dare   later   this is disgraceful  i have done nothing neither work nor  letters  on the me may day we had a great triumph our  protestant boys instead of going with their own villages and  families went of their own accord in the vailima uniform  belle made coats for them on purpose to complete the uniform  they having bought the stuff and they were hailed as they  marched in as the tamaona  the rich mans children  this  is really a score it means that vailima is publicly taken as  a family  then we had my birthday feast a week late owing  to diarrhoea on the proper occasion  the feast was laid in  the hall and was a singular mass of food 15 pigs 100 lbs  beef 100 lbs pork and the fruit and filigree in a  proportion  we had sixty horseposts driven in the gate  paddock how many guests i cannot guess perhaps 150  they  came between three and four and left about seven  seumanu  gave me one of his names and when my name was called at the  ava drinking behold it was au mai taua ma manuvao  you  would scarce recognise me if you heard me thus referred to  two days after we hired a carriage in apia fanny belle  lloyd and i and drove in great style with a native  outrider to the prison a huge gift of ava and tobacco under  the seats  the prison is now under the pule of an austrian  captain wurmbrand a soldier of fortune in servia and turkey  a charming clever kindly creature who is adored by his  chiefs as he calls them meaning our political prisoners   and we came into the yard walled about with tinned iron and  drank ava with the prisoners and the captain  it may amuse  you to hear how it is proper to drink ava  when the cup is  handed you you reach your arm out somewhat behind you and  slowly pour a libation saying with somewhat the manner of  prayer ia taumafa e le atua  ua matagofie le fesilafaiga  nei  be it highchief partaken of by the god  how high  chief beautiful to view is this high chief gathering   this pagan practice is very queer  i should say that the  prison ava was of that not very welcome form that we  elegantly call spitava but of course there was no escape  and it had to be drunk  fanny and i rode home and i  moralised by the way  could we ever stand europe again did  she appreciate that if we were in london we should be  actually jostled in the street and there was nobody in the  whole of britain who knew how to take ava like a gentleman   tis funny to be thus of two civilisations  or if you like  of one civilisation and one barbarism  and as usual the  barbarism is the more engaging  colvin you have to come here and see us in our  native   mortal  spot  i just dont seem to be able to make up my  mind to your not coming  by this time you will have seen  graham i hope and he will be able to tell you something  about us and something reliable i shall feel for the first  time as if you knew a little about samoa after that  fanny  seems to be in the right way now  i must say she is very  very well for her and complains scarce at all  yesterday  she went down sola at least accompanied by a groom to pay a  visit belle lloyd and i went a walk up the mountain road   the great public highway of the island where you have to go  single file  the object was to show belle that gaudy valley  of the vaisigano which the road follows  if the road is to  be made and opened as our new chief justice promises it  will be one of the most beautiful roads in the world  but  the point is this i forgot i had been three months in  civilisation wearing shoes and stockings and i tell you i  suffered on my soft feet coming home down hill on that  stairway of loose stones i could have cried  o yes another  story i knew i had  the house boys had not been behaving  well so the other night i announced a fono and lloyd and i  went into the boys quarters and i talked to them i suppose  for half an hour and talolo translated lloyd was there  principally to keep another ear on the interpreter else  there may be dreadful misconceptions  i rubbed all their  ears except two whom i particularly praised and one mans  wages i announced i had cut down by one half  imagine his  taking this smiling  ever since he has been specially  attentive and greets me with a face of really heavenly  brightness  this is another good sign of their really and  fairly accepting me as a chief  when i first came here if i  had fined a man a sixpence he would have quit work that  hour and now i remove half his income and he is glad to  stay on  nay does not seem to entertain the possibility of  leaving  and this in the face of one particular difficulty   i mean our house in the bush and no society and no women  society within decent reach  i think i must give you our staff in a tabular form   house   o sosimo provost and butler and my valet  o misifolo who is fanny and belles chamberlain  kitchen   o talolo provost and chief cook   o iopu second cook  tali his wife no wages  tia samoan cook  feiloai his child no wages likewise no work  belles  pet   o leuelu fannys boy gardener odd jobs  in apia   eliga washman and daily errand man  outside   o henry simele provost and overseas of outside boys  lu  tasi sele  maiele  pulu who is also our talking man and cries the ava   the crosses mark out the really excellent boys  tia is the  man who has just been fined half his wages he is a beautiful  old man the living image of fighting gladiator my  favourite statue  but a dreadful humbug  i think we keep  him on a little on account of his looks  this sign o marks  those who have been two years or upwards in the family  i  note all my old boys have the cross of honour except  misifolo well poor dog he does his best i suppose  you  should see him scour  it is a remark that has often been  made by visitors you never see a samoan run except at  vailima  do you not suppose that makes me proud  i am pleased to see what a success the wrecker was having  already in little more than a year outstripped the master of  ballantrae  about david balfour in two volumes do see that they make it  a decentlooking book and tell me do you think a little  historical appendix would be of service  lang bleats for  one and i thought i might address it to him as a kind of  open letter   dec 4th   no time after all  goodbye  r l s    chapter xxxv    my dear colvin  one page out of my picture book i must give  you  fine burning day half past two pm  we four begin to  rouse up from reparatory slumbers yawn and groan get a cup  of tea and miserably dress we have had a party the day  before xmas day with all the boys absent but one and  latterly two we had cooked all day long a cold dinner and  lo at two our guests began to arrive though dinner was not  till six they were sixteen and fifteen slept the night and  breakfasted  conceive then how unwillingly we climb on our  horses and start off in the hottest part of the afternoon to  ride 4 and a half miles attend a native feast in the gaol  and ride four and a half miles back  but there is no help  for it  i am a sort of father of the political prisoners  and have charge dames in that riotously absurd  establishment apia gaol  the twentythree i think it is  chiefs act as under gaolers  the other day they told the  captain of an attempt to escape  one of the lesser political  prisoners the other day effected a swift capture while the  captain was trailing about with the warrant the man came to  see what was wanted came too flanked by the former gaoler  my prisoner offers to show him the dark cell shoves him in  and locks the door  why do you do that cries the former  gaoler  a warrant says he  finally the chiefs actually  feed the soldiery who watch them  the gaol is a wretched little building containing a little  room and three cells on each side of a central passage it  is surrounded by a fence of corrugated iron and shows over  the top of that only a gable end with the inscription o le  fale puipui  it is on the edge of the mangrove swamp and is  reached by a sort of causeway of turf  when we drew near we  saw the gates standing open and a prodigious crowd outside   i mean prodigious for apia perhaps a hundred and fifty  people  the two sentries at the gate stood to arms  passively and there seemed to be a continuous circulation  inside and out  the captain came to meet us our boy who  had been sent ahead was there to take the horses and we  passed inside the court which was full of food and rang  continuously to the voice of the caller of gifts i had to  blush a little later when my own present came and i heard my  one pig and eight miserable pineapples being counted out  like guineas  in the four corners of the yard and along one  wall there are makeshift dwarfish samoan houses or huts  which have been run up since captain wurmbrand came to  accommodate the chiefs  before that they were all crammed  into the six cells and locked in for the night some of them  with dysentery  they are wretched constructions enough but  sanctified by the presence of chiefs  we heard a man  corrected loudly today for saying fale of one of them  maota roared the highest chief present  palace  about  eighteen chiefs gorgeously arrayed stood up to greet us  and led us into one of these maotas where you may be sure we  had to crouch almost to kneel to enter and where a row of  pretty girls occupied one side to make the ava kava  the  highest chief present was a magnificent man as high chiefs  usually are i find i cannot describe him his face is full  of shrewdness and authority his figure like ajax his name  auilua  he took the head of the building and put belle on  his right hand  fanny was called first for the ava kava   our names were called in english style the highchief wife  of mr st an unpronounceable something mrs straw and  the like  and when we went into the other house to eat we  found we were seated alternately with chiefs about the   table i was about to say but rather floor  everything was  to be done european style with a vengeance  we were the only  whites present except wurmbrand and still i had no  suspicion of the truth  they began to take off their ulas  necklaces of scarlet seeds and hang them about our necks  we politely resisted and were told that the king who had  stopped off their siva had sent down to the prison a message  to the effect that he was to give a dinner tomorrow and  wished their secondhand ulas for it  some of them were  content others not  there was a ring of anger in the boys  voice as he told us we were to wear them past the kings  house  dinner over i must say they are moderate eaters at a  feast we returned to the ava house and then the curtain  drew suddenly up upon the set scene  we took our seats and  auilua began to give me a present recapitulating each  article as he gave it out with some appropriate comment  he  called me several times their only friend said they were  all in slavery had no money and these things were all made  by the hands of their families  nothing bought he had one  phrase in which i heard his voice rise up to a note of  triumph this is a present from the poor prisoners to the  rich man  thirteen pieces of tapa some of them  surprisingly fine one i think unique thirty fans of every  shape and colour a kava cup etc etc  at first auilua  conducted the business with weighty gravity but before the  end of the thirty fans his comments began to be humorous   when it came to a little basket he said here was a little  basket for tusitala to put sixpence in when he could get  hold of one  with a delicious grimace  i answered as best  as i was able through a miserable interpreter and all the  while as i went on i heard the crier outside in the court  calling my gift of food which i perceived was to be  gargantuan  i had brought but three boys with me  it was  plain that they were wholly overpowered  we proposed to send  for our gifts on the morrow but no said the interpreter  that would never do they must go away today mulinuu must  see my porters taking away the gifts  make em jella  quoth the interpreter  and i began to see the reason of this  really splendid gift one half gratitude to me  one half a  wipe at the king  and now to introduce darker colours you must know this  visit of mine to the gaol was just a little bit risky we had  several causes for anxiety it might have been put up to  connect with a tamasese rising  tusitala and his family  would be good hostages  on the other hand there were the  mulinuu people all about  we could see the anxiety of  captain wurmbrand no less anxious to have us go than he had  been to see us come he was deadly white and plainly had a  bad headache in the noisy scene  presently the noise grew  uproarious there was a rush at the gate  a rush in not a  rush out  where the two sentries still stood passive auilua  leaped from his place it was then that i got the name of  ajax for him and the next moment we heard his voice roaring  and saw his mighty figure swaying to and fro in the hurly burly  as the deuce would have it we could not understand a  word of what was going on  it might be nothing more than the  ordinary grab racket with which a feast commonly concludes  it might be something worse  we made what arrangements we  could for my tapa fans etc as well as for my five pigs  my masses of fish taro etc and with great dignity and  ourselves laden with ulas and other decorations passed  between the sentries among the howling mob to our horses   alls well that ends well  owing to fanny and belle we had  to walk and as lloyd said he had at last ridden in a  circus  the whole length of apia we paced our triumphal  progress past the kings palace past the german firm at  sogi  you can follow it on the map  amidst admiring  exclamations of mawaia  beautiful  it may be rendered o  my aint they dandy  until we turned up at last into our  road as the dusk deepened into night  it was really  exciting  and there is one thing sure no such feast was  ever made for a single family and no such present ever given  to a single white man  it is something to have been the hero  of it  and whatever other ingredients there were  undoubtedly gratitude was present  as money value i have  actually gained on the transaction  your note arrived little profit i must say  scott has  already put his nose in in st ives sir but his appearance  is not yet complete nothing is in that romance except the  story  i have to announce that i am off work probably for  six months  i must own that i have overworked bitterly   overworked  there thats legible  my hand is a thing that  was and in the meanwhile so are my brains  and here in the  very midst comes a plausible scheme to make vailima pay  which will perhaps let me into considerable expense just when  i dont want it  you know the vast cynicism of my view of  affairs and how readily and as some people say with how  much gusto i take the darker view  why do you not send me jerome k jeromes paper and let me  see the ebb tide as a serial  it is always very important to  see a thing in different presentments  i want every number   politically we begin the new year with every expectation of a  bust in 2 or 3 days a bust which may spell destruction to  samoa  i have written to baxter about his proposal    chapter xxxvi    vailima jan 29th 1894   my dear colvin  i had fully intended for your education and  moral health to fob you off with the meanest possible letter  this month and unfortunately i find i will have to treat you  to a good long account of matters here  i believe i have  told you before about tuimalealiifano and my taking him  down to introduce him to the chief justice  well tui came  back to vailima one day in the blackest sort of spirits  saying the war was decided that he also must join in the  fight and that there was no hope whatever of success  he  must fight as a point of honour for his family and country  and in his case even if he escaped on the field of battle  deportation was the least to be looked for  he said he had a  letter of complaint from the great council of aana which he  wished to lay before the chief justice and he asked me to  accompany him as if i were his nurse  we went down about  dinner time and by the way received from a lurking native  the famous letter in an official blue envelope gummed up to  the edges  it proved to be a declaration of war quite  formal but with some variations that really made you bounce   white residents were directly threatened bidden to have  nothing to do with the kings party not to receive their  goods in their houses etc under pain of an accident   however the chief justice took it very wisely and mildly  and between us he and i and tui made up a plan which has  proved successful  so far  the war is over  fifteen chiefs  are this morning undergoing a curious double process of law  comparable to a court martial in which their complaints are  to be considered and if possible righted while their  conduct is to be criticised perhaps punished  up to now  therefore it has been a most successful policy but the  danger is before us  my own feeling would decidedly be that  all would be spoiled by a single execution  the great hope  after all lies in the knotless rather flaccid character of  the people  these are no maoris  all the powers that  cedarcrantz let go by disuse the new c j is stealthily and  boldly taking back again perhaps some others also  he has  shamed the chiefs in mulinuu into a law against taking heads  with a punishment of six years imprisonment and for a  chief degradation  to him has been left the sole conduct of  this anxious and decisive inquiry  if the natives stand it  why well  but i am nervous    chapter xxxvii    feb 1894   dear colvin  by a reaction when your letter is a little  decent mine is to be naked and unashamed  we have been much  exercised  no one can prophesy here of course and the  balance still hangs trembling but i think it will go for  peace  the mail was very late this time hence the paltryness of  this note  when it came and i had read it i retired with  the ebb tide and read it all before i slept  i did not dream  it was near as good i am afraid i think it excellent  a  little indecision about attwater not much  it gives me  great hope as i see i can work in that constipated mosaic  manner which is what i have to do just now with weir of  hermiston  we have given a ball i send you a paper describing the  event  we have two guests in the house captaincount  wurmbrand and monsieur albert de lautreppe  lautreppe is  awfully nice  a quiet gentlemanly fellow gonfle de reves  as he describes himself  once a sculptor in the atelier of  henry crosse he knows something of art and is really a  resource to me  letter from meredith very kind  have you seen no more of  graham  what about my grandfather  the family history will grow to  be quite a chapter  i suppose i am growing sensitive perhaps by living among  barbarians i expect more civility  look at this from the  author of a very interesting and laudatory critique  he  gives quite a false description of something of mine and  talks about my insolence frankly i supposed insolence  to be a tapua word  i do not use it to a gentleman i would  not write it of a gentleman i may be wrong but i believe we  did not write it of a gentleman in old days and in my view  he clever fellow as he is wants to be kicked for applying  it to me  by writing a novel  even a bad one  i do not  make myself a criminal for anybody to insult  this may amuse  you  but either there is a change in journalism too gradual  for you to remark it on the spot or there is a change in me   i cannot bear these phrases i long to resent them  my  forbears the tenant farmers of the mains would not have  suffered such expressions unless it had been from cauldwell  or rowallan or maybe auchendrane  my family pride bristles   i am like the negro i just heard last night who my great  great great great grandfather was  ever yours  r l s    chapter xxxviii    march 1894   my dear colvin  this is the very day the mail goes and i  have as yet written you nothing  but it was just as well   as it was all about my blacks and chocolates and what of  it had relation to whites you will read some of in the times   it means as you will see that i have at one blow quarrelled  with all the officials of samoa the foreign office and i  suppose her majesty the queen with milk and honey blest  but  youll see in the times  i am very well indeed but just  about dead and mighty glad the mail is near here and i can  just give up all hope of contending with my letters and lie  down for the rest of the day  these times letters are not  easy to write  and i dare say the consuls say why then  does he write them  i had miserable luck with st ives being already halfway  through it a book i had ordered six months ago arrives at  last and i have to change the first half of it from top to  bottom  how could i have dreamed the french prisoners were  watched over like a female charity school kept in a  grotesque livery and shaved twice a week  and i had made  all my points on the idea that they were unshaved and clothed  anyhow  however this last is better business if only the  book had come when i ordered it  a propos many of the books  you announce dont come as a matter of fact  when they are  of any value it is best to register them  your letter  alas is not here i sent it down to the cottage with all my  mail for fanny on sunday night a boy comes up with a  lantern and a note from fanny to say the woods are full of  atuas and i must bring a horse down that instant as the  posts are established beyond her on the road and she does  not want to have the fight going on between us  impossible  to get a horse so i started in the dark on foot with a  revolver and my spurs on my bare feet leaving directions  that the boy should mount after me with the horse  try such  an experience on our road once and do it if you please  after you have been down town from nine oclock till six on  board the shipofwar lunching teaching sunday school i  actually do and making necessary visits and the saturday  before having sat all day from half past six to halfpast  four scriving at my times letter  about halfway up just  in fact at point of the outposts i met fanny coming up   then all night long i was being wakened with scares that  really should be looked into though i knew there was nothing  in them and no bottom to the whole story and the drums and  shouts and cries from tanugamanono and the town keeping up an  all night corybantic chorus in the moonlight  the moon rose  late  and the searchlight of the warship in the harbour  making a jewel of brightness as it lit up the bay of apia in  the distance  and then next morning about eight oclock a  drum coming out of the woods and a party of patrols who had  been in the woods on our left front which is our true rear  coming up to the house and meeting there another party who  had been in the woods on our right  front  rear  which is  vaea mountain and 43 of them being entertained to ava and  biscuits on the verandah and marching off at last in single  file for apia  briefly it is not much wonder if your letter  and my whole mail was left at the cottage and i have no  means of seeing or answering particulars  the whole thing was nothing but a bottomless scare it was  obviously so you couldnt make a child believe it was  anything else but it has made the consuls sit up  my own  private scares were really abominably annoying as for  instance after i had got to sleep for the ninth time perhaps   and that was no easy matter either for i had a crick in my  neck so agonising that i had to sleep sitting up  i heard  noises as of a man being murdered in the boys house  to be  sure said i this is nothing again but if a mans head was  being taken the noises would be the same  so i had to get  up stifle my cries of agony from the crick get my revolver  and creep out stealthily to the boys house  and there were  two of them sitting up keeping watch of their own accord  like good boys and whiling the time over a game of sweepi  cascino  the whist of our islanders  and one of them was  our champion idiot misifolo and i suppose he was holding  bad cards and losing all the time  and these noises were  his humorous protests against fortune  well excuse this excursion into my blacks and chocolates   it is the last  you will have heard from lysaght how i  failed to write last mail  the said lysaght seems to me a  very nice fellow  we were only sorry he could not stay with  us longer  austin came back from school last week which  made a great time for the amanuensis you may be sure  then  on saturday the curacoa came in  same commission with all  our old friends and on sunday as already mentioned austin  and i went down to service and had lunch afterwards in the  wardroom  the officers were awfully nice to austin they are  the most amiable ship in the world and after lunch we had a  paper handed round on which we were to guess and sign our  guess of the number of leaves on the pineapple i never saw  this game before but it seems it is much practised in the  queens navee  when all have betted one of the party begins  to strip the pineapple head and the person whose guess is  furthest out has to pay for the sherry  my equanimity was  disturbed by shouts of the american commodore and i found  that austin had entered and lost about a bottle of sherry   he turned with great composure and addressed me  i am  afraid i must look to you uncle louis  the sunday school  racket is only an experiment which i took up at the request  of the late american land commissioner i am trying it for a  month and if i do as ill as i believe and the boys find it  only half as tedious as i do i think it will end in a month   i have carte blanche and say what i like but does any  single soul understand me  fanny is on the whole very much better  lloyd has been under  the weather and goes for a month to the south island of new  zealand for some skating save the mark  i get all the  skating i want among officials  dear colvin please remember that my life passes among my  blacks or chocolates  if i were to do as you propose in a  bit of a tiff it would cut you off entirely from my life   you must try to exercise a trifle of imagination and put  yourself perhaps with an effort into some sort of sympathy  with these people or how am i to write to you  i think you  are truly a little too cockney with me  ever yours  robert louis stevenson    chapter xxxix    vailima may 18th 1894   my dear colvin  your proposals for the edinburgh edition  are entirely to my mind  about the amateur emigrant it  shall go to you by this mail well slashed  if you like to  slash some more on your own account i give you permission   tis not a great work but since it goes to make up the two  first volumes as proposed i presume it has not been written  in vain  miscellanies  i see with some alarm the proposal  to print juvenilia does it not seem to you taking myself a  little too much as grandfather william  i am certainly not  so young as i once was  a lady took occasion to remind me of  the fact no later agone than last night  why dont you  leave that to the young men mr stevenson said she  but  when i remember that i felt indignant at even john ruskin  when he did something of the kind i really feel myself blush  from head to heel  if you want to make up the first volume  there are a good many works which i took the trouble to  prepare for publication and which have never been  republished  in addition to roads and dancing children  referred to by you there is an autumn effect in the  portfolio and a paper on fontainebleau  forest notes is the  name of it  in cornhill  i have no objection to any of  these being edited say with a scythe and reproduced  but i  heartily abominate and reject the idea of reprinting the  pentland rising  for gods sake let me get buried first  tales and fantasies  vols i and ii have my hearty  approval  but i think iii and iv had better be crammed  into one as you suggest  i will reprint none of the stories  mentioned  they are below the mark  well i dare say the  beastly bodysnatcher has merit and i am unjust to it from  my recollections of the pall mall  but the other two wont  do  for vols v and vi now changed into iv and v i  propose the common title of south sea yarns  there  these  are all my differences of opinion  i agree with every detail  of your arrangement and as you see my objections have  turned principally on the question of hawking unripe fruit   i daresay it is all pretty green but that is no reason for  us to fill the barrow with trash  think of having a new set  of type cast paper especially made etc in order to set up  rubbish that is not fit for the saturday scotsman  it would  be the climax of shame  i am sending you a lot of verses which had best i think be  called underwoods book iii but in what order are they to  go  also i am going on every day a little till i get sick  of it with the attempt to get the emigrant compressed into  life i know i can  or you can after me  do it  it is only  a question of time and prayer and ink and should leave  something no not good but not all bad  a very genuine  appreciation of these folks  you are to remember besides  there is that paper of mine on bunyan in the magazine of art   o and then theres another thing in seeley called some  spewsome name i cannot recall it  well  come here goes for juvenilia  dancing infants  roads an autumn effect forest notes but this should come  at the end of them as its really rather riper the tother  thing from seeley and ill tell you you may put in my  letter to the church of scotland  its not written amiss  and i daresay the philosophy of umbrellas might go in but  there i stick  and remember that was a collaboration with  james walter ferrier  o and there was a little skit called  the charity bazaar which you might see i dont think it  would do  now i do not think there are two other words that  should be printed  by the way there is an article of mine  called the day after tomorrow in the contemporary which you  might find room for somewhere it is no bad  very busy with all these affairs and some native ones also    chapter xl    vailima june 18th 94   my dear colvin  you are to please understand that my last  letter is withdrawn unconditionally  you and baxter are  having all the trouble of this edition and i simply put  myself in your hands for you to do what you like with me and  i am sure that will be the best at any rate  hence you are  to conceive me withdrawing all objections to your printing  anything you please  after all it is a sort of family  affair  about the miscellany section both plans seem to me  quite good  toss up  i think the old gardener has to stay  where i put him last  it would not do to separate john and  robert  in short i am only sorry i ever uttered a word about the  edition and leave you to be the judge  i have had a vile  cold which has prostrated me for more than a fortnight and  even now tears me nightly with spasmodic coughs but it has  been a great victory  i have never borne a cold with so  little hurt wait till the clouds blow by before you begin  to boast  i have had no fever and though ive been very  unhappy it is nigh over i think  of course st ives has  paid the penalty  i must not let you be disappointed in st  i  it is a mere tissue of adventures the central figure not  very well or very sharply drawn no philosophy no destiny  to it some of the happenings very good in themselves i  believe but none of them bildende none of them  constructive except in so far perhaps as they make up a kind  of sham picture of the time all in italics and all out of  drawing  here and there i think it is well written and  here and there its not  some of the episodic characters are  amusing i do believe others not i suppose  however they  are the best of the thing such as it is  if it has a merit  to it i should say it was a sort of deliberation and swing  to the style which seems to me to suit the mailcoaches and  postchaises with which it sounds all through  tis my most  prosaic book  i called on the two german ships now in port and we are  quite friendly with them and intensely friendly of course  with our own curacoas  but it is other guess work on the  beach  some one has employed or subsidised one of the  local editors to attack me once a week  he is pretty  scurrilous and pretty false  the first effect of the perusal  of the weekly beast is to make me angry the second is a kind  of deep golden content and glory when i seem to say to  people see this is my position  i am a plain man dwelling  in the bush in a house and behold they have to get up this  kind of truck against me  and i have so much influence that  they are obliged to write a weekly article to say i have  none  by this time you must have seen lysaght and forgiven me the  letter that came not at all  he was really so nice a fellow   he had so much to tell me of meredith  and the time was so  short  that i gave up the intervening days between mails  entirely to entertain him  we go on pretty nicely  fanny belle and i have had two  months alone and it has been very pleasant  but by to morrow or next day noon we shall see the whole clan  assembled again about vailima table which will be pleasant  too seven persons in all and the babel of voices will be  heard again in the big hall so long empty and silent  good bye  love to all  time to close  yours ever  r l s    chapter xli    july 1894   my dear colvin  i have to thank you this time for a very  good letter and will announce for the future though i  cannot now begin to put in practice good intentions for our  correspondence  i will try to return to the old system and  write from time to time during the month but truly you did  not much encourage me to continue  however that is all by past  i do not know that there is much in your letter that  calls for answer  your questions about st ives were  practically answered in my last so were your wails about the  edition amateur emigrant etc  by the end of the year st  i will be practically finished whatever it be worth and  that i know not  when shall i receive proofs of the magnum  opus or shall i receive them at all  the return of the amanuensis feebly lightens my heart  you  can see the heavy weather i was making of it with my unaided  pen  the last month has been particularly cheery largely  owing to the presence of our good friends the curacoas  she  is really a model ship charming officers and charming  seamen  they gave a ball last month which was very rackety  and joyous and naval     on the following day about one oclock three horsemen might  have been observed approaching vailima who gradually  resolved themselves into two petty officers and a native  guide  drawing himself up and saluting the spokesman a  corporal of marines addressed me thus  me and my shipmates  inwites mr and mrs stevens mrs strong mr austin and  mr balfour to a ball to be given tonight in the selfsame  all  it was of course impossible to refuse though i  contented myself with putting in a very brief appearance   one glance was sufficient the ball went off like a rocket  from the start  i had only time to watch belle careering  around with a gallant bluejacket of exactly her own height   the standard of the british navy  an excellent dancer and  conspicuously full of smalltalk  and to hear a remark from  a beachcomber its a nice sight this some way to see the  officers dancing like this with the men but i tell you sir  these are the men thatll fight together  i tell you colvin the acquaintance of the men  and boys   makes me feel patriotic  eeles in particular is a man whom i  respect  i am half in a mind to give him a letter of  introduction to you when he goes home  in case you feel  inclined to make a little of him give him a dinner ask  henry james to come to meet him etc  you might let me  know  i dont know that he would show his best but he is a  remarkably fine fellow in every department of life  we have other visitors in port  a count festetics de solna  an austrian officer a very pleasant simple boyish  creature with his young wife daughter of an american  millionaire he is a friend of our own captain wurmbrand and  it is a great pity wurmbrand is away  glad you saw and liked lysaght  he has left in our house a  most cheerful and pleasing memory as a good pleasant brisk  fellow with good health and brains and who enjoys himself  and makes other people happy  i am glad he gave you a good  report of our surroundings and way of life but i knew he  would for i believe he had a glorious time  and gave one  i am on fair terms with the two treaty officials though all  such intimacies are precarious with the consuls i need not  say my position is deplorable  the president herr emil  schmidt is a rather dreamy man whom i like  lloyd graham  and i go to breakfast with him tomorrow the next day the  whole party of us lunch on the curacoa and go in the evening  to a bierabend at dr funks  we are getting up a paper chase for the following week with some of the young german  clerks and have in view a sort of childs party for grownup  persons with kissing games etc here at vailima  such is  the gay scene in which we move  now i have done something  though not as much as i wanted to give you an idea of how we  are getting on and i am keenly conscious that there are  other letters to do before the mail goes  yours ever  r l stevenson    chapter xlii    aug 7th   my dear colvin  this is to inform you sir that on sunday  last and this is tuesday i attained my ideal here and we  had a paper chase in vailele plantation about 15 miles i  take it from us and it was all that could be wished  it is  really better fun than following the hounds since you have  to be your own hound and a precious bad hound i was  following every false scent on the whole course to the bitter  end but i came in 3rd at the last on my little jack who  stuck to it gallantly and awoke the praises of some  discriminating persons  5  7  25  145 miles yes that  is the count  we had quite the old sensations of  exhilaration discovery an appeal to a savage instinct and  i felt myself about 17 again a pleasant experience   however it was on the sabbath day and i am now a pariah  among the english as if i needed any increment of  unpopularity  i must not go again it gives so much  unnecessary tribulation to poor people and sure we dont  want to make tribulation  i have been forbidden to work and  have been instead doing my two or three hours in the  plantation every morning  i only wish somebody would pay me  10 pounds a day for taking care of cacao and i could leave  literature to others  certainly if i have plenty of  exercise and no work i feel much better but there is biles  the butcher him we have always with us  i do not much like novels i begin to think but i am  enjoying exceedingly ormes history of hindostan a lovely  book in its way in large quarto with a quantity of maps  and written in a very lively and solid eighteenth century  way never picturesque except by accident and from a kind of  conviction and a fine sense of order  no historian i have  ever read is so minute yet he never gives you a word about  the people his interest is entirely limited in the  concatenation of events into which he goes with a lucid  almost superhuman and wholly ghostly gusto  by the ghost  of a mathematician the book might be announced  a very  brave honest book  your letter to hand  fact is i dont like the picter  o its a good picture  but if you ask me you know i believe stoutly believe that  mankind including you are going mad i am not in the midst  with the other frenzy dancers so i dont catch it wholly  and when you show me a thing  and ask me dont you know   well well  glad to get so good an account of the amateur  emigrant  talking of which i am strong for making a volume  out of selections from the south sea letters i read over  again the king of apemama and it is good in spite of your  teeth and a real curiosity a thing that can never be seen  again and the group is annexed and tembinoka dead  i  wonder couldnt you send out to me the first five butaritari  letters and the low archipelago ones both of which i have  lost or mislaid and i can chop out a perfectly fair volume  of what i wish to be preserved  it can keep for the last of  the series  travels and excursions vol ii  should it not include a  paper on s f from the mag of art  the a e the new  pacific capital the old ditto  silver squat  this would  give all my works on the states and though it aint very  good its not so very bad  travels and excursions vol   iii to be these resuscitated letters  miscellanies vol  ii  comme vous voudrez cher monsieur   monday aug 13th   i have a sudden call to go up the coast and must hurry up  with my information  there has suddenly come to our naval  commanders the need of action theyre away up the coast  bombarding the atua rebels  all morning on saturday the  sound of the bombardment of lotuanuu kept us uneasy  today  again the big guns have been sounding further along the  coast  tomorrow morning early i am off up the coast myself   therefore you must allow me to break off here without further  ceremony  yours ever  robert louis stevenson    chapter xliii    vailima 1894   my dear colvin  this must be a very measly letter  i have  been trying hard to get along with st ives  i should now  lay it aside for a year and i daresay i should make something  of it after all  instead of that i have to kick against the  pricks and break myself and spoil the book if there were  anything to spoil which i am far from saying  im as sick  of the thing as ever any one can be its a rudderless hulk  its a pagoda and you can just feel  or i can feel  that  it might have been a pleasant story if it had been only  blessed at baptism  our politics have gone on fairly well but the result is  still doubtful   sept 10th   i know i have something else to say to you but unfortunately  i awoke this morning with collywobbles and had to take a  small dose of laudanum with the usual consequences of dry  throat intoxicated legs partial madness and total  imbecility and for the life of me i cannot remember what it  is  i have likewise mislaid your letter amongst the  accumulations on my table not that there was anything in it   altogether i am in a poor state  i forgot to tell baxter  that the dummy had turned up and is a fine personable looking volume and very good reading  please communicate  this to him  i have just remembered an incident that i really must not let  pass  you have heard a great deal more than you wanted about  our political prisoners  well one day about a fortnight  ago the last of them was set free  old poe whom i think i  must have mentioned to you the fatherinlaw of my cook was  one that i had had a great deal of trouble with  i had taken  the doctor to see him got him out on sick leave and when he  was put back again gave bail for him  i must not forget that  my wife ran away with him out of the prison on the doctors  orders and with the complicity of our friend the gaoler who  really and truly got the sack for the exploit  as soon as he  was finally liberated poe called a meeting of his fellow prisoners  all sunday they were debating what they were to  do and on monday morning i got an obscure hint from talolo  that i must expect visitors during the day who were coming to  consult me  these consultations i am now very well used to  and seeing first that i generally dont know what to advise  and second that they sometimes dont take my advice  though  in some notable cases they have taken it generally to my own  wonder with pretty good results  i am not very fond of these  calls  they minister to a sense of dignity but not peace of  mind and consume interminable time always in the morning  too when i cant afford it  however this was to be a new  sort of consultation  up came poe and some eight other  chiefs squatted in a big circle around the old diningroom  floor now the smokingroom  and the family being  represented by lloyd graham belle austin and myself  proceeded to exchange the necessary courtesies  then their  talking man began  he said that they had been in prison  that i had always taken an interest in them that they had  now been set at liberty without condition whereas some of  the other chiefs who had been liberated before them were  still under bond to work upon the roads and that this had  set them considering what they might do to testify their  gratitude  they had therefore agreed to work upon my road as  a free gift  they went on to explain that it was only to be  on my road on the branch that joins my house with the public  way  now i was very much gratified at this compliment although  to one used to natives it seemed rather a hollow one  it  meant only that i should have to lay out a good deal of money  on tools and food and to give wages under the guise of  presents to some workmen who were most of them old and in  illhealth  conceive how much i was surprised and touched  when i heard the whole scheme explained to me  they were to  return to their provinces and collect their families some  of the young men were to live in apia with a boat and ply up  and down the coast to aana and atua our own tuamasaga  being quite drained of resources in order to supply the  working squad with food  tools they did ask for but it was  especially mentioned that i was to make no presents  in  short the whole of this little presentation to me had been  planned with a good deal more consideration than goes usually  with a native campaign   i sat on the opposite side of the circle to the talking man   his face was quite calm and highbred as he went through the  usual samoan expressions of politeness and compliment but  when he came on to the object of their visit on their love  and gratitude to tusitala how his name was always in their  prayers and his goodness to them when they had no other  friend was their most cherished memory he warmed up to  real burning genuine feeling  i had never seen the samoan  mask of reserve laid aside before and it touched me more  than anything else  am   this morning as ever was bright and early up came the whole  gang of them a lot of sturdy commonlooking lads they  seemed to be for the most part and fell to on my new road   old poe was in the highest of good spirits and looked better  in health than he has done any time in two years being  positively rejuvenated by the success of his scheme  he  jested as he served out the new tools and i am sorry to say  damned the government up hill and down dale probably with a  view to show off his position as a friend of the family  before his workboys  now whether or not their impulse will  last them through the road does not matter to me one hair   it is the fact that they have attempted it that they have  volunteered and are now really trying to execute a thing that  was never before heard of in samoa  think of it  it is  roadmaking  the most fruitful cause after taxes of all  rebellions in samoa a thing to which they could not be wiled  with money nor driven by punishment  it does give me a sense  of having done something in samoa after all  now theres one long story for you about my blacks  yours  ever  robert louis stevenson    chapter xliv    vailima samoa oct 6th 1894   my dear colvin  we have had quite an interesting month and  mostly in consideration of that road which i think i told you  was about to be made  it was made without a hitch though i  confess i was considerably surprised  when they got through  i wrote a speech to them sent it down to a missionary to be  translated and invited the lot to a feast  i thought a good  deal of this feast  the occasion was really interesting  i  wanted to pitch it in hot  and i wished to have as many  influential witnesses present as possible  well as it drew  towards the day i had nothing but refusals  everybody  supposed it was to be a political occasion that i had made a  hive of rebels up here and was going to push for new  hostilities  the amanuensis has been ill and after the above trial  petered out  i must return to my own lone waverley  the  captain refused telling me why and at last i had to beat up  for people almost with prayers  however i got a good lot  as you will see by the accompanying newspaper report  the  road contained this inscription drawn up by the chiefs  themselves   the road of gratitude   considering the great love of tusitala in his loving care of  us in our distress in the prison we have therefore prepared  a splendid gift  it shall never be muddy it shall endure  for ever this road that we have dug  this the newspaper  reporter could not give not knowing any samoan  the same  reason explains his references to seumanutafas speech which  was not long and was important for it was a speech of  courtesy and forgiveness to his former enemies  it was very  much applauded  secondly it was not poe it was mataafa  dont confuse with mataafa who spoke for the prisoners   otherwise it is extremely correct  i beg your pardon for so much upon my aboriginals  even you  must sympathise with me in this unheardof compliment and my  having been able to deliver so severe a sermon with  acceptance  it remains a nice point of conscience what i  should wish done in the matter  i think this meeting its  immediate results and the terms of what i said to them  desirable to be known  it will do a little justice to me  who have not had too much justice done me  at the same time  to send this report to the papers is truly an act of self advertisement and i dislike the thought  query in a man  who has been so much calumniated is that not justifiable  i  do not know be my judge  mankind is too complicated for me  even myself  do i wish to advertise  i think i do god help  me  i have had hard times here as every man must have who  mixes up with public business and i bemoan myself knowing  that all i have done has been in the interest of peace and  good government and having once delivered my mind i would  like it i think to be made public  but the other part of  me regimbs  i know i am at a climacteric for all men who live by their  wits so i do not despair  but the truth is i am pretty  nearly useless at literature and i will ask you to spare st  ives when it goes to you it is a sort of count robert of  paris  but i hope rather a dombey and son to be succeeded  by our mutual friend and great expectations and a tale of two  cities  no toil has been spared over the ungrateful canvas  and it will not come together and i must live and my  family  were it not for my health which made it impossible  i could not find it in my heart to forgive myself that i did  not stick to an honest commonplace trade when i was young  which might have now supported me during these ill years   but do not suppose me to be down in anything else only for  the nonce my skill deserts me such as it is or was  it  was a very little dose of inspiration and a pretty little  trick of style long lost improved by the most heroic  industry  so far i have managed to please the journalists   but i am a fictitious article and have long known it  i am  read by journalists by my fellownovelists and by boys  with these incipit et explicit my vogue  good thing anyway  for it seems to have sold the edition  and i look forward  confidently to an aftermath i do not think my health can be  so hugely improved without some subsequent improvement in my  brains  though of course there is the possibility that  literature is a morbid secretion and abhors health  i do  not think it is possible to have fewer illusions than i  i  sometimes wish i had more  they are amusing  but i cannot  take myself seriously as an artist the limitations are so  obvious  i did take myself seriously as a workman of old  but my practice has fallen off  i am now an idler and  cumberer of the ground it may be excused to me perhaps by  twenty years of industry and illhealth which have taken the  cream off the milk  as i was writing this last sentence i heard the strident  rain drawing near across the forest and by the time i was  come to the word cream it burst upon my roof and has since  redoubled and roared upon it  a very welcome change  all  smells of the good wet earth sweetly with a kind of  highland touch the crystal rods of the shower as i look up  have drawn their crisscross over everything and a gentle  and very welcome coolness comes up around me in little  draughts blessed draughts not chilling only equalising the  temperature  now the rain is off in this spot but i hear it  roaring still in the nigh neighbourhood  and that moment i  was driven from the verandah by random rain drops spitting  at me through the japanese blinds  these are not tears with  which the page is spotted  now the windows stream the roof  reverberates  it is good it answers something which is in  my heart i know not what old memories of the wet moorland  belike  well it has blown by again and i am in my place once more  with an accompaniment of perpetual dripping on the verandah   and very much inclined for a chat  the exact subject i do  not know  it will be bitter at least and that is strange  for my attitude is essentially not bitter but i have come  into these days when a man sees above all the seamy side and  i have dwelt some time in a small place where he has an  opportunity of reading little motives that he would miss in  the great world and indeed today i am almost ready to  call the world an error  because  because i have not  drugged myself with successful work and there are all kinds  of trifles buzzing in my ear unfriendly trifles from the  least to the  well to the pretty big  all these that touch  me are pretty big and yet none touch me in the least if  rightly looked at except the one eternal burthen to go on  making an income  if i could find a place where i could lie  down and give up for say two years and allow the sainted  public to support me if it were a lunatic asylum wouldnt i  go just  but we cant have both extremes at once worse  luck  i should like to put my savings into a proprietarian  investment and retire in the meanwhile into a communistic  retreat which is doubledealing  but you men with salaries  dont know how a family weighs on a fellows mind  i hear the article in next weeks herald is to be a great  affair and all the officials who came to me the other day  are to be attacked  this is the unpleasant side of being  without a salary in public life i will leave anyone to  judge if my speech was well intended and calculated to do  good  it was even daring  i assure you one of the chiefs  looked like a fiend at my description of samoan warfare   your warning was not needed we are all determined to keep  the peace and to hold our peace  i know my dear fellow how  remote all this sounds  kindly pardon your friend  i have  my life to live here these interests are for me immediate  and if i do not write of them i might as soon not write at  all  there is the difficulty in a distant correspondence   it is perhaps easy for me to enter into and understand your  interests i own it is difficult for you but you must just  wade through them for friendships sake and try to find  tolerable what is vital for your friend  i cannot forbear  challenging you to it as to intellectual lists  it is the  proof of intelligence the proof of not being a barbarian to  be able to enter into something outside of oneself something  that does not touch ones next neighbour in the city omnibus  goodbye my lord  may your race continue and you flourish   yours ever  tusitala
