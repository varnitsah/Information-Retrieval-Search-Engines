scored   pillingshot was annoyed he was disgusted mortified no other word for it he had no objection of course to mr mellish saying that his work during the term and especially his livy had been disgraceful a master has the right to say that sort of thing if he likes it is one of the perquisites of the position but when he went on to observe without a touch of shame that there would be an examination in the livy as far as they had gone in it on the following saturday pillingshot felt that he exceeded it was not playing the game there were the examinations at the end of term those were fair enough you knew exactly when they were coming and could make your arrangements accordingly but to spring an examination on you in the middle of the term out of a blue sky as it were was underhand and unsportsmanlike and would not do at all pillingshot wished that he could put his foot down he would have liked to have stalked up to mr mellishs desk fixed him with a blazing eye and remarked sir withdraw that remark cancel that statement instantly or or words to that effect  what he did say was oo siir  yes said mr mellish not troubling to conceal his triumph at pillingshots reception of the news there will be a livy examination next saturday and he almost intoned this last observationanybody who does not get fifty per cent pillingshot fifty per cent will be severely punished very severely punished pillingshot  after which the lesson had proceeded on its course  yes it is rather low isnt it said pillingshots friend parker as pillingshot came to the end of a stirring excursus on the rights of the citizen with special reference to midterm livy examinations thats the worst of mellish he always has you somehow  but what am i to do raved pillingshot  i should advise you to swot it up before saturday said parker  oh dont be an ass said pillingshot irritably  what was the good of friends if they could only make idiotic suggestions like that  he retired brooding to his house  the day was wednesday there were only two more days therefore in which to prepare a quarter of a book of livy it couldnt be done the thing was not possible  in the house he met smythe  what are you going to do about it he inquired smythe was top of the form and if he didnt know how to grapple with a crisis of this sort who could know  if youll kindly explain said smythe what the dickens you are talking about i might be able to tell you  pillingshot explained with unwonted politeness that it meant the livy examination  oh said smythe airily that im just going to skim through it in case ive forgotten any of it then i shall read up the notes carefully and then if i have time i shall have a look at the history of the period i should advise you to do that too  oh dont be a goat said pillingshot  and he retired brooding as before  that afternoon he spent industriously copying out the fourth book of the aeneid at the beginning of the week he had had a slight disagreement with m gerard the french master  pillingshots views on behaviour and deportment during french lessons did not coincide with those of m gerard pillingshots idea of a french lesson was something between a pantomime rally and a scrum at football to him there was something wonderfully entertaining in the process of barging the end man off the edge of the form into space and upsetting his books over him m gerard however had a very undeveloped sense of humour he warned the humorist twice and on the thing happening a third time suggested that he should go into extra lesson on the ensuing wednesday  so pillingshot went and copied out virgil  he emerged from the room of detention at a quarter past four as he came out into the grounds he espied in the middle distance somebody being carried on a stretcher in the direction of the school house at the same moment parker loomed in sight walking swiftly towards the school shop his mobile features shining with the rapt expression of one who sees much gingerbeer in the near future  hullo parker said pillingshot whos the corpse  what havent you heard said parker oh no of course you were in extra its young brown hes stunned or something  how did it happen  that rotter babington in dacres simply slamming about you know getting his eye in before going in and brown walked slap into one of his drives got him on the side of the head  much hurt  oh no i dont think so keep him out of school for about a week  lucky beast wish somebody would come and hit me on the head come and hit me on the head parker  come and have an ice said parker  rightho said pillingshot it was one of his peculiarities that whatever the hour or the state of the weather he was always equal to consuming an ice this was probably due to genius he had an infinite capacity for taking pains scarcely was he outside the promised ice when another misfortune came upon him scott of the first eleven entered the shop pillingshot liked scott but he was not blind to certain flaws in the latters character for one thing he was too energetic for another he could not keep his energy to himself he was always making pillingshot do things and pillingshots notion of the ideal life was complete dolce far niente  gingerbeer please said scott with parched lips he had been bowling at the nets and the day was hot hullo pillingshot you young slacker why arent you changed been bunking halfholiday games youd better reform young man  ive been in extra said pillingshot with dignity  how many times does that make this term youre going for the record arent you jolly sporting of you bit slow in there wasnt it nother gingerbeer please  just a bit said pillingshot  i thought so and now youre dying for some excitement of course you are well cut over to the house and change and then come back and field at the nets the man yorke is going to bowl me some of his celebrated slow tosh and im going to show him exactly how jessop does it when hes in form  scott was the biggest hitter in the school mr yorke was one of the masters he bowled slow legbreaks mostly halfvolleys and long hops pillingshot had a sort of instinctive idea that fielding out in the deep with mr yorke bowling and scott batting would not contribute largely to the gaiety of his afternoon fielding deep at the nets meant that you stood in the middle of the football field where there was no telling what a ball would do if it came at you along the ground if you were lucky you escaped without injury generally however the ball bumped and deprived you of wind or teeth according to the height to which it rose he began politely but firmly to excuse himself  dont talk rot said scott complainingly you must have some exercise or youll go getting fat think what a blow it would be to your family pillingshot if you lost your figure buck up if youre back here in a quarter of an hour you shall have another ice a large ice pillingshot price sixpence think of it  the word ice as has been remarked before touched chords in pillingshots nature to which he never turned a deaf ear within the prescribed quarter of an hour he was back again changed  heres the ice said scott ive been keeping it warm for you shovel it down i want to be starting for the nets quicker man quicker dont roll it round your tongue as if it was port go for it finished thats right come on  pillingshot had not finished but scott so evidently believed that he had that it would have been unkind to have mentioned the fact he followed the smiter to the nets  if pillingshot had passed the earlier part of the afternoon in a sedentary fashion he made up for it now scott was in rare form and pillingshot noticed with no small interest that while he invariably hit mr yorkes deliveries a quarter of a mile or so he never hit two balls in succession in the same direction as soon as the panting fieldsman had sprinted to one side of the football ground and returned the ball there was a beautiful musical plonk and the ball soared to the very opposite quarter of the field it was a fine exhibition of hitting but pillingshot felt that he would have enjoyed it more if he could have watched it from a deckchair  youre coming on as a deep field young pillingshot said scott as he took off his pads youve got a knack of stopping them with your stomach which the best firstclass fields never have you ought to give lessons at it now well go and have some tea  if pillingshot had had a more intimate acquaintance with the classics he would have observed at this point timeo danaos and made a last dash for liberty in the direction of the shop but he was deceived by the specious nature of scotts remark visions rose before his eyes of sitting back in one of scotts armchairs watching a fag toasting muffins which he would eventually dispatch with languid enjoyment so he followed scott to his study the classical parallel to his situation is the wellknown case of the oysters they too were eager for the treat  they had reached the study and pillingshot was about to fling himself with a sigh of relief into the most comfortable chair when scott unmasked his batteries  oh by the way he said with a coolness which to pillingshot appeared simply brazen im afraid my fag wont be here today the young crocks gone and got mumps or the plague or something so would you mind just lighting that stove itll be rather warm but that wont matter there are some muffins in the cupboard you might weigh in with them youll find the toastingfork on the wall somewhere its hanging up got it good man fire away  and scott collected five cushions two chairs and a tin of mixed biscuits and made himself comfortable pillingshot with feelings too deep for words in the then limited state of his vocabulary did as he was requested there was something remarkable about the way scott could always get people to do things for him he seemed to take everything for granted if he had had occasion to hire an assassin to make away with the german emperor he would have said oh i say you might run over to germany and kill the kaiser will you theres a good chap dont be long and he would have taken a seat and waited without the least doubt in his mind that the thing would be carried through as desired  pillingshot had just finished toasting the muffins when the door opened and venables of merevales came in  i thought i heard you say something about tea this afternoon scott said venables i just looked in on the chance good heavens man fancy muffins at this time of year do you happen to know what the thermometer is in the shade  take a seat said scott i attribute my entire success in life to the fact that i never find it too hot to eat muffins do you know pillingshot one of the hottest fieldsmen in the school at least he was just now hes probably cooled off since then venablespillingshot and vice versa buck up with the tea pillingshot what ready good man now we might almost begin  beastly thing that accident of young browns wasnt it said scott chaps oughtnt to go slamming about like that with the field full of fellows i suppose he wont be right by next saturday  not a chance why oh yes i forgot he was to have scored for the team at windybury wasnt he  who are you going to get now  venables was captain of the st austins team the match next saturday was at windybury on the latters ground  i havent settled said venables but its easy to get somebody scoring isnt one of those things which only one chap in a hundred understands  then pillingshot had an ideaa great luminous idea  may i score he asked and waited trembling with apprehension lest the request be refused  all right said venables i dont see any reason why you shouldnt we have to catch the 814 at the station dont you go missing it or anything  rather not said pillingshot not much                                                     on saturday morning at exactly 915 mr mellish distributed the livy papers when he arrived at pillingshots seat and found it empty an expression passed over his face like unto that of the baffled villain in transpontine melodrama  where is pillingshot he demanded tragically where is he  hes gone with the team to windybury sir said parker struggling to conceal a large size in grins hes going to score  no said mr mellish sadly to himself he has scored     2  the odd trick   the attitude of philip st h harrison of merevales house towards his fellowman was outwardly one of genial and even sympathetic toleration did his formmaster intimate that his conduct was not his idea of what young englands conduct should be p st h harrison agreed cheerfully with every word he said warmly approved his intention of laying the matter before the headmaster and accepted his punishment with the air of a waiter booking an order for a chump chop and fried potatoes but the next day there would be a squeaking desk in the formroom just to show the master that he had not been forgotten or again did the captain of his side at football speak rudely to him on the subject of kicking the ball through in the scrum harrison would smile gently and at the earliest opportunity tread heavily on the captains toe in short he was a youth who made a practice of taking very good care of himself yet he had his failures the affair of grahams mackintosh was one of them and it affords an excellent example of the truth of the proverb that a cobbler should stick to his last harrisons forte was diplomacy when he forsook the arts of the diplomatist for those of the brigand he naturally went wrong and the manner of these things was thus  tony graham was a prefect in merevales and part of his duties was to look after the dormitory of which harrison was one of the ornaments it was a dormitory that required a good deal of keeping in order such choice spirits as braithwaite of the upper fourth and mace who was rapidly driving the master of the lower fifth into a premature grave needed a firm hand indeed they generally needed not only a firm hand but a firm hand grasping a serviceable walkingstick add to these harrison himself and others of a similar calibre and it will be seen that grahams post was no sinecure it was harrisons custom to throw off his mask at night with his other garments and appear in his true character of an abandoned villain willing to stick at nothing as long as he could do it strictly incog in this capacity he had come into constant contact with graham even in the dark it is occasionally possible for a prefect to tell where a noise comes from and if the said prefect has been harassed six days in the week by a noise and locates it suddenly on the seventh it is wont to be bad for the producer and patentee of same  and so it came about that harrison enjoying himself one night after the manner of his kind was suddenly dropped upon with violence he had constructed an ingenious machine consisting of a biscuit tin some pebbles and some string he put the pebbles in the tin tied the string to it and placed it under a chest of drawers then he took the other end of the string to bed with him and settled down to make a night of it at first all went well repeated inquiries from tony failed to produce the author of the disturbance and when finally the questions ceased and the prefect appeared to have given the matter up as a bad job p st h harrison began to feel that under certain circumstances life was worth living it was while he was in this happy frame of mind that the string with which he had just produced a triumphant rattle from beneath the chest of drawers was seized and the next instant its owner was enjoying the warmest minute of a chequered career tony like brer rabbit had laid low until he was certain of the direction from which the sound proceeded he had then slipped out of bed crawled across the floor in a snakelike manner which would have done credit to a red indian found the tin and traced the string to its owner harrison emerged from the encounter feeling sore and unfit for any further recreation this deed of the night left its impression on harrison the account had to be squared somehow and in a few days his chance came merevales were playing a friendly with the school house and in default of anybody better harrison had been pressed into service as umpire this in itself had annoyed him cricket was not in his linehe was not one of your flannelled foolsand of all things in connection with the game he loathed umpiring most  when however tony came on to bowl at his end vice charteris who had been hit for three fours in an over by scott the school slogger he recognized that even umpiring had its advantages and resolved to make the most of the situation  scott had the bowling and he lashed out at tonys first ball in his usual reckless style there was an audible click and what the sporting papers call confident appeals came simultaneously from welch merevales captain who was keeping wicket and tony himself even scott seemed to know that his time had come he moved a step or two away from the wicket but stopped before going farther to look at the umpire on the offchance of a miracle happening to turn his decision in the batsmans favour  the miracle happened  not out said harrison  awfully curious he added genially to tony how like a bat those bits of grass sound you have to be jolly smart to know where a noise comes from dont you  tony grunted disgustedly and walked back again to the beginning of his run  if ever in the whole history of cricket a man was out legbeforewicket scott was so out to tonys second ball it was hardly worth appealing for such a certainty still the formality had to be gone through  how was that inquired tony  not out its an awful pity dont you think that they dont bring in that new legbefore rule  seems to me said tony bitterly the old rule holds pretty good when a mans legs bang in front  rather but you see the ball didnt pitch straight and the rule says  oh all right said tony  the next ball scott hit for four and the next after that for a couple the fifth was a yorker and just grazed the leg stump the sixth was a beauty you could see it was going to beat the batsman from the moment it left tonys hand harrison saw it perfectly  no ball he shouted and just as he spoke scotts offstump ricocheted towards the wicketkeeper  heavens man said tony fairly roused out of his cricket manners a very unusual thing for him ill swear my foot never went over the crease look theres the mark  rather not only you see it seemed to me you chucked that time of course i know you didnt mean to and all that sort of thing but still the rules  tony would probably have liked to have said something very forcible about the rules at this point but it occurred to him that after all harrison was only within his rights and that it was bad form to dispute the umpires decision harrison walked off towards squareleg with a holy joy  but he was too much of an artist to overdo the thing tonys next over passed off without interference possibly however this was because it was a very bad one after the third over he asked welch if he could get somebody else to umpire as he had work to do welch heaved a sigh of relief and agreed readily  conscientious sort of chap that umpire of yours said scott to tony after the match scott had made a hundred and four and was feeling pleased considering hes in your house hes awfully fair  you mean that we generally swindle i suppose  of course not you rotter you know what i mean but i say that catch welch and you appealed for must have been a near thing i could have sworn i hit it  of course you did it was clean out so was the lbw i say did you think that ball that bowled you was a chuck that one in my first over you know  chuck my dear tony you dont mean to say that man pulled you up for chucking i thought your foot must have gone over the crease  i believe the chaps mad said tony  perhaps hes taking it out of you this way for treading on his corns somehow have you been milling with this gentle youth lately  by jove said tony youre right i gave him beans only the other night for ragging in the dormitory  scott laughed  well he seems to have been getting a bit of his own back today lucky the game was only a friendly why will you let your angry passions rise tony youve wrecked your analysis by it though its improved my average considerably i dont know if thats any solid satisfaction to you  it isnt  you dont say so well so long if i were you i should keep an eye on that conscientious umpire  i will said tony goodnight  the process of keeping an eye on harrison brought no results when he wished to behave himself well he could on such occasions sandford and merton were literally not in it with him and the hero of a sundayschool story would simply have refused to compete but nemesis as the poets tell us though no sprinter manages like the celebrated maisie to get right there in time give her time and she will arrive she arrived in the case of harrison one morning about a fortnight after the housematch incident harrison awoke with a new sensation at first he could not tell what exactly this sensation was and being too sleepy to discuss nice points of internal emotion with himself was just turning over with the intention of going to sleep again when the truth flashed upon him the sensation he felt was loneliness and the reason he felt lonely was because he was the only occupant of the dormitory to right and left and all around were empty beds  as he mused drowsily on these portents the distant sound of a bell came to his ears and completed the cure it was the bell for chapel he dragged his watch from under his pillow and looked at it with consternation four minutes to seven and chapel was at seven now harrison had been late for chapel before it was not the thought of missing the service that worried him what really was serious was that he had been late so many times before that merevale had hinted at serious steps to be taken if he were late again or at any rate until a considerable interval of punctuality had elapsed  that threat had been uttered only yesterday and here he was in all probability late once more  there was no time to dress he sprang out of bed passed a sponge over his face as a concession to the decencies and looked round for something to cover his nightshirt which however suitable for dormitory use was he felt instinctively scarcely the garment to wear in public  fate seemed to fight for him on one of the pegs in the wall hung a mackintosh a large blessed mackintosh he was inside it in a moment  four minutes later he rushed into his place in chapel  the short service gave him some time for recovering himself he left the building feeling a new man his costume though quaint would not call for comment chapel at st austins was never a fulldress ceremony mackintoshes covering nightshirts were the rule rather than the exception  but between his costume and that of the rest there was this subtle distinction they wore their own mackintoshes he wore somebody elses  the bulk of the school had split up into sections each section making for its own house and merevales was already in sight when harrison felt himself grasped from behind he turned to see graham  might i ask enquired tony with great politeness who said you might wear my mackintosh  harrison gasped  i suppose you didnt know it was mine  no no rather not i didnt know  and if you had known it was mine you wouldnt have taken it i suppose  oh no of course not said harrison graham seemed to be taking an unexpectedly sensible view of the situation  well said tony now that you know that it is mine suppose you give it up  give it up  yes buck up it looks like rain and i mustnt catch cold  but graham ive only got on  spare us these delicate details mack up please i want it  finally harrison appearing to be difficult in the matter tony took the garment off for him and went on his way  harrison watched him go with mixed feelings righteous indignation struggled with the gravest apprehension regarding his own future if merevale should see him horrible thought he ran he had just reached the house and was congratulating himself on having escaped when the worst happened at the private entrance stood merevale and with him the headmaster himself they both eyed him with considerable interest as he shot in at the boys entrance  harrison said merevale after breakfast  yes sir  the headmaster wishes to see youagain  yes sir said harrison  there was a curious lack of enthusiasm in his voice     3  laffaire uncle john a story in letters    i  from richard venables of st austins school to his brother archibald venables of kings college cambridge  dear archiei take up my pen to write to you not as one hoping for an answer but rather in order that you notice the thucydidean construction i may tell you of an event the most important of those that have gone before you may or may not have heard faroff echoes of my adventure with uncle john who has just come back from the diamondminesand looks it it happened thusly  last wednesday evening i was going through the cricket field to meet uncle john at the station as per esteemed favour from the governor telling me to just as i got on the scene to my horror amazement and disgust i saw a middleaged bounder in loud checks who from his looks might have been anything from a retired pawnbroker to a secondhand butler sacked from his last place for stealing the sherry standing in the middle of the field on the very wicket the rugborough match is to be played on next saturday tomorrow and diggingdiggingill trouble you excavating great chunks of our best turf with a walkingstick i was so unnerved i nearly fainted its bad enough being captain of a school team under any circs as far as putting you off your game goes but when you see the wicket youve been rolling by day and dreaming about by night being mangled by an utter strangerwell they say a cow is slightly irritated when her calf is taken away from her but i dont suppose the most maternal cow that ever lived came anywhere near the frenzy that surged up in my bosom at that moment i flew up to him foaming at the mouth my dear sir i shrieked are you aware that youre spoiling the best wicket that has ever been prepared since cricket began he looked at me in a dazed sort of way and said what i said how on earth do you think were going to play rugborough on a ploughed field i dont follow mister he replied a man who calls you mister is beyond the pale you are justified in being a little rude to him so i said then you must be either drunk or mad and i trust its the latter i believe thats from some book though i dont remember which this did seem to wake him up a bit but before he could frame his opinion in words up came biffen the groundman to have a last look at his wicket before retiring for the night when he saw the holesthey were about a foot deep and scattered promiscuously just where two balls out of three pitchhe almost had hysterics i gently explained the situation to him and left him to settle with my friend of the check suit biffen was just settling down to a sort of philippic when i went and i knew that i had left the man in competent hands then i went to the station the train i had been told to meet was the 530 by the way of course i didnt know in the least what uncle john was like not having seen him since i was about oneandahalf but i had been told to look out for a tall rather goodlooking man well the 530 came in all right but none of the passengers seemed to answer to the description the ones who were tall were not good looking and the only man who was good looking stood five feet nothing in his boots i did ask him if he was mr john dalgliesh but his name happening to be robinson he could not oblige i sat out a couple more trains and then went back to the field the man had gone but biffen was still there was you expecting anyone today sir he asked as i came up yes why i said that was im said biffen by skilful questioning i elicited the whole thing it seems that the fearsome bargee in checks was the governors tall goodlooking man in other words uncle john himself he had come by the 430 i suppose anyway there he was and i had insulted him badly biffen told me that he had asked who i was and that he biffen had given the information while he was thinking of something else to say to him about his digging by the way i suppose he dug from force of habit thought hed find diamonds perhaps when biffen told him this he said in a nasty voice then when he comes back will you have the goodness to tell him that my name is john dalgliesh and that he will hear more of this and im uncommonly afraid i shall the governor bars uncle john awfully i know but he wanted me to be particularly civil to him because he was to get me a place in some beastly firm when i leave i havent heard from home yet but i expect to soon still id like to know how i could stand and watch him ruining the wicket for our spot match of the season as it is it wont be as good as it would have been the rugborough slow man will be unplayable if he can find one of these spots altogether its a beastly business write soon though i know you wontyours ever dick    ii  telegram from majorgeneral sir everard venables vc kcmg to his son richard venables  venables st austins what all this about uncle john says were grossly rude write explanation next postvenables    iii  letter from mrs james anthony nee miss dorothy venables to her brother richard venables  dear dickwhat have you been doing to uncle john jim and i are stopping for a fortnight with father and have just come in for the whole thing uncle johnisnt he a horrible mansays you were grossly insolent to him when he went down to see you do write and tell me all about it i have heard no details as yet father refuses to give them and gets simply furious when the matter is mentioned jim said at dinner last night that a conscientious boy would probably feel bound to be rude to uncle john father said conscience be i forget the rest but it was awful jim says if he gets any worse we shall have to sit on his head and cut the traces he is getting so dreadfully horsey do write the very minute you get this i want to know all about ityour affectionate sister dorothy    iv  part of letter from richard venables of st austins to his father majorgeneral sir everard venables vc kcmg   so you see it was really his fault the emperor of germany has no right to come and dig holes in our best wicket take a parallel case suppose some idiot of a fellow not that uncle johns that of course but you know what i mean came and began rooting up your azaleas wouldnt you want to say something cutting i will apologize to uncle john if you like but still i do think he might have gone somewhere else if he really wanted to dig so you see etc etc    v  letter from richard venables of st austins to his sister mrs james anthony  dear dollythanks awfully for your letter and thank jim for his message hes a ripper im awfully glad you married him and not that rotter thompson who used to hang on so i hope the most marvellous infant on earth is flourishing and now about uncle john really i am jolly glad i did say all that to him we played rugborough yesterday and the wicket was simply vile they won the toss and made two hundred and ten of course the wicket was all right at one end and thats where they made most of their runs i was wicketkeeping as usual and i felt awfully ashamed of the beastly pitch when their captain asked me if it was the footballfield of course he wouldnt have said that if he hadnt been a pal of mine but it was probably what the rest of the team thought only they were too polite to say so when we came to bat it was worse than ever i went in first with welchthats the fellow who stopped a week at home a few years ago i dont know whether you remember him he got out in the first over caught off a ball that pitched where uncle john had been prospecting and jumped up it was rotten luck of course and worse was to follow for by halfpast five we had eight wickets down for just over the hundred and only young scott whos simply a slogger and another fellow to come in well scott came in i had made about sixty then and was fairly well setand he started simply mopping up the bowling he gave a chance every over as regular as clockwork and it was always missed and then he would make up for it with two or three tremendous whangsa safe four every time it wasnt batting it was more like golf well this went on for some time and we began to get hopeful again having got a hundred and eighty odd i just kept up my wicket while scott hit then he got caught and the last man a fellow called moore came in id put him in the team as a bowler but he could bat a little too on occasions and luckily this was one of them there were only eleven to win and i had the bowling i was feeling awfully fit and put their slow man clean over the screen twice running which left us only three to get then it was over and moore played the fast man in grand style though he didnt score well i got the bowling again and halfway through the over i carted a halfvolley into the pav and that gave us the match moore hung on for a bit and made about ten and then got bowled we made 223 altogether of which i had managed to get seventyeight not out it pulls my average up a good bit rather decent isnt it the fellows rotted about a good deal and chaired me into the pav but it was scott who won us the match i think he made ninetyfour but uncle john nearly did for us with his beastly walkingstick on a good wicket we might have made any number i dont know how the affair will end keep me posted up in the governors symptoms and write again soonyour affectionate brother dick  pson looking over this letter i find i have taken it for granted that you know all about the uncle john affair probably you do but in case you dont it was this way you see i was going etc etc    vi  from archibald venables of kings college cambridge to richard venables of st austins  dear dickjust a line to thank you for your letter and to tell you that since i got it i have had a visit from the great uncle john too he is an outsider if you like i gave him the best lunch i could in my rooms and the man started a long lecture on extravagance he doesnt seem to understand the difference between the varsity and a private school he kept on asking leading questions about pocketmoney and holidays and wanted to know if my master allowed me to walk in the streets in that waistcoata remark which cut me to the quick that waistcoat being quite the most posh thing of the sort in cambridge he then enquired after my studies and finally when i saw him off at the station said that he had decided not to tip me because he was afraid that i was inclined to be extravagant i was quite kind to him however in spite of everything but i was glad you had spoken to him like a father the recollection of it soothed me though it seemed to worry him he talked a good deal about it glad you came off against rugboroughyours ever a venables    vii  from mr john dalgliesh to mr philip mortimer of penge  dear sirin reply to your letter of the 18th inst i shall be happy to recommend your son reginald for the vacant post in the firm of messrs van nugget diomonde and mynes african merchants i have written them to that effect and you will doubtless receive a communication from them shortlyi am my dear sir yours faithfully j dalgliesh    viii  from richard venables of st austins to his father majorgeneral sir everard venables vc kcmg  dear fatheruncle john writes in answer to my apology to say that no apologies will meet the case and that he has given his nomination in that rotten city firm of his to a fellow called mortimer but rather a decent thing has happened there is a chap here i know pretty well who is the son of lord marmaduke twistleton and it appears that the dook himself was down watching the rugborough match and liked my batting he came and talked to me after the match and asked me what i was going to do when i left and i said i wasnt certain and he said that if i hadnt anything better on he could give me a place on his estate up in scotland as a sort of landagent as he wanted a chap who could play cricket because he was keen on the game himself and always had a lot going on in the summer up there so he says that if i go up to the varsity for three years he can guarantee me the place when i come down with a jolly good screw and a ripping openair life with lots of riding and so on which is just what ive always wanted so can i its the sort of opportunity that wont occur again and you know you always said the only reason i couldnt go up to the varsity was that it would be a waste of time but in this case you see it wont because he wants me to go and guarantees me the place when i come down itll be awfully fine if i may i hope youll see ityour affectionate son dick  psi think hes writing to you he asked your address i think uncle johns a rotter i sent him a rattling fine apology and this is how he treats it but itll be all right if you like this landagent idea if you like you might wire your answer

corpus christi r venables trinity k crespignybrown balliol  extract from the daily mails account of the varsity match of the following summer   the st austins freshman venables fully justified his inclusion by scoring a stylish fiftyseven he hit eight fours and except for a misshit in the slips at 51 which smith might possibly have secured had he started sooner gave nothing like a chance venables it will be remembered played several good innings for oxford in the earlier matches notably his not out contribution of 103 against sussex     4  harrisons slight error   the one oclock down express was just on the point of starting the enginedriver with his hand on the lever whiled away the moments like the watchman in the agamemnon by whistling the guard endeavoured to talk to three people at once porters flitted to and fro cleaving a path for themselves with trucks of luggage the usual old lady was asking if she was right for some place nobody had ever heard of everybody was saying goodbye to everybody else and last but not least p st h harrison of st austins was strolling at a leisurely pace towards the rear of the train there was no need for him to hurry for had not his friend mace promised to keep a cornerseat for him while he went to the refreshmentroom to lay in supplies undoubtedly he had and harrison as he watched the struggling crowd congratulated himself that he was not as other men a corner seat in a carriage full of his own particular friends with plenty of provisions and something to read in case he got tired of talkingit would be perfect  so engrossed was he in these reflections that he did not notice that from the opposite end of the platform a youth of about his own age was also making for the compartment in question the first intimation he had of his presence was when the latter arriving first at the door by a short head hurled a bag on to the rack and sank gracefully into the identical corner seat which harrison had long regarded as his own personal property and to make matters worse there was no other vacant seat in the compartment harrison was about to protest when the guard blew his whistle there was nothing for it but to jump in and argue the matter out en route harrison jumped in to be greeted instantly by a chorus of nine male voices outside there no room turn him out said the chorus then the chorus broke up into its component parts and began to address him one by one  you rotter harrison said babington of dacres what do you come barging in here for cant you see were five aside already  hope youve brought a sardineopener with you old chap said barrett the peerless pride of philpotts cos we shall jolly well need one when we get to the good old junction get up into the rack harrison youre stopping the ventilation  the youth who had commandeered harrisons seat so neatly took another unpardonable liberty at this point he grinned not the timid deprecating smile of one who wishes to ingratiate himself with strangers but a good sixinch grin right across his face harrison turned on him savagely  look here he said just you get out of that what do you mean by bagging my seat  are you a director of this line enquired the youth politely roars of applause from the interested audience harrison began to feel hot and uncomfortable  or only the emperor of germany pursued his antagonist  more applause during which harrison dropped his bag of provisions which were instantly seized and divided on the share and share alike system among the gratified austinians  look here none of your cheek was the shockingly feeble retort which alone occurred to him the other said nothing harrison returned to the attack  look here he said are you going to get out or have i got to make you  not a word did his opponent utter to quote the bard the stripling smiled to tell the truth the stripling smiled inanely  the other occupants of the carriage were far from imitating his reserve these treacherous friends realizing that for those who were themselves comfortably seated the spectacle of harrison standing up with aching limbs for a journey of some thirty miles would be both grateful and comforting espoused the cause of the unknown with all the vigour of which they were capable  beastly bully harrison said barrett trying to turn the kid out of his seat why cant you leave the chap alone dont you move kid  thanks said the unknown i wasnt going to  now you see what comes of slacking said grey if youd bucked up and got here in time you might have bagged this seat ive got by jove harrison youve no idea how comfortable it is in this corner  punctuality said babington is the politeness of princes  and again the unknown maddened harrison with a bestonrecord grin  but i say you chaps said he determined as a last resource to appeal to their better feelings if any mace was keeping this seat for me while i went to get some grub werent you mace he turned to mace for corroboration to his surprise mace was nowhere to be seen  his sympathetic schoolfellows grasped the full humour of the situation as one man and gave tongue once more in chorus  you weed they yelled joyfully youve got into the wrong carriage mace is next door  and then with the sound of unquenchable laughter ringing in his ears harrison gave the thing up and relapsed into a disgusted silence no single word did he speak until the journey was done and the carriage emptied itself of its occupants at the junction the local train was in readiness to take them on to st austins and this time harrison managed to find a seat without much difficulty but it was a bitter moment when mace meeting him on the platform addressed him as a rotter for that he had not come to claim the corner seat which he had been reserving for him they had had said mace a rattling good time coming down what sort of a time had harrison had in his carriage harrisons reply was not remarkable for its clearness  the unknown had also entered the local train it was plain therefore that he was coming to the school as a new boy harrison began to wonder if under these circumstances something might not be done in the matter by way of levelling up things he pondered when st austins station was reached and the travellers began to stream up the road towards the college he discovered that the newcomer was a member of his own house he was standing close beside him and heard babington explaining to him the way to merevales merevale was harrisons housemaster  it was two minutes after he had found out this fact that the grand idea came to harrison he saw his way now to a revenge so artistic so beautifully simple that it was with some difficulty that he restrained himself from bursting into song for two pins he felt he could have done a cakewalk  he checked his emotion he beat it steadily back and quenched it when he arrived at merevales he went first to the matrons room has venables come back yet he asked  venables was the head of merevales house captain of the school cricket wing threequarter of the school fifteen and a great man altogether  yes said the matron he came back early this afternoon  harrison knew it venables always came back early on the last day of the holidays  he was upstairs a short while ago continued the matron he was putting his study tidy  harrison knew it venables always put his study tidy on the last day of the holidays he took a keen and perfectly justifiable pride in his study which was the most luxurious in the house  is he there now asked harrison  no he has gone over to see the headmaster  thanks said harrison it doesnt matter it wasnt anything important  he retired triumphant things were going excellently well for his scheme  his next act was to go to the fags room where as he had expected he found his friend of the train luck continued to be with him the unknown was alone  hullo said harrison  hullo said the fellowtraveller he had resolved to follow harrisons lead if harrison was bringing war then war let it be if however his intentions were friendly he would be friendly too  i didnt know you were coming to merevales its the best house in the school  oh  yes for one thing everybody except the kids has a study  what not really why i thought we had to keep to this room one of the chaps told me so  trying to green you probably you must look out for that sort of thing ill show you the way to your study if you like come along upstairs  thanks awfully its awfully good of you said the gratified unknown and they went upstairs together  one of the doors which they passed on their way was open disclosing to view a room which though bare at present looked as if it might be made exceedingly comfortable  thats my den said harrison it was perhaps lucky that graham to whom the room belonged in fact as opposed to fiction did not hear the remark graham and harrison were old and tried foes this is yours harrison pushed open another door at the end of the passage  his companion stared blankly at the oriental luxury which met his eye but i say he said are you sure this seems to be occupied already  oh no thats all right said harrison airily the chap who used to be here left last term he didnt know he was going to leave till it was too late to pack up all his things so he left his study as it was all youve got to do is to cart the things out into the passage and leave them there the mokell take em away  the moke was the official who combined in a single body the duties of butler and bootboy at merevales house oh rightho said the unknown and harrison left him  harrisons idea was that when venables returned and found an absolute stranger placidly engaged in wrecking his carefullytidied study he would at once and without making inquiries fall upon that absolute stranger and blot him off the face of the earth afterwards it might possibly come out that he harrison had been not altogether unconnected with the business and then he was fain to admit there might be trouble but he was a youth who never took overmuch heed for the morrow sufficient unto the day was his motto and besides it was distinctly worth risking the main point and the one with which alone the house would concern itself was that he had completely taken in scored off and overwhelmed the youth who had done as much by him in the train and his reputation as one not to be lightly trifled with would be restored to its former brilliance anything that might happen between himself and venables subsequently would be regarded as a purely private matter between man and man affecting the main point not at all  about an hour later a small merevalian informed harrison that venables wished to see him in his study he went experience had taught him that when the head of the house sent for him it was as a rule as well to humour his whim and go he was prepared for a good deal for he had come to the conclusion that it was impossible for him to preserve his incognito in the matter but he was certainly not prepared for what he saw  venables and the stranger were seated in two armchairs apparently on the very best of terms with one another and this in spite of the fact that these two armchairs were the only furniture left in the study the rest as he had noted with a grin before he had knocked at the door was picturesquely scattered about the passage  hullo harrison said venables i wanted to see you there seems to have been a slight mistake somewhere did you tell my brother to shift all the furniture out of the study  harrison turned a delicate shade of green  yourerbrother he gurgled  yes i ought to have told you my brother was coming to the coll this term i told the old man and merevale and the rest of the authorities cant make out why i forgot you slipped my mind somehow however you seem to have been doing the square thing by him showing him round and so on very good of you  harrison smiled feebly venables junior grinned what seemed to harrison a mystery was how the brothers had managed to arrive at the school at different times the explanation of which was in reality very simple the elder venables had been spending the last week of the holidays with macarthur the captain of the st austins fifteen the same being a day boy suspended within a mile of the school  but what i cant make out went on venables relentlessly is this furniture business to the best of my knowledge i didnt leave suddenly at the end of last term ill ask if you like to make sure but i fancy youll find youve been mistaken must have been thinking of someone else anyhow we thought you must know best so we lugged all the furniture out into the passage and now it appears theres been a mistake of sorts and the stuff ought to be inside all the time so would you mind putting it back again wed help you only were going out to the shop to get some tea you might have it done by the time we get back thanks awfully  harrison coughed nervously and rose to a point of order  i was going out to tea too he said  im sorry but i think youll have to scratch the engagement said venables  harrison made a last effort  im fagging for welch this term he protested  it was the rule at st austins that every fag had the right to refuse to serve two masters otherwise there would have been no peace for that downtrodden race  that said venables ought to be awfully jolly for welch dont you know but as a matter of fact term hasnt begun yet it doesnt start till tomorrow weigh in  various feelings began to wage war beneath harrisons eton waistcoat a profound disinclination to undertake the suggested task battled briskly with a feeling that if he refused the commission things mightnay wouldhappen  harrison said venables gently but with meaning as he hesitated do you know what it is to wish you had never been born  and harrison with a thoughtful expression on his face picked up a photograph from the floor and hung it neatly in its place over the mantelpiece     5  bradshaws little story   the qualities which in later years rendered frederick wackerbath bradshaw so conspicuous a figure in connection with the now celebrated affair of the european african and asiatic pork pie and ham sandwich supply company frauds were sufficiently in evidence during his school career to make his masters prophesy gloomily concerning his future the boy was in every detail the father of the man there was the same genial unscrupulousness upon which the judge commented so bitterly during the trial the same readiness to seize an opportunity and make the most of it the same brilliance of tactics only once during those years can i remember an occasion on which justice scored a point against him i can remember it because i was in a sense responsible for his failure and he can remember it i should be inclined to think for other reasons our then headmaster was a man with a straight eye and a good deal of muscular energy and it is probable that the talented frederick in spite of the passage of years has a tender recollection of these facts  it was the eve of the euripides examination in the upper fourth euripides is not difficult compared to some other authors but he does demand a certain amount of preparation bradshaw was a youth who did less preparation than anybody i have ever seen heard of or read of partly because he preferred to peruse a novel under the table during prep but chiefly i think because he had reduced cribbing in form to such an exact science that he loved it for its own sake and would no sooner have come tamely into school with a prepared lesson than a sportsman would shoot a sitting bird it was not the marks that he cared for he despised them what he enjoyed was the refined pleasure of swindling under a masters very eye at the trial the judge who had so ran report been himself rather badly bitten by the ham sandwich company put the case briefly and neatly in the words you appear to revel in villainy for villainys sake and i am almost certain that i saw the beginnings of a gratified smile on fredericks expressive face as he heard the remark the rest of our studythe juniors at st austins pigged in quartetteswere in a state of considerable mental activity on account of this euripides examination there had been housematches during the preceding fortnight and housematches are not a help to study especially if you are on the very fringe of the cockhouse team as i was by dint of practising every minute of spare time i had got the eleventh place for my fielding and better still i had caught two catches in the second innings one of them a regular gallery affair and both off the captains bowling it was magnificent but it was not euripides and i wished now that it had been mellish our formmaster had an unpleasant habit of coming down with both feet as it were on members of his form who failed in the bookpapers  we were working therefore under forced draught and it was distinctly annoying to see the wretched bradshaw lounging in our only armchair with one of rider haggards best seemingly quite unmoved at the prospect of euripides examinations for all he appeared to care euripides might never have written a line in his life  kendal voiced the opinion of the meeting  bradshaw you worm he said arent you going to do any work  think not whats the good cant get up a whole play of euripides in two hours  mellishll give you beans  let him  youll get a jolly bad report  shant get a report at all i always intercept it before my guardian can get it he never says anything  mellishll probably run you in to the old man said white the fourth occupant of the study  bradshaw turned on us with a wearied air  oh do give us a rest he said here you are just going to do a most important exam and you sit jawing away as if you were paid for it oh i say by the way whos setting the paper tomorrow  mellish of course said white  no he isnt i said shows what a lot you know about it mellish is setting the livy paper  then whos doing this one asked bradshaw  yorke  yorke was the master of the upper fifth he generally set one of the upper fourth bookpapers  certain said bradshaw  absolutely  thanks thats all i wanted to know by jove i advise you chaps to read this its grand shall i read out this bit about a fight  no we shouted virtuously all together though we were dying to hear it and we turned once more to the loathsome inanities of the second chorus if we had been doing homer we should have felt more in touch with bradshaw theres a good deal of similarity when you come to compare them between homer and haggard they both deal largely in bloodshed for instance as events proved the euripides paper like many things which seem formidable at a distance was not nearly so bad as i had expected i did a fairtomoderate paper and kendal and white both seemed satisfied with themselves bradshaw confessed without emotion that he had only attempted the last half of the last question and on being pressed for further information merely laughed mysteriously and said vaguely that it would be all right  it now became plain that he had something up his sleeve we expressed a unanimous desire to know what it was  you might tell a chap i said  out with it bradshaw or well lynch you added kendal  bradshaw however was not to be drawn much of his success in the paths of crime both at school and afterwards was due to his secretive habits he never permitted accomplices  on the following wednesday the marks were read out out of a possible hundred i had obtained sixtywhich pleased me very much indeedwhite fiftyfive kendal sixtyone the unspeakable bradshaws net total was four  mellish always read out bad marks in a hushed voice expressive of disgust and horror but four per cent was too much for him he shouted it and the form yelled applause until ponsonby came in from the upper fifth next door with mr yorkes compliments and would we recollect that his form were trying to do an examination  when order had been restored mellish settled his glasses and glared through them at bradshaw who it may be remarked had not turned a hair  bradshaw he said how do you explain this  it was merely a sighting shot so to speak nobody was ever expected to answer the question bradshaw however proved himself the exception to the rule  i can explain sir he said if i may speak to you privately afterwards  i have seldom seen anyone so astonished as mellish was at these words in the whole course of his professional experience he had never met with a parallel case it was hard on the poor man not to be allowed to speak his mind about a matter of four per cent in a bookpaper but what could he do he could not proceed with his denunciation for if bradshaws explanation turned out a sufficient excuse he would have to withdraw it all again and vast stores of golden eloquence would be wasted but then if he bottled up what he wished to say altogether it might do him a serious internal injury at last he hit on a compromise he said very well bradshaw i will hear what you have to say and then sprang like the cat in the poem all claws upon an unfortunate individual who had scored twentynine and who had been congratulating himself that bradshaws failings would act as a sort of lightningconductor to him bradshaw worked off his explanation in under five minutes i tried to stay behind to listen on the pretext of wanting to tidy up my desk but was ejected by request bradshaw explained that his statement was private  after a time they came out together like longlost brothers mellish with his hand on bradshaws shoulder it was some small comfort to me to remember that bradshaw had the greatest dislike to this sort of thing  it was evident that bradshaw able exponent of the art of fiction that he was must have excelled himself on this occasion i tried to get the story out of him in the study that evening white and kendal assisted we tried persuasion first that having failed we tried taunts then we tried kindness kendal sat on his legs and i sat on his head and white twisted his arm i think that we should have extracted something soon either his arm from its socket or a full confession but we were interrupted the door flew open and prater the same being our housemaster and rather a good sort appeared  now then now then he said praters manner is always abrupt  whats this i cant have this i cant have this get up at once wheres bradshaw  i rose gracefully to my feet thereby disclosing the classic features of the lost one  the headmaster wants to see you at once bradshaw at the school house you others had better find something to do or you will be getting into trouble  he and bradshaw left together while we speculated on the cause of the summons  we were not left very long in suspense in a quarter of an hour bradshaw returned walking painfully and bearing what to the experts eye are the unmistakable signs of a touching up which being interpreted is corporal punishment  hullo said white as he appeared whats all this  how many enquired the statisticallyminded kendal youll be thankful for this when youre a man bradshaw  thats what i always say to myself when im touched up added kendal  i said nothing but it was to me that the wounded one addressed himself  you utter ass he said in tones of concentrated venom  look here bradshaw i began protestingly  its all through youyou idiot he snarled i got twelve  twelve isnt so dusty said white critically most i ever got was six  but why was it asked kendal thats what we want to know what have you been and gone and done  its about that euripides paper said bradshaw  ah said kendal  yes i dont mind telling you about it now when mellish had me up after school today id got my yarn all ready there wasnt a flaw in it anywhere as far as i could see my idea was this i told him id been to yorkes room the day before the exam to ask him if he had any marks for us that was all right yorke was doing the two unseen papers and it was just the sort of thing a fellow would do to go and ask him about the marks  well  then when i got there he was out and i looked about for the marks and on the table i saw the euripides paper  by jove said kendal we began to understand and to realize that here was a mastermind  well of course i read it not knowing what it was and then as the only way of not taking an unfair advantage i did as badly as i could in the exam that was what i told mellish any beak would have swallowed it  well didnt he  mellish did all right but the rotter couldnt keep it to himself went and told the old man the old man sent for me he was as decent as anything at first that was just his guile he made me describe exactly where i had seen the paper and so on that was rather risky of course but i put it as vaguely as i could when i had finished he suddenly whipped round and said bradshaw why are you telling me all these lies thats the sort of thing that makes you feel rather a wreck i was too surprised to say anything  i can guess the rest said kendal but how on earth did he know it was all lies why didnt you stick to your yarn  and besides i put in where do i come in i dont see what ive got to do with it  bradshaw eyed me fiercely why the whole thing was your fault he said you told me yorke was setting the paper  well so he did didnt he  no he didnt the old man set it himself said bradshaw gloomily     6  a shocking affair   the bradshaw who appears in the following tale is the same youth who figures as the heroor villain label him as you likeof the preceding equally veracious narrative i mention this because i should not care for you to go away with the idea that a waistcoat marked with the name of bradshaw must of necessity cover a scheming heart it may however be noticed that a good many members of the bradshaw family possess a keen and rather sinister sense of the humorous inherited doubtless from their great ancestor the dry wag who wrote that monument of quiet drollery bradshaws railway guide so with the hero of my story  frederick wackerbath bradshaw was as i have pointed out my contemporary at st austins we were in the same house and together we sported on the greenand elsewhereand did our best to turn the majority of the staff of masters into confirmed pessimists they in the meantime endeavouring to do the same by us with every weapon that lay to their hand and the worst of these weapons were the endofterm examination papers mellish was our formmaster and once a term a demon entered into mellish he brooded silently apart from the madding crowd he wandered through dry places seeking rest and at intervals he would smile evilly and jot down a note on the back of an envelope these notes collected and printed closely on the vilest paper made up the examination questions  our form read two authors a term one latin and one greek it was the greek that we feared most mellish had a sort of genius for picking out absolutely untranslatable passages and desiring us in print to render the same with full notes this term the book had been thucydides book ii with regard to which i may echo the words of a certain critic when called upon to give his candid opinion of a friends first novel i dare not say what i think about that book  about a week before the commencement of the examinations the ordinary nightwork used to cease and we were supposed during that week to be steadily going over the old ground and arming ourselves for the approaching struggle there were i suppose people who actually did do this but for my own part i always used to regard those seven days as a blessed period of rest set apart specially to enable me to keep abreast of the light fiction of the day and most of the form so far as i know thought the same it was only on the night before the examination that one began to revise in real earnest ones methods on that night resolved themselves into sitting in a chair and wondering where to begin just as one came to a decision it was bedtime  bradshaw i said as i reached page 103 without having read a line do you know any likely bits  bradshaw looked up from his book he was attempting to get a general idea of thucydides style by reading pickwick  what he said  i obliged with a repetition of my remark  likely bits oh you mean for the thucydides i dont know mellish never sets the bits any decent ordinary individual would set i should take my chance if i were you  what are you going to do  im going to read pickwick thicksides doesnt come within a mile of it  i thought so too  but how about tomorrow  oh i shant be there he said as if it were the most ordinary of statements  not there why have you been sacked  this really seemed the only possible explanation such an event would not have come as a surprise it was always a matter for wonder to me why the authorities never sacked bradshaw or at the least requested him to leave possibly it was another case of the ass and the bundles of hay they could not make up their minds which special misdemeanour of his to attack first  no ive not been sacked said bradshaw  a light dawned upon me  oh i said youre going to slumber in for the benefit of the uninitiated i may mention that to slumber in is to stay in the house during school on a pretence of illness  that replied the man of mystery with considerable asperity is exactly the silly rotten kids idea that would come naturally to a complete idiot like you  as a rule i resent being called a complete idiot but this was not the time for asserting ones personal dignity i had to know what bradshaws scheme for evading the examination was perhaps there might be room for two in it in which case i should have been exceedingly glad to have lent my moral support to it i pressed for an explanation  you may jaw said bradshaw at last as much as you jolly well please but im not going to give this away all youre going to know is that i shant be there tomorrow  i bet you are and i bet you do a jolly rank paper too i said remembering that the sceptic is sometimes vouchsafed revelations to which the most devout believer may not aspire it is for instance always the young man who scoffs at ghosts that the family spectre chooses as his audience but it required more than a mere sneer or an empty gibe to pump information out of bradshaw he took me up at once  whatll you bet he said  now i was prepared to wager imaginary sums to any extent he might have cared to name but as my actual worldly wealth at that moment consisted of one penny and my expectations were limited to the shilling pocketmoney which i should receive on the following saturdayhalf of which was already mortgagedit behoved me to avoid doing anything rash with my ready money but since a refusal would have meant the downfall of my arguments i was obliged to name a figure i named an even sixpence after all i felt i must win by what means other than illness could bradshaw possibly avoid putting in an appearance at the thucydides examination  all right said bradshaw an even sixpence youll lose  slumbering in barred  of course  real illness barred too i said bradshaw is a man of resource and has been known to make himself genuinely ill in similar emergencies  right you are slumbering in and real illness both barred anything else youd like to bar  i thought  no unless an idea struck meyoure not going to run away  bradshaw scorned to answer the question  now youd better buck up with your work he said opening his book again youve got about as long odds as anyone ever got but youll lose all the same  it scarcely seemed possible and yetbradshaw was generally right if he said he had a scheme for doingthough it was generally for not doingsomething it rarely failed to come off i thought of my sixpence my only sixpence and felt a distinct pang of remorse after all only the other day the chaplain had said how wrong it was to bet by jove so he had decent man the chaplain pity to do anything he would disapprove of i was on the point of recalling my wager when before my minds eye rose a vision of bradshaw rampant and sneering and myself writhing in my chair a crushed and scoredoff wreck i drew the line at that i valued my selfrespect at more than sixpence if it had been a shilling now so i set my teeth and turned once more to my thucydides bradshaw having picked up the thread of his story again emitted hoarse chuckles like minute guns until i very nearly rose and fell upon him it is maddening to listen to a person laughing and not to know the joke  you will be allowed two hours for this paper said mellish on the following afternoon as he returned to his desk after distributing the thucydides questions at five minutes to four i shall begin to collect your papers but those who wish may go on till ten past write only on one side of the paper and put your names in the top righthand corner marks will be given for neatness any boy whom i see looking at his neighbourswheres bradshaw  it was already five minutes past the hour the latest of the late always had the decency to appear at least by three minutes past  has anybody seen bradshaw repeated mellish you whatsyourname i am whatsyourname very much at your service you are in his house have you seen him  i could have pointed out with some pleasure at this juncture that if cain expressed indignation at being asked where his brother was i by a simple sum in proportion might with even greater justice feel annoyed at having to locate a person who was no relative of mine at all did mr mellish expect me to keep an eye on every member of my house did mr mellishin short what did he mean by it  this was what i thought i said no sir  this is extraordinary said mellish most extraordinary why the boy was in school this morning  this was true the boy had been in school that morning to some purpose having beaten all records his own records in the gentle sport of mellishbaiting this evidently occurred to mellish at the time for he dropped the subject at once and told us to begin our papers  now i have remarked already that i dare not say what i think of thucydides book ii how then shall i frame my opinion of that examination paper it was thucydides book ii with the few easy parts left out it was thucydides book ii with special homemade difficulties added it waswell in its way it was a masterpiece without going into detailsi dislike sensational and realistic writingi may say that i personally was not one of those who required an extra ten minutes to finish their papers i finished mine at halfpast two and amused myself for the remaining hour and a half by writing neatly on several sheets of foolscap exactly what i thought of mr mellish and precisely what i hoped would happen to him some day it was grateful and comforting  at intervals i wondered what had become of bradshaw i was not surprised at his absence at first i had feared that he would keep his word in that matter as time went on i knew that he would at more frequent intervals i wondered how i should enjoy being a bankrupt  four oclock came round and found me so engrossed in putting the finishing touches to my excursus of mr mellishs character that i stayed on in the formroom till ten past two other members of the form stayed too writing with the despairing energy of those who had five minutes to say what they would like to spread over five hours at last mellish collected the papers he seemed a trifle surprised when i gave up my modest three sheets brown and morrison who had their eye on the form prize each gave up reams brown told me subsequently that he had only had time to do sixteen sheets and wanted to know whether i had adopted rutherfords emendation in preference to the old reading in question ii my prolonged stay had made him regard me as a possible rival  i dwell upon this part of my story because it has an important bearing on subsequent events if i had not waited in the formroom i should not have gone downstairs just behind mellish and if i had not gone downstairs just behind mellish i should not have been in at the death that is to say the discovery of bradshaw and this story would have been all beginning and middle and no ending for i am certain that bradshaw would never have told me a word he was a most secretive animal  i went downstairs as i say just behind mellish st austins you must know is composed of three blocks of buildings the senior the middle and the junior joined by cloisters we left the senior block by the door to the captious critic this information may seem superfluous but let me tell him that i have left the block in my time and entered it too though never it is true in the company of a master in other ways there are windows  our procession of two mellish leading by a couple of yards passed through the cloisters and came to the middle block where the masters common room is i had no particular reason for going to that block but it was all on my way to the house and i knew that mellish hated having his footsteps dogged that thucydides paper rankled slightly  in the middle block at the top of the building far from the haunts of men is the science museum containingso i have heard i have never been near the place myselftwo stuffed rats a case of mouldering butterflies and other objects of acute interest the room has a staircase all to itself and this was the reason why directly i heard shouts proceeding from that staircase i deduced that they came from the museum i am like sherlock holmes i dont mind explaining my methods  help shouted the voice help  the voice was bradshaws  mellish was talking to m gerard the french master at the moment he had evidently been telling him of bradshaws nonappearance for at the sound of his voice they both spun round and stood looking at the staircase like a couple of pointers  help cried the voice again  mellish and gerard bounded up the stairs i had never seen a french master run before it was a pleasant sight i followed as we reached the door of the museum which was shut renewed shouts filtered through it mellish gave tongue  bradshaw  yes sir from within  are you there this i thought and still think quite a superfluous question  yes sir said bradshaw  what are you doing in there bradshaw why were you not in school this afternoon come out at once this in deep and thrilling tones  please sir said bradshaw complainingly i cant open the door now the immediate effect of telling a person that you are unable to open a door is to make him try his hand at it someone observes that there are three things which everyone thinks he can do better than anyone else namely poking a fire writing a novel and opening a door  gerard was no exception to the rule  cant open the door he said nonsense nonsense and swooping at the handle he grasped it firmly and turned it  at this point he made an attempt a very spirited attempt to lower the worlds record for the standing high jump i have spoken above of the pleasure it gave me to see a french master run but for good square enjoyment warranted free from all injurious chemicals give me a french master jumping  my dear gerard said the amazed mellish  i have received a shock dear me i have received a most terrible shock  so had i only of another kind i really thought i should have expired in my tracks with the effort of keeping my enjoyment strictly to myself i saw what had happened the museum is lit by electric light to turn it on one has to shoot the bolt of the door which like the handle is made of metal it is on the killing two birds with one stone principle you lock yourself in and light yourself up with one movement it was plain that the current had gone wrong somehow run amock as it were mellish meanwhile instead of being warned by gerards fate had followed his example and tried to turn the handle his jump though quite a creditable effort fell short of gerards by some six inches i began to feel as if some sort of round game were going on i hoped that they would not want me to take a hand i also hoped that the thing would continue for a good while longer the success of the piece certainly warranted the prolongation of its run but here i was disappointed the disturbance had attracted another spectator blaize the science and chemistry master the matter was hastily explained to him in all its bearings there was bradshaw entombed within the museum with every prospect of death by starvation unless he could support life for the next few years on the two stuffed rats and the case of butterflies the authorities did not see their way to adding a human specimen youths size to the treasures in the museum sohow was he to be got out  the scientific mind is equal to every emergency  bradshaw shouted blaize through the keyhole  sir  are you there  i should imagine that bradshaw was growing tired of this question by this time besides it cast aspersions on the veracity of gerard and mellish bradshaw with perfect politeness hastened to inform the gentleman that he was there  have you a piece of paper  will an envelope do sir  bless the boy anything will do so long as it is paper  dear me i thought is it as bad as all that is blaize in despair of ever rescuing the unfortunate prisoner going to ask him to draw up a last dying words document to be pushed under the door and despatched to his sorrowing guardian  put it over your hand and then shoot back the bolt  but sir the electricity  pooh boy  the scientific mind is always intolerant of lay ignorance  pooh boy paper is a nonconductor you wont get hurt  bradshaw apparently acted on his instructions from the other side of the door came the sharp sound of the bolt as it was shot back and at the same time the light ceased to shine through the keyhole a moment later the handle turned and bradshaw stepped forthfree  dear me said mellish now i never knew that before blaize remarkable but this ought to be seen to in the meantime i had better ask the headmaster to give out that the museum is closed until further notice i think  and closed the museum has been ever since that further notice has never been given and yet nobody seems to feel as if an essential part of their life had ceased to be so to speak curious bradshaw after a short explanation was allowed to go away without a stainthat is to say without any additional stainon his character we left the authorities discussing the matter and went downstairs  sixpence isnt enough i said take this penny its all ive got you shall have the sixpence on saturday  thanks said bradshaw was the thucydides paper pretty warm  warmish but i say didnt you get a beastly shock when you locked the door  i did the week before last the first time i ever went to the place this time i was more or less prepared for it blaize seems to think that paper dodge a special invention of his own hell be taking out a patent for it one of these days why every kid knows that paper doesnt conduct electricity  i didnt i said honestly  you dont know much said bradshaw with equal honesty  i dont i replied bradshaw youre a great man but you missed the best part of it all  what the thucydides paper asked he with a grin  no you missed seeing gerard jump quite six feet  bradshaws face expressed keen disappointment  no did he really oh i say i wish id seen it  the moral of which is that the wicked do not always prosper if bradshaw had not been in the museum he might have seen gerard jump six feet which would have made him happy for weeks on second thoughts though that does not work out quite right for if bradshaw had not been in the museum gerard would not have jumped at all no better put it this way i was virtuous and i had the pleasure of witnessing the sight i have referred to but then there was the thucydides paper which bradshaw missed but which i did not no on consideration the moral of this story shall be withdrawn and submitted to a committee of experts perhaps they will be able to say what it is     7  the babe and the dragon   the annual interhouse football cup at st austins lay between dacres who were the holders and merevales who had been runnerup in the previous year and had won it altogether three times out of the last five the cup was something of a tradition in merevales but of late dacres had become serious rivals and as has been said before were the present holders  this year there was not much to choose between the two teams dacres had three of the first fifteen and two of the second merevales two of the first and four of the second st austins being not altogether a boardingschool many of the brightest stars of the teams were day boys and there was of course always the chance that one of these would suddenly see the folly of his ways reform and become a member of a house  this frequently happened and this year it was almost certain to happen again for no less a celebrity than macarthur commonly known as the babe had been heard to state that he was negotiating with his parents to that end which house he would go to was at present uncertain he did not know himself but it would he said probably be one of the two favourites for the cup this lent an added interest to the competition for the presence of the babe would almost certainly turn the scale the babes nationality was scots and like most scotsmen he could play football more than a little he was the safest coolest centre threequarter the school had or had had for some time he shone in all branches of the game but especially in tackling to see the babe spring apparently from nowhere in the middle of an interschool match and bring down with violence a man who had passed the back was an intellectual treat both dacres and merevales therefore yearned for his advent exceedingly the reasons which finally decided his choice were rather curious they arose in the following manner  the babes sister was at girton a certain miss florence beezley was also at girton when the babes sister revisited the ancestral home at the end of the term she brought miss beezley with her to spend a week what she saw in miss beezley was to the babe a matter for wonder but she must have liked her or she would not have gone out of her way to seek her company be that as it may the babe would have gone a very long way out of his way to avoid her company he led a fine healthy outofdoors life during that week and doubtless did himself a lot of good but times will occur when it is imperative that a man shall be under the family roof mealtimes for instance the babe could not subsist without food and he was obliged miss beezley or no miss beezley to present himself on these occasions this by the way was in the easter holidays so that there was no school to give him an excuse for absence  breakfast was a nightmare lunch was rather worse and as for dinner it was quite unspeakable miss beezley seemed to gather force during the day it was not the actual presence of the lady that revolted the babe for that was passable enough it was her conversation that killed she refused to let the babe alone she was intensely learned herself and seemed to take a morbid delight in dissecting his ignorance and showing everybody the pieces also she persisted in calling him mr macarthur in a way that seemed somehow to point out and emphasize his youthfulness she added it to her remarks as a sort of afterthought or echo  do you read browning mr macarthur she would say suddenly having apparently waited carefully until she saw that his mouth was full  the babe would swallow convulsively choke blush and finally say  no not much  ah this in a tone of pity not untinged with scorn  when you say not much mr macarthur what exactly do you mean have you read any of his poems  oh yes one or two  ah have you read pippa passes  no i think not  surely you must know mr macarthur whether you have or not have you read fifine at the fair  no  have you read sordello  no  what have you read mr macarthur  brought to bay in this fashion he would have to admit that he had read the pied piper of hamelin and not a syllable more and miss beezley would look at him for a moment and sigh softly the babes subsequent share in the conversation provided the dragon made no further onslaught was not large  one nevertobeforgotten day shortly before the end of her visit a series of horrible accidents resulted in their being left to lunch together alone the babe had received no previous warning and when he was suddenly confronted with this terrible state of affairs he almost swooned the ladys steady and critical inspection of his style of carving a chicken completed his downfall his previous experience of carving had been limited to those entertainments which went by the name of studygorges where if you wanted to help a chicken you took hold of one leg invited an accomplice to attach himself to the other and pulled  but though unskilful he was plucky and energetic he lofted the bird out of the dish on to the tablecloth twice in the first minute stifling a mad inclination to call out fore or something to that effect he laughed a hollow mirthless laugh and replaced the errant fowl when a third attack ended in the same way miss beezley asked permission to try what she could do she tried and in two minutes the chicken was neatly dismembered the babe reseated himself in an overwrought state  tell me about st austins mr macarthur said miss beezley as the babe was trying to think of something to saynot about the weather do you play football  yes  ah  a prolonged silence  do you began the babe at last  tell me began miss beezley simultaneously  i beg your pardon said the babe you were saying  not at all mr macarthur you were saying  i was only going to ask you if you played croquet  yes do you  no  ah  if this is going to continue thought the babe i shall be reluctantly compelled to commit suicide  there was another long pause  tell me the names of some of the masters at st austins mr macarthur said miss beezley she habitually spoke as if she were an examination paper and her manner might have seemed to some to verge upon the autocratic but the babe was too thankful that the question was not on browning or the higher algebra to notice this he reeled off a list of names   then theres merevalerather a decent sortand dacre  what sort of a man is mr dacre  rather a rotter i think  what is a rotter mr macarthur  well i dont know how to describe it exactly he doesnt play cricket or anything hes generally considered rather a crock  really this is very interesting mr macarthur and what is a crock i suppose what it comes to she added as the babe did his best to find a definition is this that you yourself dislike him the babe admitted the impeachment mr dacre had a finished gift of sarcasm which had made him writhe on several occasions and sarcastic masters are rarely very popular  ah said miss beezley she made frequent use of that monosyllable it generally gave the babe the same sort of feeling as he had been accustomed to experience in the happy days of his childhood when he had been caught stealing jam  miss beezley went at last and the babe felt like a convict who has just received a free pardon  one afternoon in the following term he was playing fives with charteris a prefect in merevales house charteris was remarkable from the fact that he edited and published at his own expense an unofficial and highly personal paper called the glow worm which was a great deal more in demand than the recognized school magazine the austinian and always paid its expenses handsomely  charteris had the journalistic taint very badly he was always the first to get wind of any piece of school news on this occasion he was in possession of an exclusive item the babe was the first person to whom he communicated it  have you heard the latest romance in high life babe he observed as they were leaving the court but of course you havent you never do hear anything  well asked the babe patiently  you know dacre  i seem to have heard the name somewhere  hes going to be married  yes dont trouble to try and look interested youre one of those offensive people who mind their own business and nobody elses only i thought id tell you then youll have a remote chance of understanding my quips on the subject in next weeks glow worm you laddies frae the north have to be carefully prepared for the subtler flights of wit  thanks said the babe placidly goodnight  the headmaster intercepted the babe a few days after he was going home after a scratch game of football macarthur said he you pass mr dacres house do you not on your way home then would you mind asking him from me to take preparation tonight i find i shall be unable to be there it was the custom at st austins for the head to preside at preparation once a week but he performed this duty like the celebrated irishman as often as he could avoid it  the babe accepted the commission he was shown into the drawingroom to his consternation for he was not a society man there appeared to be a species of teaparty going on as the door opened somebody was just finishing a remark   faculty which he displayed in such poems as sordello said the voice  the babe knew that voice  he would have fled if he had been able but the servant was already announcing him mr dacre began to do the honours  mr macarthur and i have met before said miss beezley for it was she curiously enough the subject which we have just been discussing is one in which he takes i think a great interest i was saying mr macarthur when you came in that few of tennysons works show the poetic faculty which browning displays in sordello  the babe looked helplessly at mr dacre  i think you are taking macarthur out of his depth there said mr dacre was there something you wanted to see me about macarthur  the babe delivered his message  oh yes certainly said mr dacre shall you be passing the school house tonight if so you might give the headmaster my compliments and say i shall be delighted  the babe had had no intention of going out of his way to that extent but the chance of escape offered by the suggestion was too good to be missed he went  on his way he called at merevales and asked to see charteris  look here charteris he said you remember telling me that dacre was going to be married  yes  well do you know her name by any chance  i ken it weel ma braw hielander she is a miss beezley  great scott said the babe  hullo why was your young heart set in that direction you amaze and pain me babe i think wed better have a story on the subject in the glow worm with you as hero and dacre as villain it shall end happily of course ill write it myself  youd better said the babe grimly oh i say charteris  well  when i come as a boarder i shall be a houseprefect shant i as im in the sixth  yes  and prefects have to go to breakfast and supper and that sort of thing pretty often with the housebeak dont they  such are the facts of the case  thanks thats all go away and do some work goodnight  the cup went to merevales that year the babe played a singularly brilliant game for them     8  the manoeuvres of charteris    chapter 1  might i observe sir  you may observe whatever you like said the referee kindly twentyfive  the rules say  i have given my decision twentyfive a spot of red appeared on the official cheek the referee who had been heckled since the kickoff was beginning to be annoyed  the ball went behind without bouncing and the rules say  twentyfive shouted the referee i am perfectly well aware what the rules say and he blew his whistle with an air of finality the secretary of the bargees fc subsided reluctantly and the game was restarted  the bargees match was a curious institution their real name was the old crockfordians when a few years before the st austins secretary had received a challenge from them dated from stapleton where their secretary happened to reside he had argued within himself as follows this sounds all right old crockfordians never heard of crockford probably some large private school somewhere anyhow theyre certain to be decent fellows and he arranged the fixture it then transpired that old crockford was a village and from the appearance of the team on the day of battle the old crockfordians seemed to be composed exclusively of the riffraff of same they wore green shirts with a bright yellow leopard over the heart and cfc woven in large letters about the chest one or two of the outsides played in caps and the team to a man criticized the referees decisions with point and pungency unluckily the first year saw a weak team of austinians rather badly beaten with the result that it became a point of honour to wipe this off the slate before the fixture could be cut out of the card the next year was also unlucky the bargees managed to score a penalty goal in the first half and won on that the match resulted in a draw in the following season and by this time the thing had become an annual event  now however the school was getting some of its own back the bargees had brought down a player of some reputation from the north and were as strong as ever in the scrum but st austins had a great team and were carrying all before them charteris and graham at half had the ball out to their centres in a way which made merevale who looked after the football of the school feel that life was worth living and when once it was out things happened rapidly macarthur the captain of the team with thomson as his fellowcentre and welch and bannister on the wings did what they liked with the bargees threequarters all the school outsides had scored even the back who dropped a neat goal the player from the north had scarcely touched the ball during the whole game and altogether the bargees were becoming restless and excited  the kickoff from the twentyfive line which followed upon the small discussion alluded to above reached graham under ordinary circumstances he would have kicked but in a winning game original methods often pay he dodged a furious sportsman in green and yellow and went away down the touchline he was almost through when he stumbled he recovered himself but too late before he could pass someone was on him graham was not heavy and his opponent was muscular he was swung off his feet and the next moment the two came down together graham underneath a sharp pain shot through his shoulder  a doctor emerged from the crowdthere is always a doctor in a crowdand made an examination  anything bad asked the referee  collarbone said the doctor the usual you know rather badly smashed nothing dangerous of course be all right in a month or so stop his playing rather a pity much longer before halftime  no i was just going to blow the whistle when this happened  the injured warrior was carried off and the referee blew his whistle for halftime  i say charteris said macarthur who the deuce am i to put half instead of graham  rogers used to play half in his childhood i believe but i say did you ever see such a scrag cant you protest or something  my dear chap how can i its on our own ground these bargee beasts are visitors if you come to think of it id like to wring the chaps neck who did it i didnt spot who it was did you see  rather their secretary that man with the beard ill get prescott to mark him this half  prescott was the hardest tackler in the school he accepted the commission cheerfully and promised to do his best by the bearded one  charteris certainly gave him every opportunity when he threw the ball out of touch he threw it neatly to the criminal with the beard and prescott who stuck to him closer than a brother had generally tackled him before he knew what had happened after a time he began to grow thoughtful and when there was a lineout went and stood among the threequarters in this way much of charteriss righteous retribution miscarried but once or twice he had the pleasure and privilege of putting in a piece of tackling on his own account the match ended with the enemy still intact but considerably shaken he was also rather annoyed he spoke to charteris on the subject as they were leaving the field  i was watching you he said apropos of nothing apparently  that must have been nice for you said charteris  you wait  certainly any time youre passing im sure  you aint eard the last of me yet  thats something of a blow said charteris cheerfully and they parted  charteris having got into his blazer ran after welch and macarthur and walked back with them to the house all three of them were at merevales  poor old tony said macarthur where have they taken him to the house  yes said welch i say babe you ought to scratch this match next year tell em the cards full up or something  oh i dont know one expects fairly rough play in this sort of game after all we tackle pretty hard ourselves i know i always try and go my hardest if the man happens to be brittle thats his lookout concluded the bloodthirsty babe  my dear man said charteris theres all the difference between a decent tackle and a bally scrag like the one that doubled tony up you cant break a chaps collarbone without trying to  well if you come to think of it i suppose the man must have been fairly riled you cant expect a man to be in an angelic temper when his sides been licked by thirty points  the babe was one of those thoroughly excellent persons who always try when possible to make allowances for everybody  well dash it said charteris indignantly if he had lost his hair he might have drawn the line at falling on tony like that it wasnt the tackling part of it that crocked him the beast simply jumped on him like a hooligan anyhow i made him sit up a bit before we finished i gave prescott the tip to mark him out of touch have you ever been collared by prescott its a liberal education now there you are you see take prescott hes never crocked a man seriously in his life i dont count being winded thats absolutely an accident well there you are then prescott weighs thirteenten and hes all muscle and he goes like a batteringram youll own that he goes as hard as he jolly well knows how and yet the worst he has ever done is to lay a man out for a couple of minutes while he gets his wind back well compare him with this bargee man the bargee weighs a stone less and isnt nearly as strong and yet he smashes tonys collarbone its all very well babe but you cant get away from it prescott tackles fairly and the bargee scrags  yes said macarthur i suppose youre right  rather said charteris i wish id broken his neck  by the way said welch you were talking to him after the match what was he saying  charteris laughed  by jove id forgotten he said i hadnt heard the last of him and that i was to wait  what did you say  oh i behaved beautifully i asked him to be sure and look in any time he was passing and after a few chatty remarks we parted  i wonder if he meant anything  i believe he means to waylay me with a buckled belt i shant stir out except with the old man or some other competent bodyguard orrible outrage shocking death of a st austins schoolboy it would look rather well on the posters  welch stuck strenuously to the point  no but look here charteris he said seriously im not rotting you see the man lives in stapleton and if he knows anything of school rules  which he doesnt probably why should he wellif he knows anything of the rules hell know that stapletons out of bounds and he may book you there and run you in to merevale  yes said macarthur i tell you what youd do well to knock off a few of your expeditions to stapleton you know you wouldnt go there once a month if it wasnt out of bounds youll be a prefect next term i should wait till then if i were you  my dear chap what does it matter the worst that can happen to you for breaking bounds is a couple of hundred lines and ive got a capital of four hundred already in stock besides things would be so slow if you always kept in bounds i always feel like a cross between dick turpin and machiavelli when i go to stapleton its an awfully jolly feeling like warm treacle running down your back its cheap at two hundred lines  youre an awful fool said welch rudely but correctly  welch was a youth who treated the affairs of other people rather too seriously he worried over them this is not a particularly common trait in the character of either boy or man but welch had it highly developed he could not probably have explained exactly why he was worried but he undoubtedly was welch had a very grave and serious mind he shared a study with charterisfor charteris though not yet a schoolprefect was part owner of a studyand close observation had convinced him that the latter was not responsible for his actions and that he wanted somebody to look after him he had therefore elected himself to the post of a species of modified and unofficial guardian angel to him the duties were heavy and the remuneration exceedingly light  really you know said macarthur i dont see what the point of all your lunacy is i dont know if youre aware of it but the old mans getting jolly sick with you  i didnt know said charteris but im very glad to hear it for hist i have a gerrudge against the person beneath my ban that mystic man shall suffer coute que coute matilda he sat upon mepublicly and the resultant blot on my scutcheon can only be wiped out with blood or broken rules he added  this was true to listen to charteris on the subject one might have thought that he considered the matter rather amusing than otherwise this however was simply due to the fact that he treated everything flippantly in conversation but like the parrot he thought the more the actual casus belli had been trivial at least the mere spectator would have considered it trivial it had happened after this fashion charteris was a member of the school corps the orderlyroom of the school corps was in the junior part of the school buildings charteris had been to replace his rifle in that shrine of mars after a midday drill and on coming out into the passage had found himself in the middle of a junior school rag of the conventional type somebodys cap had fallen off and two hastily picked teams were playing football with it association rules now charteris was not a prefect that it may be observed in passing was another source of bitterness in him towards the powers for he was fairly high up in the sixth and others of his set welch thomson and tony graham who were also in the sixththe two last below him in form orderhad already received their prefects caps not being a prefect it would have been officious in him to have stopped the game so he was passing on with what mr hurry bungsho jabberjee ba would have termed a beaming simper of indescribable suavity when a member of one of the opposing teams in effecting a g o smithian dribble cannoned into him to preserve his balancethis will probably seem a very thin line of defence but i state but the factshe grabbed at the disciple of smith amidst applause and at that precise moment a new actor appeared on the scenethe headmaster now of all the things that lay in his province the headmaster most disliked to see a senior ragging with a junior he had a great idea of the dignity of the senior school and did all that in him lay to see that it was kept up the greater number of the juniors with whom the senior was found ragging the more heinous the offence circumstantial evidence was dead against charteris to all outward appearances he was one of the players in the impromptu football match the soft and fascinating beams of the simper to quote mr jabberjee once more had not yet faded from the act a wellchosen word or two from the headmagisterial lips put a premature end to the football match and charteris was proceeding on his way when the headmaster called him he stopped the headmaster was angry so angry indeed that he did what in a more lucid interval he would not have done he hauled a senior over the coals in the hearing of a number of juniors one of whom unidentified giggled loudly as charteris had on previous occasions observed the old man when he did start to take a persons measure didnt leave out much the address was not long but it covered a great deal of ground the section of it which chiefly rankled in charteriss mind and which had continued to rankle ever since was that in which the use of the word buffoon had occurred everybody who has a gift of humour and very naturally enjoys exercising it hates to be called a buffoon it was charteriss one weak spot every other abusive epithet in the language slid off him without penetrating or causing him the least discomfort the word buffoon went home right up to the hilt and to borrow from mr jabberjee for positively the very last time he had observed mentally henceforward i will perpetrate heaps of the lowest dregs of vice he had in fact started a perfect bout of breaking rules simply because they were rules the injustice of the thing rankled no one so dislikes being punished unjustly as the person who might have been punished justly on scores of previous occasions if he had only been found out to a certain extent charteris ran amok he broke bounds and did little work andhe was beginning gradually to find this outgot thoroughly tired of it all offended dignity however still kept him at it and much as he would have preferred to have resumed a less feverish type of existence he did not do so  i have a gerrudge against the man he said  you are an idiot really said welch  welch said charteris by way of explanation to macarthur is a lad of coarse fibre he doesnt understand the finer feelings he cant see that i am doing this simply for the old mans good spare the rod spile the choild lets go and have a look at tony when were changed hell be in the sickroom if hes anywhere  all right said the babe as he went into his study buck up ill toss you for first bath in a second  charteris walked on with welch to their sanctum  you know said welch seriously stooping to unlace his boots rotting apart you really are a most awful ass i wish i could get you to see it  never you mind ducky said charteris im all right ill look after myself    chapter 2  it was about a week after the bargees match that the rules respecting bounds were made stricter much to the popular indignation the penalty for visiting stapleton without leave was increased from two hundred lines to two extra lessons the venomous characteristic of extra lesson was that it cut into ones football for the criminal was turned into a formroom from two till four on halfholidays and so had to scratch all athletic engagements for the day unless he chose to go for a solitary run afterwards in the cricket term the effect of this was not so deadly it was just possible that you might get an innings somewhere after four oclock even if only at the nets but during the football seasonit was now februaryto be in extra lesson meant a total loss of everything that makes life endurable and the school protested to one another in the privacy of their studies with no uncertain voice against this barbarous innovation  the reason for the change had been simple at the corner of the high street at stapleton was a tobacconists shop and mr prater strolling in one evening to renew his stock of pioneer was interested to observe p st h harrison of merevales purchasing a consignment of girl of my heart cigarettes at twopencehalfpenny the packet of twenty including a coloured picture of lord kitchener now mr prater was one of the most sportsmanlike of masters if he had merely met harrison out of bounds and it had been possible to have overlooked him he would have done so but such a proceeding in the interior of a small shop was impossible there was nothing to palliate the crime the tobacconist also kept the wolf from the door and lured the juvenile population of the neighbourhood to it by selling various weird brands of sweets but it was only too obvious that harrison was not after these guilt was in his eye and the packet of cigarettes in his hand also harrisons house cap was fixed firmly at the back of his head mr prater finished buying his pioneer and went out without a word that night it was announced to harrison that the headmaster wished to see him the headmaster saw him though for a certain period of the interview he did not see the headmaster having turned his back on him by request on the following day stapleton was placed doubly out of bounds  tony who was still in bed had not heard the news when charteris came to see him on the evening of the day on which the edict had gone forth  how are you getting on asked charteris  oh fairly well its rather slow  the grub seems all right charteris absently reached out for a slice of cake  not bad  and you dont have to do any work  no  well then it seems to me youre having a jolly good time what dont you like about it  its so slow being alone all day  makes you appreciate intellectual conversation all the more when you get it mine for instance  i want something to read  ill bring you a sidgwicks greek prose composition if you like full of racy stories  ive read em thanks  how about jebbs homer youd like that awfully interesting proves that there never was such a man as homer you know and that the iliad and the odyssey were produced by evolution general style quietly funny make you roar  dont be an idiot im simply starving for something to read havent you got anything  youve read all mine  hasnt welch got any books  not one he bags mine when he wants to read ill tell you what i will do if you like  what  go into stapleton and borrow something from adamson adamson was the college doctor  by jove thats not a bad idea  its a dashed good idea which wouldnt have occurred to anybody but a genius ive been quite a pal of adamsons ever since i had the flu i go to tea with him occasionally and we talk medical shop have you ever tried talking medical shop during tea nothing like it for giving you an appetite  has he got anything readable  rather have you ever tried anything of james payns  ive read terminations or something said tony doubtfully but hes so obscure  dont said charteris sadly please dont terminations is by one henry james and there is a substantial difference between him and james payn anyhow if you want a short biography of james payn he wrote a hundred books and theyre all simply ripping and adamson has got a good many of them and im hoping to borrow a coupleany two will doand youre going to read them i know one always bars a book thats recommended to one but youve got no choice youre not going to get anything else till youve finished those two  all right said tony but stapletons out of bounds i suppose merevalell give you leave to go in  he wont said charteris i shant ask him on principle so long  on the following afternoon charteris went into stapleton the distance by road was almost exactly one mile if you went by the fields it was longer because you probably lost your way  dr adamsons house was in the high street charteris knocked at the door the servant was sorry but the doctor was out her tone seemed to suggest that if she had had any say in the matter he would have remained in would charteris come in and wait charteris rather thought he would he waited for half an hour and then as the absent medico did not appear to be coming took two books from the shelf wrote a succinct note explaining what he had done and why he had done it hoping the doctor would not mind and went out with his literary trophies into the high street again  the time was now close on five oclock lockup was not till a quarter past sixsix oclock nominally but the doors were always left open till a quarter past it would take him about fifteen minutes to get back less if he trotted obviously the thing to do here was to spend a thoughtful quarter of an hour or so inspecting the sights of the town these were ordinarily not numerous but this particular day happened to be market day and there was a good deal going on the high street was full of farmers cows and other animals the majority of the former well on the road to intoxication it is of course extremely painful to see a man in such a condition but when such a person is endeavouring to count a perpetually moving drove of pigs the onlookers pain is sensibly diminished charteris strolled along the high street observing these and other phenomena with an attentive eye opposite the town hall he was buttonholed by a perfect stranger whom by his conversation he soon recognized as the stapleton character there is a character in every small country town he is not a bad character still less is he a good character he is just a character pure and simple this particular manor rather this man for he was anything but particularapparently took a great fancy to charteris at first sight he backed him gently against a wall and insisted on telling him an interminable anecdote of his shady past when it seemed he had been a super in some travelling company the plot of the story as far as charteris could follow it dealt with a theatrical tour in dublin where some person or persons unknown had with malice prepense scattered several pounds of snuff on the stage previous to a performance of hamlet and according to the character when the ghost of hamlets father sneezed steadily throughout his great scene there was not a dry eye in the house the character had concluded that anecdote and was halfway through another when charteris looking at his watch found that it was almost six oclock he interrupted one of the characters periods by diving past him and moving rapidly down the street the historian did not seem to object charteris looked round and saw that he had buttonholed a fresh victim he was still gazing in one direction and walking in another when he ran into somebody  sorry said charteris hastily hullo  it was the secretary of the old crockfordians and to judge from the scowl on that gentlemans face the recognition was mutual  its you is it said the secretary in his polished way  i believe so said charteris  out of bounds observed the man  charteris was surprised this grasp of technical lore on the part of a total outsider was as unexpected as it was gratifying  what do you know about bounds said charteris  i know you aint allowed to come ere and youll get it ot from your master for coming  ah but he wont know i shant tell him and im sure you will respect my secret  charteris smiled in a winning manner  ho said the man ho indeed  there is something very clinching about the word ho it seems definitely to apply the closure to any argument at least i have never yet met anyone who could tell me the suitable repartee  well said charteris affably dont let me keep you i must be going on  ho observed the man once more ho indeed  thats a wonderfully shrewd remark said charteris i can see that but i wish youd tell me exactly what it means  youre out of bounds  your mind seems to run in a groove you cant get off that bounds business how do you know stapletons out of bounds  i have made enquiries said the man darkly  by jove said charteris delightedly this is splendid youre a regular sleuthhound i dare say youve found out my name and house too  i may ave said the man or i may not ave  well now you mention it i suppose one of the two contingencies is probable well im awfully glad to have met you goodbye i must be going  youre goin with me  arm in arm  i dont want to ave to take you  no said charteris i should jolly well advise you not to try this is my way  he walked on till he came to the road that led to st austins the secretary of the old crockfordians stalked beside him with determined stride  now said charteris when they were on the road you mustnt mind if i walk rather fast im in a hurry  charteriss idea of walking rather fast was to dash off down the road at quartermile pace the move took the man by surprise but after a moment he followed with much panting it was evident that he was not in training charteris began to feel that the walk home might be amusing in its way after they had raced some three hundred yards he slowed down to a walk again it was at this point that his companion evinced a desire to do the rest of the journey with a hand on the collar of his coat  if you touch me observed charteris with a surprising knowledge of legal minutiae itll be a technical assault and youll get run in and youll get beans anyway if you try it on  the man reconsidered matters and elected not to try it on  half a mile from the college charteris began to walk rather fast again he was a good halfmiler and his companion was bad at every distance after a game struggle he dropped to the rear and finished a hundred yards behind in considerable straits charteris shot in at merevales door with five minutes to spare and went up to his study to worry welch by telling him about it  welch you remember the bargee who scragged tony well there have been all sorts of fresh developments hes just been pacing me all the way from stapleton  stapleton have you been to stapleton did merevale give you leave  no i didnt ask him  you are an idiot and now this bargee man will go straight to the old man and run you in i wonder you didnt think of that  curious i didnt  i suppose he saw you come in here  rather he couldnt have had a better view if hed paid for a seat half a second i must just run up with these volumes to tony  when he came back he found welch more serious than ever  i told you so said welch youre to go to the old man at once hes just sent over for you i say look here if its only lines i dont mind doing some of them if you like  charteris was quite touched by this sporting offer  its awfully good of you he said but it doesnt matter really i shall be all right  ten minutes later he returned beaming  well said welch whats he given you  only his love to give to you it was this way he first asked me if i wasnt perfectly aware that stapleton was out of bounds sir says i ive known it from childhoods earliest hour ah says he to me did mr merevale give you leave to go in this afternoon no says i i never consulted the gent you mention  well  then he ragged me for ten minutes and finally told me i must go into extra the next two saturdays  i thought so  ah but mark the sequel when he had finished i said that i was sorry i had mistaken the rules but i had thought that a chap was allowed to go into stapleton if he got leave from a master but you said that mr merevale did not give you leave said he friend of my youth i replied courteously you are perfectly correct as always mr merevale did not give me leave but i added suavely mr dacre did and i came away chanting hymns of triumph in a mellow baritone and leaving him in a dead faint on the sofa and the bargee who was present during the conflict swiftly and silently vanished away his morale considerably shattered and that my gentle welch concluded charteris cheerfully put me one up so pass the biscuits and let us rejoice if we never rejoice again    chapter 3  the easter term was nearing its end football with the exception of the final housematch which had still to come off was over and life was in consequence a trifle less exhilarating than it might have been in some ways the last few weeks before the easter holidays are quite pleasant you can put on running shorts and a blazer and potter about the grounds feeling strong and athletic and delude yourself into the notion that you are training for the sports ten minutes at the broad jump five with the weight a few sprints on the trackit is all very amusing and harmless but it is apt to become monotonous after a time and if the weather is at all inclined to be chilly such an occupation becomes impossible  charteris found things particularly dull he was a fair average runner but there were others far better at every distance so that he saw no use in mortifying the flesh with strict training on the other hand in view of the fact that the final housematch had yet to be played and that merevales was one of the two teams that were going to play it it behoved him to keep himself at least moderately fit the genial muffin and the cheery crumpet were still things to be avoided he thus found himself in a position where apparently the few things which it was possible for him to do were barred and the net result was that he felt slightly dull  to make matters worse all the rest of his set were working full time at their various employments and had no leisure for amusing him welch practised hundredyard sprints daily and imagined that it would be quite a treat for charteris to be allowed to time him so he gave him the stopwatch saw him safely to the end of the track and at a given signal dashed off in the approved american style by the time he reached the tape dutifully held by two sporting merevalian juniors charteriss attention had generally been attracted elsewhere what time welch would pant by jove charteris would observe blandly i forgot to look about a minute and a quarter i fancy at which welch who always had a notion that he had done it in ten and a fifth that time at any rate would dissemble his joy and mildly suggest that somebody else should hold the watch then there was jim thomson generally a perfect mine of elevating conversation he was in for the mile and also the half and refused to talk about anything except those distances and the best methods for running them in the minimum of time charteris began to feel a blue melancholy stealing over him the babe again he might have helped to while away the long hours but unfortunately the babe had been taken very bad with a notion that he was going to win the crosscountry run and when in addition to this he was seized with a panic with regard to the prospects of the house team in the final and began to throw out hints concerning strict training charteris regarded him as a person to be avoided if he fled to the babe for sympathy now the babe would be just as likely as not to suggest that he should come for a tenmile spin with him to get him into condition for the final houser the very thought of a tenmile spin made charteris feel faint lastly there was tony but tonys company was worse than none at all he went about with his arm in a sling and declined to be comforted but for his injury he would by now have been training hard for the aldershot boxing competition and the fact that he was now definitely out of it had a very depressing effect upon him he lounged moodily about the gymnasium watching menzies who was to take his place sparring with the instructor and refused consolation altogether charteris found life a distinct bore  he was reduced to such straits for amusement that one wednesday afternoon finding himself with nothing else to do he was working at a burlesque and remarkably scurrilous article on the staff by one who has suffered which he was going to insert in the glow worm an unofficial periodical which he had started for the amusement of the school and his own and his contributors profit he was just warming to his work and beginning to enjoy himself when the door opened without a preliminary knock charteris deftly slid a piece of blottingpaper over his ms for merevale occasionally entered a study in this manner and though there was nothing about merevale himself in the article it would be better perhaps thought charteris if he did not see it but it was not merevale it was somebody far worse the babe  the babe was clothed as to his body in football clothes and as to face in a look of holy enthusiasm charteris knew what that look meant it meant that the babe was going to try and drag him out for a run  go away babe he said im busy  why on earth are you slacking in here on this ripping afternoon  slacking said charteris i like that im doing berrain work babe im writing an article on masters and their customs which will cause a profound sensation in the common room at least it would if they ever saw it but they wont or i hope they wont for their sake and mine so run away my precious babe and dont disturb your uncle when hes busy  rot said the babe firmly you havent taken any exercise for a week  charteris replied proudly that he had wound up his watch only last night the babe refused to accept the remark as relevant to the matter in hand  look here alderman he said sitting down on the table and gazing sternly at his victim its all very well you know but the final comes on in a few days and you know you arent in any too good training  i am said charteris im as fit as a prize fighter simply full of beans feel my ribs  the babe declined the offer  no but i say he said plaintively i wish youd treat it seriously its getting jolly serious really if dacres win that cup again this year thatll make four years running  not so said charteris like the mariner of infiniteresourceandsagacity not so but far otherwise itll only make three  well threes bad enough  true oh king three is quite bad enough  well then there you are now you see  charteris looked puzzled  would you mind explaining that remark he said slowly  but the babe had got off the table and was prowling round the room opening cupboards and boxes  what are you playing at enquired charteris  where do you keep your footer things  what do you want with my footer things if you dont mind my asking  im going to help you put them on and then youre coming for a run  ah said charteris  yes just a gentle spin to keep you in training hullo this looks like them  he plunged both hands into a box near the window and flung out a mass of football clothes it reminded charteris of a terrier digging at a rabbithole  he protested  dont babe treat em tenderly youll be spoiling the crease in those bags if you heave em about like that im very particular about how i look on the football field i was always taught to dress myself like a little gentleman so to speak well now youve seen them put em away  put em on said the babe firmly  you are a beast babe i dont want to go for a run im getting too old for violent exercise  buck up said the babe we mustnt chuck any chances away now that tony cant play we shall have to do all we know if we want to win  i dont see what need there is to get nervous about it considering weve got three of the first threequarter line and the second fifteen back we ought to do pretty well  but look at dacres scrum theres prescott to start with hes worth any two of our men put together then theyve got carter smith and hemming out of the first and reevejones out of the second and their outsides arent so very bad if you come to think of it bannisters in the first and the other threequarters are all good and theyve got both the second halves youll have practically to look after both of them now that tonys crocked and baddeley has come on a lot this term  babe said charteris you have reason i will turn over a new leaf i will be good give me my things and ill come for a run only please dont let it be anything over twenty miles  good man said the gratified babe we wont go far and will take it quite easy  i tell you what said charteris do you know a place called worbury i thought you wouldnt probably its only a sort of hamlet two cottages three publichouses and a duckpond and that sort of thing i only know it because welch and i ran there once last year its in the badgwick direction about three miles by road mostly along the level i vote we muffle up fairly well blazers and sweaters and so on run to worbury tea at one of the cottages and back in time for lockup how does that strike you  it sounds all right how about tea though are you certain you can get it  rather the oldest inhabitant is quite a pal of mine  charteriss circle of acquaintances was a standing wonder to the babe and other merevalians he seemed to know everybody in the county  when once he was fairly started on any business physical or mental charteris generally shaped well it was the starting that he found the difficulty now that he was actually in motion he was enjoying himself thoroughly he wondered why on earth he had been so reluctant to come for this run the knowledge that there were three miles to go and that he was equal to them made him feel a new man he felt fit and there is nothing like feeling fit for dispelling boredom he swung along with the babe at a steady pace  theres the cottage he said as they turned a bend of the road and worbury appeared a couple of hundred yards away lets sprint they sprinted and arrived at the door of the cottage with scarcely a yard between them much to the admiration of the oldest inhabitant who was smoking a thoughtful pipe in his front garden mrs oldest inhabitant came out of the cottage at the sound of voices and charteris broached the subject of tea the menu was sumptuous and varied and even the babe in spite of his devotion to strict training could scarce forbear to smile happily at the mention of hot cakes  during the mauvais quart dheure before the meal charteris kept up an animated conversation with the oldest inhabitant the babe joining in from time to time when he could think of anything to say charteris appeared to be quite a friend of the family he enquired after the oldest inhabitants rheumatics it was gratifying to find that they were distinctly better how had mrs o i been since his last visit prarper hearty excellent how was the o is nevvy  at the mention of his nevvy the o i became discursive he told his audience everything that had happened in connection with the said nevvy for years back after which he started to describe what he would probably do in the future amongst other things there were going to be some sports at rutton today week and his nevvy was going to try and win the cup for what the oldest inhabitant vaguely described as a race he had won it last year yes prarper good runner his nevvy where was rutton the babe wanted to know about eight miles out of stapleton said charteris who was well up in local geography you got there by train it was the next station  mrs o i came out to say that tea was ready and being drawn into the conversation on the subject of the rutton sports produced a programme of the same which her nevvy had sent them from this it seemed that the nevvys spot event was the egg and spoon race an asterisk against his name pointed him out as the last years winner  hullo said charteris i see theres a strangers mile im a demon at the mile when im roused i think i shall go in for it  he handed the programme back and began his tea  you know babe he said as they were going back that evening i really think i shall go in for that race it would be a most awful rag its the day before the housematch so itll just get me fit  dont be a fool said the babe there would be a fearful row about it if you were found out youd get extras for the rest of your life  well the final houser comes off on a thursday so it wont affect that  yes but still  i shall think about it said charteris you neednt go telling anyone  if youll take my advice youll drop it  your suggestion has been noted and will receive due attention said charteris put on the pace a bit  they lengthened their stride and conversation came to an abrupt end    chapter 4  i shall go babe said charteris on the following night  the sixth form had a slack day before them on the morrow there being a temporary lull in the formwork which occurred about once a week when there was no composition of any kind to be done the sixth did four compositions a week two greek and two latin and except for these did not bother themselves very much about overnight preparation the latin authors which the form were doing were livy and virgil and when either of these were on the next days programme most of the sixth considered that they were justified in taking a night off they relied on their ability to translate both authors at sight and without previous acquaintance the popular notion that virgil is hard rarely appeals to a member of a public school there are two ways of translating virgil the conscientious and the other he prefers the other  on this particular night therefore work was off merevale was over at the great hall taking preparation and the sixthform merevalians had assembled in charteriss study to talk about things in general it was after a pause of some moments that had followed upon a lively discussion of the houses prospects in the forthcoming final that charteris had spoken  i shall go babe said he  go where asked tony from the depths of a deckchair  babe knows  the babe turned to the company and explained  the lunatics going in for the strangers mile at some sports at rutton next week hell get booked for a cert he cant see that i never saw such a man  rally round said charteris and reason with me ill listen tony what do you think about it  tony expressed his opinion tersely and charteris thanked him welch who had been reading now awoke to the fact that a discussion was in progress and asked for details the babe explained once more and welch heartily corroborated tonys remarks charteris thanked him too  you arent really going are you asked welch  rather said charteris  the old man wont give you leave  shant worry the poor man with such trifles  but its miles out of bounds stapleton station is out of bounds to start with its against rules to go in a train and ruttons even more out of bounds than stapleton  and as there are sports there said tony the old man is certain to put rutton specially out of bounds for that day he always bars a st austins chap going to a place when theres anything going on there  i dont care what have i to do with the old mans petty prejudices now let me get at my timetable here we are now then  dont be a fool said tony  certainly not look here theres a train starts from stapleton at three i can catch that all right gets to rutton at threetwenty sports begin at threefifteen at least they are supposed to over before five i should think at least my race will be though i must stop to see the oldest inhabitants nevvy win the egg and spoon canter but that ought to come on before the strangers race train back at a quarter past five arrives at a quarter to six lock up sixfifteen that gives me half an hour to get here from stapleton what more do you want i shall do it easily and  the odds against my being booked are about twentyfive to one at which price if any gent present cares to deposit his money i am willing to take him now ill treat you to a tune if youre good  he went to the cupboard and produced his gramophone charteriss musical instruments had at one time been strictly suppressed by the authorities and in consequence he had laid in a considerable stock of them at last when he discovered that there was no rule against the use of musical instruments in the house merevale had yielded the stipulation that charteris should play only before prep was rigidly observed except when merevale was over at the hall and the sixth had no work on such occasions charteris felt justified in breaking through the rule he had a gramophone a banjo a penny whistle and a mouth organ the banjo which he played really well was the most in request but the gramophone was also popular  turn on whistling rufus observed thomson  whistling rufus was duly turned on giving way after an encore to bluebells  i always weep when i hear this said tony  it is beautiful isnt it said charteris      ill be your sweetheart if youwill bemine     all my life ill be your valentine     bluebells ive gatheredgrrhhrh  the needle of the gramophone after the manner of its kind slipped raspingly over the surface of the wax and the rest of the ballad was lost  that said charteris is how i feel with regard to the old man id be his sweetheart if hed be mine but he makes no advances and the stain on my scutcheon is not yet wiped out i must say i havent tried gathering bluebells for him yet nor have i offered my services as a perpetual valentine but ive been very kind to him in other ways  is he still down on you asked the babe  he hasnt done much lately were in a state of truce at present did i tell you how i scored about stapleton  youve only told us about a hundred times said the babe brutally i tell you what though hell score off you if he finds you going to rutton  lets hope he wont  he wont said welch suddenly  why  because you wont go ill bet you anything you like that you wont go  that settled charteris it was the sort of remark that always acted on him like a tonic he had been intending to go all the time but it was this speech of welchs that definitely clinched the matter one of his mottoes for everyday use was let not thyself be scored off by welch  thats all right he said of course i shall go whats the next item youd like on this machine  the day of the sports arrived and the babe meeting charteris at merevales gate made a last attempt to head him off from his purpose  how are you going to take your things he asked you cant carry a bag the first beak you met would ask questions  if he had hoped that this would be a crushing argument he was disappointed  charteris patted a bloated coat pocket  bags he said laconically vest he added doing the same to his other pocket shoes he concluded you will observe i am carrying in a handy brown paper parcel and if anybody wants to know whats in it i shall tell them its acid drops sure you wont come too  quite thanks  all right so long then be good while im gone  and he passed on down the road that led to stapleton  the rutton recreation ground presented as the stapleton herald justly remarked in its next weeks issue a gay and animated appearance there was a larger crowd than charteris had expected he made his way through them resisting without difficulty the entreaties of a hoarse gentleman in a check suit to have three to two on enery something for the hundred yards and came at last to the dressingtent  at this point it occurred to him that it would be judicious to find out when his race was to start it was rather a chilly day and the less time he spent in the undress uniform of shorts the better he bought a correct card for twopence and scanned it the strangers mile was down for fourfifty there was no need to change for an hour yet he wished the authorities could have managed to date the event earlier  fourfifty was running it rather fine the race would be over by about five to five and it was a walk of some ten minutes to the station less if he hurried that would give him ten minutes for recovering from the effects of the race and changing back into his ordinary clothes again it would be quick work but having come so far he was not inclined to go back without running in the race he would never be able to hold his head up again if he did that he left the dressingtent and started on a tour of the field  the scene was quite different from anything he had ever witnessed before in the way of sports the sports at st austins were decorous to a degree these leaned more to the rollickingly convivial it was like an ordinary racemeeting except that men were running instead of horses rutton was a quiet little place for the majority of the year but it woke up on this day and was evidently out to enjoy itself the rural hooligan was a good deal in evidence and though he was comparatively quiet just at present the frequency with which he visited the various refreshment stalls that dotted the ground gave promise of livelier times in the future charteris felt that the afternoon would not be dull  the hour soon passed and charteris having first seen the oldest inhabitants nevvy romp home in the egg and spoon event took himself off to the dressingtent and began to get into his running clothes the bell for his race was just ringing when he left the tent he trotted over to the starting place  apparently there was not a very large field two weedylooking youths of about charteriss age dressed in blushing pink put in an appearance and a very tall thin man came up almost immediately afterwards charteris had just removed his coat and was about to get to his place on the line when another competitor arrived and to judge by the applause that greeted his appearance he was evidently a favourite in the locality it was with shock that charteris recognized his old acquaintance the bargees secretary  he was clad in running clothes of a bright orange and a smile of conscious superiority and when somebody in the crowd called out go it jarge he accepted the tribute as his due and waved a condescending hand in the speakers direction  some moments elapsed before he recognized charteris and the latter had time to decide upon his line of action if he attempted concealment in any way the man would recognize that on this occasion at any rate he had to use an adequate if unclassical expression got the bulge and then there would be trouble by brazening things out however there was just a chance that he might make him imagine that there was more in the matter than met the eye and that in some mysterious way he had actually obtained leave to visit rutton that day after all the man didnt know very much about school rules and the recollection of the recent fiasco in which he had taken part would make him think twice about playing the amateur policeman again especially in connection with charteris  so he smiled genially and expressed a hope that the man enjoyed robust health  the man replied by glaring in a simple and unaffected manner  looked up the headmaster lately asked charteris  what are you doing here  im going to run hope you dont mind  youre out of bounds  thats what you said before youd better enquire a bit before you make rash statements otherwise theres no knowing what may happen perhaps mr dacre has given me leave  the man said something objurgatory under his breath but forbore to continue the discussion he was wondering as charteris had expected that he would whether the latter had really got leave or not it was a difficult problem  whether such a result was due to his mental struggles or whether it was simply to be attributed to his poor running is open to question but the fact remains that the secretary of the old crockfordians did not shine in the strangers mile he came in last but one vanquishing the pink sportsman by a foot charteris after a hot finish was beaten on the tape by one of the weedy youths who exhibited astounding sprinting powers in the last two hundred yards overhauling charteris who had led all the time in fine style and scoring what the stapleton herald described as a highly popular victory  as soon as he had recovered his normal stock of windwhich was not immediatelyit was borne in upon charteris that if he wanted to catch the fivefifteen back to stapleton he had better be beginning to change he went to the dressingtent and on examining his watch was horrified to find that he had just ten minutes in which to do everything and the walk to the station he reflected was a long five minutes he literally hurled himself into his clothes and disregarding the bargee who had entered the tent and seemed to wish to continue the discussion at the point where they had left off shot off towards the gate nearest the station he had exactly four minutes and twentyfive seconds in which to complete the journey and he had just run a mile    chapter 5  fortunately the road was mainly level on the other hand he was hampered by an overcoat after the first hundred yards he took this off and carried it in an unwieldy parcel this he found answered admirably running became easier he had worked the stiffness out of his legs by this time and was going well three hundred yards from the station it was anybodys race the exact position of the other competitor the train could not be defined it was at any rate not yet within earshot which meant that it still had at least a quarter of a mile to go charteris considered that he had earned a rest he slowed down to a walk but after proceeding at this pace for a few yards thought that he heard a distant whistle and dashed on again suddenly a raucous bellow of laughter greeted his ears from a spot in front of him hidden from his sight by a bend in the road  somebody slightly tight thought charteris rapidly diagnosing the case by jove if he comes rotting about with me ill kill him having to do anything in a desperate hurry always made charteriss temper slightly villainous he turned the corner at a sharp trot and came upon two youths who seemed to be engaged in the harmless occupation of trying to ride a bicycle they were of the type which he held in especial aversion the rural hooligan type and one at least of the two had evidently been present at a recent circulation of the festive bowl he was wheeling the bicycle about the road in an aimless manner and looked as if he wondered what was the matter with it that it would not stay in the same place for two consecutive seconds the other youth was apparently of the charleshisfriend variety content to look on and applaud and generally to play chorus to his companions lead he was standing at the side of the road smiling broadly in a way that argued feebleness of mind charteris was not quite sure which of the two types he loathed the more he was inclined to call it a tie  however there seemed to be nothing particularly lawless in what they were doing now if they were content to let him pass without hindrance he for his part was content generously to overlook the insult they offered him in daring to exist and to maintain a state of truce but as he drew nearer he saw that there was more in this business than the casual spectator might at first have supposed a second and keener inspection of the reptiles revealed fresh phenomena in the first place the bicycle which hooligan number one was playing with was a ladys bicycle and a small one at that now up to the age of fourteen and the weight of ten stone a beginner at cycling often finds it more convenient to learn to ride on a ladys machine than on a gentlemans the former offers greater facilities for rapid dismounting a quality not to be despised in the earlier stages of initiation but though this is undoubtedly the case and though charteris knew that it was so yet he felt instinctively that there was something wrong here hooligans of twenty years and twelve stone do not learn to ride on small ladies machines or if they do it is probably without the permission of the small lady who owns the same valuable as his time was charteris felt that it behoved him to spend a thoughtful minute or so examining into this affair he slowed down once again to a walk and as he did so his eye fell upon the character in the drama whose absence had puzzled him the owner of the bicycle and from that moment he felt that life would be a hollow mockery if he failed to fall upon those revellers and slay them she stood by the hedge on the right a forlorn little figure in grey and she gazed sadly and helplessly at the manoeuvres that were going on in the middle of the road her age charteris put down at a venture at twelvea correct guess her state of mind he also conjectured she was letting i dare not wait upon i would like the late macbeth the cat i the adage and numerous other celebrities she evidently had plenty of remarks to make on the subject in hand but refrained from motives of prudence  charteris had no such scruples the feeling of fatigue that had been upon him had vanished and his temper which had been growing steadily worse for some twenty minutes now boiled over gleefully at the prospect of something solid to work itself off upon even without a cause charteris detested the rural hooligan now that a real copperbottomed motive for this dislike had been supplied to him he felt himself capable of dealing with a whole regiment of the breed the criminal with the bicycle had just let it fall with a crash to the ground when charteris went for him low in the style which the babe always insisted on seeing in members of the first fifteen on the football field and hove him without comment into a damp ditch charles his friend uttered a shout of disapproval and rushed into the fray charteris gave him the straight left of the type to which the great john jackson is reported to have owed so much in the days of the old prize ring and charles taking it between the eyes stopped in a discouraged and discontented manner and began to rub the place whereupon charteris dashed in and to use an expression suitable to the deed swung his right at the mark the mark it may be explained for the benefit of the nonpugilistic is that portion of the anatomy which lies hid behind the third button of the human waistcoat it coversin a most inadequate waythe wind and even a gentle tap in the locality is apt to produce a fleeting sense of discomfort a genuine flush hit on the spot shrewdly administered by a muscular arm with the weight of the body behind it causes the passive agent in the transaction to wish fervently as far as he is at the moment physically capable of wishing anything that he had never been born charles his friend collapsed like an empty sack and charteris getting a grip of the outlying portions of his costume dragged him to the ditch and rolled him in on top of his friend who had just recovered sufficiently to be thinking about getting out again the pair of them lay there in a tangled heap charteris picked up the bicycle and gave it a cursory examination the enamel was a good deal scratched but no material damage had been done he wheeled it across to its owner  it isnt much hurt he said as they walked on slowly together bit scratched thats all  thanks awfully said the small lady  oh not at all replied charteris i enjoyed it he felt he had said the right thing there your real hero always enjoys it im sorry those bargees frightened you  they did rather butshe added triumphantly after a pausei didnt cry  rather not said charteris you were awfully plucky i noticed but hadnt you better ride on which way were you going  i wanted to get to stapleton  oh thats simple enough youve merely got to go straight on down this road as straight as ever you can go but look here you know you shouldnt be out alone like this it isnt safe why did they let you  the lady avoided his eye she bent down and inspected the left pedal  they shouldnt have sent you out alone said charteris why did they  theythey didnt i came  there was a world of meaning in the phrase charteris felt that he was in the same case they had not let him he had come here was a kindred spirit another revolutionary soul scorning the fetters of convention and the socalled authority of selfconstituted rules aha bureaucrats  shake hands he said im in just the same way  they shook hands gravely  you know said the lady im awfully sorry i did it now it was very naughty  im not sorry yet said charteris im rather glad than otherwise but i expect i shall be sorry before long  will you be sent to bed  i dont think so  will you have to learn beastly poetry  probably not  she looked at him curiously as if to enquire then if you wont have to learn poetry and you wont get sent to bed what on earth is there for you to worry about  she would probably have gone on to investigate the problem further but at that moment there came the sound of a whistle then another closer this time then a faint rumbling which increased in volume steadily charteris looked back the railway line ran by the side of the road he could see the smoke of a train through the trees it was quite close now and coming closer every minute and he was still quite a hundred and fifty yards from the station gates  i say he cried great scott here comes my train i must rush goodbye you keep straight on  his legs had had time to grow stiff again for the first few strides running was painful but his joints soon adapted themselves to the strain and in ten seconds he was sprinting as fast as he had ever sprinted off the runningtrack when he had travelled a quarter of the distance the small cyclist overtook him  be quick she said its just in sight  charteris quickened his stride and paced by the bicycle spun along in fine style forty yards from the station the train passed him he saw it roll into the station there were still twenty yards to go exclusive of the stations steps and he was already running as fast as it lay in him to run now there were only ten now five and at last with a hurried farewell to his companion he bounded up the steps and on to the platform at the end of the platform the line took a sharp curve to the left round that curve the tail end of the guards van was just disappearing  missed it sir said the solitary porter who managed things at rutton cheerfully he spoke as if he was congratulating charteris on having done something remarkably clever  whens the next panted charteris  eightthirty was the porters appalling reply  for a moment charteris felt quite ill no train till eightthirty then was he indeed lost but it couldnt be true there must be some sort of a train between now and then  are you certain he said surely theres a train before that  why yes sir said the porter gleefully but they be all exprusses eightthirty be the only un what starps at rootton  thanks said charteris with marked gloom i dont think thatll be much good to me my aunt what a hole im in   the porter made a sympathetic and interrogative noise at the back of his throat as if inviting him to explain everything but charteris felt unequal to conversation there are moments when one wants to be alone he went down the steps again when he got out into the road his small cycling friend had vanished charteris was conscious of a feeling of envy towards her she was doing the journey comfortably on a bicycle he would have to walk it walk it he didnt believe he could the strangers mile followed by the homeric combat with the two hooligans and that ghastly sprint to wind up with had left him decidedly unfit for further feats of pedestrianism and it was eight miles to stapleton if it was a yard and another mile from stapleton to st austins charteris having once more invoked the name of his aunt pulled himself together with an effort and limped gallantly on in the direction of stapleton but fate so long hostile to him at last relented a rattle of wheels approached him from behind a thrill of hope shot through him at the sound there was the prospect of a lift he stopped and waited for the dogcartit sounded like a dogcartto arrive then he uttered a shout of rapture and began to wave his arms like a semaphore the man in the dogcart was dr adamson  hullo charteris said the doctor pulling up his horse what are you doing here  give me a lift said charteris and ill tell you its a long yarn can i get in  come along plenty of room  charteris climbed up and sank on to the cushioned seat with a sigh of pleasure what glorious comfort he had never enjoyed anything more in his life  im nearly dead he said as the dogcart went on again this is how it all happened you see it was this way  and he embarked forthwith upon his narrative    chapter 6  by special request the doctor dropped charteris within a hundred yards of merevales door  goodnight he said i dont suppose you will value my advice at all but you may have it for what it is worth i recommend you stop this sort of game next time something will happen  by jove yes said charteris climbing painfully down from the dogcart ill take that advice im a reformed character from this day onwards this sort of thing isnt good enough hullo theres the bell for lockup goodnight doctor and thanks most awfully for the lift it was frightfully kind of you  dont mention it said dr adamson it is always a privilege to be in your company when are you coming to tea with me again  whenever youll have me i must get leave though this time  yes by the way hows graham it is graham isnt it the fellow who broke his collarbone  oh hes getting on splendidly still in a sling but its almost well again now but i must be off goodnight  goodnight come to tea next monday  right said charteris thanks awfully  he hobbled in at merevales gate and went up to his study the babe was in there talking to welch  hullo said the babe heres charteris  whats left of him said charteris  how did it go off  dont please  did you win asked welch  no second by a yard oh lord i am dead  hot race  rather it wasnt that though i had to sprint all the way to the station and missed my train by ten seconds at the end of it all  then how did you get here  that was the one stroke of luck ive had this afternoon i started to walk back and after id gone about a quarter of a mile adamson caught me up in his dogcart i suggested that it would be a christian act on his part to give me a lift and he did i shall remember adamson in my will  tell us what happened  ill tell thee everything i can said charteris theres little to relate i saw an aged aged man asitting on a gate where do you want me to begin  at the beginning dont rot  i was born began charteris of poor but honest parents who sent me to school at an early age in order that i might acquire a grasp of the greek and latin languages now obsolete i  how did you lose enquired the babe  the other man beat me if he hadnt i should have won hands down oh i say guess who i met at rutton  not a beak  no almost as bad though the bargee man who paced me from stapleton man who crocked tony  great scott cried the babe did he recognize you  rather we had a very pleasant conversation  if he reports you began the babe  whos that  charteris looked up tony graham had entered the study  hullo tony adamson told me to remember him to you  so youve got back  charteris confirmed the hasty guess  but what are you talking about babe said tony whos going to be reported and whos going to report  the babe briefly explained the situation  if the man he said reports charteris he may get run in tomorrow and then we shall have both our halves away against dacres charteris you are a fool to go rotting about out of bounds like this  nay dry the starting tear said charteris cheerfully in the first place i shouldnt get kept in on a thursday anyhow i should be shoved into extra on saturday also i shrewdly conveyed to the bargee the impression that i was at rutton by special permission  hes bound to know that that cant be true said tony  well i told him to think it over you see he got so badly left last time he tried to compass my downfall that i shouldnt be a bit surprised if he let the job alone this journey  lets hope so said the babe gloomily  thats right babby remarked charteris encouragingly nodding at the pessimist  you buck up and keep looking on the bright side itll be all right you see if it wont if theres any running in to be done i shall do it i shall be frightfully fit tomorrow after all this dashing about today i havent an ounce of superfluous flesh on me im a fine strapping specimen of sturdy young english manhood and im going to play a very selfish game tomorrow babe  oh my dear chap you mustnt the babes face wore an expression of horror the success of the houseteam in the final was very near to his heart he could not understand anyone jesting on the subject charteris respected his anguish and relieved it speedily  i was only ragging he said considering that our threequarter line is our one strong point im not likely to keep the ball from it if i get a chance of getting it out make your mind easy babe  the final housematch was always a warmish game the rivalry between the various houses was great and the football cup especially was fought for with immense keenness also the match was the last fixture of the season and there was a certain feeling in the teams that if they did happen to disable a man or two it would not matter much the injured sportsman would not be needed for schoolmatch purposes for another six months as a result of which philosophical reflection the tackling was ruled slightly energetic and the handingoff was done with vigour  this year to add a sort of finishing touch there was just a little illfeeling between dacres and merevales the cause of it was the babe until the beginning of the term he had been a day boy then the news began to circulate that he was going to become a boarder either at dacres or at merevales he chose the latter and dacres felt slightly aggrieved some of the less sportsmanlike members of the house had proposed that a protest should be made against his being allowed to play but fortunately for the credit of dacres prescott the captain of the house fifteen had put his foot down with an emphatic bang at the suggestion as he sagely pointed out there were some things which were bad form and this was one of them if the team wanted to express their disapproval said he let them do it on the field by tackling their very hardest he personally was going to do his best and he advised them to do the same  the rumour of this bad blood had got about the school in some mysterious manner and when swift merevales only first fifteen forward kicked off up the hill a large crowd was lining the ropes it was evident from the outset that it would be a good game  dacres were the better sideas a team they had no really weak spot but merevales extraordinarily strong threequarter line somewhat made up for an inferior scrum and the fact that the babe was in the centre was worth much  at first dacres pressed their pack was unusually heavy for a houseteam and they made full use of it they took the ball down the field in short rushes till they were in merevales twentyfive then they began to heel and if things had been more or less exciting for the merevalians before they became doubly so now the ground was dry and so was the ball and the game consequently waxed fast time after time the ball went along dacres threequarter line only to end by finding itself hurled with the wing who was carrying it into touch occasionally the centres instead of feeding their wings would try to dodge through themselves and that was where the babe came in he was admittedly the best tackler in the school but on this occasion he excelled himself his man never had a chance of getting past at last a lofty kick into touch over the heads of the spectators gave the players a few seconds rest  the babe went up to charteris  look here he said its risky but i think well try having the ball out a bit  in our own twentyfive said charteris  wherever we are i believe it will come off all right anyway well try it tell the forwards  for forwards playing against a pack much heavier than themselves it is easier to talk about letting the ball out than to do it the first half dozen times that merevales scrum tried to heel they were shoved off their feet and it was on the enemys side that the ball went out but the seventh attempt succeeded out it came cleanly and speedily daintree who was playing instead of tony switched it across to charteris charteris dodged the half who was marking him and ran heeling and passing in ones own twentyfive is like smokingan excellent practice if indulged in in moderation on this occasion it answered perfectly charteris ran to the halfway line and handed the ball on to the babe the babe was tackled from behind and passed to thomson thomson dodged his man and passed to welch on the wing welch was the fastest sprinter in the school it was a pleasureif you did not happen to be one of the opposing sideto see him race down the touchline he was off like an arrow dacres back made a futile attempt to get at him welch could have given the back fifteen yards in a hundred he ran round him and amidst terrific applause from the merevalessupporting section of the audience scored between the posts the babe took the kick and converted without difficulty five minutes afterwards the whistle blew for halftime  the remainder of the game does not call for detailed description dacres pressed nearly the whole of the last half hour but twice more the ball came out and went down merevales threequarter line once it was the babe who scored with a run from his own goalline and once charteris who got in from halfway dodging through the whole team the last ten minutes of the game was marked by a slight excess of energy on both sides dacres forwards were in a decidedly bad temper and fought like tigers to break through and merevales played up to them with spirit the babe seemed continually to be precipitating himself at the feet of rushing forwards and charteris felt as if at least a dozen bones were broken in various portions of his anatomy the game ended on merevales line but they had won the match and the cup by two goals and a try to nothing  charteris limped off the field cheerful but damaged he ached all over and there was a large bruise on his left cheekbone he and babe were going to the house when they were aware that the headmaster was beckoning to them  well macarthur and what was the result of the match  we won sir boomed the babe two goals and a try to nil  you have hurt your cheek charteris  yes sir  how did you do that  i got a kick sir in one of the rushes  ah i should bathe it charteris bathe it well i hope it will not be very painful bathe it well in warm water  he walked on  you know said charteris to the babe as they went into the house the old man isnt such a bad sort after all he has his points dont you think  the babe said that he did  im going to reform you know continued charteris confidentially  its about time said the babe you can have the bath first if you like only buck up  charteris boiled himself for ten minutes and then dragged his weary limbs to his study it was while he was sitting in a deckchair eating mixed biscuits and wondering if he would ever be able to summon up sufficient energy to put on garments of civilization that somebody knocked at the door  yes shouted charteris what is it dont come in im changing  the melodious treble of master crowinshaw his fag made itself heard through the keyhole  the head told me to tell you that he wanted to see you at the school house as soon as you can go  all right shouted charteris thanks  now what he continued to himself does the old man want to see me for perhaps he wants to make certain that ive bathed my cheek in warm water anyhow i suppose i must go  a quarter of an hour later he presented himself at the headmagisterial door the sedate parker the heads butler who always filled charteris with a desire to dig him hard in the ribs just to see what would happen ushered him into the study  the headmaster was reading by the light of a lamp when charteris came in he laid down his book and motioned him to a seat after which there was an awkward pause  i have just received began the head at last a most unpleasant communication most unpleasant from whom it comes i do not know it is in facteranonymous i am sorry that i ever read it  he stopped charteris made no comment he guessed what was coming he too was sorry that the head had ever read the letter  the writer says that he saw you that he actually spoke to you at the athletic sports at rutton yesterday i have called you in to tell me if that is true the head fastened an accusing eye on his companion  it is quite true sir said charteris steadily  what said the head sharply you were at rutton  yes sir  you were perfectly aware i suppose that you were breaking the school rules by going there charteris enquired the head in a cold voice  yes sir there was another pause  this is very serious began the head i cannot overlook this i  there was a slight scuffle of feet in the passage outside the door flew open vigorously and a young lady entered it was as charteris recognized in a minute his acquaintance of the afternoon the young lady of the bicycle  uncle she said have you seen my book anywhere  hullo she broke off as her eye fell on charteris  hullo said charteris affably not to be outdone in the courtesies  did you catch your train  no missed it  hullo whats the matter with your cheek  i got a kick on it  oh does it hurt  not much thanks  here the head feeling perhaps a little out of it put in his oar  dorothy you must not come here now i am busy and how may i ask do you and charteris come to be acquainted  why hes him said dorothy lucidly  the head looked puzzled  him the chap you know  it is greatly to the heads credit that he grasped the meaning of these words long study of the classics had quickened his faculty for seeing sense in passages where there was none the situation dawned upon him  do you mean to tell me dorothy that it was charteris who came to your assistance yesterday  dorothy nodded energetically  he gave the men beans she said he did really she went on regardless of the heads look of horror he used right and left with considerable effect  dorothys brother a keen follower of the ring had been good enough some days before to read her out an extract from an account in the sportsman of a match at the national sporting club and the account had been much to her liking she regarded it as a masterpiece of english composition  dorothy said the headmaster run away to bed a suggestion which she treated with scorn it wanting a clear two hours to her legal bedtime i must speak to your mother about your deplorable habit of using slang dear me i must certainly speak to her  and shamefully unabashed dorothy retired  the head was silent for a few minutes after she had gone then he turned to charteris again  in consideration of this charteris i shallermitigate slightly the punishment i had intended to give you  charteris murmured his gratification  but continued the head sternly i cannot overlook the offence i have my duty to consider you will therefore write meerten lines of virgil by tomorrow evening charteris  yes sir  latin and english said the relentless pedagogue  yes sir  and charterisi am speaking nowerunofficially not as a headmaster you understandif in future you would cease to break school rules simply as a matter of principle for that i fancy is what it amounts to ierwell i think we should get on better together and that is on my part at least a consummationerdevoutly to be wished goodnight charteris  goodnight sir  the head extended a large hand charteris took it and his departure  the headmaster opened his book again and turned over a new leaf charteris at the same moment walking slowly in the direction of merevales was resolving for the future to do the very same thing and he did     9  how payne bucked up   it was walkinshaws affair from the first grey the captain of the st austins fifteen was in the infirmary nursing a bad knee to him came charles augustus walkinshaw with a scheme walkinshaw was football secretary and in greys absence acted as captain besides these two there were only a couple of last years team leftreade and barrett both of philpotts house  hullo grey hows the knee said walkinshaw  hows the team getting on he said  well as far as i can see said walkinshaw we ought to have a rather good season if youd only hurry up and come back we beat a jolly hot lot of all comers yesterday smith was playing for them the blue you know and lots of others we got a goal and a try to nil  good said grey who did anything for us who scored  i got in once payne got the other  by jove did he what sort of a game is he playing this year  the moment had come for walkinshaw to unburden himself to his scheme he proceeded to do so  not up to much he said look here grey ive got rather an idea its my opinion paynes not bucking up nearly as much as he might do you mind if i leave him out of the next game  grey stared the idea was revolutionary  what leave him out my good man hell be the next chap to get his colours hes a cert for his cap  thats just it he knows hes a cert and hes slacking on the strength of it now my idea is that if you slung him out for a match or two hed buck up extra hard when he came into the team again cant i have a shot at it  grey weighed the matter walkinshaw pressed home his arguments  you see it isnt like cricket at cricket of course it might put a chap off awfully to be left out but i dont see how it can hurt a mans play at footer besides hes beginning to stick on side already  is he by jove said grey this was the unpardonable sin well ill tell you what you can do if you like get up a scratch game first fifteen v second and make him captain of the second  right said walkinshaw and retired beaming  walkinshaw it may be remarked at once to prevent mistakes was a wellmeaning idiot there was no doubt about his being wellmeaning also there was no doubt about his being an idiot he was continually getting insane ideas into his head and being unable to get them out again this matter of payne was a good example of his customary methods he had put his hand on the one really firstclass forward st austins possessed and proposed to remove him from the team and yet through it all he was perfectly wellmeaning the fact that personally he rather disliked payne had to do him justice no weight at all with him he would have done the same by his bosom friend under like circumstances this is the only excuse that can be offered for him it was true that payne regarded himself as a certainty for his colours as far as anything can be considered certain in this vale of sorrow but to accuse him of trading on this and to use the vernacular of putting on side was unjust to a degree  on the afternoon following this conversation payne who was a member of dacres house came into his study and banged his books down on the table with much emphasis this was a sign that he was feeling dissatisfied with the way in which affairs were conducted in the world bowden who was asleep in an armchairhe had been staying in with a coldwoke with a start bowden shared paynes study he played centre threequarter for the second fifteen  hullo he said  payne grunted bowden realized that matters had not been going well with him he attempted to soothe him with conversation choosing what he thought would be a congenial topic  whats on on saturday he asked  scratch game first v second  bowden groaned  i know those first v second games he said they turn the second out to get butchered for thirtyfive minutes each way to improve the firsts combination it may be fun for the first but its not nearly so rollicking for us look here payne if you find me with the pill at any time you can let me down easy you know you neednt go bringing off any of your beastly gallery tackles  i wont said payne to start with it would be against rules we happen to be on the same side  rot man im not playing for the first this was the only explanation that occurred to him  im playing for the second  what are you certain  ive seen the list theyre playing babington instead of me  but why babingtons no good  i think they have a sort of idea im slacking or something at any rate walkinshaw told me that if i bucked up i might get tried again  silly goat said bowden what are you going to do  im going to take his advice and buck up  ii  he did at the beginning of the game the ropes were lined by some thirty spectators who had come to derive a languid enjoyment from seeing the first pile up a record score by halftime their numbers had risen to an excited mob of something over three hundred and the second half of the game was fought out to the accompaniment of a storm of yells and counter yells such as usually only belonged to schoolmatches the second fifteen after a poor start suddenly awoke to the fact that this was not going to be the conventional massacre by any means the first had scored an unconverted try five minutes after the kickoff and it was after this that the second began to get together the school back bungled the drop out badly and had to find touch in his own twentyfive and after that it was anyones game the scrums were a treat to behold payne was a monument of strength time after time the second had the ball out to their threequarters and just after halftime bowden slipped through in the corner the kick failed and the two teams with their scores equal now settled down grimly to fight the thing out to a finish but though they remained on their opponents line for most of the rest of the game the second did not add to their score and the match ended in a draw of three points all  the first intimation grey received of this came to him late in the evening he had been reading a novel which whatever its other merits may have been was not interesting and it had sent him to sleep he awoke to hear a wellknown voice observe with some unction ah myes leeches and hot fomentations this effectually banished sleep if there were two things in the world that he loathed they were leeches and hot fomentations and the school doctor apparently regarded them as a panacea for every kind of bodily ailment from a fractured skull to a cold in the head it was this gentleman who had just spoken but greys alarm vanished as he perceived that the words had no personal application to himself the object of the remark was a fellowsufferer in the next bed but one now grey was certain that when he had fallen asleep there had been nobody in that bed when therefore the medical expert had departed on his fell errand the quest of leeches and hot fomentations he sat up and gave tongue  whos that in that bed he asked  hullo grey replied a voice didnt know you were awake ive come to keep you company  that you barrett whats up with you  collarbone dislocated it or something reades over in that corner he has bust his ankle oh yes weve been having a nice cheery afternoon concluded barrett bitterly  great scott how did it happen  payne  where in your collarbone  yes that wasnt what i meant though what i was explaining was that payne got hold of me in the middle of the field and threw me into touch after which he fell on me that was enough for my simple needs im not grasping  how about reade  the entire second scrum collapsed on top of reade when we dug him out his ankle was crocked mainspring gone probably then they gathered up the pieces and took them gently away i dont know how it all ended  just then walkinshaw burst into the room he had a large bruise over one eye his arm was in a sling and he limped but he was in excellent spirits  i knew i was right by jove he observed to grey i knew he could buck up if he liked  i know it now said barrett  whos this youre talking about said grey  payne ive never seen anything like the game he played today he was everywhere and by jove his tackling  dont said barrett wearily  its the best match i ever played in said walkinshaw bubbling over with enthusiasm do you know the second had all the best of the game  what was the score  draw one try all  and now i suppose youre satisfied enquired barrett the great scheme for the regeneration of payne had been confided to him by its proud patentee  almost said walkinshaw well continue the treatment for one more game and then well have him simply fizzing for the windybury match thats next saturday by the way im afraid youll hardly be fit again in time for that barrett will you  i may possibly said barrett coldly be getting about again in time for the windybury match of the year after next this year im afraid i shall not have the pleasure and i should strongly advise you if you dont want to have to put a team of cripples into the field to discontinue the treatment as you call it  oh i dont know said walkinshaw  on the following wednesday evening at five oclock something was carried in on a stretcher and deposited in the bed which lay between grey and barrett close scrutiny revealed the fact that it was what had once been charles augustus walkinshaw he was slightly broken up  payne enquired grey in chilly tones  walkinshaw admitted the impeachment  grey took a pencil and a piece of paper from the table at his side if you want to know what im doing he said im writing out the team for the windybury match and im going to make payne captain as the senior second fifteen man and if we win im jolly well going to give him his cap after the match if we dont win itll be the fault of a raving lunatic of the name of walkinshaw with his beastly colney hatch schemes for reforming slack forwards you utter rotter  fortunately for the future peace of mind of c a walkinshaw the latter contingency did not occur the school in spite of its absentees contrived to pull the match off by a try to nil payne as was only right and proper scored the try making his way through the ranks of the visiting team with the quiet persistence of a steamroller after the game he came to tea by request at the infirmary and was straightaway invested by grey with his first fifteen colours on his arrival he surveyed the invalids with interest  rough game footer he observed at length  dont mention it said barrett politely leeches he added dreamily leeches and hot fomentations boiling fomentations will somebody kindly murder walkinshaw  why asked payne innocently     10  author   j s m babington of dacres house was on the horns of a dilemma circumstances over which he had had no control had brought him like another hercules to the crossroads and had put before him the choice between pleasure and duty or rather between pleasure and what those in authority called duty being human he would have had little difficulty in making his decision had not the path of pleasure been so hedged about by danger as to make him doubt whether after all the thing could be carried through  the facts in the case were these it was the custom of the mathematical set to which j s m babington belonged 4b to wit to relieve the tedium of the daily lesson with a species of round game which was played as follows as soon as the master had taken his seat one of the players would execute a manoeuvre calculated to draw attention on himself such as dropping a book or upsetting the blackboard called up to the desk to give explanation he would embark on an eloquent speech for the defence this was the cue for the next player to begin his part consisted in making his way to the desk and testifying to the moral excellence of his companion and giving in full the reasons why he should be discharged without a stain upon his character as soon as he had warmed to his work he would be followed by a third player and so on until the standing room around the desk was completely filled with a great cloud of witnesses the duration of the game varied of course considerably on some occasions it could be played through with such success that the master would enter into the spirit of the thing and do his best to book the names of all offenders at one and the same time a feat of no inconsiderable difficulty at other times matters would come to a head more rapidly in any case much innocent fun was to be derived from it and its popularity was great on the day however on which this story opens a new master had been temporarily loosed into the room in place of the rev septimus brown who had been there as long as the oldest inhabitant could remember the rev septimus was a wrangler but knew nothing of the ways of the human boy his successor mr reginald seymour was a poor mathematician but a good master he had been moreover a cambridge rugger blue this fact alone should have ensured him against the customary pleasantries for a blue is a man to be respected it was not only injudicious therefore but positively wrong of babington to plunge against the blackboard on his way to his place if he had been a student of tennyson he might have remembered that the old order is in the habit of changing and yielding place to the new  mr seymour looked thoughtfully for a moment at the blackboard  that was rather a crude effort he said pleasantly to babington you lack finesse pick it up again please  babington picked it up without protest under the rule of the rev septimus this would have been the signal for the rest of the class to leave their places and assist him but now they seemed to realize that there was a time for everything and that this was decidedly no time for indoor games  thank you said mr seymour when the board was in its place again what is your name eh what i didnt quite hear  babington sir  ah you had better come in tomorrow at two and work out examples three hundred to threetwenty in hall and knight there is really plenty of room to walk in between that desk and the blackboard it only wants practice  what was left of babington then went to his seat he felt that his reputation as an artistic player of the game had received a shattering blow then there was the imposition this in itself would have troubled him little to be kept in on a halfholiday is annoying but it is one of those ills which the flesh is heir to and your true philosopher can always take his gruel like a man  but it so happened that by the evening post he had received a letter from a cousin of his who was a student at guys and from all accounts was building up a great reputation in the medical world from this letter it appeared that by a complicated process of knowing people who knew other people who had influence with the management he had contrived to obtain two tickets for a morning performance of the new piece that had just been produced at one of the theatres and if mr j s m babington wished to avail himself of the opportunity would he write by return and be at charing cross underground bookstall at twenty past two  now babington though he objected strongly to the drama of ancient greece was very fond of that of the present day and he registered a vow that if the matter could possibly be carried through it should be his choice was obvious he could cut his engagement with mr seymour or he could keep it the difficulty lay rather in deciding upon one or other of the alternatives the whole thing turned upon the extent of the penalty in the event of detection  that was his dilemma he sought advice  i should risk it said his bosom friend peterson  i shouldnt advise you to remarked jenkins  jenkins was equally a bosom friend and in the matter of wisdom in no way inferior to peterson  what would happen do you think asked babington  sack said one authority  jaw and double impot said another  the daily telegraph muttered the tempter in a stage aside calls it the best comedy since sheridan  so it does thought babington ill risk it  youll be a fool if you do croaked the gloomy jenkins youre bound to be caught but the ayes had it babington wrote off that night accepting the invitation  it was with feelings of distinct relief that he heard mr seymour express to another master his intention of catching the twelvefifteen train up to town it meant that he would not be on the scene to see him start on the hall and knight unless luck were very much against him babington might reasonably hope that he would accept the imposition without any questions he had taken the precaution to get the examples finished overnight with the help of peterson and jenkins aided by a weird being who actually appeared to like algebra and turned out ten of the twenty problems in an incredibly short time in exchange for a couple of works of fiction down and a tea at a date he himself meant to catch the onethirty which would bring him to town in good time peterson had promised to answer his name at rollcall a delicate operation in which long practice had made him like many others of the junior members of the house no mean proficient  it would be pleasant for a conscientious historian to be able to say that the onethirty broke down just outside victoria and that babington arrived at the theatre at the precise moment when the curtain fell and the gratified audience began to stream out but truth though it crush me the onethirty was so punctual that one might have thought that it belonged to a line other than the line to which it did belong from victoria to charing cross is a journey that occupies no considerable time and babington found himself at his destination with five minutes to wait at twenty past his cousin arrived and they made their way to the theatre a brief skirmish with a liveried menial in the lobby and they were in their seats  some philosopher of extraordinary powers of intuition once informed the world that the best of things come at last to an end the statement was tested and is now universally accepted as correct to apply the general to the particular the play came to an end amidst uproarious applause to which babington contributed an unstinted quotum about three hours after it had begun  what do you say to going and grubbing somewhere asked babingtons cousin as they made their way out  hullo theres that man richards he continued before babington could reply that of all possible actions he considered that of going and grubbing somewhere the most desirable fellow i know at guys you know he added in explanation ill get him to join us youll like him i expect  richards professed himself delighted and shook hands with babington with a fervour which seemed to imply that until he had met him life had been a dreary blank but that now he could begin to enjoy himself again i should like to join you if you dont mind including a friend of mine in the party said richards he was to meet me here by the way hes the author of that new piecethe way of the world  why weve just been there  oh then you will probably like to meet him here he is  as he spoke a man came towards them and with a shock that sent all the blood in his body to the very summit of his head and then to the very extremities of his boots babington recognized mr seymour the assurance of the programme that the play was by walter walsh was a fraud nay worse a downright and culpable lie he started with the vague idea of making a rush for safety but before his paralysed limbs could be induced to work mr seymour had arrived and he was being introduced oh the tragic irony of it to the man for whose benefit he was at that very moment supposed to be working out examples three hundred to threetwenty in hall and knight  mr seymour shook hands without appearing to recognize him babingtons blood began to resume its normal position again though he felt that this seeming ignorance of his identity might be a mere veneer a wile of guile as the bard puts it he remembered with a pang a story in some magazine where a prisoner was subjected to what the lighthearted inquisitors called the torture of hope he was allowed to escape from prison and pass guards and sentries apparently without their noticing him then just as he stepped into the open air the chief inquisitor tapped him gently on the shoulder and more in sorrow than in anger reminded him that it was customary for condemned men to remain inside their cells surely this was a similar case but then the thought came to him that mr seymour had only seen him once and so might possibly have failed to remember him for there was nothing special about babingtons features that arrested the eye and stamped them on the brain for all time he was rather ordinary than otherwise to look at at tea as bad luck would have it the two sat opposite one another and babington trembled then the worst happened mr seymour who had been looking attentively at him for some time leaned forward and said in a tone evidently devoid of suspicion havent we met before somewhere i seem to remember your face  erno no replied babington that is i think not we may have  i feel sure we have what school are you at  babingtons soul began to writhe convulsively  what what school oh what school why erim ateruppingham  mr seymours face assumed a pleased expression  uppingham really why i know several uppingham fellows do you know mr morton hes a master at uppingham and a great friend of mine  the room began to dance briskly before babingtons eyes but he clutched at a straw or what he thought was a straw  uppingham did i say uppingham of course i mean rugby you know rugby ones always mixing the two up you know isnt one  mr seymour looked at him in amazement then he looked at the others as if to ask which of the two was going mad he or the youth opposite him babingtons cousin listened to the wild fictions which issued from his lips in equal amazement he thought he must be ill even richards had a fleeting impression that it was a little odd that a fellow should forget what school he was at and mistake the name rugby for that of uppingham or vice versa babington became an object of interest  i say jack said the cousin youre feeling all right arent you i mean you dont seem to know what youre talking about if youre going to be ill say so and ill prescribe for you  is he at rugby asked mr seymour  no of course hes not how could he have got from rugby to london in time for a morning performance why hes at st austins  mr seymour sat for a moment in silence taking this in then he chuckled its all right he said hes not ill we have met before but under such painful circumstances that master babington very thoughtfully dissembled in order not to remind me of them  he gave a brief synopsis of what had occurred the audience exclusive of babington roared with laughter  i suppose said the cousin you wont prosecute will you its really such shocking luck you know that you ought to forget youre a master  mr seymour stirred his tea and added another lump of sugar very carefully before replying babington watched him in silence and wished that he would settle the matter quickly one way or the other  fortunately for babington said mr seymour and unfortunately for the cause of morality i am not a master i was only a stopgap and my term of office ceased today at one oclock thus the prisoner at the bar gets off on a technical point of law and i trust it will be a lesson to him i suppose you had the sense to do the imposition  yes sir i sat up last night  good now if youll take my advice youll reform or another day youll come to a bad end by the way how did you manage about rollcall today  i thought that was an awfully good part just at the end of the first act said babington  mr seymour smiled possibly from gratification  well how did it go off asked peterson that night  dont old chap said babington faintly  i told you so said jenkins at a venture  but when he had heard the whole story he withdrew the remark and commented on the wholly undeserved good luck some people seemed to enjoy     11  the tabby terror   the struggle between praters cat and praters cats conscience was short and ended in the hollowest of victories for the former the conscience really had no sort of chance from the beginning it was weak by nature and flabby from long want of exercise while the cat was in excellent training and was moreover backed up by a strong temptation it pocketed the stakes which consisted of most of the contents of a tin of sardines and left unostentatiously by the window when smith came in after football and found the remains he was surprised and even pained when montgomery entered soon afterwards he questioned him on the subject  i say have you been having a sort of preliminary canter with the banquet  no said montgomery why  somebody has said smith exhibiting the empty tin doesnt seem to have had such a bad appetite either  this reminds me of the story of the great bear the medium bear and the little ditto observed montgomery who was apt at an analogy you may remember that when the great bear found his porridge tampered with he  at this point shawyer entered he had been bidden to the feast and was feeling ready for it  hullo tea ready he asked  smith displayed the sardine tin in much the same manner as the conjurer shows a pack of cards when he entreats you to choose one and remember the number  you havent finished already surely why its only just five  we havent even begun said smith thats just the difficulty the question is who has been on the raid in here  no human being has done this horrid thing said montgomery he always liked to introduce a holmeswatsonian touch into the conversation in the first place the door was locked wasnt it smith  by jove so it was then how on earth  through the window of course the cat equally of course i should like a private word with that cat  i suppose it must have been  of course it was apart from the merely circumstantial evidence which is strong enough to hang it off its own bat we have absolute proof of its guilt just cast your eye over that butter you follow me watson  the butter was submitted to inspection in the very centre of it there was a footprint  i traced his little footprints in the butter said montgomery now is that the mark of a human foot  the jury brought in a unanimous verdict of guilty against the missing animal and over a sorrowful cup of tea eked out with bread and jambutter appeared to be unpopulardiscussed the matter in all its bearings the cat had not been an inmate of praters house for a very long time and up till now what depredation it had committed had been confined to the official larder now however it had evidently got its hand in and was about to commence operations upon a more extensive scale the tabby terror had begun where would it end the general opinion was that something would have to be done about it no one seemed to know exactly what to do montgomery spoke darkly of bricks bits of string and horseponds smith rolled the word ratpoison luxuriously round his tongue shawyer who was something of an expert on the range babbled of airguns  at tea on the following evening the first really serious engagement of the campaign took place the cat strolled into the tearoom in the patronizing way characteristic of his kind but was heavily shelled with lumpsugar and beat a rapid retreat that was the signal for the outbreak of serious hostilities from that moment its paw was against every man and the tale of the things it stole is too terrible to relate in detail it scored all along the line like death in the poem it knocked at the doors of the highest and the lowest alike or rather it did not exactly knock it came in without knocking the palace of the prefect and the hovel of the fag suffered equally trentham the head of the house lost sausages to an incredible amount one evening and the next day ripton of the lower third was robbed of his one ewe lamb in the shape of half a tin of anchovy paste panic reigned  it was after this matter of the sausages that a luminous idea occurred to trentham he had been laid up with a slight football accident and his family reading between the lines of his written statement that he had got crocked at footer nothing much only rather a nuisance might do him out of the housematches a notification of mortal injuries and seeming to hear a deathrattle through the words felt rather chippy yesterday had come down en masse to investigate en masse that is to say with the exception of his father who said he was too busy but felt sure it was nothing serious why when i was a boy my dear i used to think nothing of an occasional tumble theres nothing the matter with dick why etc etc  trenthams sister was his first visitor  i say said he when he had satisfied her on the subject of his health would you like to do me a good turn  she intimated that she would be delighted and asked for details  buy the beaks cat hissed trentham in a hoarse whisper  dick it was your leg that you hurt wasnt it notnot your head she replied i mean  no i really mean it why cant you its a perfectly simple thing to do  but what is a beak and why should i buy its cat  a beaks a master surely you know that you see praters got a cat lately and the beast strolls in and raids the studies got round over half a pound of prime sausages in here the other night and hes always bagging things everywhere youd be doing everyone a kindness if you would take him on hell get lynched some day if you dont besides you want a cat for your new house surely keep down the mice and that sort of thing you know this animals a demon for mice this was a telling argument trenthams sister had lately been married and she certainly had had some idea of investing in a cat to adorn her home as for beetles continued the invalid pushing home his advantage they simply darent come out of their lairs for fear of him  if he eats beetles objected his sister he cant have a very good coat  he doesnt eat them just squashes them you know like a policeman hes a decent enough beast as far as looks go  but if he steals things  no dont you see he only does that here because the praters dont interfere with him and dont let us do anything to him he wont try that sort of thing on with you if he does get somebody to hit him over the head with a bootjack or something hell soon drop it then you might as well you know the housell simply black your boots if you do  but would mr prater let me have the cat  try him anyhow pitch it fairly warm you know only cat you ever loved and that sort of thing  very well ill try  thanks awfully and i say you might just look in here on your way out and report  mrs james williamson nee miss trentham made her way dutifully to the merevales part of the house mrs prater had expressed a hope that she would have some tea before catching her train with tea it is usual to have milk and with milk it is usual if there is a cat in the house to have feline society captain kettle which was the name thought suitable to this cat by his godfathers and godmothers was on hand early as he stood there pawing the mat impatiently and mewing in a minor key mrs williamson felt that here was the cat for her he certainly was good to look upon his black heart was hidden by a sleek coat of tabby fur which rendered stroking a luxury his scheming brain was out of sight in a shapely head  oh what a lovely cat said mrs williamson  yes isnt he agreed mrs prater we are very proud of him  such a beautiful coat  and such a sweet purr  he looks so intelligent has he any tricks  had he any tricks why mrs williamson he could do everything except speak captain kettle you bad boy come here and die for your country puss puss  captain kettle came at last reluctantly died for his country in record time and flashed back again to the saucer he had an important appointment sorry to appear rude and all that sort of thing dont you know but he had to see a cat about a mouse  well said trentham when his sister looked in upon him an hour later  oh dick its the nicest cat i ever saw i shall never be happy if i dont get it  have you bought it asked the practical trentham  my dear dick i couldnt we couldnt bargain about a cat during tea why i never met mrs prater before this afternoon  no i suppose not admitted trentham gloomily anyhow look here if anything turns up to make the beak want to get rid of it ill tell him youre dead nuts on it see  for a fortnight after this episode matters went on as before mrs williamson departed thinking regretfully of the cat she had left behind her  captain kettle died for his country with moderate regularity and on one occasion when he attempted to extract some milk from the very centre of a fags teaparty almost died for another reason then the end came suddenly  trentham had been invited to supper one sunday by mr prater when he arrived it became apparent to him that the atmosphere was one of subdued gloom at first he could not understand this but soon the reason was made clear captain kettle had in the expressive language of the man in the street been and gone and done it he had been left alone that evening in the drawingroom while the house was at church and his eye roaming restlessly about in search of evil to perform had lighted upon a cage in that cage was a special sort of canary in its own line as accomplished an artiste as captain kettle himself it sang with taste and feeling and made itself generally agreeable in a number of little ways but to captain kettle it was merely a bird one of the poets sings of an acquaintance of his who was so constituted that a primrose by the rivers brim a simple primrose was to him and it was nothing more just so with captain kettle he was not the cat to make nice distinctions between birds like the cat in another poem he only knew they made him light and salutary meals so with the exercise of considerable ingenuity he extracted that canary from its cage and ate it he was now in disgrace  we shall have to get rid of him said mr prater  im afraid so said mrs prater  if you werent thinking of giving him to anyone in particular sir said trentham my sister would be awfully glad to take him i know she was very keen on him when she came to see me  thats excellent said prater i was afraid we should have to send him to a home somewhere  i suppose we cant keep him after all suggested mrs prater  trentham waited in suspense  no said prater decidedly i think not so captain kettle went and the house knew him no more and the tabby terror was at an end     12  the prize poem   some quarter of a century before the period with which this story deals a certain rich and misanthropic man was seized with a bright idea for perpetuating his memory after death and at the same time harassing a certain section of mankind so in his will he set aside a portion of his income to be spent on an annual prize for the best poem submitted by a member of the sixth form of st austins college on a subject to be selected by the headmaster and he addedone seems to hear him chuckling to himselfevery member of the form must compete then he died but the evil that men do lives after them and each year saw a fresh band of unwilling bards goaded to despair by his bequest true there were always one or two who hailed this ready market for their sonnets and odes with joy but the majority being barely able to rhyme dove with love regarded the annual announcement of the subject chosen with feelings of the deepest disgust  the chains were thrown off after a period of twentyseven years in this fashion  reynolds of the remove was indirectly the cause of the change he was in the infirmary convalescing after an attack of german measles when he received a visit from smith an ornament of the sixth  by jove remarked that gentleman gazing enviously round the sickroom they seem to do you pretty well here  yes not bad is it take a seat anything been happening lately  nothing much i suppose you know we beat the mcc by a wicket  yes so i heard anything else  prize poem said smith without enthusiasm he was not a poet  reynolds became interested at once if there was one role in which he fancied himself and indeed there were a good many it was that of a versifier his great ambition was to see some of his lines in print and he had contracted the habit of sending them up to various periodicals with no result so far except the arrival of rejected mss at mealtimes in embarrassingly long envelopes which he blushingly concealed with all possible speed  whats the subject this year he asked  the collegeof all idiotic things  couldnt have a better subject for an ode by jove i wish i was in the sixth  wish i was in the infirmary said smith  reynolds was struck with an idea  look here smith he said if you like ill do you a poem and you can send it up if it gets the prize  oh it wont get the prize smith put in eagerly rogers is a cert for that  if it gets the prize repeated reynolds with asperity youll have to tell the old man all about it hell probably curse a bit but that cant be helped hows this for a beginning      imposing pile reared up midst pleasant grounds     the scene of many a battle lost or won     at cricket or at football whose red walls     full many a sun has kissed ere day is done  grand couldnt you get in something about the mcc match you could make cricket rhyme with wicket smith sat entranced with his ingenuity but the other treated so material a suggestion with scorn  well said smith i must be off now weve got a housematch on thanks awfully about the poem  left to himself reynolds set himself seriously to the composing of an ode that should do him justice that is to say he drew up a chair and table to the open window wrote down the lines he had already composed and began chewing a pen after a few minutes he wrote another four lines crossed them out and selected a fresh piece of paper he then copied out his first four lines again after eating his pen to a stump he jotted down the two words boys and joys at the end of separate lines this led him to select a third piece of paper on which he produced a sort of edition de luxe in his best handwriting with the title ode to the college in printed letters at the top he was admiring the neat effect of this when the door opened suddenly and violently and mrs lee a lady of advanced years and energetic habits whose duty it was to minister to the needs of the sick and wounded in the infirmary entered with his tea mrs lees method of entering a room was in accordance with the advice of the psalmist where he says fling wide the gates she flung wide the gate of the sickroom and the result was that what is commonly called a thorough draught was established the air was thick with flying papers and when calm at length succeeded storm two editions of ode to the college were lying on the grass outside  reynolds attacked the tea without attempting to retrieve his vanished work poetry is good but tea is better besides he argued within himself he remembered all he had written and could easily write it out again so as far as he was concerned those three sheets of paper were a closed book  later on in the afternoon montgomery of the sixth happened to be passing by the infirmary when fate aided by a sudden gust of wind blew a piece of paper at him great scott he observed as his eye fell on the words ode to the college montgomery like smith was no expert in poetry he had spent a wretched afternoon trying to hammer out something that would pass muster in the poem competition but without the least success there were four lines on the paper two more and it would be a poem and capable of being entered for the prize as such the words imposing pile with which the fragment in his hand began took his fancy immensely a poetic afflatus seized him and in less than three hours he had added the necessary couplet      how truly sweet it is for such as me     to gaze on thee  and dashed neat too he said with satisfaction as he threw the manuscript into his drawer i dont know whether me shouldnt be i but theyll have to lump it its a poem anyhow within the meaning of the act and he strolled off to a neighbours study to borrow a book  two nights afterwards morrison also of the sixth was enjoying his usual during prep siesta in his study a tap at the door roused him hastily seizing a lexicon he assumed the attitude of the seeker after knowledge and said come in it was not the housemaster but evans morrisons fag who entered with pride on his face and a piece of paper in his hand  i say he began you remember you told me to hunt up some tags for the poem will this do  morrison took the paper with a judicial air on it were the words      imposing pile reared up midst pleasant grounds     the scene of many a battle lost or won     at cricket or at football whose red walls     full many a sun has kissed ere day is done  thats ripping as far as it goes said morrison couldnt be better youll find some apples in that box better take a few but look here with sudden suspicion i dont believe you made all this up yourself did you  evans finished selecting his apples before venturing on a reply then he blushed as much as a member of the junior school is capable of blushing  well he said i didnt exactly you see you only told me to get the tags you didnt say how  but how did you get hold of this whose is it  dunno i found it in the field between the pavilion and the infirmary  oh well it doesnt matter much theyre just what i wanted which is the great thing thanks shut the door will you whereupon evans retired the richer by many apples and morrison resumed his siesta at the point where he had left off  got that poem done yet said smith to reynolds pouring out a cup of tea for the invalid on the following sunday  two lumps please no not quite  great caesar man whenll it be ready do you think its got to go in tomorrow  well im really frightfully sorry but i got hold of a grand book ever read  isnt any of it done asked smith  only the first verse im afraid but look here you arent keen on getting the prize why not send in only the one verse it makes a fairly decent poem  hum think the old unll pass it  hell have to theres nothing in the rules about length here it is if you want it  thanks i suppose itll be all right so long i must be off  the headmaster known to the world as the rev arthur james perceval ma and to the school as the old un was sitting at breakfast stirring his coffee with a look of marked perplexity upon his dignified face this was not caused by the coffee which was excellent but by a letter which he held in his left hand  hum he said then umph in a protesting tone as if someone had pinched him finally he gave vent to a longdrawn ummm in a deep bass most extraordinary really most extraordinary exceedingly yes um very he took a sip of coffee  my dear said he suddenly mrs perceval started violently she had been sketching out in her mind a little dinner and wondering whether the cook would be equal to it  yes she said  my dear this is a very extraordinary communication exceedingly so yes very  who is it from  mr perceval shuddered he was a purist in speech from whom you should say it is from mr wells a great college friend of mine iahsubmitted to him for examination the poems sent in for the sixth form prize he writes in a very flippant style i must say very flippant this is his letterdear jimmy really really he should remember that we are not so young as we were dearahemjimmy the poems to hand i have read them and am writing this from my sickbed the doctor tells me i may pull through even yet there was only one any good at all that was rogerss which thoughersquiffy tut in parts was a long way better than any of the others but the most taking part of the whole programme was afforded by the three comedians whose efforts i enclose you will notice that each begins with exactly the same four lines of course i deprecate cribbing but you really cant help admiring this sort of thing there is a reckless daring about it which is simply fascinating a horrible thoughthave they been pulling your dignified leg by the way do you rememberthe rest of the letter iseron different matters  james how extraordinary  um yes i am reluctant to suspectercollusion but really here there can be no doubt no doubt at all no  unless began mrs perceval tentatively no doubt at all my dear snapped reverend jimmy he did not wish to recall the other possibility that his dignified leg was being pulled  now for what purpose did i summon you three boys asked mr perceval of smith montgomery and morrison in his room after morning school that day he generally began a painful interview with this question the method had distinct advantages if the criminal were of a nervous disposition he would give himself away upon the instant in any case it was likely to startle him for what purpose repeated the headmaster fixing smith with a glittering eye  i will tell you continued mr perceval it was because i desired information which none but you can supply how comes it that each of your compositions for the poetry prize commences with the same four lines the three poets looked at one another in speechless astonishment  here he resumed are the three papers compare them nowafter the inspection was over what explanation have you to offer smith are these your lines  ierahwrote them sir  dont prevaricate smith are you the author of those lines  no sir  ah very good are you montgomery  no sir  very good then you morrison are exonerated from all blame you have been exceedingly badly treated the firstfruit of your brain has beenahplucked by others who toiled not neither did they spin you can go morrison  but sir  well morrison  i didnt write them sir  iahdont quite understand you morrison you say that you are indebted to another for these lines  yes sir  to smith  no sir  to montgomery  no sir  then morrison may i ask to whom you are indebted  i found them in the field on a piece of paper sir he claimed the discovery himself because he thought that evans might possibly prefer to remain outside this tangle  so did i sir this from montgomery mr perceval looked bewildered as indeed he was  and did you smith also find this poem on a piece of paper in the field there was a metallic ring of sarcasm in his voice  no sir  ah then to what circumstance were you indebted for the lines  i got reynolds to do them for me sir  montgomery spoke it was near the infirmary that i found the paper and reynolds is in there  so did i sir said morrison incoherently  then am i to understand smith that to gain the prize you resorted to such underhand means as this  no sir we agreed that there was no danger of my getting the prize if i had got it i should have told you everything reynolds will tell you that sir  then what object had you in pursuing this deception  well sir the rules say everyone must send in something and i cant write poetry at all and reynolds likes it so i asked him to do it  and smith waited for the storm to burst but it did not burst far down in mr percevals system lurked a quiet sense of humour the situation penetrated to it then he remembered the examiners letter and it dawned upon him that there are few crueller things than to make a prosaic person write poetry  you may go he said and the three went  and at the next board meeting it was decided mainly owing to the influence of an exceedingly eloquent speech from the headmaster to alter the rules for the sixth form poetry prize so that from thence onward no one need compete unless he felt himself filled with the immortal fire     13  work       with a pleasure thats emphatic     we retire to our attic     with the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done      oh philosophers may sing     of the troubles of a king     but of pleasures there are many and of troubles there are none     and the culminating pleasure     which we treasure beyond measure     is the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done                                             w s gilbert  work is supposed to be the centre round which school life revolvesthe hub of the school wheel the lodestar of the schoolboys existence and a great many other things you come to school to work is the formula used by masters when sentencing a victim to the wailing and gnashing of teeth provided by two hours extra tuition on a hot afternoon in this i think they err and my opinion is backed up by numerous scholars of my acquaintance who have even gone so faron occasions when they themselves have been the victimsas to express positive disapproval of the existing state of things in the dear dead days beyond recall i used often to long to put the case to my formmaster in its only fair aspect but always refrained from motives of policy masters are so apt to take offence at the wellmeant endeavours of their form to instruct them in the way they should go  what i should have liked to have done would have been something after this fashion entering the sanctum of the headmaster i should have motioned him to his seatif he were seated already have assured him that to rise was unnecessary i should then have taken a seat myself taking care to preserve a calm fixity of demeanour and finally with a preliminary cough i should have embarked upon the following moving address my dear sir my dear reverend jones or brown as the case may be believe me when i say that your whole system of work is founded on a fallacious dream and reeks of rottenness no no i beg that you will not interrupt me the real state of the case if i may say so is briefly this a boy goes to school to enjoy himself and on arriving finds to his consternation that a great deal more work is expected of him than he is prepared to do what course then reverend jones or brown does he take he proceeds to do as much work as will steer him safely between the ahi may say the scylla of punishment and the charybdis of being considered what my erfellowpupils euphoniously term a swot that i think is all this morning good day pray do not trouble to rise i will find my way out i should then have made for the door locked it if possible on the outside and rushing to the railway station have taken a through ticket to spitzbergen or some other place where extradition treaties do not hold good  but twas not mine to play the tib gracchus to emulate the o cromwell so far from pouring my opinions like so much boiling oil into the ear of my taskmaster i was content to play the part of audience while he did the talking my sole remark being yesr at fixed intervals  and yet i knew that i was in the right my bosom throbbed with the justice of my cause for why the ambition of every human new boy is surely to become like j essop of the first eleven who can hit a ball over two ponds a wood and seven villages rather than to resemble that pale young student millstuart who though he can speak sanskrit like a native of sanskritia couldnt score a single off a slow longhop  and this ambition is a laudable one for the athlete is the product of naturea step towards the more perfect type of animal while the scholar is the outcome of artificiality what i ask does the scholar gain either morally or physically or in any other way by knowing who was tribune of the people in 284 bc or what is the precise difference between the various constructions of cum it is not as if ignorance of the tribunes identity caused him any mental unrest in short what excuse is there for the student none shrieks echo enthusiastically none whatever  our children are being led to ruin by this system they will become dons and think in greek the victim of the craze stops at nothing he puns in latin he quips and quirks in ionic and doric in the worst stages of the disease he will edit greek plays and say that merry quite misses the fun of the passage or that jebb is mediocre think i beg of you paterfamilias and you mater ditto what your feelings would be were you to find henry or archibald cuthbert correcting proofs of the agamemnon and inventing nasty ones for mr sidgwick very well then be warned  our brighteyed lads are taught insane constructions in greek and latin from morning till night and they come for their holidays in many cases without the merest foundation of a batting style ask them what a yorker is and they will say a man from york though i presume you mean a yorkshireman they will read herodotus without a dictionary for pleasure but ask them to translate the childishly simple sentence trott was soon in his timberyard with a length un that whipped across from the off and theyll shrink abashed and swear they have not skill at that as gilbert says  the papers sometimes contain humorous forecasts of future education when cricket and football shall come to their own they little know the excellence of the thing they mock at when we get schools that teach nothing but games then will the sun definitely refuse to set on the roast beef of old england may it be soon some day mayhap i shall gather my greatgreatgrandsons round my knee and tell themas one tells tales of faerythat i can remember the time when work was considered the beall and the endall of a school career perchance when my greatgreatgrandson john called john after the famous jones of that name has brought home the prize for english essay on rugby v association i shall pat his head gently and the tears will come to my old eyes as i recall the time when i too might have won a prizefor that obsolete subject latin proseand was only prevented by the superior excellence of my thirtyandone fellow students coupled indeed with my own inability to conjugate sum  such days i say may come but now are the dark ages the only thing that can possibly make work anything but an unmitigated nuisance is the prospect of a varsity scholarship and the thought that in the event of failure a varsity career will be out of the question  with this thought constantly before him the student can put a certain amount of enthusiasm into his work and even go to the length of rising at five oclock o mornings to drink yet deeper of the cup of knowledge i have done it myself varsity means games and yellow waistcoats and proctors and that sort of thing it is worth working for  but for the unfortunate individual who is barred by circumstances from participating in these joys what inducement is there to work is such a one to leave the school nets in order to stew in a stuffy room over a thucydides i trow not  chapter one of my great forthcoming work the compleat slacker contains minute instructions on the art of avoiding preparation from beginning to end of term foremost among the words of advice ranks this maxim get an official list of the books you are to do and examine them carefully with a view to seeing what it is possible to do unseen thus if virgil is among these authors you can rely on being able to do him with success people who ought to know better will tell you that virgil is hard such a shallow falsehood needs little comment a scholar who cannot translate ten lines of the aeneid between the time he is put on and the time he begins to speak is unworthy of pity or consideration and if i meet him in the street i shall assuredly cut him aeschylus on the other hand is a demon and needs careful watching though in an emergency you can always say the reading is wrong  sometimes the compleat slacker falls into a trap the saddest case i can remember is that of poor charles vanderpoop he was a bright young lad and showed some promise of rising to heights as a slacker he fell in this fashion one easter term his form had halffinished a speech of demosthenes and the formmaster gave them to understand that they would absorb the rest during the forthcoming term charles being naturally anxious to do as little work as possible during the summer months spent his easter holidays carefully preparing this speech so as to have it ready in advance what was his horror on returning to school at the appointed date to find that they were going to throw demosthenes over altogether and patronize plato threats entreaties prayersall were accounted nothing by the master who had led him into this morass of troubles it is believed that the shock destroyed his reason at any rate the fact remains that that term the summer term mark you he won two prizes in the following term he won three to recapitulate his outrages from that time to the present were a harrowing and unnecessary task suffice it that he is now a regius professor and i saw in the papers a short time ago that a lecture of his on the probable origin of the greek negative created quite a furore if this is not tragedy with a big t i should like to know what it is  as an exciting pastime unseen translation must rank very high everyone who has ever tried translating unseen must acknowledge that all other forms of excitement seem but feeble makeshifts after it i have in the course of a career of sustained usefulness to the human race had my share of thrills i have asked a strong and busy porter at paddington when the brighton train started i have gone for the broadjump record in trying to avoid a motorcar i have played spillikins and pingpong but never again have i felt the excitement that used to wander athwart my moral backbone when i was put on to translate a passage containing a notorious crux and seventeen doubtful readings with only that innate genius which is the wonder of the civilized world to pull me through and what a glow of pride one feels when it is all over when one has made a glorious golden guess at the crux and trampled the doubtful readings under foot with inspired ease it is like a day at the seaside  work is bad enough but examinations are worse especially the board examinations by doing from ten to twenty minutes prep every night the compleat slacker could get through most of the term with average success then came the examinations the dabbler in unseen translations found himself caught as in a snare gone was the peaceful security in which he had lulled to rest all the wellmeant efforts of his guardian angel to rouse him to a sense of his duties there right in front of him yawned the abyss of retribution  alas poor slacker i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy where be his gibes now how is he to cope with the fiendish ingenuity of the examiners how is he to master the contents of a book of thucydides in a couple of days it is a fearsome problem perhaps he will get up in the small hours and work by candle light from two till eight oclock in this case he will start his day a mental and physical wreck perhaps he will try to work and be led away by the love of light reading  in any case he will fail to obtain enough marks to satisfy the examiners though whether examiners ever are satisfied except by harry the hero of the school story every lads library uniform edition 2s 6d is rather a doubtful question  in such straits matters resolve themselves into a sort of drama with three characters we will call our hero smith  scene a study  dramatis personae

effusiveness that which exploits the     original work of others and professes to supply us with right     opinions thereanent is the least wanted                                       kenneth grahame  it has always seemed to me one of the worst flaws in our mistaken social system that absolutely no distinction is made between the master who forces the human boy to take down notes from dictation and the rest of mankind i mean that if in a moment of righteous indignation you rend such a one limb from limb you will almost certainly be subjected to the utmost rigour of the law and you will be lucky if you escape a heavy fine of five or ten shillings exclusive of the costs of the case now this is not right on the face of it it is even wrong the law should take into account the extreme provocation which led to the action punish if you will the man who travels secondclass with a thirdclass ticket or who borrows a pencil and forgets to return it but there are occasions when justice should be tempered with mercy and this murdering of pedagogues is undoubtedly such an occasion  it should be remembered however that there are two varieties of notes the printed notes at the end of your thucydides or homer are distinctly useful when they aim at acting up to their true vocation namely the translating of difficult passages or words sometimes however the author will insist on airing his scholarship and instead of translations he supplies parallel passages which neither interest elevate nor amuse the reader this of course is mere vanity the author sitting in his comfortable chair with something short within easy reach recks nothing of the misery he is inflicting on hundreds of people who have done him no harm at all he turns over the pages of his book of familiar quotations with brutal callousness and for every tricky passage in the work which he is editing finds and makes a note of three or four even trickier ones from other works who has not in his time been brought face to face with a word which defies translation there are two courses open to you on such an occasion to look the word up in the lexicon or in the notes you of course turn up the notes and find see line 80 you look up line 80 hoping to see a translation and there you are told that a rather similar construction occurs in xenophades lyrics from a padded cell on this the craven of spirit will resort to the lexicon but the man of mettle will close his book with an emphatic bang and refuse to have anything more to do with it of a different sort are the notes which simply translate the difficulty and subside these are a boon to the scholar without them it would be almost impossible to prepare ones work during school and we should be reduced to the prosaic expedient of working in prep time what we want is the commentator who translates mensa as a table without giving a page and a half of notes on the uses of the table in ancient greece with an excursus on the habit common in those times of retiring underneath it after dinner and a list of the passages in apollonius rhodius where the word table is mentioned  these voluminous notes are apt to prove a nuisance in more ways than one your average master is generally inordinately fond of them and will frequently ask some member of the form to read his note on soandso out to his fellows this sometimes leads to curious results as it is hardly to be expected that the youth called upon will be attending even if he is awake which is unlikely on one occasion an acquaintance of mine whose name i am not at liberty to divulge was suddenly aware that he was being addressed and on giving the matter his attention found that it was the formmaster asking him to read out his note on balbus murum aedificavit my friend is a kindhearted youth and of an obliging disposition and would willingly have done what was asked of him but there were obstacles first and foremost of which ranked the fact that taking advantage of his position on the back desk whither he thought the basilisk eye of authority could not reach he had substituted bab ballads for the words of virgil and was engrossed in the contents of that modern classic the subsequent explanations lasted several hours in fact it is probable that the master does not understand the facts of the case thoroughly even now it is true that he called him a loathsome slimy repulsive toad but even this seems to fall short of the grandeur of the situation  those notes also which are alas only too common nowadays that deal with peculiarities of grammar how supremely repulsive they are it is impossible to glean any sense from them as the editor mixes up nipperwicks view with sidgeleys reasoning and spreckendzedeutscheims surmise with donnerundblitzendorfs conjecture in a way that seems to argue a thorough unsoundness of mind and morals a cynical insanity combined with a blatant indecency he occasionally starts in a reasonable manner by giving one view as 1 and the next as 2 so far everyone is happy and satisfied the trouble commences when he has occasion to refer back to some former view when he will say thus we see 1 and 14 that etc the unlucky student puts a finger on the page to keep the place and hunts up view one having found this and marked the spot with another finger he proceeds to look up view fourteen he places another finger on this and reads on as follows zmpe however maintains that schrumpff see 3 is practically insane that spleckzh see 34 is only a little better and that rswkg see 97 a b c3 is so far from being right that his views may be dismissed as readily as those of xkryt see 5x at this point brainfever sets in the victims last coherent thought being a passionate wish for more fingers a friend of mine who was the wonder of all who knew him in that he was known to have scored ten per cent in one of these papers on questions like the above once divulged to an interviewer the fact that he owed his success to his methods of learning rather than to his ability on the night before an exam he would retire to some secret solitary place such as the bootroom and commence learning these notes by heart this though a formidable task was not so bad as the other alternative the result was that although in the majority of cases he would put down for one question an answer that would have been right for another yet occasionally luck being with him he would hit the mark hence his ten per cent  another fruitful source of discomfort is provided by the type of master who lectures on a subject for half an hour and then with a bland smile invites or rather challenges his form to write a good long note on the quintessence of his discourse for the inexperienced this is an awful moment they must write somethingbut what for the last half hour they have been trying to impress the master with the fact that they belong to the class of people who can always listen best with their eyes closed nor poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world can ever medicine them to that sweet sleep that they have just been enjoying and now they must write a good long note it is in such extremities that your veteran shows up well he does not betray any discomfort not he he rather enjoys the prospect in fact of being permitted to place the masters golden eloquence on paper so he takes up his pen with alacrity no need to think what to write he embarks on an essay concerning the master showing up all his flaws in a pitiless light and analysing his thorough worthlessness of character on so congenial a subject he can of course write reams and as the master seldom if ever desires to read the good long note he acquires a wellearned reputation for attending in school and being able to express himself readily with his pen vivat floreatque  but all these forms of notes are as nothing compared with the notes that youths even in this our boasted land of freedom are forced to take down from dictation of the good long note your french scholar might well remark cest terrible but justice would compel him to add as he thought of the dictation note mais ce nest pas le diable for these notes from dictation are especially on a warm day indubitably le diable  such notes are always dictated so rapidly that it is impossible to do anything towards understanding them as you go you have to write your hardest to keep up the beauty of this from one point of view is that if you miss a sentence you have lost the thread of the whole thing and it is useless to attempt to take it up again at once the only plan is to wait for some perceptible break in the flow of words and dash in like lightning it is much the same sort of thing as boarding a bus when in motion and so you can take a long rest provided you are in an obscure part of the room in passing i might add that a very pleasing indoor game can be played by asking the master what came after soandso mentioning a point of the oration some halfhour back this always provides a respite of a few minutes while he is thinking of some bitter repartee worthy of the occasion and if repeated several times during an afternoon may cause much innocent merriment  of course the real venom that lurks hid within notes from dictation does not appear until the time for examination arrives then you find yourself face to face with sixty or seventy closely and badly written pages of a notebook all of which must be learnt by heart if you would aspire to the dizzy heights of halfmarks it is useless to tell your examiner that you had no chance of getting up the subject why he will reply i gave you notes on that very thing myself you did sir you say as you advance stealthily upon him but as you dictated those notes at the rate of two hundred words a minute and as my brain though large is not capable of absorbing sixty pages of a notebook in one night how the suggestively asterisked aposiopesis do you expect me to know them ahhh the last word is a warcry as you fling yourself bodily on him and tear him courteously but firmly into minute fragments experience which as we all know teaches will in time lead you into adopting some method by which you may evade this taking of notes a good plan is to occupy yourself with the composition of a journal an unofficial magazine not intended for the eyes of the profane but confined rigidly to your own circle of acquaintances the chief advantage of such a work is that you will continue to write while the notes are being dictated to throw your pen down with an air of finality and begin reading some congenial work of fiction would be a gallant action but impolitic no writing of some sort is essential and as it is out of the question to take down the notes what better substitute than an unofficial journal could be found to one whose contributions to the school magazine are constantly being cut down to mere skeletons by the hands of censors there is a rapture otherwise unattainable in a page of really scurrilous items about those in authority try it yourselves my beamish lads think of something really bad about somebody write it down and gloat over it sometimes indeed it is of the utmost use in determining your future career you will probably remember those titanic articles that appeared at the beginning of the war in the weekly luggagetrain dealing with all the crimes of the war officethe generals the soldiers the enemyof everybody in fact except the editor staff and officeboy of the wlt well the writer of those epochmaking articles confesses that he owes all his skill to his early training when a happy lad at his little desk in school he used to write trenchantly in his notebook on the subject of the authorities there is an example for you of course we can never be like him but let oh let us be as like him as were able to be a final word to those lost ones who dictate the notes why are our ears so constantly assailed with unnecessary explanations of and opinions on english literature prey upon the classics if you will it is a revolting habit but too common to excite overmuch horror but surely anybody presupposing a certain bias towards sanity can understand the classics of our own language with the exception of course of browning take tennyson for example how often have we been forced to take down from dictation the miserable maunderings of some commentator on the subject of maud a person reads maud and either likes it or dislikes it in any case his opinion is not likely to be influenced by writing down at express speed the opinions of somebody else concerning the methods or objectivity and subjectivity of the author when he produced the work  somebody told me a short time ago that shelley was an example of supreme divine superhuman genius it is the sort of thing mr gilberts rapturous maidens might have said how botticellian how fra angelican how perceptively intense and consummately utter there is really no material difference     15  now talking about cricket   in the days of yore when these white hairs were brownor was it black at any rate they were not whiteand i was at school it was always my custom when fate obliged me to walk to school with a casual acquaintance to whom i could not unburden my soul of those profound thoughts which even then occupied my mind to turn the struggling conversation to the relative merits of cricket and football  do you like cricket better than footer was my formula now though at the time in order to save fruitless argument i always agreed with my companion and praised the game he praised in the innermost depths of my subconsciousness cricket ranked a long way in front of all other forms of sport i may be wrong more than once in my career it has been represented to me that i couldnt play cricket for nuts my captain said as much when i ran him out in the match of the season after he had made fortynine and looked like stopping a bowling acquaintance heartily endorsed his opinion on the occasion of my missing three catches off him in one over this however i attribute to prejudice for the man i missed ultimately reached his century mainly off the deliveries of my bowling acquaintance i pointed out to him that had i accepted any one of the three chances we should have missed seeing the prettiest century made on the ground that season but he was one of those bowlers who sacrifice all that is beautiful in the game to mere wickets a sordid practice  later on the persistence with which my county ignored my claims to inclusion in the team convinced me that i must leave cricket fame to others true i did figure rather prominently too in one county match it was at the oval surrey v middlesex how well i remember that occasion albert trott was bowling bertie we used to call him i forget who was batting suddenly the ball came soaring in my direction i was not nervous i put down the sandwich i was eating rose from my seat picked the ball up neatly and returned it with unerring aim to a fieldsman who was waiting for it with becoming deference thunders of applause went up from the crowded ring  that was the highest point i ever reached in practical cricket but as the historian says of mr winkle a man may be an excellent sportsman in theory even if he fail in practice thats me reader if any have you ever played cricket in the passage outside your study with a walkingstick and a ball of paper thats the game my boy for testing your skill of wrist and eye a century v the mcc is well enough in its way but give me the man who can watch em in a narrow passage lit only by a flickering gasjetone for every hit four if it reaches the end and six if it goes downstairs fullpitch any pace bowling allowed to make double figures in such a match is to taste life only you had better do your tasting when the housemaster is out for the evening  i like to watch the young cricket idea shooting i refer to the lower games where next man in umpires with his pads on his loins girt and a bat in his hand many people have wondered why it is that no budding umpire can officiate unless he holds a bat for my part i think there is little foundation for the theory that it is part of a semireligious rite on the analogy of the freemasons special handshake and the like nor do i altogether agree with the authorities who allege that man when standing up needs something as a prop or support there is a shadow of reason i grant in this supposition but after years of keen observation i am inclined to think that the umpire keeps his bat by him firstly in order that no unlicensed hand shall commandeer it unbeknownst and secondly so that he shall be ready to go in directly his predecessor is out there is an illconcealed restiveness about his movements as he watches the batsmen getting set that betrays an overwrought spirit then of a sudden one of them plays a ball on to his pad s that asks the bowler with an overdone carelessness clean out now im in and already he is rushing up the middle of the pitch to take possession when he gets to the wicket a short argument ensues look here you idiot i hit it hard rot man out of the way  look here smith are you going to dispute the umpires decision chorus of fieldsmen get out smith you ass youve been given out years ago overwhelmed by popular execration smith reluctantly departs registering in the black depths of his soul a resolution to take on the umpireship at once with a view to gaining an artistic revenge by giving his enemy run out on the earliest possible occasion there is a primeval insouciance about this sort of thing which is as refreshing to a mind jaded with the stiff formality of professional umpires as a cold showerbath  i have made a special study of lastwicket men they are divided into two classes the deplorably nervous or the outrageously confident the nervous largely outnumber the confident the launching of a lastwicket man when there are ten to make to win or five minutes left to make a draw of a losing game is fully as impressive a ceremony as the launching of the latest battleship an interested crowd harasses the poor victim as he is putting on his pads feel in a funk asks some tactless friend nnno norrabit thats right says the captain encouragingly bowlings as easy as anything  this cheers the wretch up a little until he remembers suddenly that the captain himself was distinctly at sea with the despised trundling and succumbed to his second ball about which he obviously had no idea whatever at this he breaks down utterly and if emotional will sob into his batting glove he is assisted down the pavilion steps and reaches the wickets in a state of collapse here very probably a reaction will set in the sight of the crease often comes as a positive relief after the vague terrors experienced in the pavilion  the confident lastwicket man on the other hand goes forth to battle with a light quip upon his lips the lot of a lastwicket batsman with a good eye and a sense of humour is a very enviable one the incredulous disgust of the fast bowler who thinks that at last he may safely try that slow headball of his and finds it lifted genially over the legboundary is well worth seeing i remember in one school match the last man unfortunately on the opposite side did this three times in one over ultimately retiring to a fluky catch in the slips with fortyone to his name nervousness at cricket is a curious thing as the author of willow the king himself a county cricketer has said it is not the fear of getting out that causes funk it is a sort of intangible je ne sais quoi i trust i make myself clear some batsmen are nervous all through a long innings with others the feeling disappears with the first boundary  a young ladyit is of course not polite to mention her age to the minute but it ranged somewhere between eight and tenwas taken to see a cricket match once after watching the game with interest for some time she gave out this profound truth they all attend specially to one man it would be difficult to sum up the causes of funk more lucidly and concisely to be an object of interest is sometimes pleasant but when ten fieldsmen a bowler two umpires and countless spectators are eagerly watching your every movement the thing becomes embarrassing  that is why it is on the whole preferable to be a cricket spectator rather than a cricket player no game affords the spectator such unique opportunities of exerting his critical talents you may have noticed that it is always the reporter who knows most about the game everyone moreover is at heart a critic whether he represent the majesty of the press or not from the lady of hoxton who crushes her friends latest confection with the words my wot an at down to that lowest class of all the persons who call your attention in print to the sinister meaning of everything clytemnestra says in the agamemnon the whole world enjoys expressing an opinion of its own about something  in football you are vouchsafed fewer chances practically all you can do is to shout offside whenever an opponent scores which affords but meagre employment for a really critical mind in cricket however nothing can escape you everything must be done in full sight of everybody there the players stand without refuge simply inviting criticism  it is best however not to make ones remarks too loud if you do you call down upon yourself the attention of others and are yourself criticized i remember once when i was of tender years watching a school match and one of the batsmen lifted a ball clean over the pavilion this was too much for my sensitive and critical young mind on the carpet sir i shouted sternly well up in the treble clef keep em on the carpet i will draw a veil suffice it to say that i became a sport and derision and was careful for the future to criticize in a whisper but the reverse by no means crushed me even now i take a melancholy pleasure in watching school matches and saying soandso will make quite a fair schoolboy bat in time but he must get rid of that stroke of his on the off and that shocking leghit and a few of those awful strokes in the slips but that on the whole he is by no means lacking in promise i find it refreshing if however you feel compelled not merely to look on but to play as one often does at schools where cricket is compulsory it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of white boots the game you play before you get white boots is not cricket but a weak imitation the process of initiation is generally this one plays in shoes for a few years with the most dire result running away to square leg from fast balls and so on till despair seizes the soul then an angel in human form in the very effective disguise of the man at the school bootshop hints that for an absurdly small sum in cash you may become the sole managing director of a pair of white buckskin boots with real spikes you try them on they fit and the initiation is complete you no longer run away from fast balls you turn them neatly off to the boundary in a word you begin for the first time to play the game the whole game and nothing but the game  there are misguided people who complain that cricket is becoming a business more than a game as if that were not the most fortunate thing that could happen when it ceases to be a mere business and becomes a religious ceremony it will be a sign that the millennium is at hand the person who regards cricket as anything less than a business is no fit companion gentle reader for the likes of you and me as long as the game goes in his favour the cloven hoof may not show itself but give him a good steady spell of leatherhunting and you will know him for what he is a mere dilettante a dabbler in a word a worm who ought never to be allowed to play at all the worst of this species will sometimes take advantage of the fact that the game in which they happen to be playing is only a scratch game upon the result of which no very great issues hang to pollute the air they breathe with verbal and the ground they stand on with physical buffooneries many a time have i and many a time have you if you are what i take you for shed tears of blood at the sight of such careless returns overthrowsbut enough of a painful subject let us pass on  i have always thought it a better fate for a man to be born a bowler than a bat a batsman certainly gets a considerable amount of innocent fun by snicking good fast balls just off his wicket to the ropes and standing stolidly in front against slow legbreaks these things are good and help one to sleep peacefully o nights and enjoy ones meals but no batsman can experience that supreme emotion of something attempted something done which comes to a bowler when a ball pitches in a hole near points feet and whips into the leg stump it is one crowded second of glorious life again the words retired hurt on the scoresheet are far more pleasant to the bowler than the batsman the groan of a batsman when a loose ball hits him full pitch in the ribs is genuine but the awfullysorryoldchapitslipped of the bowler is not half a loaf is better than no bread as mr chamberlain might say and if he cannot hit the wicket he is perfectly contented with hitting the man in my opinion therefore the bowlers lot in spite of billiard table wickets red marl and such like inventions of a degenerate age is the happier one  and here glowing with pride of originality at the thought that i have written of cricket without mentioning alfred mynn or fuller pilch i heave a reminiscent sigh blot my ms and thrust my pen back into its sheath     16  the tom brown question   the man in the corner had been trying to worry me into a conversation for some time he had asked me if i objected to having the window open he had said something rather bitter about the war office and had hoped i did not object to smoking then finding that i stuck to my book through everything he made a fresh attack  i see you are reading tom browns schooldays he said  this was a plain and uninteresting statement of fact and appeared to me to require no answer i read on  fine book sir  very  i suppose you have heard of the tom brown question  i shut my book wearily and said i had not  it is similar to the homeric question you have heard of that i suppose  i knew that there was a discussion about the identity of the author of the iliad when at school i had been made to take down notes on the subject until i had grown to loathe the very name of homer  you see went on my companion the difficulty about tom browns schooldays is this it is obvious that part one and part two were written by different people you admit that i suppose  i always thought mr hughes wrote the whole book  dear me not really why i thought everyone knew that he only wrote the first half the question is who wrote the second i know but i dont suppose ten other people do no sir  what makes you think he didnt write the second part  my dear sir just read it read part one carefully and then read part two why you can see in a minute  i said i had read the book three times but had never noticed anything peculiar about it except that the second half was not nearly so interesting as the first  well just tell me this do you think the same man created east and arthur now then  i admitted that it was difficult to understand such a thing  there was a time of course continued my friend when everybody thought as you do the book was published under hughess name and it was not until professor burkettsmith wrote his celebrated monograph on the subject that anybody suspected a dual or rather a composite authorship burkettsmith if you remember based his arguments on two very significant points the first of these was a comparison between the football match in the first part and the cricket match in the second after commenting upon the truth of the former description he went on to criticize the latter do you remember that match you do very well you recall how tom wins the toss on a plumb wicket  yes  then with the usual liberality of young hands i quote from the book he put the mcc in first now my dear sir i ask you would a school captain do that i am young says one of gilberts characters the grand duke i think but he adds i am not so young as that tom may have been young but would he could he have been young enough to put his opponents in on a true wicket when he had won the toss would the tom brown of part one have done such a thing  never i shouted with enthusiasm  but thats nothing to what he does afterwards he permits he actually sits there and permits comic songs and speeches to be made during the luncheon interval comic songs do you hear me sir comic songs and this when he wanted every minute of time he could get to save the match would the tom brown of part one have done such a thing  never never i positively shrieked the words this time  burkettsmith put that point very well his second argument is founded on a single remark of toms or rather  or rather i interrupted fiercely or rather of the wretched miserable  contemptible said my friend  despicable scoundrelly impostor who masquerades as tom in the second half of the book  exactly said he thank you very much i have often thought the same myself the remark to which i refer is that which he makes to the master while he is looking on at the mcc match in passing sir might i ask you whether the tom brown of part one would have been on speaking terms with such a master  i shook my head violently i was too exhausted to speak  you remember the remark the master commented on the fact that arthur is a member of the first eleven i forget toms exact words but the substance of them is this that though on his merits arthur was not worth his place he thought it would do him such a lot of good being in the team do i make myself plain sir hethoughtitwoulddo himsuchalotofgoodbeingintheteam  there was a pause we sat looking at one another forming silently with our lips the words that still echoed through the carriage  burkettsmith continued my companion makes a great deal of that remark his peroration is a very fine piece of composition whether concludes he the captain of a school cricket team who could own spontaneously to having been guilty of so horrible so terrible an act of favouritismical jobbery who could sit unmoved and see his team being beaten in the most important match of the season and indeed for all that the author tells us it may have been the only match of the season for no other reason than that he thought a first eleven cap would prove a valuable tonic to an unspeakable personal friend of his whether i say the tom brown who acted thus could have been the tom brown who headed the revolt of the fags in part one is a question which to the present writer offers no difficulties i await with confidence the verdict of a free enlightened and conscientious public of my fellowcountrymen fine piece of writing that sir  very i said  that pamphlet of course caused a considerable stir opposing parties began to be formed some maintaining that burkettsmith was entirely right others that he was entirely wrong while the rest said he might have been more wrong if he had not been so right but that if he had not been so mistaken he would probably have been a great deal more correct the great argument put forward by the supporters of what i may call the one author view was that the fight in part two could not have been written by anyone except the author of the fight with flashman in the schoolhouse hall and this is the point which has led to all the discussion eliminate the slogger williams episode and the whole of the second part stands out clearly as the work of another hand but there is one thing that seems to have escaped the notice of everybody  yes i said  he leant forward impressively and whispered only the actual fight is the work of the genuine author the interference of arthur has been interpolated  by jove i said not really  yes fact i assure you why think for a minute could a man capable of describing a fight as that fight is described also be capable of stopping it just as the man the reader has backed all through is winning it would be brutal positively brutal sir  then how do you explain it  a year ago i could not have told you now i can for five years i have been unravelling the mystery by the aid of that one clue listen when mr hughes had finished part one he threw down his pen and started to wales for a holiday he had been there a week or more when one day as he was reclining on the peak of a mountain looking down a deep precipice he was aware of a body of men approaching him they were dressed soberly in garments of an inky black each had side whiskers and each wore spectacles mr hughes i believe said the leader as they came up to him  your servant sir said he  we have come to speak to you on an important matter mr hughes we are the committee of the secret society for putting wholesome literature within the reach of every boy and seeing that he gets it i sir am the president of the ssfpwlwtroebasthgi he bowed  really sir ierdont think i have the pleasure began mr hughes  you shall have the pleasure sir we have come to speak to you about your book our representative has read part i and reports unfavourably upon it it contains no moral there are scenes of violence and your hero is far from perfect  i think you mistake my object said mr hughes tom is a boy not a patent medicine in other words he is not supposed to be perfect  well i am not here to bandy words the second part of your book must be written to suit the rules of our society do you agree or shall we throw you over that precipice  never i mean i dont agree  then we must write it for you remember sir that you will be constantly watched and if you attempt to write that second part yourself he paused dramatically so the second part was written by the committee of the society so now you know  but said i how do you account for the fight with slogger williams  the president relented slightly towards the end and consented to mr hughes inserting a chapter of his own on condition that the society should finish it and the society did see  but  ticket  eh  ticket please sir  i looked up the guard was standing at the open door my companion had vanished  guard said i as i handed him my ticket wheres the gentleman who travelled up with me  gentleman sir i havent seen nobody  not a man in tweeds with red hair i mean in tweeds and owning red hair  no sir youve been alone in the carriage all the way up must have dreamed it sir  possibly i did
