  chapter i  a mysterious dog  the elmtree avenue was all overgrown the great gate was never unlocked and the old house had been shut up for several years  yet voices were heard about the place the lilacs nodded over the high wall as if they said we could tell fine secrets if we chose and the mullein outside the gate made haste to reach the keyhole that it might peep in and see what was going on if it had suddenly grown up like a magic beanstalk and looked in on a certain june day it would have seen a droll but pleasant sight for somebody evidently was going to have a party  from the gate to the porch went a wide walk paved with smooth slabs of dark stone and bordered with the tall bushes which met overhead making a green roof all sorts of neglected flowers and wild weeds grew between their stems covering the walls of this summer parlor with the prettiest tapestry a board propped on two blocks of wood stood in the middle of the walk covered with a little plaid shawl much the worse for wear and on it a miniature teaservice was set forth with great elegance to be sure the teapot had lost its spout the creamjug its handle the sugarbowl its cover and the cups and plates were all more or less cracked or nicked but polite persons would not take notice of these trifling deficiencies and none but polite persons were invited to this party  on either side of the porch was a seat and here a somewhat remarkable sight would have been revealed to any inquisitive eye peering through the aforesaid keyhole upon the lefthand seat lay seven dolls upon the righthand seat lay six and so varied were the expressions of their countenances owing to fractures dirt age and other afflictions that one would very naturally have thought this a dolls hospital and these the patients waiting for their tea  this however would have been a sad mistake for if the wind had lifted the coverings laid over them it would have disclosed the fact that all were in full dress and merely reposing before the feast should begin  there was another interesting feature of the scene which would have puzzled any but those well acquainted with the manners and customs of dolls a fourteenth rag baby with a china head hung by her neck from the rusty knocker in the middle of the door a sprig of white and one of purple lilac nodded over her a dress of yellow calico richly trimmed with redflannel scallops shrouded her slender form a garland of small flowers crowned her glossy curls and a pair of blue boots touched toes in the friendliest if not the most graceful manner an emotion of grief as well as of surprise might well have thrilled any youthful breast at such a spectacle for why oh why was this resplendent dolly hung up there to be stared at by thirteen of her kindred was she a criminal the sight of whose execution threw them flat upon their backs in speechless horror or was she an idol to be adored in that humble posture neither my friends she was blonde belinda set or rather hung aloft in the place of honor for this was her seventh birthday and a superb ball was about to celebrate the great event all were evidently awaiting a summons to the festive board but such was the perfect breeding of these dolls that not a single eye out of the whole twentyseven dutch hans had lost one of the black beads from his worsted countenance turned for a moment toward the table or so much as winked as they lay in decorous rows gazing with mute admiration at belinda she unable to repress the joy and pride which swelled her sawdust bosom till the seams gaped gave an occasional bounce as the wind waved her yellow skirts or made the blue boots dance a sort of jig upon the door hanging was evidently not a painful operation for she smiled contentedly and looked as if the red ribbon around her neck was not uncomfortably tight therefore if slow suffocation suited her who else had any right to complain so a pleasing silence reigned not even broken by a snore from dinah the top of whose turban alone was visible above the coverlet or a cry from baby jane though her bare feet stuck out in a way that would have produced shrieks from a less welltrained infant  presently voices were heard approaching and through the arch which led to a sidepath came two little girls one carrying a small pitcher the other proudly bearing a basket covered with a napkin they looked like twins but were not for bab was a year older than betty though only an inch taller both had on brown calico frocks much the worse for a weeks wear but clean pink pinafores in honor of the occasion made up for that as well as the gray stockings and thick boots both had round rosy faces rather sunburnt pug noses somewhat freckled merry blue eyes and braided tails of hair hanging down their backs like those of the dear little kenwigses  dont they look sweet cried bab gazing with maternal pride upon the lefthand row of dolls who might appropriately have sung in chorus we are seven  very nice but my belinda beats them all i do think she is the splendidest child that ever was and betty set down the basket to run and embrace the suspended darling just then kicking up her heels with joyful abandon  the cake can be cooling while we fix the children it does smell perfectly delicious said bab lifting the napkin to hang over the basket fondly regarding the little round loaf that lay inside  leave some smell for me commanded betty running back to get her fair share of the spicy fragrance the pug noses sniffed it up luxuriously and the bright eyes feasted upon the loveliness of the cake so brown and shiny with a tipsylooking b in piecrust staggering down one side instead of sitting properly atop  ma let me put it on the very last minute and it baked so hard i couldnt pick it off we can give belinda that piece so its just as well observed betty taking the lead as her child was queen of the revel  lets set them round so they can see too proposed bab going with a hop skip and jump to collect her young family  betty agreed and for several minutes both were absorbed in seating their dolls about the table for some of the dear things were so limp they wouldnt sit up and others so stiff they wouldnt sit down and all sorts of seats had to be contrived to suit the peculiarities of their spines this arduous task accomplished the fond mammas stepped back to enjoy the spectacle which i assure you was an impressive one belinda sat with great dignity at the head her hands genteelly holding a pink cambric pockethandkerchief in her lap josephus her cousin took the foot elegantly arrayed in a new suit of purple and green gingham with his speaking countenance much obscured by a straw hat several sizes too large for him while on either side sat guests of every size complexion and costume producing a very gay and varied effect as all were dressed with a noble disregard of fashion  they will like to see us get tea  did you forget the buns inquired betty anxiously  no got them in my pocket and bab produced from that chaotic cupboard two rather stale and crumbly ones saved from lunch for the fete these were cut up and arranged in plates forming a graceful circle around the cake still in its basket  ma couldnt spare much milk so we must mix water with it strong tea isnt good for children she says and bab contentedly surveyed the gill of skimmilk which was to satisfy the thirst of the company  while the tea draws and the cake cools lets sit down and rest im so tired sighed betty dropping down on the doorstep and stretching out the stout little legs which had been on the go all day for saturday had its tasks as well as its fun and much business had preceded this unusual pleasure bab went and sat beside her looking idly down the walk toward the gate where a fine cobweb shone in the afternoon sun  ma says she is going over the house in a day or two now it is warm and dry after the storm and we may go with her you know she wouldnt take us in the fall cause we had whoopingcough and it was damp there now we shall see all the nice things wont it be fun observed bab after a pause  yes indeed ma says theres lots of books in one room and i can look at em while she goes round may be ill have time to read some and then i can tell you answered betty who dearly loved stories and seldom got any new ones  id rather see the old spinningwheel up garret and the big pictures and the queer clothes in the blue chest it makes me mad to have them all shut up there when we might have such fun with them id just like to bang that old door down and bab twisted round to give it a thump with her boots you neednt laugh you know youd like it as much as me she added twisting back again rather ashamed of her impatience  i didnt laugh  you did  dont you suppose i know what laughing is  i guess i know i didnt  you did laugh  how darst you tell such a fib  if you say that again ill take belinda and go right home then what will you do  ill eat up the cake  no you wont  its mine ma said so and you are only company so youd better behave or i wont have any party at all so now  this awful threat calmed babs anger at once and she hastened to introduce a safer subject  never mind dont lets fight before the children do you know ma says she will let us play in the coachhouse next time it rains and keep the key if we want to  oh goody thats because we told her how we found the little window under the woodbine and didnt try to go in though we might have just as easy as not cried betty appeased at once for after a ten years acquaintance she had grown used to babs peppery temper  i suppose the coach will be all dust and rats and spiders but i dont care you and the dolls can be the passengers and i shall sit up in front drive  you always do  i shall like riding better than being horse all the time with that old wooden bit in my mouth and you jerking my arms off said poor betty who was tired of being horse continually  i guess wed better go and get the water now suggested bab feeling that it was not safe to encourage her sister in such complaints  it is not many people who would dare to leave their children all alone with such a lovely cake and know they wouldnt pick at it said betty proudly as they trotted away to the spring each with a little tin pail in her hand  alas for the faith of these too confiding mammas they were gone about five minutes and when they returned a sight met their astonished eyes which produced a simultaneous shriek of horror flat upon their faces lay the fourteen dolls and the cake the cherished cake was gone  for an instant the little girls could only stand motionless gazing at the dreadful scene then bab cast her waterpail wildly away and doubling up her fist cried out fiercely  it was that sally  she said shed pay me for slapping her when she pinched little mary ann and now she has ill give it to her you run that way ill run this quick quick  away they went bab racing straight on and bewildered betty turning obediently round to trot in the opposite direction as fast as she could with the water splashing all over her as she ran for she had forgotten to put down her pail round the house they went and met with a crash at the back door but no sign of the thief appeared  in the lane shouted bab  down by the spring panted betty and off they went again one to scramble up a pile of stones and look over the wall into the avenue the other to scamper to the spot they had just left still nothing appeared but the dandelions innocent faces looking up at bab and a brown bird scared from his bath in the spring by bettys hasty approach  back they rushed but only to meet a new scare which made them both cry ow and fly into the porch for refuge  a strange dog was sitting calmly among the ruins of the feast licking his lips after basely eating up the last poor bits of bun when he had bolted the cake basket and all apparently  oh the horrid thing cried bab longing to give battle but afraid for the dog was a peculiar as well as a dishonest animal  he looks like our china poodle doesnt he whispered betty making herself as small as possible behind her more valiant sister  he certainly did for though much larger and dirtier than the wellwashed china dog this live one had the same tassel at the end of his tail ruffles of hair round his ankles and a body shaven behind and curly before his eyes however were yellow instead of glassy black like the others his red nose worked as he cocked it up as if smelling for more cakes in the most impudent manner and never during the three years he had stood on the parlor mantelpiece had the china poodle done the surprising feats with which this mysterious dog now proceeded to astonish the little girls almost out of their wits first he sat up put his forepaws together and begged prettily then he suddenly flung his hindlegs into the air and walked about with great ease hardly had they recovered from this shock when the hindlegs came down the forelegs went up and he paraded in a soldierly manner to and fro like a sentinel on guard but the crowning performance was when he took his tail in his mouth and waltzed down the walk over the prostrate dolls to the gate and back again barely escaping a general upset of the ravaged table  bab and betty could only hold each other tight and squeal with delight for never had they seen any thing so funny but when the gymnastics ended and the dizzy dog came and stood on the step before them barking loudly with that pink nose of his sniffing at their feet and his queer eyes fixed sharply upon them their amusement turned to fear again and they dared not stir  whish go away commanded bab  scat meekly quavered betty  to their great relief the poodle gave several more inquiring barks and then vanished as suddenly as he appeared with one impulse the children ran to see what became of him and after a brisk scamper through the orchard saw the tasselled tail disappear under the fence at the far end  where do you spose he came from asked betty stopping to rest on a big stone  id like to know where hes gone too and give him a good beating old thief scolded bab remembering their wrongs  oh dear yes i hope the cake burnt him dreadfully if he did eat it groaned betty sadly remembering the dozen good raisins she chopped up and the lots of lasses mother put into the dear lost loaf  the partys all spoilt so we may as well go home and bab mournfully led the way back betty puckered up her face to cry but burst out laughing in spite of her woe  it was so funny to see him spin round and walk on his head  i wish hed do it all over again dont you  yes but i hate him just the same  i wonder what ma will say whenwhy why and bab stopped short in the arch with her eyes as round and almost as large as the blue saucers on the teatray  what is it oh what is it cried betty all ready to run away if any new terror appeared  look there its come back said bab in an awestricken whisper pointing to the table betty did look and her eyes opened even wideras well they mightfor there just where they first put it was the lost cake unhurt unchanged except that the big b had coasted a little further down the gingerbread hill    chapter ii  where they found his master  neither spoke for a minute astonishment being too great for words then as by one impulse both stole up and touched the cake with a timid finger quite prepared to see it fly away in some mysterious and startling manner it remained sitting tranquilly in the basket however and the children drew a long breath of relief for though they did not believe in fairies the late performances did seem rather like witchcraft  the dog didnt eat it  sally didnt take it  how do you know  she never would have put it back  who did  cant tell but i forgive em  what shall we do now asked betty feeling as if it would be very difficult to settle down to a quiet teaparty after such unusual excitement  eat that cake up just as fast as ever we can and bab divided the contested delicacy with one chop of the big knife bound to make sure of her own share at all events  it did not take long for they washed it down with sips of milk and ate as fast as possible glancing round all the while to see if the queer dog was coming again  there now id like to see any one take my cake away said bab defiantly crunching her half of the piecrust b  or mine either coughed betty choking over a raisin that wouldnt go down in a hurry  we might as well clear up and play there had been an earthquake suggested bab feeling that some such convulsion of nature was needed to explain satisfactorily the demoralized condition of her family  that will be splendid my poor linda was knocked right over on her nose darlin child come to your mother and be fixed purred betty lifting the fallen idol from a grove of chickweed and tenderly brushing the dirt from belindas heroically smiling face  shell have croup tonight as sure as the world wed better make up some squills out of this sugar and water said bab who dearly loved to dose the dollies all round  praps she will but you neednt begin to sneeze yet awhile i can sneeze for my own children thank you maam returned betty sharply for her usually amiable spirit had been ruffled by the late occurrences  i didnt sneeze ive got enough to do to talk and cry and cough for my own poor dears without bothering about yours cried bab even more ruffled than her sister  then who did  i heard a real live sneeze just as plain as anything and betty looked up to the green roof above her as if the sound came from that direction  a yellowbird sat swinging and chirping on the tall lilacbush but no other living thing was in sight birds dont sneeze do they asked betty eying little goldy suspiciously  you goose of course they dont  well i should just like to know who is laughing and sneezing round here may be it is the dog suggested betty looking relieved  i never heard of a dogs laughing except mother hubbards  this is such a queer one may be he can though i wonder where he went to and bab took a survey down both the sidepaths quite longing to see the funny poodle again  i know where i m going to said betty piling the dolls into her apron with more haste than care im going right straight home to tell ma all about it i dont like such actions and i m afraid to stay  i aint but i guess it is going to rain so i shall have to go any way answered bab taking advantage of the black clouds rolling up the sky for she scorned to own that she was afraid of any thing  clearing the table in a summary manner by catching up the four corners of the cloth bab put the rattling bundle into her apron flung her children on the top and pronounced herself ready to depart betty lingered an instant to pick up and ends that might be spoilt by the rain and when she turned from taking the red halter off the knocker two lovely pink roses lay on the stone steps  oh bab just see  heres the very ones we wanted  wasnt it nice of the wind to blow em down she called out picking them up and running after her sister who had strolled moodily along still looking about for her sworn foe sally folsom the flowers soothed the feelings of the little girls because they had longed for them and bravely resisted the temptation to climb up the trellis and help themselves since their mother had forbidden such feats owing to a fall bab got trying to reach a honeysuckle from the vine which ran all over the porch  home they went and poured out their tale to mrs mosss great amusement for she saw in it only some playmates prank and was not much impressed by the mysterious sneeze and laugh  well have a grand rummage monday and find out what is going on over there was all she said but mrs moss could not keep her promise for on monday it still rained and the little girls paddled off to school like a pair of young ducks enjoying every puddle they came to since indiarubber boots made wading a delicious possibility they took their dinner and at noon regaled a crowd of comrades with an account of the mysterious dog who appeared to be haunting the neighborhood as several of the other children had seen him examining their back yards with interest he had begged of them but to none had he exhibited his accomplishments except bab and betty and they were therefore much set up and called him our dog with an air the cake transaction remained a riddle for sally folsom solemnly declared that she was playing tag in mamie snows barn at that identical time no one had been near the old house but the two children and no one could throw any light upon that singular affair  it produced a great effect however for even teacher was interested and told such amazing tales of a juggler she once saw that doughnuts were left forgotten in dinnerbaskets and wedges of pie remained suspended in the air for several minutes at a time instead of vanishing with miraculous rapidity as usual at afternoon recess which the girls had first bab nearly dislocated every joint of her little body trying to imitate the poodles antics she had practised on her bed with great success but the woodshed floor was a different thing as her knees and elbows soon testified  it looked just as easy as any thing i dont see how he did it she said coming down with a bump after vainly attempting to walk on her hands  my gracious there he is this very minute cried betty who sat on a little woodpile near the door there was a general rushand sixteen small girls gazed out into the rain as eagerly as if to behold cinderellas magic coach instead of one forlorn dog trotting by through the mud  oh do call him in and make him dance  cried the girls all chirping at once till it sounded as if a flock of sparrows had taken possession of the shed  i will call him he knows me and bab scrambled up forgetting how she had chased the poodle and called him names two days ago  he evidently had not forgotten however for though he paused and looked wistfully at them he would not approach but stood dripping in the rain with his frills much bedraggled while his tasselled tail wagged slowly and his pink nose pointed suggestively to the pails and baskets nearly empty now  hes hungry give him something to eat and then hell see that we dont want to hurt him suggested sally starting a contribution with her last bit of bread and butter  bab caught up her new pail and collected all the odds and ends then tried to beguile the poor beast in to eat and be comforted but he only came as far as the door and sitting up begged with such imploring eyes that bab put down the pail and stepped back saying pitifully  the poor thing is starved let him eat all he wants and we wont touch him  the girls drew back with little clucks of interest and compassion but i regret to say their charity was not rewarded as they expected for the minute the coast was clear the dog marched boldly up seized the handle of the pail in his mouth and was off with it galloping down the road at a great pace  shrieks arose from the children especially bab and betty basely bereaved of their new dinnerpail but no one could follow the thief for the bell rang and in they went so much excited that the boys rushed tumultuously forth to discover the cause by the time school was over the sun was out and bab and betty hastened home to tell their wrongs and be comforted by mother who did it most effectually  never mind dears ill get you another pail if he doesnt bring it back as he did before as it is too wet for you to play out you shall go and see the old coachhouse as i promised keep on your rubbers and come along  this delightful prospect much assuaged their woe and away they went skipping gayly down the gravelled path while mrs moss followed with skirts well tucked up and a great bunch of keys in her hand for she lived at the lodge and had charge of the premises  the small door of the coachhouse was fastened inside but the large one had a padlock on it and this being quickly unfastened one half swung open and the little girls ran in too eager and curious even to cry out when they found themselves at last in possession of the longcoveted old carriage a dusty musty concern enough but it had a high seat a door steps that let down and many other charms which rendered it most desirable in the eyes of children  bab made straight for the box and betty for the door but both came tumbling down faster than they went up when from the gloom of the interior came a shrill bark and a low voice saying quickly down sancho down  who is there demanded mrs moss in a stern tone backing toward the door with both children clinging to her skirts  the wellknown curly white head was popped out of the broken window and a mild whine seemed to say dont be alarmed ladies we wont hurt you come out this minute or i shall have to come and get you called mrs moss growing very brave all of a sudden as she caught sight of a pair of small dusty shoes under the coach  yes m im coming as fast as i can answered a meek voice as what appeared to be a bundle of rags leaped out of the dark followed by the poodle who immediately sat down at the bare feet of his owner with a watchful air as if ready to assault any one who might approach too near  now then who are you and how did you get here asked mrs moss trying to speak sternly though her motherly eyes were already full of pity as they rested on the forlorn little figure before her    chapter iii  ben  please m my name is ben brown and im travellin  where are you going  anywheres to get work  what sort of work can you do  all kinds  im used to horses  bless me such a little chap as you  im twelve maam and can ride any thing on four legs and the small boy gave a nod that seemed to say bring on your cruisers im ready for em  havent you got any folks asked mrs moss amused but still anxious for the sunburnt face was very thin the eyes hollow with hunger or pain and the ragged figure leaned on the wheel as if too weak or weary to stand alone  no m not of my own and the people i was left with beat me so irun away the last words seemed to bolt out against his will as if the womans sympathy irresistibly won the childs confidence  then i dont blame you  but how did you get here  i was so tired i couldnt go any further and i thought the folks up here at the big house would take me in but the gate was locked and i was so discouraged i jest laid down outside and give up  poor little soul i dont wonder said mrs moss while the children looked deeply interested at mention of their gate  the boy drew a long breath and his eyes began to twinkle in spite of his forlorn state as he went on while the dog pricked up his ears at mention of his name  while i was restin i heard some one come along inside and i peeked and saw them little girls playin the vittles looked so nice i couldnt help wantin em but i didnt take nothinit was sancho and he took the cake for me  bab and betty gave a gasp and stared reproachfully at the poodle who half closed his eyes with a meek unconscious look that was very droll  and you made him put it back cried bab  no i did it myself got over the gate when you was racin after sancho and then clim up on the porch and hid said the boy with a grin  and you laughed asked bab  yes  and sneezed added betty  yes  and threw down the roses cried both  yes and you liked em didnt you  course we did what made you hide said bab  i wasnt fit to be seen muttered ben glancing at his tatters as if hed like to dive out of sight into the dark coach again  how came you here demanded mrs moss suddenly remembering her responsibility  i heard em talk about a little winder and a shed and when theyd gone i found it and come in the glass was broke and i only pulled the nail out i havent done a mite of harm sleepin here two nights i was so tuckered out i couldnt go on nohow though i tried a sunday  and came back again  yes m it was so lonesome in the rain and this place seemed kinder like home and i could hear em talkin outside and sanch he found vittles and i was pretty comfortable  well i never ejaculated mrs moss whisking up a corner of her apron to wipe her eyes for the thought of the poor little fellow alone there for two days and nights with no bed but musty straw no food but the scraps a dog brought him was too much for her do you know what im going to do with you she asked trying to look calm and cool with a great tear running down her wholesome red cheek and a smile trying to break out at the corners of her lips  no maam and i dunno as i care  only dont be hard on sanch hes been real good to me and we re fond of one another aint us old chap answered the boy with his arm around the dogs neck and an anxious look which he had not worn for himself  im going to take you right home and wash and feed and put you in a good bed and tomorrowwell well see whatll happen then said mrs moss not quite sure about it herself  youre very kind maam ill be glad to work for you  aint you got a horse i can see to asked the boy eagerly  nothing but hens and a cat  bab and betty burst out laughing when their mother said that and ben gave a faint giggle as if he would like to join in if he only had the strength to do it but his legs shook under him and he felt a queer dizziness so he could only hold on to sancho and blink at the light like a young owl  come right along child  run on girls and put the rest of the broth to warming and fill the kettle ill see to the boy commanded mrs moss waving off the children and going up to feel the pulse of her new charge for it suddenly occurred to her that he might be sick and not safe to take home  the hand he gave her was very thin but clean and cool and the black eyes were clear though hollow for the poor lad was halfstarved  im awful shabby but i aint dirty  i had a washin in the rain last night and ive jest about lived on water lately he explained wondering why she looked at him so hard  put out your tongue  he did so but took it in again to say quickly  i aint sickim only hungry for i havent had a mite but what sanch brought for three days and i always go halves dont i sanch  the poodle gave a shrill bark and vibrated excitedly between the door and his master as if he understood all that was going on and recommended a speedy march toward the promised food and shelter mrs moss took the hint and bade the boy follow her at once and bring his things with him  i aint got any  some big fellers took away my bundle else i wouldnt look so bad theres only this im sorry sanch took it and id like to give it back if i knew whose it was said ben bringing the new dinnerpail out from the depths of the coach where he had gone to housekeeping  thats soon done its mine and youre welcome to the bits your queer dog ran off with come along i must lock up and mrs moss clanked her keys suggestively  ben limped out leaning on a broken hoehandle for he was stiff after two days in such damp lodgings as well as worn out with a fortnights wandering through sun and rain sancho was in great spirits evidently feeling that their woes were over and his foraging expeditions at an end for he frisked about his master with yelps of pleasure or made playful darts at the ankles of his benefactress which caused her to cry whish and scat and shake her skirts at him as if he were a cat or hen  a hot fire was roaring in the stove under the brothskillet and teakettle and betty was poking in more wood with a great smirch of black on her chubby cheek while bab was cutting away at the loaf as if bent on slicing her own fingers off before ben knew what he was about he found himself in the old rockingchair devouring bread and butter as only a hungry boy can with sancho close by gnawing a muttonbone like a ravenous wolf in sheeps clothing  while the newcomers were thus happily employed mrs moss beckoned the little girls out of the room and gave them both an errand  bab you run over to mrs bartons and ask her for any old duds billy dont want and betty you go to the cutters and tell miss clarindy id like a couple of the shirts we made at last sewing circle any shoes or a hat or socks would come handy for the poor dear hasnt a whole thread on him  away went the children full of anxiety to clothe their beggar and so well did they plead his cause with the good neighbors that ben hardly knew himself when he emerged from the back bedroom half an hour later clothed in billy bartons faded flannel suit with an unbleached cotton shirt out of the dorcas basket and a pair of milly cutters old shoes on his feet  sancho also had been put in better trim for after his master had refreshed himself with a warm bath he gave his dog a good scrub while mrs moss set a stitch here and there in the new old clothes and sancho reappeared looking more like the china poodle than ever being as white as snow his curls well brushed up and his tasselly tail waving proudly over his back  feeling eminently respectable and comfortable the wanderers humbly presented themselves and were greeted with smiles of approval from the little girls and a hospitable welcome from the mother who set them near the stove to dry as both were decidedly damp after their ablutions  i declare i shouldnt have known you exclaimed the good woman surveying the boy with great satisfaction for though still very thin and tired the lad had a tidy look that pleased her and a lively way of moving about in his clothes like an eel in a skin rather too big for him the merry black eyes seemed to see every thing the voice had an honest sound and the sunburnt face looked several years younger since the unnatural despondency had gone out of it  its very nice and me and sanch are lots obliged maam murmured ben getting red and bashful under the three pairs of friendly eyes fixed upon him  bab and betty were doing up the teathings with unusual despatch so that they might entertain their guest and just as ben spoke bab dropped a cup to her great surprise no smash followed for bending quickly the boy caught it as it fell and presented it to her on the back of his hand with a little bow  gracious how could you do it asked bab looking as if she thought there was magic about  thats nothing look here and taking two plates ben sent them spinning up into the air catching and throwing so rapidly that bab and betty stood with their mouths open as if to swallow the plates should they fall while mrs moss with her dishcloth suspended watched the antics of her crockery with a housewifes anxiety  that does beat all was the only exclamation she had time to make for as if desirous of showing his gratitude in the only way he could ben took clothespins from a basket near by sent several saucers twirling up caught them on the pins balanced the pins on chin nose forehead and went walking about with a new and peculiar sort of toadstool ornamenting his countenance  the children were immensely tickled and mrs moss was so amused she would have lent her best souptureen if he had expressed a wish for it but ben was too tired to show all his accomplishments at once and he soon stopped looking as if he almost regretted having betrayed that he possessed any  i guess youve been in the juggling business said mrs moss with a wise nod for she saw the same look on his face as when he said his name was ben brownthe look of one who was not telling the whole truth  yes m  i used to help senor pedro the wizard of the world and i learned some of his tricks stammered ben trying to seem innocent  now look here boy youd better tell me the whole story and tell it true or i shall have to send you up to judge morris i wouldnt like to do that for he is a harsh sort of a man so if you havent done any thing bad you neednt be afraid to speak out and ill do what i can for you said mrs moss rather sternly as she went and sat down in her rockingchair as if about to open the court  i havent done any thing bad and i aint afraid only i dont want to go back and if i tell may be youll let em know where i be said ben much distressed between his longing to confide in his new friend and his fear of his old enemies  if they abused you of course i wouldnt  tell the truth and ill stand by you girls you go for the milk  oh ma do let us stay  well never tell truly truly cried bab and betty full of dismay being sent off when secrets were about to be divulged  i dont mind em said ben handsomely  very well only hold your tongues  now boy where did you come from said mrs moss as the little girls hastily sat down together on their private and particular bench opposite their mother brimming with curiosity and beaming with satisfaction at the prospect before them    chapter iv  his story  i ran away from a circus began ben but got no further for bab and betty gave a simultaneous bounce of delight and both cried out at once  weve been to one  it was splendid  you wouldnt think so if you knew as much about it as i do answered ben with a sudden frown and wriggle as if he still felt the smart of the blows he had received we dont call it splendid do we sancho he added making a queer noise which caused the poodle to growl and bang the floor irefully with his tail as he lay close to his masters feet getting acquainted with the new shoes they wore  how came you there asked mrs moss rather disturbed at the news  why my father was the wild hunter of the plains didnt you ever see or hear of him said ben as if surprised at her ignorance  bless your heart child i havent been to a circus this ten years and im sure i dont remember what or who i saw then answered mrs moss amused yet touched by the sons evident admiration for his father  didnt you see him demanded ben turning to the little girls  we saw indians and tumbling men and the bounding brothers of borneo and a clown and monkeys and a little mite of a pony with blue eyes was he any of them answered betty innocently  pooh he didnt belong to that lot  he always rode two four six eight horses to oncet and i used to ride with him till i got too big my father was a no 1 and didnt do any thing but break horses and ride em said ben with as much pride as if his parent had been a president  is he dead asked mrs moss  i dont know  wish i didand poor ben gave a gulp as if something rose in his throat and choked him  tell us all about it dear and may be we can find out where he is said mrs moss leaning forward to pat the shiny dark head that was suddenly bent over the dog  yes maam  i will thank y and with an effort the boy steadied his voice and plunged into the middle of his story  father was always good to me and i liked bein with him after granny died i lived with her till i was seven then father took me and i was trained for rider you jest oughter have seen me when i was a little feller all in white tights and a gold belt and pink riggin standing on fathers shoulder or hangin on to old generals tail and him gallopin full pelt or father ridin three horses with me on his head wavin flags and every one clapping like fun  oh werent you scared to pieces asked betty quaking at the mere thought  not a bit i liked it  so should i cried bab enthusiastically  then i drove the four ponies in the little chariot when we paraded continued ben and i sat on the great ball up top of the grand car drawed by hannibal and nero but i didnt like that cause it was awful high and shaky and the sun was hot and the trees slapped my face and my legs ached holdin on  whats hanny bells and neroes demanded betty  big elephants  father never let em put me up there and they didnt darst till he was gone then i had to else theyd a thrashed me  didnt any one take your part asked mrs moss  yes m most all the ladies did they were very good to me specially melia she vowed she wouldnt go on in the tunnymunt act if they didnt stop knockin me round when i wouldnt help old buck with the bears so they had to stop it cause she led first rate and none of the other ladies rode half as well as melia  bears oh do tell about them exclaimed bab in great excitement for at the only circus she had seen the animals were her delight  buck had five of em cross old fellers and he showed em off  i played with em once jest for fun and he thought it would make a hit to have me show off instead of him but they had a way of clawin and huggin that wasnt nice and you couldnt never tell whether they were goodnatured or ready to bite your head off buck was all over scars where theyd scratched and bit him and i wasnt going to do it and i didnt have to owin to miss st johns standin by me like a good one  who was miss st john asked mrs moss rather confused by the sudden introduction of new names and people  why she was meliamrs  smithers the ringmasters wife his name wasnt montgomery any moren hers was st john they all change em to something fine on the bills you know father used to be senor jose montebello and i was master adolphus bloomsbury after i stopped bein a flyin coopid and a infant progidy  mrs moss leaned back in her chair to laugh at that greatly to the surprise of the little girls who were much impressed with the elegance of these highsounding names  go on with your story ben and tell why you ran away and what became of your pa she said composing herself to listen really interested in the child  well you see father had a quarrel with old smithers and went off sudden last fall just before tenting season was over he told me he was goin to a great ridin school in new york and when he was fixed hed send for me i was to stay in the museum and help pedro with the trick business he was a nice man and i liked him and melia was goin to see to me and i didnt mind for awhile but father didnt send for me and i began to have horrid times if it hadnt been for melia and sancho i would have cut away long before i did  what did you have to do  lots of things for times was dull and i was smart smithers said so any way and i had to tumble up lively when he gave the word i didnt mind doin tricks or showin off sancho for father trained him and he always did well with me but they wanted me to drink gin to keep me small and i wouldnt cause father didnt like that kind of thing i used to ride tiptop and that just suited me till i got a fall and hurt my back but i had to go on all the same though i ached dreadful and used to tumble off i was so dizzy and weak  what a brute that man must have been  why didnt melia put a stop to it asked mrs moss indignantly  she died maam and then there was no one left but sanch so i run away  then ben fell to patting his dog again to hide the tears he could not keep from coming at the thought of the kind friend he had lost  what did you mean to do  find father but i couldnt for he wasnt at the ridin school and they told me he had gone out west to buy mustangs for a man who wanted a lot so then i was in a fix for i couldnt go to father didnt know jest where he was and i wouldnt sneak back to smithers to be abused tried to make em take me at the ridin school but they didnt want a boy and i travelled along and tried to get work but id have starved if it hadnt been for sanch i left him tied up when i ran off for fear theyd say i stole him hes a very valuable dog maam the best trick dog i ever see and theyd want him back more than they would me he belongs to father and i hated to leave him but i did i hooked it one dark night and never thought id see him agin next mornin i was eatin breakfast in a barn miles away and dreadful lonesome when he came tearin in all mud and wet with a great piece of rope draggin hed gnawed it and come after me and wouldnt go back or be lost and ill never leave him again will i dear old feller  sancho had listened to this portion of the tale with intense interest and when ben spoke to him he stood straight up put both paws on the boys shoulders licked his face with a world of dumb affection in his yellow eyes and gave a little whine which said as plainly as words  cheer up little master fathers may vanish and friends die but i never will desert you  ben hugged him close and smiled over his curly white head at the little girls who clapped their hands at the pleasing tableau and then went to pat and fondle the good creature assuring him that they entirely forgave the theft of the cake and the new dinnerpail inspired by these endearments and certain private signals given by ben sancho suddenly burst away to perform all his best antics with unusual grace and dexterity  bab and betty danced about the room with rapture while mrs moss declared she was almost afraid to have such a wonderfully intelligent animal in the house praises of his dog pleased ben more than praises of himself and when the confusion had subsided he entertained his audience with a lively account of sanchos cleverness fidelity and the various adventures in which he had nobly borne his part  while he talked mrs moss was making up her mind about him and when he came to an end of his dogs perfections she said gravely  if i can find something for you to do would you like to stay here awhile  oh yes maam id be glad to answered ben eagerly for the place seemed homelike already and the good woman almost as motherly as the departed mrs smithers  well ill step over to the squires tomorrow to see what he says shouldnt wonder if hed take you for a choreboy if you are as smart as you say he always has one in the summer and i havent seen any round yet can you drive cows  hope so and ben gave a shrug as if it was a very unnecessary question to put to a person who had driven four calico ponies in a gilded chariot  it maynt be as lively as riding elephants and playing with bears but it is respectable and i guess youll be happier switching brindle and buttercup than being switched yourself said mrs moss shaking her head at him with a smile  i guess i will maam answered ben with sudden meekness remembering the trials from which he had escaped  very soon after this he was sent off for a good nights sleep in the back bedroom with sancho to watch over him but both found it difficult to slumber till the racket overhead subsided for bab insisted on playing she was a bear and devouring poor betty in spite of her wails till their mother came up and put an end to it by threatening to send ben and his dog away in the morning if the girls didnt behave and be as still as mice  this they solemnly promised and they were soon dreaming of gilded cars and mouldy coaches runaway boys and dinnerpails dancing dogs and twirling teacups    chapter v  ben gets a place  when ben awoke next morning he looked about him for a moment half bewildered because there was neither a canvas tent a barn roof nor the blue sky above him but a neat white ceiling where several flies buzzed sociably together while from without came not the tramping of horses the twitter of swallows or the chirp of early birds but the comfortable cackle of hens and the sound of two little voices chanting the multiplication table  sancho sat at the open window watching the old cat wash her face and trying to imitate her with his great ruffled paw so awkwardly that ben laughed and sanch to hide his confusion at being caught made one bound from chair to bed and licked his masters face so energetically that the boy dived under the bedclothes to escape from the rough tongue a rap on the floor from below made both jump up and in ten minutes a shinyfaced lad and a lively dog went racing downstairsone to say goodmornin maam the other to wag his tail faster than ever tail wagged before for ham frizzled on the stove and sancho was fond of it  did you rest well asked mrs moss nodding at him fork in hand  guess i did  never saw such a bed  im used to hay and a horseblanket and lately nothin but sky for a cover and grass for my featherbed laughed ben grateful for present comforts and making light of past hardships  clean sweet cornhusks aint bad for young bones even if they havent got more flesh on them than yours have answered mrs moss giving the smooth head a motherly stroke as she went by  fat aint allowed in our profession maam  the thinner the better for tightropes and tumblin likewise bareback ridin and spry jugglin muscles the thing and there you are  ben stretched out a wiry little arm with a clenched fist at the end of it as if he were a young hercules ready to play ball with the stove if she gave him leave glad to see him in such good spirits she pointed to the well outside saying pleasantly  well then just try your muscle by bringing in some fresh water  ben caught up a pail and ran off ready to be useful but while he waited for the bucket to fill down among the mossy stones he looked about him well pleased with all he sawthe small brown house with a pretty curl of smoke rising from its chimney the little sisters sitting in the sunshine green hills and newlyplanted fields far and near a brook dancing through the orchard birds singing in the elm avenue and all the world as fresh and lovely as early summer could make it  dont you think its pretty nice here asked bab as his eye came back to them after a long look which seemed to take in every thing brightening as it roved  just the nicest place that ever was  only needs a horse round somewhere to be complete answered ben as the long wellsweep came up with a dripping bucket at one end an old grindstone at the other  the judge has three but hes so fussy about them he wont even let us pull a few hairs out of old majors tail to make rings of said betty shutting her arithmetic with an injured expression  mike lets me ride the white one to water when the judge isnt round its such fun to go jouncing down the lane and back i do love horses cried bab bobbing up and down on the blue bench to imitate the motion of white jenny  i guess you are a plucky sort of a girl and ben gave her an approving look as he went by taking care to slop a little water on mrs puss who stood curling her whiskers and humping up her back at sancho  come to breakfast called mrs moss and for about twenty minutes little was said as mush and milk vanished in a way that would have astonished even jack the giantkiller with his leather bag  now girls fly round and get your chores done up ben you go chop me some kindlings and ill make things tidy then we can all start off at once said mrs moss as the last mouthful vanished and sancho licked his lips over the savory scraps that fell to his share  ben fell to chopping so vigorously that chips flew wildly all about the shed bab rattled the cups into her dishpan with dangerous haste and betty raised a cloud of dust sweepingup while mother seemed to be everywhere at once even sanch feeling that his fate was at stake endeavored to help in his own somewhat erratic waynow frisking about ben at the risk of getting his tail chopped off then trotting away to poke his inquisitive nose into every closet and room whither he followed mrs moss in her flying round evolutions next dragging off the mat so betty could brush the doorsteps or inspecting babs dishwashing by standing on his hindlegs to survey the table with a critical air when they drove him out he was not the least offended but gayly barked puss up a tree chased all the hens over the fence and carefully interred an old shoe in the garden where the remains of the muttonbone were already buried  by the time the others were ready he had worked off his superfluous spirits and trotted behind the party like a wellbehaved dog accustomed to go out walking with ladies at the crossroads they separated the little girls running on to school while mrs moss and ben went up to the squires big house on the hill  dont you be scared child ill make it all right about your running away and if the squire gives you a job just thank him for it and do your best to be steady and industrious then youll get on i havent a doubt she whispered ringing the ben at a sidedoor on which the word morris shone in bright letters  come in called a gruff voice and feeling very much as if he were going to have a tooth out ben meekly followed the good woman who put on her pleasantest smile anxious to make the best possible impression  a whiteheaded old gentleman sat reading a paper and peered over his glasses at the newcomers with a pair of sharp eyes saying in a testy tone which would have rather daunted any one who did not know what a kind heart he had under his capacious waistcoat  goodmorning maam  whats the matter now young tramp been stealing your chickens  oh dear no sir exclaimed mrs moss as if shocked at the idea then in a few words she told bens story unconsciously making his wrongs and destitution so pathetic by her looks and tones that the squire could not help being interested and even ben pitied himself as if he were somebody else  now then boy what can you do asked the old gentleman with an approving nod to mrs moss as she finished and such a keen glance from under his bushy brows that ben felt as if he was perfectly transparent  most any thing sir to get my livin  can you weed  never did but i can learn sir  pull up all the beets and leave the pigweed hey can you pick strawberries  never tried any thing but eatin em sir  not likely to forget that part of the job  can you ride a horse to plow  guess i could sirand bens eyes began to sparkle for he dearly loved the noble animals who had been his dearest friends lately  no antics allowed my horse is a fine fellow and im very particular about him the squire spoke soberly but there was a twinkle in his eye and mrs moss tried not to smile for the squires horse was a joke all over the town being about twenty years old and having a peculiar gait of his own lifting his forefeet very high with a great show of speed though never going out of a jogtrot the boys used to say he galloped before and walked behind and made all sorts of fun of the big romannosed beast who allowed no liberties to be taken with him  im too fond of horses to hurt em sir  as for ridin i aint afraid of any thing on four legs the king of morocco used to kick and bite like fun but i could manage him firstrate  then youd be able to drive cows to pasture perhaps  ive drove elephants and camels ostriches and grizzly bears and mules and six yellow ponies all to oncet may be i could manage cows if i tried hard answered ben endeavoring to be meek and respectful when scorn filled his soul at the idea of not being able to drive a cow  the squire liked him all the better for the droll mixture of indignation and amusement betrayed by the fire in his eyes and the sly smile round his lips and being rather tickled by bens list of animals he answered gravely  dont raise elephants and camels much round here bears used to be plenty but folks got tired of them mules are numerous but we have the twolegged kind and as a general thing prefer shanghae fowls to ostriches  he got no farther for ben laughed out so infectiously that both the others joined him and somehow that jolly laugh seemed to settle matters than words as they stopped the squire tapped on the window behind him saying with an attempt at the former gruffness  well try you on cows awhile  my man will show you where to drive them and give you some odd jobs through the day ill see what you are good for and send you word tonight mrs moss the boy can sleep at your house cant he  yes indeed sir  he can go on doing it and come up to his work just as well as not i can see to him then and he wont be a care to any one said mrs moss heartily  ill make inquiries concerning your father boy meantime mind what you are about and have a good report to give when he comes for you returned the squire with a warning wag of a stern forefinger  thanky sir  i will sir  fatherll come just as soon as he can if he isnt sick or lost murmured ben inwardly thanking his stars that he had not done any thing to make him quake before that awful finger and resolved that he never would  here a redheaded irishman came to the door and stood eying the boy with small favor while the squire gave his orders  pat this lad wants work  hes to take the cows and go for them  give him any light jobs you have and let me know if hes good for any thing  yis your honor  come out o this by till i show ye the bastes responded pat and with a hasty goodby to mrs moss ben followed his new leader sorely tempted to play some naughty trick upon him in return for his ungracious reception  but in a moment he forgot that pat existed for in the yard stood the duke of wellington so named in honor of his roman nose if ben had known any thing about shakespeare he would have cried a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse for the feeling was in his heart and he ran up to the stately animal without a fear duke put back his ears and swished his tail as if displeased for a moment but ben looked straight in his eyes gave a scientific stroke to the irongray nose and uttered a chirrup which made the ears prick up as if recognizing a familiar sound  hell nip ye if ye go botherin that way  leave him alone and attend to the cattle as his honor told ye commanded pat who made a great show of respect toward duke in public and kicked him brutally in private  i aint afraid you wont hurt me will you old feller  see there nowhe knows i m a friend and takes to me right off said ben with an arm around dukes neck and his own cheek confidingly laid against the animals for the intelligent eyes spoke to him as plainly as the little whinny which he understood and accepted as a welcome  the squire saw it all from the open window and suspecting from pats face that trouble was brewing called out  let the lad harness duke if he can  im going out directly and he may as well try that as any thing  ben was delighted and proved himself so brisk and handy that the roomy chaise stood at the door in a surprisingly short time with a smiling little ostler at dukes head when the squire came out  his affection for the horse pleased the old gentleman and his neat way of harnessing suited as well but ben got no praise except a nod and a brief all right boy as the equipage went creaking and jogging away  four sleek cows filed out of the barnyard when pat opened the gate and ben drove them down the road to a distant pasture where the early grass awaited their eager cropping by the school they went and the boy looked pityingly at the black brown and yellow heads bobbing past the windows as a class went up to recite for it seemed a hard thing to the libertyloving lad to be shut up there so many hours on a morning like that  but a little breeze that was playing truant round the steps did ben a service without knowing it for a sudden puff blew a torn leaf to his feet and seeing a picture he took it up it evidently had fallen from some illused history for the picture showed some queer ships at anchor some oddly dressed men just landing and a crowd of indians dancing about on the shore ben spelt out all he could about these interesting personages but could not discover what it meant because ink evidently had deluged the page to the new readers great disappointment  ill ask the girls may be they will know said ben to himself as after looking vainly for more stray leaves he trudged on enjoying the bobolinks song the warm sunshine and a comfortable sense of friendliness and safety which soon set him to whistling as gayly as any blackbird in the meadow    chapter vi  a circulating library  after supper that night bab and betty sat in the old porch playing with josephus and belinda and discussing the events of the day for the appearance of the strange boy and his dog had been a most exciting occurrence in their quiet lives they had seen nothing of him since morning as he took his meals at the squires and was at work with pat in a distant field when the children passed sancho had stuck closely to his master evidently rather bewildered by the new order of things and bound to see that no harm happened to ben  i wish theyd come  its sundown and i heard the cows mooing so i know they have gone home said betty impatiently for she regarded the newcomer in the light of an entertaining book and wished to read on as fast as possible  im going to learn the signs he makes when he wants sancho to dance then we can have fun with him whenever we like hes the dearest dog i ever saw answered bab who was fonder of animals than her sister  ma saidow whats that cried betty with a start as something bumped against the gate outside and in a moment bens head peeped over the top as he swung himself up to the iron arch in the middle of which was the empty lantern frame  please to locate gentlemen please to locate the performance is about to begin with the great flyin coopid act in which master bloomsbury has appeared before the crowned heads of europe pronounced by all beholders the most remarkable youthful progidy agoin hooray here we are  having rattled off the familiar speech in mr smitherss elegant manner ben begin to cut up such capers that even a party of dignified hens going down the avenue to bed paused to look on with clucks of astonishment evidently fancying that salt had set him to fluttering and tumbling as it did them never had the old gate beheld such antics though it had seen gay doings in its time for of all the boys who had climbed over it not one had ever stood on his head upon each of the big balls which ornamented the posts hung by his heels from the arch gone round and round like a wheel with the bar for an axis played a tattoo with his toes while holding on by his chin walked about the wall on his hands or closed the entertainment by festooning himself in an airy posture over the side of the lantern frame and kissing his hand to the audience as a wellbred cupid is supposed to do on making his bow  the little girls clapped and stamped enthusiastically while sancho who had been calmly surveying the show barked his approval as he leaped up to snap at bens feet  come down and tell what you did up at the squires  was he cross  did you have to work hard do you like it asked bab when the noise had subsided  its cooler up here answered ben composing himself in the frame and fanning his hot face with a green spray broken from the tall bushes rustling odorously all about him i did all sorts of jobs the old gentleman wasnt cross he gave me a dime and i like him firstrate but i just hate carrots he swears at a feller and fired a stick of wood at me guess ill pay him off when i get a chance  fumbling in his pocket to show the bright dime he found the torn page and remembered the thirst for information which had seized him in the morning look here tell me about this will you what are these chaps up to the ink has spoilt all but the picture and this bit of reading i want to know what it means take it to em sanch  the dog caught the leaf as it fluttered to the ground and carrying it carefully in his mouth deposited it at the feet of the little girls seating himself before them with an air of deep interest bab and betty picked it up and read it aloud in unison while ben leaned from his perch to listen and learn  when day dawned land was visible  a pleasant land it was  there were gay flowers and tall trees with leaves and fruit such as they had never seen before on the shore were unclad coppercolored men gazing with wonder at the spanish ships they took them for great birds the white sails for their wings and the spaniards for superior beings brought down from heaven on their backs  why thats columbus finding san salvador dont you know about him demanded bab as if she were one of the superior beings and intimately acquainted with the immortal christopher  no i dont  who was he any way  i spose thats him paddlin ahead but which of the injuns is sam salvindoor asked ben rather ashamed of his ignorance but bent on finding out now he had begun  my gracious twelve years old and not know your quackenbos laughed bab much amused but rather glad to find that she could teach the whirligig boy something for she considered him a remarkable creature  i dont care a bit for your quackin boss whoever he is  tell about this fine feller with the ships i like him persisted ben  so bab with frequent interruptions and hints from betty told the wonderful tale in a simple way which made it easy to understand for she liked history and had a lively tongue of her own  id like to read some more would my ten cents buy a book asked ben anxious to learn a little since bab laughed at him  no indeed ill lend you mine when im not using it and tell you all about it promised bab forgetting that she did not know all about it herself yet  i dont have any time only evenings and then may be youll want it begun ben in whom the inky page had roused a strong curiosity  i do get my history in the evening but you could have it mornings before school  i shall have to go off early so there wont be any chance  yes there willill tell you how to do it let me read while i drive up the cows squire likes em to eat slow along the road sos to keep the grass short and save mowin pat said so and i could do history instead of loafin round cried ben full of this bright idea  how will i get my book back in time to recite asked bab prudently  oh ill leave it on the windowsill or put it inside the door as i go back ill be real careful and just as soon as i earn enough ill buy you a new one and take the old one will you  yes but ill tell you a nicer way to do  dont put the book on the window cause teacher will see you or inside the door cause some one may steal it you put it in my cubbyhouse right at the corner of the wall nearest the big maple youll find a cunning place between the roots that stick up under the flat stone thats my closet and i keep things there its the best cubby of all and we take turns to have it  ill find it and thatll be a firstrate place said ben much gratified  i could put my readingbook in sometimes if youd like it  theres lots of pretty stories in it and pictures proposed betty rather timidly for she wanted to share the benevolent project but had little to offer not being as good a scholar as bab  id like a rithmetic better i read tiptop but i aint much on rithmetic so if you can spare yours i might take a look at it now im goin to earn wages i ought to know about addin em up and so on said ben with the air of a vanderbilt oppressed with the care of millions  ill teach you that  betty doesnt know much about sums  but she spells splendidly and is always at the head of her class teacher is real proud of her cause she never misses and spells hard fussy words like chirography and bronchitis as easy as any thing  bab quite beamed with sisterly pride and betty smoothed down her apron with modest satisfaction for bab seldom praised her and she liked it very much  i never went to school so thats the reason i aint smart i can write though better n some of the boys up at school i saw lots of names on the shed door see here nowand scrambling down ben pulled out a cherished bit of chalk and flourished off ten letters of the alphabet one on each of the dark stone slabs that paved the walk  those are beautiful  i cant make such curly ones  who taught you to do it asked bab as she and betty walked up and down admiring them  horse blankets answered ben soberly  what cried both girls stopping to stare  our horses all had their names on their blankets and i used to copy em the wagons had signs and i learned to read that way after father taught me my letters off the red and yellow posters first word i knew was lion cause i was always goin to see old jubal in his cage father was real proud when i read it right off i can draw one too  ben proceeded to depict an animal intended to represent his lost friend but jubal would not have recognized his portrait since it looked much more like sancho than the king of the forest the children admired it immensely however and ben gave them a lesson in natural history which was so interesting that it kept them busy and happy till bedtime for the boy described what he had seen in such lively language and illustrated in such a droll way it was no wonder they were charmed    chapter vii  new friends trot in  next day ben ran off to his work with quackenboss elementary history of the united states in his pocket and the squires cows had ample time to breakfast on wayside grass before they were put into their pasture even then the pleasant lesson was not ended for ben had an errand to town and all the way he read busily tumbling over the hard words and leaving bits which he did not understand to be explained at night by bab  at the first settlements he had to stop for the schoolhouse was reached and the book must be returned the mapletree closet was easily found and a little surprise hidden under the flat stone for ben paid two sticks of red and white candy for the privilege of taking books from the new library  when recess came great was the rejoicing of the children over their unexpected treat for mrs moss had few pennies to spare for sweets and somehow this candy tasted particularly nice bought out of grateful bens solitary dime the little girls shared their goodies with their favorite mates but said nothing about the new arrangement fearing it would be spoilt if generally known they told their mother however and she gave them leave to lend their books and encourage ben to love learning all they could she also proposed that they should drop patchwork and help her make some blue shirts for ben mrs barton had given her the materials and she thought it would be an excellent lesson in needlework as well as a useful gift to benwho boylike never troubled himself as to what he should wear when his one suit of clothes gave out  wednesday afternoon was the sewing time so the two little bs worked busily at a pair of shirtsleeves sitting on their bench in the doorway while the rusty needles creaked in and out and the childish voices sang schoolsongs with frequent stoppages for lively chatter  for a week ben worked away bravely and never shirked nor complained although pat put many a hard or disagreeable job upon him and chores grew more and more distasteful his only comfort was the knowledge that mrs moss and the squire were satisfied with him his only pleasure the lessons he learned while driving the cows and recited in the evening when the three children met under the lilacs to play school  he had no thought of studying when he began and hardly knew that he was doing it as he pored over the different books he took from the library but the little girls tried him with all they possessed and he was mortified to find how ignorant he was he never owned it in words but gladly accepted all the bits of knowledge they offered from their small store getting betty to hear him spell just for fun agreeing to draw bab all the bears and tigers she wanted if she would show him how to do sums on the flags and often beguiled his lonely labors by trying to chant the multiplication table as they did when tuesday night came round the squire paid him a dollar said he was a likely boy and might stay another week if he chose ben thanked him and thought he would but the next morning after he had put up the bars he remained sitting on the top rail to consider his prospects for he felt uncommonly reluctant to go back to the society of rough pat like most boys he hated work unless it was of a sort which just suited him then he could toil like a beaver and never tire his wandering life had given him no habits of steady industry and while he was an unusually capable lad of his age he dearly loved to loaf about and have a good deal of variety and excitement in his life  now he saw nothing before him but days of patient and very uninteresting labor he was heartily sick of weeding even riding duke before the cultivator had lost its charms and a great pile of wood lay in the squires yard which he knew he would be set to piling up in the shed strawberrypicking would soon follow the asparagus cultivation then haying and and so on all the long bright summer without any fun unless his father came for him  on the other hand he was not obliged to stay a minute longer unless he liked with a comfortable suit of clothes a dollar in his pocket and a row of dinnerbaskets hanging in the schoolhouse entry to supply him with provisions if he didnt mind stealing them what was easier than to run away again tramping has its charms in fair weather and ben had lived like a gypsy under canvas for years so he feared nothing and began to look down the leafy road with a restless wistful expression as the temptation grew stronger and stronger every minute  sancho seemed to share the longing for he kept running off a little way and stopping to frisk and bark then rushed back to sit watching his master with those intelligent eyes of his which seemed to say come on ben let us scamper down this pleasant road and never stop till we are tired swallows darted by white clouds fled before the balmy west wind a squirrel ran along the wall and all things seemed to echo the boys desire to leave toil behind and roam away as carefree as they one thing restrained him the thought of his seeming ingratitude to good mrs moss and the disappointment of the little girls at the loss of their two new playfellows while he paused to think of this something happened which kept him from doing what he would have been sure to regret afterward  horses had always been his best friends and one came trotting up to help him now though he did not know how much he owed it till long after just in the act of swinging himself over the bars to take a shortcut across the fields the sound of approaching hoofs unaccompanied by the roll of wheels caught his ear and pausing he watched eagerly to see who was coming at such a pace  at the turn of road however the quick trot stopped and in a moment a lady on a bay mare came pacing slowly into sighta young and pretty lady all in dark blue with a bunch of dandelions like yellow stars in her buttonhole and a silverhandled whip hanging from the pommel of her saddle evidently more for ornament than use the handsome mare limped a little and shook her head as if something plagued her while her mistress leaned down to see what was the matter saying as if she expected an answer of some sort  now chevalita if you have got a stone in your foot i shall have to get off and take it out why dont you look where you step and save me all this trouble  ill look for you maam id like to said an eager voice so unexpectedly that both horse and rider started as a boy came down the bank with a jump  i wish you would  you need not be afraid lita is as gentle as a lamb answered the young lady smiling as if amused by the boys earnestness  shes a beauty any way muttered ben lifting one foot after another till he found the stone and with some trouble got it out  that was nicely done and im much obliged can you tell me if that crossroad leads to the elms asked the lady as she went slowly on with ben beside her  no maam im new in these parts and i only know where squire morris and mrs moss live  i want to see both of them so suppose you show me the way i was here long ago and thought i should remember how to find the old house with the elm avenue and the big gate but i dont  i know it they call that place the laylocks now cause theres a hedge of em all down the path and front wall its a real pretty place bab and betty play there and so do i  ben could not restrain a chuckle at the recollection of his first appearance there and as if his merriment or his words interested her the lady said pleasantly  tell me all about it  are bab and betty your sisters quite forgetting his intended tramp ben plunged into a copious history of himself and newmade friends led on by a kind look an inquiring word and sympathetic smile till he had told every thing at the schoolhouse corner he stopped and said spreading his arms like a signpost  thats the way to the laylocks and this is the way to the squires  as im in a hurry to see the old house ill go this way first if you will be kind enough to give my love to mrs morris and tell the squire miss celia is coming to dine with him i wont say goodby because i shall see you again  with a nod and a smile the young lady cantered away and ben hurried up the hill to deliver his message feeling as if something pleasant was going to happen so it would be wise to defer running away for the present at least  at one oclock miss celia arrived and ben had the delight of helping pat stable pretty chevalita then his own dinner hastily eaten he fell to work at the detested woodpile with sudden energy for as he worked he could steal peeps into the diningroom and see the curly brown head between the two gay ones as the three sat round the table he could not help hearing a word now and then as the windows were open and these bits of conversation filled him with curiosity for the names thorny celia and george were often repeated and an occasional merry laugh from the young lady sounded like music in that usually quiet place  when dinner was over bens industrious fit left him and he leisurely trundled his barrow to and fro till the guest departed there was no chance for him to help now since pat anxious to get whatever trifle might be offered for his services was quite devoted in his attentions to the mare and her mistress till she was mounted and off but miss celia did not forget her little guide and spying a wistful face behind the woodpile paused at the gate and beckoned with that winning smile of hers if ten pats had stood scowling in the way ben would have defied them all and vaulting over the fence he ran up with a shining face hoping she wanted some last favor of him leaning down miss celia slipped a new quarter into his hand saying  lita wants me to give you this for taking the stone out of her foot  thank y maam i liked to do it for i hate to see em limp specially such a pretty one as she is answered ben stroking the glossy neck with a loving touch  the squire says you know a good deal about horses so i suppose you understand the houyhnhnm language im learning it and it is very nice laughed miss celia as chevalita gave a little whinny and snuffled her nose into bens pocket  no miss i never went to school  that is not taught there  ill bring you a book all about it when i come back mr gulliver went to the horsecountry and heard the dear things speak their own tongue  my father has been on the prairies where theres lots of wild ones but he didnt hear em speak i know what they want without talkin answered ben suspecting a joke but not exactly seeing what it was  i dont doubt it but i wont forget the book goodby my lad we shall soon meet again and away went miss celia as if she were in a hurry to get back  if she only had a red habit and a streamin white feather shed look as fine as melia used to she is most as kind and rides most as well wonder where shes goin to hope she will come soon thought ben watching till the last flutter of the blue habit vanished round the corner and then he went back to his work with his head full of the promised book pausing now and then to chink the two silver halves and the new quarter together in his pocket wondering what he should buy with this vast sum  bab and betty meantime had had a most exciting day for when they went home at noon they found the pretty lady there and she had talked to them like an old friend given them a ride on the little horse and kissed them both goodby when they went back to school in the afternoon the lady was gone the old house all open and their mother sweeping airing in great spirits so they had a splendid frolic tumbling on featherbeds beating bits of carpet opening closets and racing from garret to cellar like a pair of distracted kittens  here ben found them and was at once overwhelmed with a burst of news which excited him as much as it did them miss celia owned the house was coming to liver there and things were to be made ready as soon as possible all thought the prospect a charming one mrs moss because life had been dull for her during the year she had taken charge of the old house the little girls had heard rumors of various pets who were coming and ben learning that a boy and a donkey were among them resolved that nothing but the arrival of his father should tear him from this now deeply interesting spot  im in such a hurry to see the peacocks and hear them scream she said they did and that wed laugh when old jack brayed cried bab hopping about on one foot to work off her impatience  is a faytun a kind of a bird i heard her say she could keep it in the coachhouse asked betty inquiringly  its a little carriage and ben rolled in the grass much tickled at poor bettys ignorance  of course it is  i looked it out in the dic and you mustnt call it a payton though it is spelt with a p added bab who liked to lay down the law on all occasions and did not mention that she had looked vainly among the vs till a schoolmate set her right  you cant tell me much about carriages  but what i want to know is where lita will stay said ben  oh shes to be up at the squires till things are fixed and you are to bring her down squire came and told ma all about it and said you were a boy to be trusted for he had tried you  ben made no answer but secretly thanked his stars that he had not proved himself untrustworthy by running away and so missing all this fun  wont it be fine to have the house open all the time  we can run over and see the pictures and books whenever we like i know we can miss celia is so kind began betty who cared for these things more than for screaming peacocks and comical donkeys  not unless you are invited answered their mother locking the front door behind her youd better begin to pick up your duds right away for she wont want them cluttering round her front yard if you are not too tired ben you might rake round a little while i shut the blinds i want things to look nice and tidy  two little groans went up from two afflicted little girls as they looked about them at the shady bower the dear porch and the winding walks where they loved to run till their hair whistled in the wind as the fairybooks say  whatever shall we do  our attic is so hot and the shed so small and the yard always full of hens or clothes we shall have to pack all our things away and never play any more said bab tragically  may be ben could build us a little house in the orchard proposed betty who firmly believed that ben could do any thing  he wont have any time  boys dont care for babyhouses returned bab collecting her homeless goods and chattels with a dismal face  we shant want these much when all the new things come see if we do said cheerful little betty who always found out a silver lining to every cloud    chapter viii  miss celias man  ben was not too tired and the clearingup began that very night  none too soon for in a day or two things arrived to the great delight of the children who considered moving a most interesting play first came the phaeton which ben spent all his leisure moments in admiring wondering with secret envy what happy boy would ride in the little seat up behind and beguiling his tasks by planning how when he got rich he would pass his time driving about in just such an equipage and inviting all the boys he met to have a ride  then a load of furniture came creaking in at the lodge gate and the girls had raptures over a cottage piano several small chairs and a little low table which they pronounced just the thing for them to play at the live stock appeared next creating a great stir in the neighborhood for peacocks were rare birds there the donkeys bray startled the cattle and convulsed the people with laughter the rabbits were continually getting out to burrow in the newly made garden and chevalita scandalized old duke by dancing about the stable which he had inhabited for years in stately solitude  last but by no means least miss celia her young brother and two maids arrived one evening so late that only mrs moss went over to help them settle the children were much disappointed but were appeased by a promise that they should all go to pay their respects in the morning  they were up so early and were so impatient to be off that mrs  moss let them go with the warning that they would find only the servants astir she was mistaken however for as the procession approached a voice from the porch called out goodmorning little neighbors so unexpectedly that bab nearly spilt the new milk she carried betty gave such a start that the freshlaid eggs quite skipped in the dish and bens face broke into a broad grin over the armful of clover which he brought for the bunnies as he bobbed his head saying briskly  shes all right miss lita is and i can bring her over any minute you say  i shall want her at four oclock  thorny will be too tired to drive but i must hear from the postoffice rain or shine and miss celias pretty color brightened as she spoke either from some happy thought or because she was bashful for the honest young faces before her plainly showed their admiration of the whitegowned lady under the honeysuckles  the appearance of miranda the maid reminded the children of their errand and having delivered their offerings they were about to retire in some confusion when miss celia said pleasantly  i want to thank you for helping put things in such nice order  i see signs of busy hands and feet both inside the house and all about the grounds and i am very much obliged  i raked the beds said ben proudly eying the neat ovals and circles  i swept all the paths added bab with a reproachful glance at several green sprigs fallen from the load of clover on the smooth walk  i cleared up the porch and bettys clean pinafore rose and fell with a long sigh as she surveyed the late summer residence of her exiled family miss celia guessed the meaning of that sigh and made haste to turn it into a smile by asking anxiously  what has become of the playthings i dont see them anywhere  ma said you wouldnt want our duds round so we took them all home answered betty with a wistful face  but i do want them round  i like dolls and toys almost as much as ever and quite miss the little duds from porch and path suppose you come to tea with me tonight and bring some of them back i should be very sorry to rob you of your pleasant playplace  oh yes m wed love to come and well bring our best things  ma always lets us have our shiny pitchers and the china poodle when we go visiting or have company at home said bab and betty both speaking at once  bring what you like and ill hunt up my toys too ben is to come also and his poodle is especially invited added miss celia as sancho came and begged before her feeling that some agreeable project was under discussion  thank you miss  i told them youd be willing they should come sometimes they like this place ever so much and so do i said ben feeling that few spots combined so many advantages in the way of climbable trees arched gates halfadozen gables and other charms suited to the taste of an aspiring youth who had been a flying cupid at the age of seven  so do i echoed miss celia heartily  ten years ago i came here a little girl and made lilac chains under these very bushes and picked chickweed over there for my bird and rode thorny in his babywagon up and down these paths grandpa lived here then and we had fine times but now they are all gone except us two  we havent got any father either said bab for something in miss celias face made her feel as if a cloud had come over the sun  i have a firstrate father if i only knew where hed gone to said ben looking down the path as eagerly as if one waited for him behind the locked gate  you are a rich boy and you are happy little girls to have so good a mother ive found that out already and the sun shone again as the young lady nodded to the neat rosy children before her  you may have a piece of her if you want to cause you havent got any of your own said betty with a pitiful look which made her blue eyes as sweet as two wet violets  so i will and you shall be my little sisters  i never had any and id love to try how it seems and celia took both the chubby hands in hers feeling ready to love every one this first bright morning in the new home which she hoped to make a very happy one  bab gave a satisfied nod and fell to examining the rings upon the white hand that held her own but betty put her arms about the new friends neck and kissed her so softly that the hungry feeling in miss celias heart felt better directly for this was the food it wanted and thorny had not learned yet to return one half of the affection he received holding the child close she played with the yellow braids while she told them about the little german girls in their funny blacksilk caps shortwaisted gowns and wooden shoes whom she used to see watering long webs of linen bleaching on the grass watching great flocks of geese or driving pigs to market knitting or spinning as they went  presently randa as she called her stout maid came to tell her that master thorny couldnt wait another minute and she went in to breakfast with a good appetite while the children raced home to bounce in upon mrs moss talking all at once like little lunatics  the phaeton at fourso sweet in a beautiful white gowngoing to tea and sancho and all the baby things invited cant we wear our sunday frocks a splendid new net for lita and she likes dolls goody goody wont it be fun  with much difficulty their mother got a clear account of the approaching festivity out of the eager mouths and with still more difficulty got breakfast into them for the children had few pleasures and this brilliant prospect rather turned their heads  bab and betty thought the day would never end and cheered the long hours by expatiating on the pleasures in store for them till their playmates were much afflicted because they were not going also at noon their mother kept them from running over to the old house lest they should be in the way so they consoled themselves by going to the syringa bush at the corner and sniffing the savory odors which came from the kitchen where katy the cook was evidently making nice things for tea  ben worked as if for a wager till four then stood over pat while he curried lita till her coat shone like satin then drove her gently down to the coachhouse where he had the satisfaction of harnessing her all his own self  shall i go round to the great gate and wait for you there miss he asked when all was ready looking up at the porch where the young lady stood watching him as she put on her gloves  no ben the great gate is not to be opened till next october i shall go in and out by the lodge and leave the avenue to grass and dandelions meantime answered miss celia as she stepped in and took the reins with a sudden smile  but she did not start even when ben had shaken out the new duster and laid it neatly over her knees  isnt it all right now asked the boy anxiously  not quite i need one thing more  cant you guess what it is and miss celia watched his anxious face as his eyes wandered from the tips of litas ears to the hindwheel of the phaeton trying to discover what had been omitted  no miss i dont see he began much mortified to think he had forgotten any thing  wouldnt a little groom up behind improve the appearance of my turnout she said with a look which left no doubt in his mind that he was to be the happy boy to occupy that proud perch  he grew red with pleasure but stammered as he hesitated looking down at his bare feet and blue shirt  i aint fit miss and i havent got any other clothes  miss celia only smiled again more kindly than before and answered in a tone which he understood better than her wordsa great man said his coatofarms was a pair of shirtsleeves and a sweet poet sang about a barefooted boy so i need not be too proud to ride with one up with you ben my man and let us be off or we shall be late for our party  with one bound the new groom was in his place sitting very erect with his legs stiff arms folded and nose in the air as he had seen real grooms sit behind their masters in fine dogcarts or carriages mrs moss nodded as they drove past the lodge and ben touched his torn hatbrim in the most dignified manner though he could not suppress a broad grin of delight which deepened into a chuckle when lita went off at a brisk trot along the smooth road toward town  it takes so little to make a child happy it is a pity grown people do not oftener remember it and scatter little bits of pleasure before the small people as they throw crumbs to the hungry sparrows miss celia knew the boy was pleased but he had no words in which to express his gratitude for the great contentment she had given him he could only beam at all he met smile when the floating ends of the gray veil blew against his face and long in his heart to give the new friend a boyish hug as he used to do his dear melia when she was very good to him  school was just out as they passed and it was a spectacle i assure you to see the boys and girls stare at ben up aloft in such state also to see the superb indifference with which that young man regarded the vulgar herd who went afoot he couldnt resist an affable nod to bab and betty for they stood under the mapletree and the memory of their circulating library made him forget his dignity in his gratitude  we will take them next time but now i want to talk to you began miss celia as lita climbed the hill my brother has been ill and i have brought him here to get well i want to do all sorts of things to amuse him and i think you can help me in many ways would you like to work for me instead of the squire  i guess i would ejaculated ben so heartily that no further assurances were needed and miss celia went on well pleased  you see poor thorny is weak and fretful and does not like to exert himself though he ought to be out a great deal and kept from thinking of his little troubles he cannot walk much yet so i have a wheeled chair to push him in and the paths are so hard it will be easy to roll him about that will be one thing you can do another is to take care of his pets till he is able to do it himself then you can tell him your adventures and talk to him as only a boy can talk to a boy that will amuse him when i want to write or go out but i never leave him long and hope he will soon be running about as well as the rest of us how does that sort of work look to you  firstrate ill take real good care of the little feller and do every thing i know to please him and so will sanch hes fond of children answered ben heartily for the new place looked very inviting to him miss celia laughed and rather damped his ardor by her next words  i dont know what thorny would say to hear you call him  little he is fourteen and appears to get taller and taller every day he seems like a child to me because i am nearly ten years older than he is but you neednt be afraid of his long legs and big eyes he is too feeble to do any harm only you mustnt mind if he orders you about  im used to that i dont mind it if he wont call me a spalpeen and fire things at me said ben thinking of his late trials with pat  i can promise that and i am sure thorny will like you for i told him your story and he is anxious to see the circus boy as he called you squire allen says i may trust you and i am glad to do so for it saves me much trouble to find what i want all ready for me you shall be well fed and clothed kindly treated and honestly paid if you like to stay with me  i know i shall like ittill father comes anyway squire wrote to smithers right off but hasnt got any answer yet i know they are on the go now so may be we wont hear for ever so long answered ben feeling less impatient to be off than before this fine proposal was made to him  i dare say meantime we will see how we get on together and perhaps your father will be willing leave you for the summer if he is away now show me the bakers the candyshop and the postoffice said miss celia as they rattled down the main street of the village  ben made himself useful and when all the other errands were done received his reward in the shape of a new pair of shoes and a straw hat with a streaming blue ribbon on the ends of which shone silvery anchors he was also allowed to drive home while his new mistress read her letters one particularly long one with a queer stamp on the envelope she read twice never speaking a word till they got back then ben was sent off with lita and the squires letters promising to get his chores done in time for tea    chapter ix  a happy tea  exactly five minutes before six the party arrived in great state for bab and betty wore their best frocks and hairribbons ben had a new blue shirt and his shoes on as fulldress and sanchos curls were nicely brushed his frills as white as if just done up  no one was visible to receive them but the low table stood in the middle of the walk with four chairs and a footstool around it a pretty set of green and white china caused the girls to cast admiring looks upon the little cups and plates while ben eyed the feast longingly and sancho with difficulty restrained himself from repeating his former naughtiness no wonder the dog sniffed and the children smiled for there was a noble display of little tarts and cakes little biscuits and sandwiches a pretty milkpitcher shaped like a white calla rising out of its green leaves and a jolly little teakettle singing away over the spiritlamp as cosily as you please  isnt it perfectly lovely whispered betty who had never seen any thing like it before  i just wish sally could see us now answered bab who had not yet forgiven her enemy  wonder where the boy is added ben feeling as good as any one but rather doubtful how others might regard him  here a rumbling sound caused the guests to look toward the garden and in a moment miss celia appeared pushing a wheeled chair in which sat her brother a gay afghan covered the long legs a broadbrimmed hat half hid the big eyes and a discontented expression made the thin face as unattractive as the fretful voice which said complainingly  if they make a noise ill go in  dont see what you asked them for  to amuse you dear  i know they will if you will only try to like them whispered the sister smiling and nodding over the chairback as she came on adding aloud such a punctual party i am all ready however and we will sit down at once this is my brother thornton and we are all going to be very good friends byandby here s the droll dog thorny isnt he nice and curly  now ben had heard what the other boy said and made up his mind that he shouldnt like him and thorny had decided beforehand that he wouldnt play with a tramp even if he cut capers go both looked decidedly cool and indifferent when miss celia introduced them but sancho had better manners and no foolish pride he therefore set them a good example by approaching the chair with his tail waving like a flag of truce and politely presented his ruffled paw for a hearty shake  thorny could not resist that appeal and patted the white head with a friendly look into the affectionate eyes of the dog saying to his sister as he did so  what a wise old fellow he is it seems as if he could almost speak doesnt it  he can  say how do you do sanch commanded ben relenting at once for he saw admiration in thornys face  wow wow wow remarked sancho in a mild and conversational tone sitting up and touching one paw to his head as if he saluted by taking off his hat thorny laughed in spite of himself and miss celia seeing that the ice was broken wheeled him to his place at the foot of the table then seating the little girls on one side ben and the dog on the other took the head herself and told her guests to begin bab and betty were soon chattering away to their pleasant hostess as freely as if they had known her for months but the boys were still rather shy and made sancho the medium through which they addressed one another the excellent beast behaved with wonderful propriety sitting upon his cushion in an attitude of such dignity that it seemed almost a liberty to offer him food a dish of thick sandwiches had been provided for his especial refreshment and as ben from time to time laid one on his plate he affected entire unconsciousness of it till the word was given when it vanished at one gulp and sancho again appeared absorbed in deep thought  but having once tasted of this pleasing delicacy it was very hard to repress his longing for more and in spite of all his efforts his nose would work his eye kept a keen watch upon that particular dish and his tail quivered with excitement as it lay like a train over the red cushion at last a moment came when temptation proved too strong for him ben was listening to something miss celia said a tart lay unguarded upon his plate sanch looked at thorny who was watching him thorny nodded sanch gave one wink bolted the tart and then gazed pensively up at a sparrow swinging on a twig overhead  the slyness of the rascal tickled the boy so much that he pushed back his hat clapped his hands and burst out laughing as he had not done before for weeks every one looked round surprised and sancho regarded them with a mildly inquiring air as if he said why this unseemly mirth my friends  thorny forgot both sulks and shyness after that and suddenly began to talk ben was flattered by his interest in the dear dog and opened out so delightfully that he soon charmed the other by his lively tales of circuslife then miss celia felt relieved and every thing went splendidly especially the food for the plates were emptied several times the little teapot ran dry twice and the hostess was just wondering if she ought to stop her voracious guests when something occurred which spared her that painful task  a small boy was suddenly discovered standing in the path behind them regarding the company with an air of solemn interest a pretty welldressed child of six with dark hair cut short across the brow a rosy face a stout pair of legs left bare by the socks which had slipped down over the dusty little shoes one end of a wide sash trailed behind him a straw hat hung at his back his right hand firmly grasped a small turtle and his left a choice collection of sticks before miss celia could speak the stranger calmly announced his mission  i have come to see the peacocks  you shall presently began miss celia but got no further for the child added coming a step nearer  and the wabbits  yes but first wont you  and the curly dog continued the small voice as another step brought the resolute young personage nearer  there he is  a pause a long look then a new demand with the same solemn tone the same advance  i wish to hear the donkey bray  certainly if he will  and the peacocks scream  any thing more sir  having reached the table by this time the insatiable infant surveyed its ravaged surface then pointed a fat little finger at the last cake left for manners and said commandingly  i will have some of that  help yourself and sit upon the step to eat it while you tell me whose boy you are said miss celia much amused at his proceedings  deliberately putting down his sticks the child took the cake and composing himself upon the step answered with his rosy mouth full  i am papas boy  he makes a paper  i help him a great deal  what is his name  mr barlow  we live in springfield volunteered the new guest unbending a trifle thanks to the charms of the cake  have you a mamma dear  she takes naps  i go to walk then  without leave i suspect  have you no brothers or sisters to go with you asked miss celia wondering where the little runaway belonged  i have two brothers thomas merton barlow and harry sanford barlow  i am alfred tennyson barlow we dont have any girls in our house only bridget  dont you go to school  the boys do  i dont learn any greeks and latins yet  i dig and read to mamma and make poetrys for her  couldnt you make some for me  im very fond of poetrys proposed miss celia seeing that this prattle amused the children  i guess i couldnt make any now i made some coming along  i will say it to you and crossing his short legs the inspired babe half said half sung the following poem 1      sweet are the flowers of life     swept oer my happy days at home     sweet are the flowers of life     when i was a little child      sweet are the flowers of life     that i spent with my father at home     sweet are the flowers of life     when children played about the house      sweet are the flowers of life     when the lamps are lighted at night     sweet are the flowers of life     when the flowers of summer bloomed      sweet are the flowers of life     dead with the snows of winter     sweet are the flowers of life     when the days of spring come on  1 these lines were actually composed by a sixyear old child   thats all of that one  i made another one when i digged after the turtle i will say that it is a very pretty one observed the poet with charming candor and taking a long breath he tuned his little lyre afresh      sweet sweet days are passing     oer my happy home     passing on swift wings through the valley of life     cold are the days when winter comes again     when my sweet days were passing at my happy home     sweet were the days on the rivulets green brink     sweet were the days when i read my fathers books     sweet were the winter days when bright fires are blazing  bless the baby where did he get all that exclaimed miss celia amazed while the children giggled as tennyson jr took a bite at the turtle instead of the halfeaten cake and then to prevent further mistakes crammed the unhappy creature into a diminutive pocket in the most businesslike way imaginable  it comes out of my head  i make lots of them began the imperturbable one yielding more and more to the social influences of the hour  here are the peacocks coming to be fed interrupted bab as the handsome birds appeared with their splendid plumage glittering in the sun  young barlow rose to admire but his thirst for knowledge was not yet quenched and he was about to request a song from juno and jupiter when old jack pining for society put his head over the garden wall with a tremendous bray  this unexpected sound startled the inquiring stranger half out of his wits for a moment the stout legs staggered and the solemn countenance lost its composure as he whispered with an astonished air  is that the way peacocks scream  the children were in fits of laughter and miss celia could hardly make herself heard as she answered merrily  no dear that is the donkey asking you to come and see him will you go  i guess i couldnt stop now mamma might want me  and without another word the discomfited poet precipitately retired leaving his cherished sticks behind him  ben ran after the child to see that he came to no harm and presently returned to report that alfred had been met by a servant and gone away chanting a new verse of his poem in which peacocks donkeys and the flowers of life were sweetly mingled  now ill show you my toys and well have a little play before it gets too late for thorny to stay with us said miss celia as randa carried away the teathings and brought back a large tray full of picturebooks dissected maps puzzles games and several pretty models of animals the whole crowned with a large doll dressed as a baby  at sight of that betty stretched out her arms to receive it with a cry of delight bab seized the games and ben was lost in admiration of the little arab chief prancing on the white horseall saddled and bridled and fit for the fight thorny poked about to find a certain curious puzzle which he could put together without a mistake after long study even sancho found something to interest him and standing on his hindlegs thrust his head between the boys to paw at several red and blue letters on square blocks  he looks as if he knew them said thorny amused at the dogs eager whine and scratch  he does  spell your name sanch and ben put all the gay letters down upon the flags with a chirrup which set the dogs tail to wagging as he waited till the alphabet was spread before him then with great deliberation he pushed the letters about till he had picked out six these he arranged with nose and paw till the word sancho lay before him correctly spelt  isnt that clever  can he do any more cried thorny delighted  lots thats the way he gets his livin and mine too answered ben and proudly put his poodle through his welllearned lessons with such success that even miss celia was surprised  he has been carefully trained  do you know how it was done she asked when sancho lay down to rest and be caressed by the children  no m father did it when i was a little chap and never told me how i used to help teach him to dance and that was easy enough he is so smart father said the middle of the night was the best time to give him his lessons it was so still then and nothing disturbed sanch and made him forget i cant do half the tricks but im goin to learn when father comes back hed rather have me show off sanch than ride till im older  i have a charming book about animals and in it an interesting account of some trained poodles who could do the most wonderful things would you like to hear it while you put your maps and puzzles together asked miss celia glad to keep her brother interested in their fourfooted guest at least  yesm yesm answered the children and fetching the book she read the pretty account shortening and simplifying it here and there to suit her hearers  i invited the two dogs to dine and spend the evening and they came with their master who was a frenchman he had been a teacher in a deaf and dumb school and thought he would try the same plan with dogs he had also been a conjurer and now was supported by blanche and her daughter lyda these dogs behaved at dinner just like other dogs but when i gave blanche a bit of cheese and asked if she knew the word for it her master said she could spell it so a table was arranged with a lamp on it and round the table were laid the letters of the alphabet painted on cards blanche sat in the middle waiting till her master told her to spell cheese which she at once did in french f r o m a g e then she translated a word for us very cleverly some one wrote pferd the german for horse on a slate blanche looked at it and pretended to read it putting by the slate with her paw when she had done now give us the french for that word said the man and she instantly brought cheval now as you are at an englishmans house give it to us in english and she brought me horse then we spelt some words wrong and she corrected them with wonderful accuracy but she did not seem to like it and whined and growled and looked so worried that she was allowed to go and rest and eat cakes in a corner  then lyda took her place on the table and did sums on the slate with a set of figures also mental arithmetic which was very pretty now lyda said her master i want to see if you understand division suppose you had ten bits of sugar and you met ten prussian dogs how many lumps would you a french dog give to each of the prussians lyda very decidedly replied to this with a cipher but suppose you divided your sugar with me how many lumps would you give me lyda took up the figure five and politely presented it to her master  wasnt she smart sanch cant do that exclaimed ben forced to own that the french doggie beat his cherished pet  he is not too old to learn  shall i go on asked miss celia seeing that the boys liked it though betty was absorbed with the doll and bab deep in a puzzle  oh yes  what else did they do  they played a game of dominoes together sitting in chairs opposite each other and touched the dominoes that were wanted but the man placed them and kept telling how the game went lyda was beaten and hid under the sofa evidently feeling very badly about it blanche was then surrounded with playingcards while her master held another pack and told us to choose a card then he asked her what one had been chosen and she always took up the right one in her teeth i was asked to go into another room put a light on the floor with cards round it and leave the doors nearly shut then the man begged some one to whisper in the dogs ear what card she was to bring and she went at once and fetched it thus showing that she understood their names lyda did many tricks with the numbers so curious that no dog could possibly understand them yet what the secret sign was i could not discover but suppose it must have been in the tones of the masters voice for he certainly made none with either head or hands  it took an hour a day for eighteen months to educate a dog enough to appear in public and as you say ben the night was the best time to give the lessons soon after this visit the master died and these wonderful dogs were sold because their mistress did not know how to exhibit them  wouldnt i have liked to see em and find out how they were taught sanch youll have to study up lively for im not going to have you beaten by french dogs said ben shaking his finger so sternly that sancho grovelled at his feet and put both paws over his eyes in the most abject manner  is there a picture of those smart little poodles asked ben eying the book which miss celia left open before her  not of them but of other interesting creatures also anecdotes about horses which will please you i know and she turned the pages for him neither guessing how much good mr hamertons charming chapters on animals were to do the boy when he needed comfort for a sorrow which was very near    chapter x  a heavy trouble  thank you maam thats a tiptop book specially the pictures  but i cant bear to see these poor fellows and ben brooded over the fine etching of the dead and dying horses on a battlefield one past all further pain the other helpless but lifting his head from his dead master to neigh a farewell to the comrades who go galloping away in a cloud of dust  they ought to stop for him some of em muttered ben hastily turning back to the cheerful picture of the three happy horses in the field standing kneedeep among the grass as they prepare to drink at the wide stream  aint that black one a beauty  seems as if i could see his mane blow in the wind and hear him whinny to that small feller trotting down to see if he cant get over and be sociable how id like to take a rousin run round that meadow on the whole lot of em and ben swayed about in his chair as if he was already doing it in imagination  you may take a turn round my field on lita any day  she would like it and thornys saddle will be here next week said miss celia pleased to see that the boy appreciated the fine pictures and felt such hearty sympathy with the noble animals whom she dearly loved herself  neednt wait for that  id rather ride bareback oh i say is this the book you told about where the horses talked asked ben suddenly recollecting the speech he had puzzled over ever since he heard it  no i brought the book but in the hurry of my teaparty forgot to unpack it ill hunt it up tonight remind me thorny  there now ive forgotten something too squire sent you a letter and im having such a jolly time i never thought of it  ben rummaged out the note with remorseful haste protesting that he was in no hurry for mr gulliver and very glad to save him for another day leaving the young folks busy with their games miss celia sat in the porch to read her letters for there were two and as she read her face grew so sober then so sad that if any one had been looking he would have wondered what bad news had chased away the sunshine so suddenly no one did look no one saw how pitifully her eyes rested on bens happy face when the letters were put away and no one minded the new gentleness in her manner as she came back to the table but ben thought there never was so sweet a lady as the one who leaned over him to show him how the dissected map went together and never smiled at his mistakes  so kind so very kind was she to them all that when after an hour of merry play she took her brother in to bed the three who remained fell to praising her enthusiastically as they put things to rights before taking leave  shes like the good fairies in the books and has all sorts of nice pretty things in her house said betty enjoying a last hug of the fascinating doll whose lids would shut so that it was a pleasure to sing bye sweet baby bye with no staring eyes to spoil the illusion  what heaps she knows  more than teacher i do believe and she doesnt mind how many questions we ask i like folks that will tell me things added bab whose inquisitive mind was always hungry  i like that boy firstrate and i guess he likes me though i didnt know where nantucket ought to go he wants me to teach him to ride when hes on his pins again and miss celia says i may she knows how to make folks feel good dont she and ben gratefully surveyed the arab chief now his own though the best of all the collection  wont we have splendid times  she says we may come over every night and play with her and thorny  and shes goin to have the seats in the porch lift up so we can put our things in there all day and have em handy  and im going to be her boy and stay here all the time i guess the letter i brought was a recommend from the squire  yes ben and if i had not already made up my mind to keep you before i certainly would now my boy  something in miss celias voice as she said the last two words with her hand on bens shoulder made him look up quickly and turn red with pleasure wondering what the squire had written about him  mother must have some of the party so you shall take her these bab and betty may carry baby home for the night she is so nicely asleep it is a pity to wake her good by till tomorrow little neighbors continued miss celia and dismissed the girls with a kiss  is ben coming too asked bab as betty trotted off in a silent rapture with the big darling bobbing over her shoulder  not yet ive several things to settle with my new man  tell mother he will come byandby  off rushed bab with the plateful of goodies and drawing ben down beside her on the wide step miss celia took out the letters with a shadow creeping over her face as softly as the twilight was stealing over the world while the dew fell and every thing grew still and dim  ben dear ive something to tell you she began slowly and the boy waited with a happy face for no one had called him so since melia died  the squire has heard about your father and this is the letter mr smithers sends  hooray where is he please cried ben wishing she would hurry up for miss celia did not even offer him the letter but sat looking down at sancho on the lower step as if she wanted him to come and help her he went after the mustangs and sent some home but could not come himself  went further on i spose  yes he said he might go as far as california and if he did hed send for me id like to go there its a real splendid place they say  he has gone further away than that to a lovelier country than california i hope and miss celias eyes turned to the deep sky where early stars were shining  didnt he send for me  wheres he gone when s he coming back asked ben quickly for there was a quiver in her voice the meaning of which he felt before he understood  miss celia put her arms about him and answered very tenderlyben dear if i were to tell you that he was never coming back could you bear it  i guess i couldbut you dont mean it  oh maam he isnt dead cried ben with a cry that made her heart ache and sancho leap up with a bark  my poor little boy i wish i could say no  there was no need of any more words no need of tears or kind arms around him he knew he was an orphan now and turned instinctively to the old friend who loved him best throwing himself down beside his dog ben clung about the curly neck sobbing bitterly  oh sanch hes never coming back again never never any more  poor sancho could only whine and lick away the tears that wet the halfhidden face questioning the new friend meantime with eyes so full of dumb love and sympathy and sorrow that they seemed almost human wiping away her own tears miss celia stooped to pat the white head and to stroke the black one lying so near it that the dogs breast was the boys pillow presently the sobbing ceased and ben whispered without looking up  tell me all about it ill be good  then as kindly as she could miss celia read the brief letter which told the hard news bluntly for mr smithers was obliged to confess that he had known the truth months before and never told the boy lest he should be unfitted for the work they gave him of ben brown the elders death there was little to tell except that he was killed in some wild place at the west and a stranger wrote the fact to the only person whose name was found in bens pocketbook mr smithers offered to take the boy back and do well by him averring that the father wished his son to remain where he left him and follow the profession to which he was trained  will you go ben asked miss celia hoping to distract his mind from his grief by speaking of other things  no no id rather tramp and starve  hes awful hard to me and sanch and hed be worse now fathers gone dont send me back let me stay here folks are good to me theres nowhere else to go and the head ben had lifted up with a desperate sort of look went down again on sanchos breast as if there were no other refuge left  you shall stay here and no one shall take you away against your will i called you my boy in play now you shall be my boy in earnest this shall be your home and thorny your brother we are orphans too and we will stand by one another till a stronger friend comes to help us said miss celia with such a mixture of resolution and tenderness in her voice that ben felt comforted at once and thanked her by laying his cheek against the pretty slipper that rested on the step beside him as if he had no words in which to swear loyalty to the gentle mistress whom he meant henceforth to serve with grateful fidelity  sancho felt that he must follow suit and gravely put his paw upon her knee with a low whine as if he said count me in and let me help to pay my masters debt if i can  miss celia shook the offered paw cordially and the good creature crouched at her feet like a small lion bound to guard her and her house for evermore  dont lie on that cold stone ben come here and let me try to comfort you she said stooping to wipe away the great drops that kept rolling down the brown cheek half hidden in her dress but ben put his arm over his face and sobbed out with a fresh burst of grief  you cant you didnt know him  oh daddy daddy if id only seen you jest once more  no one could grant that wish but miss celia did comfort him for presently the sound of music floated out from the parlormusic so soft so sweet that involuntarily the boy stopped his crying to listen then quieter tears dropped slowly seeming to soothe his pain as they fell while the sense of loneliness passed away and it grew possible to wait till it was time to go to father in that faroff country lovelier than golden california  how long she played miss celia never minded but when she stole out to see if ben had gone she found that other friends even kinder than herself had taken the boy into their gentle keeping the wind had sung a lullaby among the rustling lilacs the moons mild face looked through the leafy arch to kiss the heavy eyelids and faithful sancho still kept guard beside his little master who with his head pillowed on his arm lay fast asleep dreaming happily that daddy had come home again    chapter xi  sunday  mrs moss woke ben with a kiss next morning for her heart yearned over the fatherless lad as if he had been her own and she had no other way of showing her sympathy ben had forgotten his troubles in sleep but the memory of them returned as soon as he opened his eyes heavy with the tears they had shed he did not cry any more but felt strange and lonely till he called sancho and told him all about it for he was shy even with kind mrs moss and glad when she went away  sancho seemed to understand that his master was in trouble and listened to the sad little story with gurgles of interest whines of condolence and intelligent barks whenever the word daddy was uttered he was only a brute but his dumb affection comforted the boy more than any words for sanch had known and loved father almost as long and well as his son and that seemed to draw them closely together now they were left alone  we must put on mourning old feller  its the proper thing and theres nobody else to do it now said ben as he dressed remembering how all the company wore bits of crape somewhere about them at melias funeral  it was a real sacrifice of boyish vanity to take the blue ribbon with its silver anchors off the new hat and replace it with the dingy black band from the old one but ben was quite sincere in doing this though doubtless his theatrical life made him think of the effect more than other lads would have done he could find nothing in his limited wardrobe with which to decorate sanch except a black cambric pocket it was already half torn out of his trousers with the weight of nails pebbles and other light trifles so he gave it a final wrench and tied it into the dogs collar saying to himself as he put away his treasures with a sigh  one pocket is enough i shant want anything but a hankchif today  fortunately that article of dress was clean for he had but one and with this somewhat ostentatiously drooping from the solitary pocket the serious hat upon his head the new shoes creaking mournfully and sanch gravely following much impressed with his black bow the chief mourner descended feeling that he had done his best to show respect to the dead  mrs mosss eyes filled as she saw the rusty band and guessed why it was there but she found it difficult to repress a smile when she beheld the cambric symbol of woe on the dogs neck not a word was said to disturb the boys comfort in these poor attempts however and he went out to do his chores conscious that he was an object of interest to his friends especially so to bab and betty who having been told of bens loss now regarded him with a sort of pitying awe very grateful to his feelings  i want you to drive me to church byandby it is going to be pretty warm and thorny is hardly strong enough to venture yet said miss celia when ben ran over after breakfast to see if she had any thing for him to do for he considered her his mistress now though he was not to take possession of his new quarters till the morrow  yes m id like to if i look well enough answered ben pleased to be asked but impressed with the idea that people had to be very fine on such occasions  you will do very well when i have given you a touch god doesnt mind our clothes ben and the poor are as welcome as the rich to him you have not been much have you asked miss celia anxious to help the boy and not quite sure how to begin  no m our folks didnt hardly ever go and father was so tired he used to rest sundays or go off in the woods with me  a little quaver came into bens voice as he spoke and a sudden motion made his hatbrim hide his eyes for the thought of the happy times that would never come any more was almost too much for him  that was a pleasant way to rest i often do so and we will go to the grove this afternoon and try it but i have to go to church in the morning it seems to start me right for the week and if one has a sorrow that is the place where one can always find comfort will you come and try it ben dear  id do any thing to please you muttered ben without looking up for though he felt her kindness to the bottom of his heart he did wish that no one would talk about father for a little while it was so hard to keep from crying and he hated to be a baby  miss celia seemed to understand for the next thing she said in a very cheerful tone was see what a pretty sight that is when i was a little girl i used to think spiders spun cloth for the fairies and spread it on the grass to bleach  ben stopped digging a hole in the ground with his toe and looked up to see a lovely cobweb like a wheel circle within circle spun across a corner of the arch over the gate tiny drops glittered on every thread as the light shone through the gossamer curtain and a soft breath of air made it tremble as if about to blow it away  its mighty pretty but it will fly off just as the others did  i never saw such a chap as that spider is he keeps on spinning a new one every day for they always get broke and he dont seem to be discouraged a mite said ben glad to change the subject as she knew he would be  that is the way he gets his living he spins his web and waits for his daily breador fly rather and it always comes i fancy byandby you will see that pretty trap full of insects and mr spider will lay up his provisions for the day after that he doesnt care how soon his fine web blows away  i know him hes a handsome feller all black and yellow and lives up in that corner where the shiny sort of hole is he dives down the minute i touch the gate but comes up after ive kept still a minute i like to watch him but he must hate me for i took away a nice green fly and some little millers one day  did you ever hear the story of bruce and his spider most children know and like that said miss celia seeing that he seemed interested  no m i dont know ever so many things most children do answered ben soberly for since he had been among his new friends he had often felt his own deficiencies  ah but you also know many things which they do not half the boys in town would give a great deal to be able to ride and run and leap as you do and even the oldest are not as capable of taking care of themselves as you are your active life has done much in some ways to make a man of you but in other ways it was bad as i think you begin to see now suppose you try to forget the harmful part and remember only the good while learning to be more like our boys who go to school and church and fit themselves to become industrious honest men ben had been looking straight up in miss celias face as she spoke feeling that every word was true though he could not have expressed it if he had tried and when she paused with her bright eyes inquiringly fixed on his he answered heartily  id like to stay here and be respectable for since i came ive found out that folks dont think much of circus riders though they like to go and see em i didnt use to care about school and such things but i do now and i guess hed like it better than to have me knockin round that way without him to look after me  i know he would so we will try benny  i dare say it will seem dull and hard at first after the gay sort of life you have led and you will miss the excitement but it was not good for you and we will do our best to find something safer dont be discouraged and when things trouble you come to me as thorny does and ill try to straighten them out for you ive got two boys now and i want to do my duty by both  before ben had time for more than a grateful look a tumbled head appeared at an upper window and a sleepy voice drawled out  celia  i cant find a bit of a shoestring and i wish youd come and do my necktie  lazy boy come down here and bring one of your black ties with you shoestrings are in the little brown bag on my bureau called back miss celia adding with a laugh as the tumbled head disappeared mumbling something about bothering old bags thorny has been half spoiled since he was ill you mustnt mind his fidgets and dawdling ways hell get over them soon and then i know you two will be good friends  ben had his doubts about that but resolved to do his best for her sake so when master thorny presently appeared with a careless how are you ben that young person answered respectfullyvery well thank you though his nod was as condescending as his new masters because he felt that a boy who could ride bareback and turn a double somersault in the air ought not to knuckle under to a fellow who had not the strength of a pussycat  sailors knot please keeps better so said thorny holding up his chin to have a bluesilk scarf tied to suit him for he was already beginning to be something of a dandy  you ought to wear red till you get more color dear and his sister rubbed her blooming cheek against his pale one as if to lend him some of her own roses  men dont care how they look said thorny squirming out of her hold for he hated to be cuddled before people  oh dont they  here s a vain boy who brushes his hair a dozen times a day and quiddles over his collar till he is so tired he can hardly stand laughed miss celia with a little tweak of his ear  i should like to know what this is for demanded thorny in a dignified tone presenting a black tie  for my other boy  he is going to church with me and miss celia tied a second knot for this young gentleman with a smile that seemed to brighten up even the rusty hatband  well i like that began thorny in a tone that contradicted his words  a look from his sister reminded him of what she had told him half an hour ago and he stopped short understanding now why she was extra good to the little tramp  so do i for you are of no use as a driver yet and i dont like to fasten lita when i have my best gloves on said miss celia in a tone that rather nettled master thorny  is ben going to black my boots before he goes with a glance at the new shoes which caused them to creak uneasily  no he is going to black mine if he will be so kind you wont need boots for a week yet so we wont waste any time over them you will find every thing in the shed ben and at ten you may go for lita  with that miss celia walked her brother off to the diningroom and ben retired to vent his ire in such energetic demonstrations with the blackingbrush that the little boots shone splendidly  he thought he had never seen any thing as pretty as his mistress when an hour later she came out of the house in her white shawl and bonnet holding a book and a late lilyofthevalley in the pearlcolored gloves which he hardly dared to touch as he helped her into the carriage he had seen a good many fine ladies in his life and those he had known had been very gay in the colors of their hats and gowns very fond of cheap jewelry and much given to feathers lace and furbelows so it rather puzzled him to discover why miss celia looked so sweet and elegant in such a simple suit he did not then know that the charm was in the woman not the clothes or that merely living near such a person would do more to give him gentle manners good principles and pure thoughts than almost any other training he could have had but he was conscious that it was pleasant to be there neatly dressed in good company and going to church like a respectable boy somehow the lonely feeling got better as he rolled along between green fields with the june sunshine brightening every thing a restful quiet in the air and a friend beside him who sat silently looking out at the lovely world with what he afterward learned to call her sunday facea soft happy look as if all the work and weariness of the past week were forgotten and she was ready to begin afresh when this blessed day was over  well child what is it she asked catching his eye as he stole a shy glance at her one of many which she had not seen  i was only thinking you looked as if  as if what  dont be afraid she said for ben paused and fumbled at the reins feeling half ashamed to tell his fancy  you were saying prayers he added wishing she had not caught him  so i was  dont you when you are happy  nom  im glad but i dont say any thing  words are not needed but they help sometimes if they are sincere and sweet did you never learn any prayers ben  only now i lay me grandma taught me that when i was a little mite of a boy  i will teach you another the best that was ever made because it says all we need ask  our folks wasnt very pious they didnt have time i spose  i wonder if you know just what it means to be pious  goin to church and readin the bible and sayin prayers and hymns aint it  those things are a part of it but being kind and cheerful doing ones duty helping others and loving god is the best way to show that we are pious in the true sense of the word  then you are and ben looked as if her acts had been a better definition than her words  i try to be but i very often fail so every sunday i make new resolutions and work hard to keep them through the week that is a great help as you will find when you begin to try it  do you think if i said in meetin i wont ever swear any more that i wouldnt do it again asked ben soberly for that was his besetting sin just now  im afraid we cant get rid of our faults quite so easily i wish we could but i do believe that if you keep saying that and trying to stop you will cure the habit sooner than you think  i never did swear very bad and i didnt mind much till i came here but bab and betty looked so scared when i said damn and mrs moss scolded me so i tried to leave off its dreadful hard though when i get mad hang it dont seem half so good if i want to let off steam  thorny used to confound every thing so i proposed that he should whistle instead and now he sometimes pipes up so suddenly and shrilly that it makes me jump how would that do instead of swearing proposed miss celia not the least surprised at the habit of profanity which the boy could hardly help learning among his former associates  ben laughed and promised to try it feeling a mischievous satisfaction at the prospect of outwhistling master thorny as he knew he should for the objectionable words rose to his lips a dozen times a day  the ben was ringing as they drove into town and by the time lita was comfortably settled in her shed people were coming up from all quarters to cluster around the steps of the old meetinghouse like bees about a hive accustomed to a tent where people kept their hats on ben forgot all about his and was going down the aisle covered when a gentle hand took it off and miss celia whispered as she gave it to him  this is a holy place remember that and uncover at the door  much abashed ben followed to the pew where the squire and his wife soon joined them  glad to see him here said the old gentleman with an approving nod as he recognized the boy and remembered his loss  hope he wont nestle round in meetingtime whispered mrs allen composing herself in the corner with much rustling of black silk  ill take care that he doesnt disturb you answered miss celia pushing a stool under the short legs and drawing a palmleaf fan within reach  ben gave an inward sigh at the prospect before him for an hours captivity to an active lad is hard to bear and he really did want to behave well so he folded his arms and sat like a statue with nothing moving but his eyes they rolled to and fro up and down from the high red pulpit to the worn hymnbooks in the rack recognizing two little faces under blueribboned hats in a distant pew and finding it impossible to restrain a momentary twinkle in return for the solemn wink billy barton bestowed upon him across the aisle ten minutes of this decorous demeanor made it absolutely necessary for him to stir so he unfolded his arms and crossed his legs as cautiously as a mouse moves in the presence of a cat for mrs allens eye was on him and he knew by experience that it was a very sharp one  the music which presently began was a great relief to him for under cover of it he could wag his foot and no one heard the creak thereof and when they stood up to sing he was so sure that all the boys were looking at him he was glad to sit down again the good old minister read the sixteenth chapter of samuel and then proceeded to preach a long and somewhat dull sermon ben listened with all his ears for he was interested in the young shepherd ruddy and of a beautiful countenance who was chosen to be sauls armorbearer he wanted to hear more about him and how he got on and whether the evil spirits troubled saul again after david had harped them out but nothing more came and the old gentleman droned on about other things till poor ben felt that he must either go to sleep like the squire or tip the stool over by accident since nestling was forbidden and relief of some sort he must have  mrs allen gave him a peppermint and he dutifully ate it though it was so hot it made his eyes water then she fanned him to his great annoyance for it blew his hair about and the pride of his life was to have his head as smooth and shiny as black satin an irrepressible sigh of weariness attracted miss celias attention at last for though she seemed to be listening devoutly her thoughts had flown over the sea with tender prayers for one whom she loved even more than david did his jonathan she guessed the trouble in a minute and had provided for it knowing by experience that few small boys can keep quiet through sermontime finding a certain place in the little book she had brought she put it into his hands with the whisper read if you are tired  ben clutched the book and gladly obeyed though the title scripture narratives did not look very inviting then his eye fell on the picture of a slender youth cutting a large mans head off while many people stood looking on  jack the giantkiller thought ben and turned the page to see the words david and goliath which was enough to set him to reading the story with great interest for here was the shepherd boy turned into a hero no more fidgets now the sermon was no longer heard the fan flapped unfelt and billy bartons spirited sketches in the hymnbook were vainly held up for admiration ben was quite absorbed in the stirring history of king david told in a way that fitted it for childrens reading and illustrated with fine pictures which charmed the boys eye  sermon and story ended at the same time and while he listened to the prayer ben felt as if he understood now what miss celia meant by saying that words helped when they were well chosen and sincere several petitions seemed as if especially intended for him and he repeated them to himself that he might remember them they sounded so sweet and comfortable heard for the first time just when he most needed comfort miss celia saw a new expression in the boys face as she glanced down at him and heard a little humming at her side when all stood up to sing the cheerful hymn with which they were dismissed  how do you like church asked the young lady as they drove away  firstrate answered ben heartily  especially the sermon  ben laughed and said with an affectionate glance at the little book in her lap  i couldnt understand it but that story was just elegant  theres more and id admire to read em if i could  im glad you like them and we will keep the rest for another sermontime thorny used to do so and always called this his pew book i dont expect you to understand much that you hear yet awhile but it is good to be there and after reading these stories you will be more interested when you hear the names of the people mentioned here  yes m  wasnt david a fine feller  i liked all about the kid and the corn and the ten cheeses and killin the lion and bear and slingin old goliath dead first shot i want to know about joseph next time for i saw a gang of robbers puttin him in a hole and it looked real interesting  miss celia could not help smiling at bens way of telling things but she was pleased to see that he was attracted by the music and the stories and resolved to make churchgoing so pleasant that he would learn to love it for its own sake  now you have tried my way this morning and we will try yours this afternoon come over about four and help me roll thorny down to the grove i am going to put one of the hammocks there because the smell of the pines is good for him and you can talk or read or amuse yourselves in any quiet way you like  can i take sanch along  he doesnt like to be left and felt real bad because i shut him up for fear hed follow and come walkin into meetin to find me  yes indeed let the clever bowwow have a good time and enjoy sunday as much as i want my boys to  quite content with this arrangement ben went home to dinner which he made very lively by recounting billy bartons ingenious devices to beguile the tedium of sermon time he said nothing of his conversation with miss celia because he had not quite made up his mind whether he liked it or not it was so new and serious he felt as if he had better lay it by to think over a good deal before he could understand all about it but he had time to get dismal again and long for four oclock because he had nothing to do except whittle mrs moss went to take a nap bab and betty sat demurely on their bench reading sunday books no boys were allowed to come and play even the hens retired under the currantbushes and the cock stood among them clucking drowsily as if reading them a sermon  dreadful slow day thought ben and retiring to the recesses of his own room he read over the two letters which seemed already old to him now that the first shock was over he could not make it true that his father was dead and he gave up trying for he was an honest boy and felt that it was foolish to pretend to be more unhappy than he really was so he put away his letters took the black pocket off sanchs neck and allowed himself to whistle softly as he packed up his possessions ready to move next day with few regrets and many bright anticipations for the future  thorny i want you to be good to ben and amuse him in some quiet way this afternoon i must stay and see the morrises who are coming over but you can go to the grove and have a pleasant time said miss celia to her brother  not much fun in talking to that horsey fellow im sorry for him but i cant do anything to amuse him objected thorny pulling himself up from the sofa with a great yawn  you can be very agreeable when you like and ben has had enough of me for this time tomorrow he will have his work and do very well but we must try to help him through today because he doesnt know what to do with himself besides it is just the time to make a good impression on him while grief for his father softens him and gives us a chance i like him and im sure he wants to do well so it is our duty to help him as there seems to be no one else  here goes then where is he and thorny stood up won by his sisters sweet earnestness but very doubtful of his own success with the horsey fellow  waiting with the chair  randa has gone on with the hammock  be a dear boy and ill do as much for you some day  dont see how you can be a dear boy youre the best sister that ever was so ill love all the scallywags you ask me to  with a laugh and a kiss thorny shambled off to ascend his chariot goodhumoredly saluting his pusher whom he found sitting on the high rail behind with his feet on sanch  drive on benjamin  i dont know the way so i cant direct  dont spill me outthats all ive got to say  all right sirand away ben trundled down the long walk that led through the orchard to a little grove of seven pines  a pleasant spot for a soft rustle filled the air a brown carpet of pine needles with fallen cones for a pattern lay under foot and over the tops of the tall brakes that fringed the knoll one had glimpses of hill and valley farmhouses and winding river like a silver ribbon through the low green meadows  a regular summer house said thorny surveying it with approval whats the matter randa wont it do he asked as the stout maid dropped her arms with a puff after vainly trying to throw the hammock rope over a branch  that end went up beautiful but this one wont the branches is so high i cant reach em and im no hand at flinging ropes round  ill fix it and ben went up the pine like a squirrel tied a stout knot and swung himself down again before thorny could get out of the chair  my patience what a spry boy exclaimed randa admiringly  that s nothing you ought to see me shin up a smooth tentpole said ben rubbing the pitch off his hands with a boastful wag of the head  you can go randa just hand me my cushion and books ben then you can sit in the chair while i talk to you commanded thorny tumbling into the hammock  whats he goin to say to me wondered ben to himself as he sat down with sanch sprawling among the wheels  now ben i think youd better learn a hymn i always used to when i was a little chap and it is a good thing to do sundays began the new teacher with a patronizing air which ruffled his pupil as much as the opprobrious term little chap  ill bewhewif i do whistled ben  stopping an oath just in time  it is not polite to whistle in company said thorny with great dignity  miss celia told me to ill say confound it if you like that better answered ben as a sly smile twinkled in his eyes  oh i see she s told you about it  well then if you want to please her youll learn a hymn right off come now she wants me to be clever to you and id like to do it but if you get peppery how can i  thorny spoke in a hearty blunt way which suited ben much better than the other and he responded pleasantly  if you wont be grand i wont be peppery nobody is going to boss me but miss celia so ill learn hymns if she wants me to  in the soft season of thy youth is a good one to begin with i learned it when i was six nice thing better have it and thorny offered the book like a patriarch addressing an infant  ben surveyed the yellow page with small favor for the long s in the oldfashioned printing bewildered him and when he came to the last two lines he could not resist reading them wrong  the earth affords no lovelier fight than a religious youth  i dont believe i could ever get that into my head straight havent you got a plain one any where round he asked turning over the leaves with some anxiety  look at the end and see if there isnt a piece of poetry pasted in you learn that and see how funny celia will look when you say it to her she wrote it when she was a girl and somebody had it printed for other children i like it best myself  pleased by the prospect of a little fun to cheer his virtuous task ben whisked over the leaves and read with interest the lines miss celia had written in her girlhood      my kingdom      a little kingdom i possess     where thoughts and feelings dwell     and very hard i find the task     of governing it well     for passion tempts and troubles me     a wayward will misleads     and selfishness its shadow casts     on all my words and deeds      how can i learn to rule myself     to be the child i should     honest and bravenor ever tire     of trying to be good     how can i keep a sunny soul     to shine along lifes way     how can i tune my little heart     to sweetly sing all day      dear father help me with the love     that casteth out my fear     teach me to lean on thee and feel     that thou art very near     that no temptation is unseen     no childish grief too small     since thou with patience infinite     doth soothe and comfort all      i do not ask for any crown     but that which all may will     nor seek to conquer any world     except the one within     be then my guide until i find     led by a tender hand     thy happy kingdom in myself     and dare to take command  i like that said ben emphatically when he had read the little hymn i understand it and ill learn it right away dont see how she could make it all come out so nice and pretty  celia can do any thing and thorny gave an allembracing wave of the hand which forcibly expressed his firm belief in his sisters boundless powers  i made some poetry once bab and betty thought it was firstrate i didnt said ben moved to confidence by the discovery of miss celias poetic skill  say it commanded thorny adding with tact i cant make any to save my lifenever could but im fond of it      chevalita     pretty cretr     i do love her     like a brother     just to ride     is my delight     for she does not     kick or bite  recited ben with modest pride for his first attempt had been inspired by sincere affection and pronounced lovely by the admiring girls  very good you must say them to celia too she likes to hear lita praised you and she and that little barlow boy ought to try for a prize as the poets did in athens ill tell you all about it some time now you peg away at your hymn  cheered by thornys commendation ben fell to work at his new task squirming about in the chair as if the process of getting words into his memory was a very painful one but he had quick wits and had often learned comic songs so he soon was able to repeat the four verses without mistake much to his own and thornys satisfaction  now well talk said the wellpleased preceptor and talk they did one swinging in the hammock the other rolling about on the pineneedles as they related their experiences boy fashion bens were the most exciting but thornys were not without interest for he had lived abroad for several years and could tell all sorts of droll stories of the countries he had seen  busied with friends miss celia could not help wondering how the lads got on and when the teabell rang waited a little anxiously for their return knowing that she could tell at a glance if they had enjoyed themselves  all goes well so far she thought as she watched their approach with a smile for sancho sat bolt upright in the chair which ben pushed while thorny strolled beside him leaning on a stout cane newly cut both boys were talking busily and thorny laughed from time to time as if his comrades chat was very amusing  see what a jolly cane ben cut for me  hes great fun if you dont stroke him the wrong way said the elder lad flourishing his staff as they came up  what have you been doing down there  you look so merry i suspect mischief asked miss celia surveying them front the steps  weve been as good as gold  i talked and ben learned a hymn to please you come young man say your piece said thorny with an expression of virtuous content  taking off his hat ben soberly obeyed much enjoying the quick color that came up in miss celias face as she listened and feeling as if well repaid for the labor of learning by the pleased look with which she said as he ended with a bow  i feel very proud to think you chose that and to hear you say it as if it meant something to you i was only fourteen when i wrote it but it came right out of my heart and did me good i hope it may help you a little  ben murmured that he guessed it would but felt too shy to talk about such things before thorny so hastily retired to put the chair away and the others went in to tea but later in the evening when miss celia was singing like a nightingale the boy slipped away from sleepy bab and betty to stand by the syringa bush and listen with his heart full of new thoughts and happy feelings for never before had he spent a sunday like this and when he went to bed instead of saying now i lay me he repeated the third verse of miss celias hymn for that was his favorite because his longing for the father whom he had seen made it seem sweet and natural now to love and lean without fear upon the father whom he had not seen    chapter xii  good times  every one was very kind to ben when his loss was known  the squire wrote to mr smithers that the boy had found friends and would stay where he was mrs moss consoled him in her motherly way and the little girls did their very best to be good to poor benny but miss celia was his truest comforter and completely won his heart not only by the friendly words she said and the pleasant things she did but by the unspoken sympathy which showed itself just at the right minute in a look a touch a smile more helpful than any amount of condolence she called him my man and ben tried to be one bearing his trouble so bravely that she respected him although he was only a little boy because it promised well for the future  then she was so happy herself it was impossible for those about her to be sad and ben soon grew cheerful again in spite of the very tender memory of his father laid quietly away in the safest corner of his heart he would have been a very unboyish boy if he had not been happy for the new place was such a pleasant one he soon felt as if for the first time he really had a home no more grubbing now but daily tasks which never grew tiresome they were so varied and so light no more cross pats to try his temper but the sweetest mistress that ever was since praise was oftener on her lips than blame and gratitude made willing service a delight  at first it seemed as if there was going to be trouble between the two boys for thorny was naturally masterful and illness had left him weak and nervous so he was often both domineering and petulant ben had been taught instant obedience to those older than him self and if thorny had been a man ben would have made no complaint but it was hard to be ordered round by a boy and an unreasonable one into the bargain  a word from miss celia blew away the threatening cloud however and for her sake her brother promised to try to be patient for her sake ben declared he never would get mad if mr thorny did fidget and both very soon forgot all about master and man and lived together like two friendly lads taking each others ups and downs goodnaturedly and finding mutual pleasure and profit in the new companionship  the only point on which they never could agree was legs and many a hearty laugh did they give miss celia by their warm and serious discussion of this vexed question thorny insisted that ben was bowlegged ben resented the epithet and declared that the legs of all good horsemen must have a slight curve and any one who knew any thing about the matter would acknowledge both its necessity and its beauty then thorny would observe that it might be all very well in the saddle but it made a man waddle like a duck when afoot whereat ben would retort that for his part he would rather waddle like a duck than tumble about like a horse with the staggers he had his opponent there for poor thorny did look very like a weakkneed colt when he tried to walk but he would never own it and came down upon ben with crushing allusions to centaurs or the greeks and romans who were famous both for their horsemanship and fine limbs ben could not answer that except by proudly referring to the chariotraces copied from the ancients in which he had borne a part which was more than some folks with long legs could say gentlemen never did that sort of thing nor did they twit their best friends with their misfortunes thorny would remark casting a pensive glance at his thin hands longing the while to give ben a good shaking this hint would remind the other of his young masters late sufferings and all he owed his dear mistress and he usually ended the controversy by turning a few lively somersaults as a vent for his swelling wrath and come up with his temper all right again or if thorny happened to be in the wheeled chair he would trot him round the garden at a pace which nearly took his breath away thereby proving that if bowlegs were not beautiful to some benighted beings they were good to go  thorny liked that and would drop the subject for the time by politely introducing some more agreeable topic so the impending quarrel would end in a laugh over some boyish joke and the word legs be avoided by mutual consent till accident brought it up again  the spirit of rivalry is hidden in the best of us and is a helpful and inspiring power if we know how to use it miss celia knew this and tried to make the lads help one another by means of itnot in boastful or ungenerous comparison of each others gifts but by interchanging them giving and taking freely kindly and being glad to love what was admirable wherever they found it thorny admired bens strength activity and independence ben envied thornys learning good manners and comfortable surroundings and when a wise word had set the matter rightly before them both enjoyed the feeling that there was a certain equality between them since money could not buy health and practical knowledge was as useful as any that can be found in books so they interchanged their small experiences accomplishments and pleasures and both were the better as well as the happier for it because in this way only can we truly love our neighbor as ourself and get the real sweetness out of life  there was no end to the new and pleasant things ben had to do from keeping paths and flowerbeds neat feeding the pets and running errands to waiting on thorny and being righthand man to miss celia he had a little room in the old house newly papered with hunting scenes which he was never tired of admiring in the closet hung several outgrown suits of thornys made over for his valet and what ben valued infinitely more a pair of boots well blacked and ready for grand occasions when he rode abroad with one old spur found in the attic brightened up and merely worn for show since nothing would have induced him to prick beloved lita with it  many pictures cut from illustrated papers of races animals and birds were stuck round the room giving it rather the air of a circus and menagerie this however made it only the more homelike to its present owner who felt exceedingly rich and respectable as he surveyed his premises almost like a retired showman who still fondly remembers past successes though now happy in the more private walks of life  in one drawer of the quaint little bureau which he used were kept the relics of his father very few and poor and of no interest to any one but himselfonly the letter telling of his death a wornout watchchain and a photograph of senor jose montebello with his youthful son standing on his head both airily attired and both smiling with the calmly superior expression which gentlemen of their profession usually wear in public bens other treasures had been stolen with his bundle but these he cherished and often looked at when he went to bed wondering what heaven was like since it was lovelier than california and usually fell asleep with a dreamy impression that it must be something like america when columbus found ita pleasant land where were gay flowers and tall trees with leaves and fruit such as they had never seen before and through this happy huntingground father was for ever riding on a beautiful white horse with wings like the one of which miss celia had a picture  nice times ben had in his little room poring over his books for he soon had several of his own but his favorites were hamertons animals and our dumb friends both full of interesting pictures and anecdotes such as boys love still nicer times working about the house helping get things in order and best of all were the daily drives with miss celia and thorny when weather permitted or solitary rides to town through the heaviest rain for certain letters must go and come no matter how the elements raged the neighbors soon got used to the antics of that boy but ben knew that he was an object of interest as he careered down the main street in a way that made old ladies cry out and brought people flying to the window sure that some one was being run away with lita enjoyed the fun as much as he and apparently did her best to send him heels over head having rapidly earned to understand the signs he gave her by the touch of hand and foot or the tones of his voice  these performances caused the boys to regard ben brown with intense admiration the girls with timid awe all but bab who burned to imitate him and tried her best whenever she got a chance much to the anguish and dismay of poor jack for that longsuffering animal was the only steed she was allowed to ride fortunately neither she nor betty had much time for play just now as school was about to close for the long vacation and all the little people were busy finishing up that they might go to play with free minds so the lilacparties as they called them were deferred till later and the lads amused themselves in their own way with miss celia to suggest and advise  it took thorny a long time to arrange his possessions for he could only direct while ben unpacked wondering and admiring as he worked because he had never seen so many boyish treasures before the little printingpress was his especial delight and leaving every thing else in confusion thorny taught him its and planned a newspaper on the spot with ben for printer himself for editor and sister for chief contributor while bab should be carrier and betty officeboy next came a postagestamp book and a rainy day was happily spent in pasting a new collection where each particular one belonged with copious explanations from thorny as they went along ben did not feel any great interest in this amusement after one trial of it but when a book containing patterns of the flags of all nations turned up he was seized with a desire to copy them all so that the house could be fitly decorated on gala occasions finding that it amused her brother miss celia generously opened her piecedrawer and ragbag and as the mania grew till her resources were exhausted she bought bits of gay cambric and manycolored papers and startled the storekeeper by purchasing several bottles of mucilage at once bab and betty were invited to sew the bright strips of stars and pricked their little fingers assiduously finding this sort of needlework much more attractive than piecing bedquilts  such a snipping and pasting planning and stitching as went on in the big back room which was given up to them and such a noble array of banners and petitions as soon decorated its walls would have caused the dullest eye to brighten with amusement if not with admiration of course the stars and stripes hung highest with the english lion ramping on the royal standard close by then followed a regular picturegallery for there was the white elephant of siam the splendid peacock of burmah the doubleheaded russian eagle and black dragon of china the winged lion of venice and the prancing pair on the red white and blue flag of holland the keys and mitre of the papal states were a hard job but up they went at last with the yellow crescent of turkey on one side and the red full moon of japan on the other the pretty blue and white flag of greece hung below and the cross of free switzerland above if materials had held out the flags of all the united states would have followed but paste and patience were exhausted so the busy workers rested awhile before they flung their banner to the breeze as the newspapers have it  a spell of shipbuilding and rigging followed the flag fit for thorny feeling too old now for such toys made over his whole fleet to the children condescending however to superintend a thorough repairing of the same before he disposed of all but the big manofwar which continued to ornament his own room with all sail set and a little red officer perpetually waving his sword on the quarterdeck  these gifts led to outofdoor waterworks for the brook had to be dammed up that a shallow ocean might be made where bens piratical red rover with the black flag might chase and capture babs smart frigate queen while the bounding betsey laden with lumber safely sailed from kennebunkport to massachusetts bay thorny from his chair was chiefengineer and directed his gang of one how to dig the basin throw up the embankment and finally let in the water till the mimic ocean was full then regulate the little watergate lest it should overflow and wreck the pretty squadron or ships boats canoes and rafts which soon rode at anchor there  digging and paddling in mud and water proved such a delightful pastime that the boys kept it up till a series of waterwheels little mills and cataracts made the once quiet brook look as if a manufacturing town was about to spring up where hitherto minnows had played in peace and the retiring frog had chanted his serenade unmolested  miss celia liked all this for any thing which would keep thorny happy outofdoors in the sweet june weather found favor in her eyes and when the novelty had worn off from home affairs she planned a series of exploring expeditions which filled their boyish souls with delight as none of them knew much about the place it really was quite exciting to start off on a bright morning with a roll of wraps and cushions lunch books and drawing materials packed into the phaeton and drive at random about the shady roads and lanes pausing when and where they liked wonderful discoveries were made pretty places were named plans were drawn and all sorts of merry adventures befell the pilgrims  each day they camped in a new spot and while lita nibbled the fresh grass at her ease miss celia sketched under the big umbrella thorny read or lounged or slept on his rubber blanket and ben made himself generally useful unloading filling the artists waterbottle piling the invalids cushions setting out the lunch running to and fro for a bower or a butterfly climbing a tree to report the view reading chatting or frolicking with sanchoany sort of duty was in bens line and he did them all well for an outofdoor life was natural to him and he liked it  ben i want an amanuensis said thorny dropping book and pencil one day after a brief interval of silence broken only by the whisper of the young leaves overhead and the soft babble of the brook close by  a what asked ben pushing back his hat with such an air of amazement that thorny rather loftily inquired  dont you know what an amanuensis is  well no not unless its some relation to an anaconda shouldnt think youd want one of them anyway  thorny rolled over with a hoot of derision and his sister who sat close by sketching an old gate looked up to see what was going on  well you neednt laugh at a feller you didnt know what a wombat was when i asked you and i didnt roar said ben giving his hat a slap as nothing else was handy  the idea of wanting an anaconda tickled me so i couldnt help it  i dare say youd have got me one if i had asked for it you are such an obliging chap  of course i would if i could  shouldnt be surprised if you did some day you want such funny things answered ben appeased by the compliment  ill try the amanuensis first  its only some one to write for me i get so tired doing it without a table you write well enough and it will be good for you to know something about botany i intend to teach you ben said thorny as if conferring a great favor  it looks pretty hard muttered ben with a doleful glance at the book laid open upon a strew of torn leaves and flowers  no it isnt its regularly jolly and youd be no end of a help if you only knew a little now suppose i say bring me a ranunculus bulbosus how would you know what i wanted demanded thorny waving his microscope with a learned air  shouldnt  there are quantities of them all round us and i want to analyze one see if you cant guess  ben stared vaguely from earth to sky and was about to give it up when a buttercup fell at his feet and he caught sight of miss celia smiling at him from behind her brother who did not see the flower  spose you mean this  i dont call em rhinocerus bulburses so i wasnt sure and taking the hint as quickly as it was given ben presented the buttercup as if he knew all about it  you guessed that remarkably well now bring me a leontodon taraxacum said thorny charmed with the quickness of his pupil and glad to display his learning  again ben gazed but the field was full of early flowers and if a long pencil had not pointed to a dandelion close by he would have been lost  here you are sir he answered with a chuckle and thorny took his turn at being astonished now  how the dickens did you know that  try it again and may be youll find out laughed ben  diving haphazard into his book thorny demanded a trifolium pratense  the clever pencil pointed and ben brought a red clover mightily enjoying the joke and thinking that their kind of botany wasnt bad fun  look here no fooling and thorny sat up to investigate the matter so quickly that his sister had not time to sober down ah ive caught you not fair to tell celia now ben youve got to learn all about this buttercup to pay for cheating  werry good sir bring on your rhinoceriouses answered ben who couldnt help imitating his old friend the clown when he felt particularly jolly  sit there and write what i tell you ordered thorny with all the severity of a strict schoolmaster perching himself on the mossy stump ben obediently floundered through the following analysis with constant help in the spelling and much private wonder what would come of it  phaenogamous  exogenous  angiosperm  polypetalous stamens more than ten stamens on the receptacle pistils more than one and separate leaves without stipules crowfoot family genus ranunculus botanical name ranunculus bulbosus  jerusalem what a flower pistols and crows feet and polly put the kettles on and angy sperms and all the rest of em if thats your botany i wont take any more thank you said ben as he paused as hot and red as if he had been running a race  yes you will youll learn that all by heart and then i shall give you a dandelion to do youll like that because it means dent de lion or lions tooth and ill show them to you through my glass youve no idea how interesting it is and what heaps of pretty things youll see answered thorny who had already discovered how charming the study was and had found great satisfaction in it since he had been forbidden more active pleasures  whats the good of it anyway asked ben who would rather have been set to mowing the big field than to the task before him  it tells all about it in my book heregrays botany for young people but i can tell you what use it is to us continued thorny crossing his legs in the air and preparing to argue the matter comfortably lying flat on his back we are a scientific exploration society and we must keep an account of all the plants animals minerals and so on as we come across them then suppose we get lost and have to hunt for food how are we to know what is safe and what isnt come now do you know the difference between a toadstool and a mushroom  no i dont  then ill teach you some day  there is sweet flag and poisonous flag and all sorts of berries and things and youd better look out when you are in the woods or youll touch ivy and dogwood and have a horrid time if you dont know your botany  thorny learned much of his by sad experience and you will be wise to take his advice said miss celia recalling her brothers various mishaps before the new fancy came on  didnt i have a time of it though when i had to go round for a week with plantain leaves and cream stuck all over my face just picked some pretty red dogwood ben and then i was a regular guy with a face like a lobster and my eyes swelled out of sight come along and learn right away and never get into scrapes like most fellows  impressed by this warning and attracted by thornys enthusiasm ben cast himself down upon the blanket and for an hour the two heads bobbed to and fro from microscope to book the teacher airing his small knowledge the pupil more and more interested in the new and curious things he saw or heardthough it must be confessed that ben infinitely preferred to watch ants and bugs queer little worms and gauzywinged flies rather than putter over plants with long names he did not dare to say so however but when thorny asked him if it wasnt capital fun he dodged cleverly by proposing to hunt up the flowers for his master to study offering to learn about the dangerous ones but pleading want of time to investigate this pleasing science very deeply  as thorny had talked himself hoarse he was very ready to dismiss his class of one to fish the milkbottle out of the brook and recess was prolonged till next day but both boys found a new pleasure in the pretty pastime they made of it for active ben ranged the woods and fields with a tin box slung over his shoulder and feeble thorny had a little room fitted up for his own use where he pressed flowers in newspaper books dried herbs on the walls had bottles and cups pans and platters for his treasures and made as much litter as he liked  presently ben brought such lively accounts of the green nooks where jacksinthepulpit preached their little sermons brooks beside which grew blue violets and lovely ferns rocks round which danced the columbines like rosy elves or the trees where birds built squirrels chattered and woodchucks burrowed that thorny was seized with a desire to go and see these beauties for himself so jack was saddled and went plodding scrambling and wandering into all manner of pleasant places always bringing home a stronger browner rider than he carried away  this delighted miss celia and she gladly saw them ramble off together leaving her time to stitch happily at certain dainty bits of sewing write voluminous letters or dream over others quite as long swinging in her hammock under the lilacs    chapter xiii  somebody runs away      school is done     now well have fun  sung bab and betty slamming down their books as if they never meant to take them up again when they came home on the last day of june  tired teacher had dismissed them for eight whole weeks and gone away to rest the little schoolhouse was shut up lessons were over spirits rising fast and vacation had begun the quiet town seemed suddenly inundated with children all in such a rampant state that busy mothers wondered how they ever should be able to keep their frisky darlings out of mischief thrifty fathers planned how they could bribe the idle hands to pick berries or rake hay and the old folks while wishing the young folks well secretly blessed the man who invented schools  the girls immediately began to talk about picnics and have them too for little hats sprung up in the fields like a new sort of mushroomevery hillside bloomed with gay gowns looking as if the flowers had gone out for a walk and the woods were full of featherless birds chirping away as blithely as the thrushes robins and wrens  the boys took to baseball like ducks to water and the common was the scene of tremendous battles waged with much tumult but little bloodshed to the uninitiated it appeared as if these young men had lost their wits for no matter how warm it was there they were tearing about in the maddest manner jackets off sleeves rolled up queer caps flung on any way all batting shabby leather balls and catching the same as if their lives depended on it every one talking in his gruffest tone bawling at the top of his voice squabbling over every point of the game and seeming to enjoy himself immensely in spite of the heat dust uproar and imminent danger of getting eyes or teeth knocked out  thorny was an excellent player but not being strong enough to show his prowess he made ben his proxy and sitting on the fence acted as umpire to his hearts content ben was a promising pupil and made rapid progress for eye foot and hand had been so well trained that they did him good service now and brown was considered a firstrate catcher  sancho distinguished himself by his skill in hunting up stray balls and guarding jackets when not needed with the air of one of the old guard on duty at the tomb of napoleon bab also longed to join in the fun which suited her better than stupid picnics or fussing over dolls but her heroes would not have her at any price and she was obliged to content herself with sitting by thorny and watching with breathless interest the varying fortunes of our side  a grand match was planned for the fourth of july but when the club met things were found to be unpropitious thorny had gone out of town with his sister to pass the day two of the best players did not appear and the others were somewhat exhausted by the festivities which began at sunrise for them so they lay about on the grass in the shade of the big elm languidly discussing their various wrongs and disappointments  its the meanest fourth i ever saw cant have no crackers because somebodys horse got scared last year growled sam kitteridge bitterly resenting the stern edict which forbade freeborn citizens to burn as much gunpowder as they liked on that glorious day  last year jimmy got his arm blown off when they fired the old cannon didnt we have a lively time going for the doctors and getting him home asked another boy looking as if he felt defrauded of the most interesting part of the anniversary because no accident had occurred  aint going to be fireworks either unless somebodys barn burns up dont i just wish there would gloomily responded another youth who had so rashly indulged in pyrotechnics on a former occasion that a neighbors cow had been roasted whole  i wouldnt give two cents for such a slow old place as this  why last fourth at this time i was rumbling though boston streets on top of our big car all in my best toggery hot as pepper but good fun looking in at the upper windows and hearing the women scream when the old thing waggled round and i made believe i was going to tumble off said ben leaning on his bat with the air of a man who had seen the world and felt some natural regret at descending from so lofty a sphere  catch me cuttin away if i had such a chance as that answered sam trying to balance his bat on his chin and getting a smart rap across the nose as he failed to perform the feat  much you know about it old chap  its hard work i can tell you and that wouldnt suit such a lazybones then you are too big to begin though you might do for a fat boy if smithers wanted one said ben surveying the stout youth with calm contempt  lets go in swimming not loaf round here if we cant play proposed a red and shiny boy panting for a game of leapfrog in sandy pond  may as well dont see much else to do sighed sam rising like a young elephant  the others were about to follow when a shrill hi hi boys hold on made them turn about to behold billy barton tearing down the street like a runaway colt waving a long strip of paper as he ran  now then whats the matter demanded ben as the other came up grinning and puffing but full of great news  look here read it im going come along the whole of you panted billy putting the paper into sams hand and surveying the crowd with a face as beaming as a full moon  look out for the big show read sam van amburgh  cos new great golden menagerie circus and colosseum will exhibit at berryville july 4th at 1 and 7 precisely admission 50 cents children halfprice dont forget day and date h frost manager  while sam read the other boys had been gloating over the enticing pictures which covered the bill there was the golden car filled with noble beings in helmets all playing on immense trumpets the twentyfour prancing steeds with manes tails and feathered heads tossing in the breeze the clowns the tumblers the strong men and the riders flying about in the air as if the laws of gravitation no longer existed but best of all was the grand conglomeration of animals where the giraffe appears to stand on the elephants back the zebra to be jumping over the seal the hippopotamus to be lunching off a couple of crocodiles and lions and tigers to be raining down in all directions with their mouths wide open and their tails as stiff as that of the famous northumberland house lion  cricky wouldnt i like to see that said little cyrus fay devoutly hoping that the cage in which this pleasing spectacle took place was a very strong one  you never would its only a picture that now is something like and ben who had pricked up his ears at the word circus laid his finger on a smaller cut of a man hanging by the back of his neck with a child in each hand two men suspended from his feet and the third swinging forward to alight on his head  i m going said sam with calm decision for this superb array of unknown pleasures fired his soul and made him forget his weight  how will you fix it asked ben fingering the bill with a nervous thrill all through his wiry limbs just as he used to feel it when his father caught him up to dash into the ring  foot it with billy its only four miles and weve got lots of time so we can take it easy mother wont care if i send word by cy answered sam producing half a dollar as if such magnificent sums were no strangers to his pocket  come on brown youll be a firstrate fellow to show us round as you know all the dodges said billy anxious to get his moneys worth  well i dont know began ben longing to go but afraid mrs moss would say no if he asked leave  hes afraid sneered the redfaced boy who felt bitterly toward all mankind at that instant because he knew there was no hope of his going  say that again and ill knock your head off and ben faced round with a gesture which caused the other to skip out of reach precipitately  hasnt got any money more likely observed a shabby youth whose pockets never had any thing in them but a pair of dirty hands  ben calmly produced a dollar bill and waved it defiantly before this doubter observing with dignity  ive got money enough to treat the whole crowd if i choose to which i dont  then come along and have a jolly time with sam and me  we can buy some dinner and get a ride home as like as not said the amiable billy with a slap on the shoulder and a cordial grin which made it impossible for ben to resist  what are you stopping for demanded sam ready to be off that they might take it easy  dont know what to do with sancho  hell get lost or stolen if i take him and its too far to carry him home if you are in a hurry began ben persuading himself that this was the true reason of his delay  let cy take him back hell do it for a cent wont you cy proposed billy smoothing away all objections for he liked ben and saw that he wanted to go  no i wont i dont like him he winks at me and growls when i touch him muttered naughty cy remembering how much reason poor sanch had to distrust his tormentor  there s bab shell do it  come here sissy ben wants you called sam beckoning to a small figure just perching on the fence  down it jumped and came fluttering up much elated at being summoned by the captain of the sacred nine  i want you to take sanch home and tell your mother im going to walk and may be wont be back till sundown miss celia said i might do what i pleased all day you remember now  ben spoke without looking up and affected to be very busy buckling a strap into sanchs collar for the two were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled it was a mistake on bens part for while his eyes were on his work babs were devouring the bill which sam still held and her suspicions were aroused by the boys faces  where are you going  ma will want to know she said as curious as a magpie all at once  never you mind girls cant know every thing you just catch hold of this and run along home lock sanch up for an hour and tell your mother im all right answered ben bound to assert his manly supremacy before his mates  hes going to the circus whispered fay hoping to make mischief  circus oh ben do take me cried bab falling into a state of great excitement at the mere thought of such delight  you couldnt walk four miles began ben  yes i could as easy as not  you havent got any money  you have i saw you showing your dollar and you could pay for me and ma would pay it back  cant wait for you to get ready  ill go as i am  i dont care if it is my old hat and bab jerked it on to her head  your mother wouldnt like it  she wont like your going either  she isnt my missis now  miss celia wouldnt care and im going any way  do do take me ben ill be just as good as ever was and ill take care of sanch all the way pleaded bab clasping her hands and looking round for some sign of relenting in the faces of the boys  dont you bother we dont want any girls tagging after us said sam walking off to escape the annoyance  ill bring you a roll of chickerberry lozengers if you wont tease whispered kindhearted billy with a consoling pat on the crown of the shabby straw hat  when the circus comes here you shall go certain sure and betty too said ben feeling mean while he proposed what he knew was a hollow mockery  they never do come to such little towns you said so and i think you are very cross and i wont take care of sanch so now cried bab getting into a passion yet ready to cry she was so disappointed  i suppose it wouldnt do hinted billy with a look from ben to the little girl who stood winking hard to keep the tears back  of course it wouldnt  id like to see her walking eight miles i dont mind paying for her its getting her there and back girls are such a bother when you want to knock round no bab you cant go travel right home and dont make a fuss come along boys it s most eleven and we dont want to walk fast  ben spoke very decidedly and taking billys arm away they went leaving poor bab and sanch to watch them out of sight one sobbing the other whining dismally  somehow those two figures seemed to go before ben all along the pleasant road and half spoilt his fun for though he laughed and talked cut canes and seemed as merry as a grig he could not help feeling that he ought to have asked leave to go and been kinder to bab  perhaps mrs moss would have planned somehow so we could all go if id told her id like to show her round and shes been real good to me no use now ill take the girls a lot of candy and make it all right  he tried to settle it in that way and trudged gayly off hoping sancho wouldnt feel hurt at being left wondering if any of smitherss lot would be round and planning to do the honors handsomely to the boys  it was very warm and just outside of the town they paused by a wayside wateringtrough to wash their dusty faces and cool off before plunging into the excitements of the afternoon as they stood refreshing themselves a bakers cart came jingling by and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested a supply of gingerbread was soon bought and climbing the green bank above they lay on the grass under a wild cherrytree munching luxuriously while they feasted their eyes at the same time on the splendors awaiting them for the great tent with all its flags flying was visible from the hill  well cut across those fieldsit s shorter than going by the roadand then we can look round outside till its time to go in i want to have a good go at every thing especially the lions said sam beginning on his last cookie  i heard em roar just now and billy stood up to gaze with big eyes at the flapping canvas which hid the king of beasts from his longing sight  that was a cow mooing  dont you be a donkey bill  when you hear a real roar youll shake in your boots said ben holding up his handkerchief to dry after it had done double duty as towel and napkin  i wish youd hurry up sam  folks are going in now i see em and billy pranced with impatience for this was his first circus and he firmly believed that he was going to behold all that the pictures promised  hold on a minute while i get one more drink buns are dry fodder said sam rolling over to the edge of the bank and preparing to descend with as little trouble as possible  he nearly went down head first however for as he looked before he leaped he beheld a sight which caused him to stare with all his might for an instant then turn and beckon saying in an eager whisper look here boysquick  ben and billy peered over and both suppressed an astonished hullo for there stood bab waiting for sancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough  such a shabby tiredlooking couple as they were bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked with tears shoes white with dust playfrock torn at the gathers something bundled up in her apron and one shoe down at the heel as if it hurt her sancho lapped eagerly with his eyes shut all his ruffles were gray with dust and his tail hung wearily down the tassel at half mast as if in mourning for the master whom he had come to find bab still held the strap intent on keeping her charge safe though she lost herself but her courage seemed to be giving out as she looked anxiously up and down the road seeing no sign of the three familiar figures she had been following as steadily as a little indian on the wartrail  oh sanch what shall i do if they dont come along  we must have gone by them somewhere for i dont see any one that way and there isnt any other road to the circus seems to me  bab spoke as if the dog could understand and answer and sancho looked as if he did both for he stopped drinking pricked up his cars and fixing his sharp eyes on the grass above him gave a suspicious bark  its only squirrels dont mind but come along and be good for i m so tired i dont know what to do sighed bab trying to pull him after her as she trudged on bound to see the outside of that wonderful tent even if she never got in  but sancho had heard a soft chirrup and with a sudden bound twitched the strap away sprang up the bank and landed directly on bens back as he lay peeping over a peal of laughter greeted him and having got the better of his master in more ways than one he made the most of the advantage by playfully worrying him as he kept him down licking his face in spite of his struggles burrowing in his neck with a ticklish nose snapping at his buttons and yelping joyfully as if it was the best joke in the world to play hideandseek for four long miles  before ben could quiet him bab came climbing up the bank with such a funny mixture of fear fatigue determination and relief in her dirty little face that the boys could not look awful if they tried  how dared you come after us miss demanded sam as she looked calmly about her and took a seat before she was asked  sanch would come after ben i couldnt make him go home so i had to hold on till he was safe here else hed be lost and then ben would feel bad  the cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely and sam tried again while ben was getting the dog down and sitting on him  now you expect to go to the circus i suppose  course i do  ben said he didnt mind paying if i could get there without bothering him and i have and ill go home alone i aint afraid sanch will take care of me if you wont answered bab stoutly  what do you suppose your mother will say to you asked ben feeling much reproached by her last words  i guess shell say you led me into mischief and the sharp child nodded as if she defied him to deny the truth of that  youll catch it when you get home ben so youd better have a good time while you can advised sam thinking bab great fun since none of the blame of her pranks would fall on him what would you have done if you hadnt found us asked billy forgetting his impatience in his admiration for this plucky young lady  id have gone on and seen the circus and then id have gone home again and told betty all about it was the prompt answer  but you havent any money  oh id ask somebody to pay for me  i m so little it wouldnt be much  nobody would do it so youd have to stay outside you see  no i wouldnt  i thought of that and planned how id fix it if i didnt find ben id make sanch do his tricks and get a quarter that way so now answered bab undaunted by any obstacle  i do believe she would you are a smart child bab and if i had enough id take you in myself said billy heartily for having sisters of his own he kept a soft place in his heart for girls especially enterprising ones  ill take care of her  it was very naughty to come bab but so long as you did you neednt worry about any thing ill see to you and you shall have a real good time said ben accepting his responsibilities without a murmur and bound to do the handsome thing by his persistent friend  i thought you would and bab folded her arms as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself  are you hungry asked billy fishing out several fragments of gingerbread  starving and bab ate them with such a relish that sam added a small contribution and ben caught some water for her in his hand where the little spring bubbled up beside a stone  now you wash your face and spat down your hair and put your hat on straight and then well go commanded ben giving sanch a roll on the grass to clean him  bab scrubbed her face till it shone and pulling down her apron to wipe it scattered a load of treasures collected in her walk some of the dead flowers bits of moss and green twigs fell near ben and one attracted his attentiona spray of broad smooth leaves with a bunch of whitish berries on it  where did you get that he asked poking it with his foot  in a swampy place coming along  sanch saw something down there and i went with him cause i thought may be it was a muskrat and youd like one if we could get him  was it asked the boys all at once and with intense interest  no only a snake and i dont care for snakes i picked some of that it was so green and pretty thorny likes queer leaves and berries you know answered bab spatting down her rough locks  well he wont like that nor you either its poisonous and i shouldnt wonder if youd got poisoned bab dont touch it swampsumach is horrid stuffmiss celia said so and ben looked anxiously at bab who felt her chubby face all over and examined her dingy hands with a solemn air asking eagerly  will it break out on me fore i get to the circus  not for a day or so i guess but its bad when it does come  i dont care if i see the animals first  come quick and never mind the old weeds and things said bab much relieved for present bliss was all she had room for now in her happy little heart    chapter xiv  somebody gets lost  putting all care behind them the young folks ran down the hill with a very lively dog gambolling beside them and took a delightfully tantalizing survey of the external charms of the big tent but people were beginning to go in and it was impossible to delay when they came round to the entrance  ben felt that now his foot was on his native heath and the superb air of indifference with which he threw down his dollar at the ticketoffice carelessly swept up the change and strolled into the tent with his hands in his pockets was so impressive that even big sam repressed his excitement and meekly followed their leader as he led them from cage to cage doing the honors as if he owned the whole concern bab held tight to the flap of his jacket staring about her with round eyes and listening with little gasps of astonishment or delight to the roaring of lions the snarling of tigers the chatter of the monkeys the groaning of camels and the music of the very brass band shut up in a red bin  five elephants were tossing their hay about in the middle of the menagerie and billys legs shook under him as he looked up at the big beasts whose long noses and small sagacious eyes filled him with awe sam was so tickled by the droll monkeys that the others left him before the cage and went on to see the zebra striped just like mas muslin gown bab declared but the next minute she forgot all about him in her raptures over the ponies and their tiny colts especially one mite of a thing who lay asleep on the hay such a miniature copy of its little mousecolored mamma that one could hardly believe it was alive  oh ben i must feel of itthe cunning baby horse and down went bab inside the rope to pat and admire the pretty creature while its mother smelt suspiciously at the brown hat and baby lazily opened one eye to see what was going on  come out of that it isnt allowed commanded ben longing to do the same thing but mindful of the proprieties and his own dignity  bab reluctantly tore herself away to find consolation in watching the young lions who looked so like big puppies and the tigers washing their faces just as puss did  if i stroked em wouldnt they purr she asked bent on enjoying herself while ben held her skirts lest she should try the experiment  youd better not go to patting them or youll get your hands clawed up tigers do purr like fun when they are happy but these fellers never are and youll only see em spit and snarl said ben leading the way to the humpy carrels who were peacefully chewing their cud and longing for the desert with a dreamy faraway look in their mournful eyes  here leaning on the rope and scientifically biting a straw while he talked ben played showman to his hearts content till the neigh of a horse from the circus tent beyond reminded him of the joys to come  wed better hurry along and get good seats before folks begin to crowd i want to sit near the curtain and see if any of smittherss lot are round  i aint going way off there you cant see half so well and that big drum makes such a noise you cant hear yourself think said sam who had rejoined them  so they settled in good places where they could see and hear all that went on in the ring and still catch glimpses of white horses bright colors and the glitter of helmets beyond the dingy red curtains ben treated bab to peanuts and popcorn like an indulgent parent and she murmured protestations of undying gratitude with her mouth full as she sat blissfully between him and the congenial billy  sancho meantime had been much excited by the familiar sights and sounds and now was greatly exercised in his doggish mind at the unusual proceeding of his master for he was sure that they ought to be within there putting on their costumes ready to take their turn he looked anxiously at ben sniffed disdainfully at the strap as if to remind him that a scarlet ribbon ought to take its place and poked peanut shells about with his paw as if searching for the letters with which to spell his famous name  i know old boy i know but it cant be done weve quit the business and must just look on no larks for us this time sanch so keep quiet and behave whispered ben tucking the dog away under the seat with a sympathetic cuddle of the curly head that peeped out from between his feet  he wants to go and cut up dont he said billy and so do you i guess wish you were going to wouldnt it be fun to see ben showing off in there  id be afraid to have him go up on a pile of elephants and jump through hoops like these folks answered bab poring over her pictured playbill with unabated relish  done it a hundred times and id just like to show you what i can do they dont seem to have any boys in this lot shouldnt wonder if theyd take me if i asked em said ben moving uneasily on his seat and casting wistful glances toward the inner tent where he knew he would feel more at home than in his present place  i heard some men say that its against the law to have small boys now its so dangerous and not good for them this kind of thing if thats so youre done for ben observed sam with his most grownup air remembering bens remarks on fat boys  dont believe a word of it and sanch and i could go this minute and get taken on ill bet we are a valuable couple and i could prove it if i chose to began ben getting excited and boastful  oh see theyre cominggold carriages and lovely horses and flags and elephants and every thing cried bab giving a clutch at bens arm as the opening procession appeared headed by the band tooting and banging till their faces were as red as their uniforms  round and round they went till every one had seen their fill then the riders alone were left caracoling about the ring with feathers flying horses prancing and performers looking as tired and indifferent as if they would all like to go to sleep then and there  how splendid sighed bab as they went dashing out to tumble off almost before the horses stopped  thats nothing you wait till you see the bareback riding and the acrobatic exercises said ben quoting from the playbill with the air of one who knew all about the feats to come and could never be surprised any more  what are crowbackic exercises asked billy thirsting for information  leaping and climbing and tumbling youll see george what a stunning horse and ben forgot every thing else to feast his eyes on the handsome creature who now came pacing in to dance upset and replace chairs kneel bow and perform many wonderful or graceful feats ending with a swift gallop while the rider sat in a chair on its back fanning himself with his legs crossed as comfortably as you please  that now is something like and bens eyes shone with admiration and envy as the pair vanished and the pink and silver acrobats came leaping into the ring  the boys were especially interested in this part and well they might be for strength and agility are manly attributes which lads appreciate and these lively fellows flew about like indiarubber balls each trying to outdo the other till the leader of the acrobats capped the climax by turning a double somersault over five elephants standing side by side  there sir hows that for a jump asked ben rubbing his hands with satisfaction as his friends clapped till their palms tingled  well rig up a springboard and try it said billy fired with emulation  wherell you get your elephants asked sam scornfully for gymnastics were not in his line  youll do for one retorted ben and billy and bab joined in his laugh so heartily that a roughlooking man who sat behind them hearing all they said pronounced them a jolly set and kept his eye on sancho who now showed signs of insubordination  hullo that wasnt on the bill cried ben as a particolored clown came in followed by half a dozen dogs  im so glad now sancho will like it  theres a poodle that might be his ownty donty brotherthe one with the blue ribbon said bab beaming with delight as the dogs took their seats in the chairs arranged for them  sancho did like it only too well for be scrambled out from under the seat in a great hurry to go and greet his friends and being sharply checked sat up and begged so piteously that ben found it very hard to refuse and order him down he subsided for a moment but when the black spaniel who acted the canine clown did something funny and was applauded sancho made a dart as if bent on leaping into the ring to outdo his rival and ben was forced to box his ears and put his feet on the poor beast fearing he would be ordered out if he made any disturbance  too well trained to rebel again sancho lay meditating on his wrongs till the dog act was over carefully abstaining from any further sign of interest in their tricks and only giving a sidelong glance at the two little poodles who came out of a basket to run up and down stairs on their forepaws dance jigs on their hindlegs and play various pretty pranks to the great delight of all the children in the audience if ever a dog expressed by look and attitude pooh i could do much better than that and astonish you all if i were only allowed to that dog was sancho as he curled himself up and affected to turn his back on an unappreciative world  its too bad when he knows more than all those chaps put together id give any thing if i could show him off as i used to folks always like it and i was ever so proud of him hes mad now because i had to cuff him and wont take any notice of me till i make up said ben regretfully eying his offended friend but not daring to beg pardon yet  more riding followed and bab was kept in a breathless state by the marvellous agility and skill of the gauzy lady who drove four horses at once leaped through hoops over banners and bars sprang off and on at full speed and seemed to enjoy it all so much it was impossible to believe that there could be any danger or exertion in it then two girls flew about on the trapeze and walked on a tight rope causing bab to feel that she had at last found her sphere for young as she was her mother often said  i really dont know what this child is fit for except mischief like a monkey  ill fix the clothesline when i get home and show ma how nice it is then may be shed let me wear red and gold trousers and climb round like these girls thought the busy little brain much excited by all it saw on that memorable day  nothing short of a pyramid of elephants with a glittering gentleman in a turban and top boots on the summit would have made her forget this new and charming plan but that astonishing spectacle and the prospect of a cage of bengal tigers with a man among them in imminent danger of being eaten before her eyes entirely absorbed her thoughts till just as the big animals went lumbering out a peal of thunder caused considerable commotion in the audience men on the highest seats popped their heads through the openings in the tentcover and reported that a heavy shower was coming up anxious mothers began to collect their flocks of children as hens do their chickens at sunset timid people told cheerful stories of tents blown over in gales cages upset and wild beasts let loose many left in haste and the performers hurried to finish as soon as possible  im going now before the crowd comes so i can get a lift home i see two or three folks i know so im off and climbing hastily down sam vanished without further ceremony  better wait till the shower is over we can go and see the animals again and get home all dry just as well as not observed ben encouragingly as billy looked anxiously at the billowing canvas over his head the swaying posts before him and heard the quick patter of drops outside not to mention the melancholy roar of the lion which sounded rather awful through the sudden gloom which filled the strange place  i wouldnt miss the tigers for any thing see they are pulling in the cart now and the shiny man is all ready with his gun will he shoot any of them apprehension for the sharp crack of a rifle startled her more than the loudest thunderclap she ever heard  bless you no child it s only powder to make a noise and scare em i wouldnt like to be in his place though father says you can never trust tigers as you can lions no matter how tame they are sly fellers like cats and when they scratch its no joke i tell you answered ben with a knowing wag of the head as the sides of the cage rattled down and the poor fierce creatures were seen leaping and snarling as if they resented this display of their captivity  bab curled up her feet and winked fast with excitement as she watched the shiny man fondle the great cats lie down among them pull open their red mouths and make them leap over him or crouch at his feet as he snapped the long whip when he fired the gun and they all fell as if dead she with difficulty suppressed a small scream and clapped her hands over her ears but poor billy never minded it a bit for he was pale and quaking with the fear of heavens artillery thundering overhead and as a bright flash of lightning seemed to run down the tall tentpoles he hid his eyes and wished with all his heart that he was safe with mother  afraid of thunder bill asked ben trying to speak stoutly while a sense of his own responsibilities began to worry him for how was bab to be got home in such a pouring rain  it makes me sick always did  wish i hadnt come sighed billy feeling all too late that lemonade and lozengers were not the fittest food for man or a stifling tent the best place to be in on a hot july day especially in a thunderstorm  i didnt ask you to come you asked me so it isnt my fault said ben rather gruffly as people crowded by without pausing to hear the comic song the clown was singing in spite of the confusion  oh im so tired groaned bab getting up with a long stretch of arms and legs  youll be tireder before you get home i guess nobody asked you to come any way and ben gazed dolefully round him wishing he could see a familiar face or find a wiser head than his own to help him out of the scrape he was in  i said i wouldnt be a bother and i wont  ill walk right home this minute i aint afraid of thunder and the rain wont hurt these old clothes come along cried bab bravely bent on keeping her word though it looked much harder after the fun was all over than before  my head aches like fury  dont i wish old jack was here to take me back said billy following his companions in misfortune with sudden energy as a louder peal than before rolled overhead  you might as well wish for lita and the covered wagon while you are about it then we could all ride answered ben leading the way to the outer tent where many people were lingering in hopes of fair weather  why billy barton how in the world did you get here cried a surprised voice as the crook of a cane caught the boy by the collar and jerked him face to face with a young farmer who was pushing along followed by his wife and two or three children  oh uncle eben im so glad you found me i walked over and its raining and i dont feel well let me go with you cant i asked billy casting himself and all his woes upon the strong arm that had laid hold of him  dont see what your mother was about to let you come so far alone and you just over scarlet fever we are as full as ever we can be but well tuck you in somehow said the pleasantfaced woman bundling up her baby and bidding the two little lads keep close to father  i didnt come alone  sam got a ride and cant you tuck ben and bab in too they aint very big either of them whispered billy anxious to serve his friends now that he was provided for himself  cant do it any way  got to pick up mother at the corner and that will be all i can carry its lifting a little hurry along lizzie and let us get out of this as quick is possible said uncle eben impatiently for going to a circus with a young family is not an easy task as every one knows who has ever tried it  ben im real sorry there isnt room for you ill tell babs mother where she is and may be some one will come for you said billy hurriedly as he tore himself away feeling rather mean to desert the others though he could be of no use  cut away and dont mind us im all right and bab must do the best she can was all ben had time to answer before his comrade was hustled away by the crowd pressing round the entrance with much clashing of umbrellas and scrambling of boys and men who rather enjoyed the flurry  no use for us to get knocked about in that scrimmage  well wait a minute and then go out easy its a regular rouser and youll be as wet as a sop before we get home hope youll like that added ben looking out at the heavy rain poring down as if it never meant to stop  dont care a bit said bab swinging on one of the ropes with a happygolucky air for her spirits were not extinguished yet and she was bound to enjoy this exciting holiday to the very end i like circuses so much i wish i lived here all the time and slept in a wagon as you did and had these dear little colties to play with  it wouldnt be fun if you didnt have any folks to take care of you began ben thoughtfully looking about the familiar place where the men were now feeding the animals setting their refreshment tables or lounging on the hay to get such rest as they could before the evening entertainment suddenly he started gave a long look then turned to bab and thrusting sanchos strap into her hand said hastily  i see a fellow i used to know may be he can tell me something about father dont you stir till i come back  then he was off like a shot and bab saw him run after a man with a bucket who bad been watering the zebra sancho tried to follow but was checked with an impatient  no you cant go  what a plague you are tagging around when people dont want you  sancho might have answered so are you but being a gentlemanly dog he sat down with a resigned expression to watch the little colts who were now awake and seemed ready for a game of bopeep behind their mammas bab enjoyed their funny little frisks so much that she tied the wearisome strap to a post and crept under the rope to pet the tiny mousecolored one who came and talked to her with baby whinnies and confiding glances of its soft dark eyes  oh luckless bab why did you turn your back oh too accomplished sancho why did you neatly untie that knot and trot away to confer with the disreputable bulldog who stood in the entrance beckoning with friendly wavings of an abbreviated tail oh much afflicted ben why did you delay till it was too late to save your pet from the rough man who set his foot upon the trailing strap and led poor sanch quickly out of sight among the crowd  it was bascum but he didnt know any thing why wheres sanch said ben returning a breathless voice made bab turn to see ben looking about him with as much alarm in his hot face as if the dog had been a two years child  i tied himhes here somewherewith the ponies stammered bab in sudden dismay for no sign of a dog appeared as her eyes roved wildly to and fro  ben whistled called and searched in vain till one of the lounging men said lazily  if you are looking after the big poodle youd better go outside i saw him trotting off with another dog  away rushed ben with bab following regardless of the rain for both felt that a great misfortune had befallen them but long before this sancho had vanished and no one minded his indignant howls as he was driven off in a covered cart  if he is lost ill never forgive you never never never and ben found it impossible to resist giving bab several hard shakes which made her yellow braids fly up and down like pump handles  im dreadful sorry hell come backyou said he always did pleaded bab quite crushed by her own afflictions and rather scared to see ben look so fierce for he seldom lost his temper or was rough with the little girls  if he doesnt come back dont you speak to me for a year  now im going home and feeling that words were powerless to express his emotions ben walked away looking as grim as a small boy could  a more unhappy little lass is seldom to be found than bab was as she pattered after him splashing recklessly through the puddles and getting as wet and muddy as possible as a sort of penance for her sins for a mile or two she trudged stoutly along while ben marched before in solemn silence which soon became both impressive and oppressive because so unusual and such a proof of his deep displeasure penitent bab longed for just one word one sign of relenting and when none came she began to wonder how she could possibly bear it if he kept his dreadful threat and did not speak to her for a whole year  but presently her own discomfort absorbed her for her feet were wet and cold as well as very tired popcorn and peanuts were not particularly nourishing food and hunger made her feel faint excitement was a new thing and now that it was over she longed to lie down and go to sleep then the long walk with a circus at the end seemed a very different affair from the homeward trip with a distracted mother awaiting her the shower had subsided into a dreary drizzle a chilly east wind blew up the hilly road seemed to lengthen before the weary feet and the mute blue flannel figure going on so fast with never a look or sound added the last touch to babs remorseful anguish  wagons passed but all were full and no one offered a ride men and boys went by with rough jokes on the forlorn pair for rain soon made them look like young tramps but there was no brave sancho to resent the impertinence and this fact was sadly brought to both their minds by the appearance of a great newfoundland dog who came trotting after a carriage the good creature stopped to say a friendly word in his dumb fashion looking up at bab with benevolent eyes and poking his nose into bens hand before he bounded away with his plumy tail curled over his back  ben started as the cold nose touched his fingers gave the soft head a lingering pat and watched the dog out of sight through a thicker mist than any the rain made but bab broke down for the wistful look of the creatures eyes reminded her of lost sancho and she sobbed quietly as she glanced back longing to see the dear old fellow jogging along in the rear  ben heard the piteous sound and took a sly peep over his shoulder seeing such a mournful spectacle that he felt appeased saying to himself as if to excuse his late sternness  she is a naughty girl but i guess she is about sorry enough now  when we get to that signpost ill speak to her only i wont forgive her till sanch comes back  but he was better than his word for just before the post was reached bab blinded by tears tripped over the root of a tree and rolling down the bank landed in a bed of wet nettles ben had her out in a jiffy and vainly tried to comfort her but she was past any consolation he could offer and roared dismally as she wrung her tingling hands with great drops running over her cheeks almost as fast as the muddy little rills ran down the road  oh dear oh dear im all stinged up and i want my supper and my feet ache and im cold and every thing is so horrid wailed the poor child lying on the grass such a miserable little wet bunch that the sternest parent would have melted at the sight  dont cry so babby i was real cross and im sorry  ill forgive you right away now and never shake you any more cried ben so full of pity for her tribulations that he forgot his own like a generous little man  shake me again if you want to i know i was very bad to tag and lose sanch i never will any more and im so sorry i dont know what to do answered bab completely bowed down by this magnanimity  never mind you just wipe up your face and come along and well tell ma all about it and shell fix us as nice as can be i shouldnt wonder if sanch got home now before we did said ben cheering himself as well as her by the fond hope  i dont believe i ever shall  im so tired my legs wont go and the water in my boots makes them feel dreadfully i wish that boy would wheel me a piece dont you spose he would asked bab wearily picking herself up as a tall lad trundling a barrow came out of a yard near by  hullo joslyn said ben recognizing the boy as one of the hill fellows who came to town saturday nights for play or business  hullo brown responded the other arresting his squeaking progress with signs of surprise at the moist tableau before him  where goin asked ben with masculine brevity  got to carry this home hang the old thing  where to  batchelors down yonder and the boy pointed to a farmhouse at the foot of the next hill  goin that way take it right along  what for questioned the prudent youth distrusting such unusual neighborliness  shes tired wants a ride ill leave it all right true as i live and breathe explained ben half ashamed yet anxious to get his little responsibility home as soon as possible for mishaps seemed to thicken  ho you couldnt cart her all that way shes most as heavy as a bag of meal jeered the taller lad amused at the proposition  im stronger than most fellers of my size try if i aint and ben squared off in such scientific style that joslyn responded with sudden amiability  all right lets see you do it  bab huddled into her new equipage without the least fear and ben trundled her off at a good pace while the boy retired to the shelter of a barn to watch their progress glad to be rid of an irksome errand  at first all went well for the way was down hill and the wheel squeaked briskly round and round bab smiled gratefully upon her bearer and ben went in on his muscle with a will as he expressed it but presently the road grew sandy began to ascend and the load seemed to grow heavier with every step  ill get out now  its real nice but i guess i am too heavy said bab as the face before her got redder and redder and the breath began to come in puffs  sit still he said i couldnt  im not going to give in with him looking on panted ben and he pushed gallantly up the rise over the grassy lawn to the side gate of the batchelors dooryard with his head down teeth set and every muscle of his slender body braced to the task  did ever ye see the like of that now  ah ha      the streets were so wide and the lanes were so narry      he brought his wife home on a little wheelbarry  sung a voice with an accent which made ben drop his load and push back his hat to see pats red head looking over the fence  to have his enemy behold him then and there was the last bitter drop in poor bens cup of humiliation a shrill approving whistle from the hill was some comfort however and gave him spirit to help bab out with composure though his hands were blistered and he had hardly breath enough to issue the command  go along home and dont mind him  nice childer ye are runnin off this way settin the women distracted and me wastin me time comin after ye when id be milkin airly so id get a bit of pleasure the day grumbled pat coming up to untie the duke whose roman nose ben had already recognized as well as the roomy chaise standing before the door  did billy tell you about us asked bab gladly following toward this welcome refuge  faith he did and the squire sent me to fetch ye home quiet and aisy when ye found me id jist stopped here to borry a light for me pipe up wid ye by and not be wastin me time stramashin after a spalpeen that id like to lay me whip over said pat gruffly as ben came along having left the barrow in the shed  dont you wish you could  you neednt wait for me ill come when im ready answered ben dodging round the chaise bound not to mind pat if he spent the night by the roadside in consequence  bedad and i wont then  its lively ye are but four legs is better than two as yell find this night me young man  with that he whipped up and was off before bab could say a word to persuade ben to humble himself for the sake of a ride she lamented and pat chuckled both forgetting what an agile monkey the boy was and as neither looked back they were unaware master ben was hanging on behind among the straps and springs making derisive grimaces at his unconscious foe through the little glass in the leathern back  at the lodge gate ben jumped down to run before with whoops of naughty satisfaction which brought the anxious waiters to the door in a flock so pat could only shake his fist at the exulting little rascal as he drove away leaving the wanderers to be welcomed as warmly as if they were a pair of model children  mrs moss had not been very much troubled after all for cy had told her that bab went after ben and billy had lately reported her safe arrival among them so motherlike she fed dried and warmed the runaways before she scolded them  even then the lecture was a mild one for when they tried to tell the adventures which to them seemed so exciting not to say tragical the effect astonished them immensely as their audience went into gales of laughter especially at the wheelbarrow episode which bab insisted on telling with grateful minuteness to bens confusion thorny shouted and even tenderhearted betty forgot her tears over the lost dog to join in the familiar melody when bab mimicked pats quotation from mother goose  we must not laugh any more or these naughty children will think they have done something very clever in running away said miss celia when the fun subsided adding soberly i am displeased but i will say nothing for i think ben is already punished enough  guess i am muttered ben with a choke in his voice as he glanced toward the empty mat where a dear curly bunch used to be with a bright eye twinkling out of the middle of it    chapter xv  bens ride  great was the mourning for sancho because his talents and virtues made him universally admired and beloved miss celia advertised thorny offered rewards and even surly pat kept a sharp lookout for poodle dogs when he went to market but no sancho or any trace of him appeared ben was inconsolable and sternly said it served bab right when the dogwood poison affected both face and hands poor bab thought so too and dared ask no sympathy from him though thorny eagerly prescribed plantain leaves and betty kept her supplied with an endless succession of them steeped in cream and pitying tears this treatment was so successful that the patient soon took her place in society as well as ever but for bens affliction there was no cure and the boy really suffered in his spirits  i dont think its fair that i should have so much troublefirst losing father and then sanch if it wasnt for lita and miss celia i dont believe i could stand it he said one day in a fit of despair about a week after the sad event  oh come now dont give up so old fellow  well find him if he s alive and if he isnt ill try and get you another as good answered thorny with a friendly slap on the shoulder as ben sat disconsolately among the beans he had been hoeing  as if there ever could be another half as good cried ben indignant at the idea or as if id ever try to fill his place with the best and biggest dog that ever wagged a tail no sir theres only one sanch in all the world and if i cant have him ill never have a dog again  try some other sort of pet then  you may have any of mine you like have the peacocks do now urged thorny full of boyish sympathy and goodwill  they are dreadful pretty but i dont seem to care about em thank you replied the mourner  have the rabbits all of them which was a handsome offer on thornys part for there were a dozen at least  they dont love a fellow as a dog does all they care for is stuff to eat and dirt to burrow in im sick of rabbits and well he might be for he had had the charge of them ever since they came and any boy who has ever kept bunnies knows what a care they are  so am i guess well have an auction and sell out  would jack be a comfort to you if he will you may have him im so well now i can walk or ride anything added thorny in a burst of generosity  jack couldnt be with me always as sanch was and i couldnt keep him if i had him  ben tried to be grateful but nothing short of lita would have healed his wounded heart and she was not thornys to give or he would probably have offered her to his afflicted friend  well no you couldnt take jack to bed with you or keep him up in your room and im afraid he would never learn to do any thing clever i do wish i had something you wanted id so love to give it to you  he spoke so heartily and was so kind that ben looked up feeling that he had given him one of the sweetest things in the worldfriendship he wanted to tell him so but did not know how to do it so caught up his hoe and fell to work saying in a tone thorny understood better than words  you are real good to menever mind i wont worry about it only it seems extra hard coming so soon after the other  he stopped there and a bright drop fell on the bean leaves to shine like dew till ben saw clearly enough to bury it out of sight in a great flurry  by jove ill find that dog if he is out of the ground keep your spirits up my lad and well have the dear old fellow back yet  with which cheering prophecy thorny went off to rack his brains as to what could be done about the matter  half an hour afterward the sound of a handorgan in the avenue roused him from the brown study into which he had fallen as he lay on the newly mown grass of the lawn peeping over the wall thorny reconnoitred and finding the organ a good one the man a pleasantfaced italian and the monkey a lively animal he ordered them all in as a delicate attention to ben for music and monkey together might suggest soothing memories of the past and so be a comfort  in they came by way of the lodge escorted by bab and betty full of glee for handorgans were rare in those parts and the children delighted in them smiling till his white teeth shone and his black eyes sparkled the man played away while the monkey made his pathetic little bows and picked up the pennies thorny threw him  it is warm and you look tired  sit down and ill get you some dinner said the young master pointing to the seat which now stood near the great gate  with thanks in broken english the man gladly obeyed and ben begged to be allowed to make jacko equally comfortable explaining that he knew all about monkeys and what they liked so the poor thing was freed from his cocked hat and uniform fed with bread and milk and allowed to curl himself up in the cool grass for a nap looking so like a tired littie old man in a fur coat that the children were never weary of watching him  meantime miss celia had come out and was talking italian to giacomo in a way that delighted his homesick heart she had been to naples and could understand his longing for the lovely city of his birth so they had a little chat in the language which is all music and the good fellow was so grateful that he played for the children to dance till they were glad to stop lingering afterward as if he hated to set out again upon his lonely dusty walk  id rather like to tramp round with him for a week or so  could make enough to live on as easy as not if i only i had sanch to show off said ben as he was coaxing jacko into the suit which he detested you go wid me yes asked the man nodding and smiling well pleased at the prospect of company for his quick eye and what the boys let fall in their talk showed him that ben was not one of them  if i had my dog id love to and with sad eagerness ben told the tale of his loss for the thought of it was never long out of his mind  i tink i see droll dog like he way off in new york he do leetle trick wid letter and dance and go on he head and many tings to make laugh said the man when he had listened to a list of sanchs beauties and accomplishments  who had him asked thorny full of interest at once  a man i not know  cross fellow what beat him when he do letters bad  did he spell his name cried ben breathlessly  no that for why man beat him  he name generale and he go spell sancho all times and cry when whip fall on him ha yes that name true one not generale and the man nodded waved his hands and showed his teeth almost as much excited as the boys  its sanch lets go and get him now right off cried ben in a fever to be gone  a hundred miles away and no clue but this mans story  we must wait a little ben and be sure before we set out said miss celia ready to do almost any thing but not so certain as the boys what sort of a dog was it a large curly white poodle with a queer tail she asked of giacomo  no signorina mia he no curly no wite he black smooth dog littel tail small so and the man held up one brown finger with a gesture which suggested a short wagging tail  there you see how mistaken we were  dogs are often named sancho especially spanish poodles for the original sancho was a spaniard you know this dog is not ours and im so sorry  the boys faces had fallen dismally as their hope was destroyed but ben would not give up for him there was and could be only one sancho in the world and his quick wits suggested an explanation which no one else thought of  it may be my dogthey color em as we used to paint over trick horses i told you he was a valuable chap and those that stole him hide him that way else hed be no use dont you see because wed know him  but the black dog had no tail began thorny longing to be convinced but still doubtful  ben shivered as if the mere thought hurt him as he said in a grim tone  they might have cut sanchs off  oh no no they mustntthey wouldnt how could any one be so wicked cried bab and betty horrified at the suggestion  you dont know what such fellows would do to make all safe so they could use a dog to earn their living for em said ben with mysterious significance quite forgetting in his wrath that he had just proposed to get his own living in that way himself  he no your dog  sorry i not find him for you addio signorina grazia signor buon giorno buon giorno and kissing his hand the italian shouldered organ and monkey ready to go  miss celia detained him long enough to give him her address and beg him to let her know if he met poor sanch in any of his wanderings for such itinerant showmen often cross each others paths ben and thorny walked to the schoolcorner with him getting more exact information about the black dog and his owner for they had no intention of giving it up so soon  that very evening thorny wrote to a boy cousin in new york giving all the particulars of the case and begging him to hunt up the man investigate the dog and see that the police made sure that every thing was right much relieved by this performance the boys waited anxiously for a reply and when it came found little comfort in it cousin horace had done his duty like a man but regretted that he could only report a failure the owner of the black poodle was a suspicious character but told a straight story how he had bought the dog from a stranger and exhibited him with success till he was stolen knew nothing of his history and was very sorry to lose him for he was a remarkably clever beast  i told my dogman to look about for him but he says he has probably been killed with ever so many more so there is an end of it and i call it a mean shame  good for horace  i told you hed do it up thoroughly and see the end of it said thorny as he read that paragraph in the deeply interesting letter  may be the end of that dog but not of mine ill bet he ran away and if it was sanch hell come home you see if he doesnt cried ben refusing to believe that all was over  a hundred wiles off oh he couldnt find you without help smart as he is answered thorny incredulously  ben looked discouraged but miss celia cheered him up again by saying  yes he could  my father had a friend who left a little dog in paris and the creature found her in milan and died of fatigue next day that was very wonderful but true and ive no doubt that if sanch is alive he will come home let us hope so and be happy while we wait  we will said the boys and day after day looked for the wanderers return kept a bone ready in the old place if he should arrive at night and shook his mat to keep it soft for his weary bones when he came but weeks passed and still no sanch  something else happened however so absorbing that he was almost forgotten for a time and ben found a way to repay a part of all he owed his best friend  miss celia went off for a ride one afternoon and an hour afterward as ben sat in the porch reading lita dashed into the yard with the reins dangling about her legs the saddle turned round and one side covered with black mud showing that she had been down for a minute bens heart stood still then he flung away his book ran to the horse and saw at once by her heaving flanks dilated nostrils and wet coat that she must have come a long way and at full speed  she has had a fall but isnt hurt or frightened thought the boy as the pretty creature rubbed her nose against his shoulder pawed the ground and champed her bit as if she tried to tell him all about the disaster whatever it was  lita wheres miss celia he asked looking straight into the intelligent eyes which were troubled but not wild  lita threw up her head and neighed loud and clear as if she called her mistress and turning would have gone again if ben had not caught the reins and held her  all right well find her and pulling off the broken saddle kicking away his shoes and ramming his hat firmly on ben was up like a flash tingling all over with a sense of power as he felt the bare back between his knees and caught the roll of litas eye as she looked round with an air of satisfaction  hi there mrs moss something has happened to miss celia and im going to find her thorny is asleep tell him easy and ill come back as soon as i can  then giving lita her head he was off before the startled woman had time to do more than wring her hands and cry out  go for the squire oh what shall we do  as if she knew exactly what was wanted of her lita went back the way she had come as ben could see by the fresh irregular tracks that cut up the road where she had galloped for help for a mile or more they went then she paused at a pair of bars which were let down to allow the carts to pass into the wide hayfields beyond on she went again cantering across the newmown turf toward a brook across which she had evidently taken a leap before for on the further side at a place where cattle went to drink the mud showed signs of a fall  you were a fool to try there but where is miss celia said ben who talked to animals as if they were people and was understood much better than any one not used to their companionship would imagine  now lita seemed at a loss and put her head down as if she expected to find her mistress where she had left her somewhere on the ground ben called but there was no answer and he rode slowly along the brookside looking far and wide with anxious eyes  may be she wasnt hurt and has gone to that house to wait thought the boy pausing for a last survey of the great sunny field which had no place of shelter in it but one rock on the other side of the little stream as his eye wandered over it something dark seemed to blow out from behind it as if the wind played in the folds of a shirt or a human limb moved away went lita and in a moment ben had found miss celia lying in the shadow of the rock so white and motionless he feared that she was dead he leaped down touched her spoke to her and receiving no answer rushed away to bring a little water in his leaky hat to sprinkle in her face as he had seen them do when any of the riders got a fall in the circus or fainted from exhaustion after they left the ring where do or die was the motto all adopted  in a minute the blue eyes opened and she recognized the anxious face bending over her saying faintly as she touched it  my good little ben i knew youd find mei sent lita for you im so hurt i couldnt come  oh where  what shall i do  had i better run up to the house asked ben overjoyed to hear her speak but much dismayed by her seeming helplessness for he had seen bad falls and had them too  i feel bruised all over and my arm is broken im afraid  lita tried not to hurt me she slipped and we went down i came here into the shade and the pain made me faint i suppose call somebody and get me home  then she shut her eyes and looked so white that ben hurried away and burst upon old mrs paine placidly knitting at the end door so suddenly that as she afterward said it scat her like a clap o thunder  aint a man nowheres around  all down in the big medder gettin in hay was her reply to bens breathless demand for everybody to come and see to miss celia  he turned to mount for he had flung himself off before lita stopped but the old lady caught his jacket and asked half a dozen questions in a breath  whos your folks  whats broke howd she fall  where is she  why didnt she come right here is it a sunstroke  as fast as words could tumble out of his mouth ben answered and then tried to free himself but the old lady held on while she gave her directions expressed her sympathy and offered her hospitality with incoherent warmth  sakes alive poor dear fetch her right in liddy get out the camphire and melissy you haul down a bed to lay her on falls is dretful uncertin things shouldnt wonder if her back was broke fathers down yender and he and bijah will see to her you go call em and ill blow the horn to start em up tell her wed be pleased to see her and it wont make a mite of trouble  ben heard no more fur as mrs paine turned to take down the tin horn he was up and away  several long and dismal toots sent lita galloping through the grassy path as the sound of the trumpet excites a warhorse and father and bijah alarmed by the signal at that hour leaned on their rakes to survey with wonder the distractedlooking little horseman approaching like a whirlwind  guess likely grandpas had nother stroke  told em to send over soon s ever it come said the farmer calmly  shouldnt wonder ef suthing was afire somers conjectured the hired man surveying the horizon for a cloud of smoke  instead of advancing to meet the messenger both stood like statues in blue overalls and red flannel shirts till the boy arrived and told his tale  sho thats bad said the farmer anxiously  that brook always was the darndest place added bijah then both men bestirred themselves helpfully the former hurrying to miss cella while the latter brought up the cart and made a bed of hay to lay her on  now then boy you go for the doctor  my own folks will see to the lady and shed better keep quiet up yender till we see what the matter is said the farmer when the pale girl was lifted in as carefully as four strong arms could do it hold on he added as ben made one leap to litas back youll have to go to berryville dr mills is a master hand for broken bones and old dr babcock aint tisnt but about three miles from here to his house and youll fetch him fore theres any harm done waitin  dont kill lita called miss celia from the cart as it began to move  but ben did not hear her for he was off across the fields riding as if life and death depended upon his speed  that boy will break his neck said mr paine standing still to watch horse and rider go over the wall as if bent on instant destruction  no fear for ben he can ride any thing and lita was trained to leap answered miss celia falling back on the hay with a groan for she had involuntarily raised her head to see her little squire dash away in gallant style  i should hope so regular jockey that boy never see any thing like it out of a raceground and farmer paine strode on still following with his eye the figures that went thundering over the bridge up the hill out of sight leaving a cloud of cloud of dust behind  now that his mistress was safe ben enjoyed that wild ride mightily and so did the bay mare for lita had good blood in her and proved it that day by doing her three miles in a wonderfully short time people jogging along in wagons and country carryalls stared amazed as the reckless pair went by women placidly doing their afternoon sewing at the front windows dropped their needles to run out with exclamations of alarm sure some one was being run away with children playing by the roadside scattered like chickens before a hawk as ben passed with a warning whoop and babycarriages were scrambled into dooryards with perilous rapidity at his approach  but when he clattered into town intense interest was felt in this barefooted boy on the foaming steed and a dozen voices asked whos killed as he pulled up at the doctors gate  jest drove off that way mrs flynns babys in a fit cried a stout lady from the piazza never ceasing to rock though several passersby paused to hear the news for she was a doctors wife and used to the arrival of excited messengers from all quarters at all hours of the day and night  deigning no reply to any one ben rode away wishing he could leap a yawning gulf scale a precipice or ford a raging torrent to prove his devotion to miss celia and his skill in horsemanship but no dangers beset his path and he found the doctor pausing to water his tired horse at the very trough where bab and sancho had been discovered on that evermemorable day the story was quickly told and promising to be there as soon as possible dr mills drove on to relieve baby flynns inner man a little disturbed by a bit of soap and several buttons upon which he had privately lunched while his mamma was busy at the washtub  ben thanked his stars as he had already done more than once that he knew how to take care of a horse for he delayed by the wateringplace long enough to wash out litas mouth with a handful of wet grass to let her have one swallow to clear her dusty throat and then went slowly back over the breezy hills patting and praising the good creature for her intelligence and speed she knew well enough that she had been a clever little mare and tossed her head arched her glossy neck and ambled daintily along as conscious and coquettish as a pretty woman looking round at her admiring rider to return his compliments by glance of affection and caressing sniffs of a velvet nose at his bare feet  miss celia had been laid comfortably in bed by the farmers wife and daughter and when the doctor arrived bore the setting of her arm bravely no other serious damage appeared and bruises soon heal so ben was sent home to comfort thorny with a good report and ask the squire to drive up in his big carryall for her the next day if she was able to be moved  mrs moss had been wise enough to say nothing but quietly made what preparations she could and waited for tidings bab and betty were away berrying so no one had alarmed thorny and he had his afternoon nap in peacean unusually long one owing to the stillness which prevailed in the absence of the children and when he awoke he lay reading for a while before he began to wonder where every one was lounging out to see he found ben and lita reposing side by side on the fresh straw in the loose box which had been made for her in the coachhouse by the pails sponges and currycombs lying about it was evident that she had been refreshed by a careful washing and rubbing down and my lady was now luxuriously resting after her labors with her devoted groom half asleep close by  well of all queer boys you are the queerest to spend this hot afternoon fussing over lita just for the fun of it cried thorny looking in at them with much amusement  if you knew what wed been doing youd think i ought to fuss over her and both of us had a right to rest answered ben rousing up as bright as a button for he longed to tell his thrilling tale and had with difficulty been restrained from bursting in on thorny as soon as he arrived  he made short work of the story but was quite satisfied with the sensation it produced for his listener was startled relieved excited and charmed in such rapid succession that he was obliged to sit upon the mealchest and get his breath before he could exclaim with an emphatic demonstration of his heels against the bin  ben brown ill never forget what youve done for celia this day or say bowlegs again as long as i live  george i felt as if i had six legs when we were going the pace we were all one piece and had a jolly spin didnt we my beauty and ben chuckled as he took litas head in his lap while she answered with a gusty sigh that nearly blew him away  like the fellow that brought the good news from ghent to aix said thorny surveying the recumbent pair with great admiration  what follow asked ben wondering if he didnt mean sheridan of whose ride he had heard  dont you know that piece i spoke it at school give it to you now see if it isnt a rouser  and glad to find a vent from his excitement thorny mounted the mealchest to thunder out that stirring ballad with such spirit that lita pricked up her ears and ben gave a shrill hooray as the last verse ended     and all i remember is friends flocking round    as i sat with his head twixt my knees on the ground    and no voice but was praising this roland of mine    as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine    which the burgesses voted by common consent    was no more than his due who brought good news from ghent    chapter xvi  detective thornton  a few days later miss celia was able to go about with her arm in a sling pale still and rather stiff but so much better than any one expected that all agreed mr paine was right in pronouncing dr mills a master hand with broken bones two devoted little maids waited on her two eager pages stood ready to run her errands and friendly neighbors sent in delicacies enough to keep these four young persons busily employed in disposing of them  every afternoon the great bamboo lounging chair was brought out and the interesting invalid conducted to it by stout randa who was head nurse and followed by a train of shawl cushion footstool and book bearers who buzzed about like swarming bees round a new queen when all were settled the little maids sewed and the pages read aloud with much conversation by the way for one of the rules was that all should listen attentively and if any one did not understand what was read he or she should ask to have it explained on the spot whoever could answer was invited to do so and at the end of the reading miss celia could ask any she liked or add any explanations which seemed necessary in this way much pleasure and profit was extracted from the tales ben and thorny read and much unexpected knowledge as well as ignorance displayed not to mention piles of neatly hemmed towels for which bab and betty were paid like regular sewingwomen  so vacation was not all play and the girls found their picnics berry parties and goin a visitin all the more agreeable for the quiet hour spent with miss celia thorny had improved wonderfully and was getting to be quite energetic especially since his sisters accident for while she was laid up he was the head of the house and much enjoyed his promotion but ben did not seem to flourish as he had done at first the loss of sancho preyed upon him sadly and the longing to go and find his dog grew into such a strong temptation that he could hardly resist it he said little about it but now and then a word escaped him which might have enlightened any one who chanced to be watching him no one was just then so he brooded over this fancy day by day in silence and solitude for there was no riding and driving now thorny was busy with his sister trying to show her that he remembered how good she had been to him when he was ill and the little girls had their own affairs  miss celia was the first to observe the change having nothing to do but lie on the sofa and amuse herself by seeing others work or play ben was bright enough at the readings because then he forgot his troubles but when they were over and his various duties done he went to his own room or sought consolation with lita being sober and quiet and quite unlike the merry monkey all knew and liked so well  thorny what is the matter with ben asked miss celia one day when she and her brother were alone in the green parlor as they called the lilactree walk  fretting about sanch i suppose  i declare i wish that dog had never been born losing him has just spoilt ben not a bit of fun left in him and he wont have any thing i offer to cheer him up  thorny spoke impatiently and knit his brows over the pressed flowers he was neatly gumming into his herbal  i wonder if he has any thing on his mind he acts as if he was hiding a trouble he didnt dare to tell have you talked with him about it asked miss celia looking as if she was hiding a trouble she did not like to tell  oh yes i poke him up now and then but he gets peppery so i let him alone may be he is longing for his old circus again shouldnt blame him much if he was it isnt very lively here and hes used to excitement you know  i hope it isnt that  do you think he would slip away without telling us and go back to the old life again  dont believe he would ben isnt a bit of a sneak thats why i like him  have you ever found him sly or untrue in any way asked miss celia lowering her voice  no hes as fair and square a fellow as i ever saw little bit low now and then but he doesnt mean it and wants to be a gentleman only he never lived with one before and its all new to him ill get him polished up after a while  oh thorny there are three peacocks on the place and you are the finest laughed miss celia as her brother spoke in his most condescending way with a lift of the eyebrows very droll to see  and two donkeys and bens the biggest not to know when he is well off and happy retorted the gentleman slapping a dried specimen on the page as if he were pounding discontented ben  come here and let me tell you something which worries me i would not breathe it to another soul but i feel rather helpless and i dare say you can manage the matter better than i  looking much mystified thorny went and sat on the stool at his sisters feet while she whispered confidentially in his ear ive lost some money out of my drawer and im so afraid ben took it  but its always locked up and you keep the keys of the drawer and the little room  it is gone nevertheless and ive had my keys safe all the time  but why think it is he any more than randa or katy or me  because i trust you three as i do myself ive known the girls for years and you have no object in taking it since all i have is yours dear  and all mine is yours of course but celia how could he do it  he cant pick locks i know for we fussed over my desk together and had to break it after all  i never really thought it possible till today when you were playing ball and it went in at the upper window and ben climbed up the porch after it you remember you said if it had gone in at the garret gable you couldnt have done that so well and he answered yes i could there isnt a spout i cant shin up or a bit of this roof i havent been over  so he did but there is no spout near the little room window  there is a tree and such an agile boy as ben could swing in and out easily now thorny i hate to think this of him but it has happened twice and for his own sake i must stop it if he is planning to run away money is a good thing to have and he may feel that it is his own for you know he asked me to put his wages in the bank and i did he may not like to come to me for that because he can give no good reason for wanting it im so troubled i really dont know what to do  she looked troubled and thorny put his arms about her as if to keep all worries but his own away from her  dont you fret cely dear you leave it to me ill fix himungrateful little scamp  that is not the way to begin  i am afraid you will make him angry and hurt his feelings and then we can do nothing  bother his feelings i shall just say calmly and coolly now look here ben hand over the money you took out of my sisters drawer and well let you off easy or something like that  it wouldnt do thorny his temper would be up in a minute and away he would go before we could find out whether he was guilty or not i wish i knew how to manage  let me think and thorny leaned his chin on the arm of the chair staring hard at the knocker as if he expected the lions mouth to open with words of counsel then and there  by jove i do believe ben took it he broke out suddenly for when i went to his room this morning to see why he didnt come and do my boots he shut the drawer in his bureau as quick as a flash and looked red and queer for i didnt knock and sort of startled him  he wouldnt be likely to put stolen money there ben is too wise for that  he wouldnt keep it there but he might be looking at it and pitch it in when i called hes hardly spoken to me since and when i asked him what his flag was at halfmast for he wouldnt answer besides you know in the reading this afternoon he didnt listen and when you asked what he was thinking about he colored up and muttered something about sanch i tell you celia it looks badvery bad and thorny shook his head with a wise air  it does and yet we may be all wrong let us wait a little and give the poor boy a chance to clear himself before we speak id rather lose my money than suspect him falsely  how much was it  eleven dollars a one went first and i supposed id miscalculated somewhere when i took some out but when i missed a ten i felt that i ought not to let it pass  look here sister you just put the case into my hands and let me work it up i wont say any thing to ben till you give the word but ill watch him and now that my eyes are open it wont be easy to deceive me  thorny was evidently pleased with the new play of detective and intended to distinguish himself in that line but when miss celia asked how he meant to begin he could only respond with a blank expression dont know you give me the keys and leave a bill or two in the drawer and may be i can find him out somehow  so the keys were given and the little dressingroom where the old secretary stood was closely watched for a day or two ben cheered up a trifle which looked as if he knew an eye was upon him but otherwise he went on as usual and miss celia feeling a little guilty at even harboring a suspicion of him was kind and patient with his moods thorny was very funny in the unnecessary mystery and fuss he made his affectation of careless indifference to bens movements and his clumsy attempts to watch every one of them his dodgings up and down stairs ostentatious clanking of keys and the elaborate traps he set to catch his thief such as throwing his ball in at the dressingroom window and sending ben up the tree to get it which he did thereby proving beyond a doubt that he alone could have taken the money thorny thought another deep discovery was that the old drawer was so shrunken that the lock could be pressed down by slipping a knifeblade between the hasp and socket  now it is as clear as day and youd better let me speak he said full of pride as well as regret at this triumphant success of his first attempt as a detective  not yet and you need do nothing more  im afraid it was a mistake of mine to let you do this and if it has spoiled your friendship with ben i shall be very sorry for i do not think he is guilty answered miss celia  why not and thorny looked annoyed  ive watched also and he doesnt act like a deceitful boy  today i asked him if he wanted any money or should i put what i owe him with the rest and he looked me straight in the face with such honest grateful eyes i could not doubt him when he said keep it please i dont need any thing here you are all so good to me  now celia dont you be softhearted  hes a sly little dog and knows my eye is on him when i asked him what he saw in the dressingroom after he brought out the ball and looked sharply at him he laughed and said only a mouse as saucy as you please  do set the trap there i heard the mouse nibbling last night and it kept me awake we must have a cat or we shall be overrun  well shall i give ben a good blowing up or will you asked thorny scorning such poor prey as mice and bound to prove that he was in the right  ill let you know what i have decided in the morning be kind to ben meantime or i shall feel as if i had done you harm by letting you watch him  so it was left for that day and by the next miss celia had made up her mind to speak to ben she was just going down to breakfast when the sound of loud voices made her pause and listen it came from bens room where the two boys seemed to be disputing about something  i hope thorny has kept his promise she thought and hurried through the back entry fearing a general explosion  bens chamber was at the end and she could see and hear what was going on before she was near enough to interfere ben stood against his closet door looking as fierce and red as a turkeycock thorny sternly confronted him saying in an excited tone and with a threatening gesture you are hiding something in there and you cant deny it  i dont  better not i insist on seeing it  well you wont  what have you been stealing now  didnt steal itused to be minei only took it when i wanted it  i know what that means  youd better give it back or ill make you  stop cried a third voice as thorny put out his arm to clutch ben who looked ready to defend himself to the last gasp boys i will settle this affair is there anything hidden in the closet ben and miss celia came between the belligerent parties with her one hand up to part them  thorny fell back at once looking half ashamed of his heat and ben briefly answered with a gulp as if shame or anger made it hard to speak steadily  yes m there is  does it belong to you  yes m it does  where did you get it  up to squires  thats a lie muttered thorny to himself  bens eye flashed and his fist doubled up in spite of him but he restrained himself out of respect for miss celia who looked puzzled as she asked another question not quite sure how to proceed with the investigation is it money ben  no m it isnt  then what can it be  meow answered a fourth voice from the closet and as ben flung open the door a gray kitten walked out purring with satisfaction at her release  miss celia fell into a chair and laughed till her eyes were full thorny looked foolish and ben folded his arms curled up his nose and regarded his accuser with calm defiance while pussy sat down to wash her face as if her morning toilette had been interrupted by her sudden abduction  thats all very well but it doesnt mend matters much so you neednt laugh celia began thorny recovering himself and stubbornly bent on sifting the case to the bottom now he had begun  well it would if youd let a feller alone  she said she wanted a cat so i went and got the one they gave me when i was at the squires i went early and took her without asking and i had a right to explained ben much aggrieved by having his surprise spoiled  it was very kind of you and im glad to have this nice kitty we will shut her up in my room to catch the mice that plague me said miss celia picking up the little cat and wondering how she would get her two angry boys safely down stairs  the dressingroom she means you know the way and you dont need keys to get in added thorny with such sarcastic emphasis that ben felt some insult was intended and promptly resented it  you wont get me to climb any more trees after your balls and my cat wont catch any of your mice so you neednt ask me  cats dont catch thieves and they are what im after  what do you mean by that fiercely demanded ben  celia has lost some money out of her drawer and you wont let me see whats in yours so i thought perhaps youd got it blurted out thorny finding it hard to say the words angry as he was for the face opposite did not look like a guilty one  for a minute ben did not seem to understand him plainly as he spoke then he turned an angry scarlet and with a reproachful glance at his mistress opened the little drawer so that both could see all that it contained  they aint any thing but im fond of em they are all ive goti was afraid hed laugh at me that time so i wouldnt let him lookit was fathers birthday and i felt bad about him and sanch bens indignant voice got more and more indistinct as he stumbled on and broke down over the last words he did not cry however but threw back his little treasures as if half their sacredness was gone and making a strong effort at selfcontrol faced around asking of miss celia with a grieved look  did you think id steal anything of yours  i tried not to ben but what could i do it was gone and you the only stranger about the place  wasnt there any one to think bad of but me he said so sorrowfully that miss celia made up her mind on the spot that he was as innocent of the theft as the kitten now biting her buttons no other refreshment being offered  nobody for i know my girls well  yet eleven dollars are gone and i cannot imagine where or how for both drawer and door are always locked because my papers and valuables are in that room  what a lot but how could i get it if it was locked up and ben looked as if that question was unanswerable  folks that can climb in at windows for a ball can go the same way for money and get it easy enough when theyve only to pry open an old lock  thornys look and tone seemed to make plain to ben all that they had been suspecting and being innocent he was too perplexed and unhappy to defend himself his eye went from one to the other and seeing doubt in both faces his boyish heart sunk within him for he could prove nothing and his first impulse was to go away at once  i cant say any thing only that i didnt take the money  you wont believe it so id better go back where i come from they werent so kind but they trusted me and knew i wouldnt steal a cent you may keep my money and the kitty too i dont want em and snatching up his hat ben would gone straight away if thorny had not barred his passage  come now dont be mad  lets talk it over and if i m wrong ill take it all back and ask your pardon he said in a friendly tone rather scared at the consequences of his first attempt though as sure as ever that he was right  it would break my heart to have you go in that way ben  stay at least till your innocence is proved then no one can doubt what you say now  dont see how it can be proved answered ben appeased by her evident desire to trust him  well try as well as we know how and the first thing we will do is to give that old secretary a good rummage from top to bottom ive done it once but it is just possible that the bills may have slipped out of sight come now i cant rest till ive done all i can to comfort you and convince thorny miss celia rose as she spoke and led the way to the dressingroom which had no outlet except through her chamber still holding his hat ben followed with a troubled face and thorny brought up the rear doggedly determined to keep his eye on the little scamp till the matter was satisfactorily cleared up miss celia had made her proposal more to soothe the feelings of one boy and to employ the superfluous energies of the other than in the expectation of throwing any light upon the mystery for she was sadly puzzled by bens manner and much regretted that she had let her brother meddle in the matter  there she said unlocking the door with the key thorny reluctantly gave up to her this is the room and that is the drawer on the right the lower ones have seldom been opened since we came and hold only some of papas old books those upper ones you may turn out and investigate as much as you bless me heres something in your trap thorny and miss celia gave a little skip as she nearly trod on a long gray tall which hung out of the bole now filled by a plump mouse  but her brother was intent on more serious things and merely pushed the trap aside as he pulled out the drawer with an excited gesture which sent it and all its contents clattering to the floor  confound the old thing it always stuck so i had to give a jerk  now there it is topsyturvy and thorny looked much disgusted at his own awkwardness  no harm done i left nothing of value in it look back there ben and see if there is room for a paper to get worked over the top of the drawer i felt quite a crack but i dont believe it is possible for things to slip out the place was never full enough to overflow in any way  miss celia spoke to ben who was kneeling down to pick up the scattered papers among which were two marked dollar billsthornys bait for the thief ben looked into the dusty recess and then put in his hand saying carelessly  theres nothing but a bit of red stuff  my old penwiperwhy whats the matter asked miss celia as ben dropped the handful of what looked like rubbish  something warm and wiggly inside of it answered ben stooping to examine the contents of the little scarlet bundle baby mice aint they funny look just like mites of young pigs well have to kill em if youve caught their mamma he said forgetting his own trials in boyish curiosity about his find  miss celia stooped also and gently poked the red cradle with her finger for the tiny mice were nestling deeper into the fluff with small squeals of alarm suddenly she cried out boys boys ive found the thief look here pull out these bits and see if they wont make up my lost bills  down went the motherless babies as four ruthless hands pulled apart their cosey nest and there among the nibbled fragments appeared enough finely printed greenish paper to piece out parts of two bank bills a large cypher and part of a figure one were visible and that accounted for the ten but though there were other bits no figures could be found and they were willing to take the other bill on trust  now then am i a thief and a liar demanded ben pointing proudly to the telltale letters spread forth on the table over which all three had been eagerly bending  no i beg your pardon and im very sorry that we didnt look more carefully before we spoke then we all should have been spared this pain  all right old fellow forgive and forget  ill never think hard of you againon my honor i wont  as they spoke miss celia and her brother held out their hands frankly and heartily ben shook both but with a difference for he pressed the soft one gratefully remembering that its owner had always been good to him but the brown paw he gripped with a vengeful squeeze that made thorny pull it away in a hurry exclaiming goodnaturedly in spite of both physical and mental discomfort  come ben dont you bear malice for youve got the laugh on your side and we feel pretty small i do any way for after my fidgets all ive caught is a mouse  and her family  im so relieved im almost sorry the poor little mother is deadshe and her babies were so happy in the old penwiper said miss celia hastening to speak merrily for ben still looked indignant and she was much grieved at what had happened  a pretty expensive house began thorny looking about for the interesting orphans who had been left on the floor while their paperhangings were examined  no further anxiety need be felt for them however kitty had come upon the scene and as judge jury and prisoner turned to find the little witnesses they beheld the last pink mite going down pussys throat in one mouthful  i call that summary justicethe whole family executed on the spot give kit the mouse also and let us go to breakfast i feel as if i had found my appetite now this worry is off my mind said miss celia laughing so infectiously that ben had to join in spite of himself as she took his arm and led him away with a look which mutely asked his pardon over again  rather lively for a funeral procession said thorny following with the trap in his hand and puss at his heels adding to comfort his pride as a detective  well i said id catch the thief and i have though it is rather a small one    chapter xvii  bettys bravery  celia ive a notion that we ought to give ben something  a sort of peaceoffering you know for he feels dreadfully hurt about our suspecting him said thorny at dinner that day  i see he does though he tries to seem as bright and pleasant as ever i do not wonder and ive been thinking what i could do to soothe his feelings can you suggest any thing  cuffbuttons  i saw some jolly ones over at berryville oxidized silver with dogs heads on them yellow eyes and all as natural as could be those now would just suit him for his gotomeeting white shirtsneat appropriate and in memoriam  miss celia could not help laughing it was such a boyish suggestion but she agreed to it thinking thorny knew best and hoping the yelloweyed dogs would be as balm to bens wounds  well dear you may give those and lita shall give the little whip with a horses foot for a handle if it is not gone i saw it at the harness shop in town and ben admired it so much that i planned to give it to him on his birthday  that will tickle him immensely and if youd just let him put brown tops to my old boots and stick a cockade in his hat when he sits up behind the phaeton hed be a happy fellow laughed thorny who had discovered that one of bens ambitions was to be a tiptop groom  no thank you those things are out of place in america and would be absurd in a small country place like this his blue suit and straw hat please me better for a boy though a nicer little groom in livery or out no one could desire and you may tell him i said so  i will and hell look as proud as punch for he thinks every word you say worth a dozen from any one else but wont you give him something just some little trifle to show that we are both eating humble pie feeling sorry about the mouse money  i shall give him a set of schoolbooks and try to get him ready to begin when vacation is over an education is the best present we can make him and i want you to help me fit him to enter as well is he can bab and betty began little dearslent him their books and taught all they knew so ben got a taste and with the right encouragement would like to go on i am sure  thats so like you celia  always thinking of the best thing and doing it handsomely ill help like a house afire if he will let me but all day hes been as stiff as a poker so i dont believe he forgives me a bit  he will in time and if you are kind and patient he will be glad to have you help him i shall make it a sort of favor to me on his part to let you see to his lessons now and then it will be quite true for i dont want you to touch your latin or algebra till cool weather teaching him will be play to you  miss celias last words made her brother unbend his brows for he longed to get at his books again and the idea of being tutor to his manservant did not altogether suit him  ill tool him along at a great pace if he will only go geography and arithmetic shall be my share and you may have the writing and spelling it gives me the fidgets to set copies and hear children make a mess of words shall i get the books when i buy the other things can i go this afternoon  yes here is the list bab gave it to me  you can go if you will come home early and have your tooth filled  gloom fell at once upon thornys beaming face and he gave such a shrill whistle that his sister jumped in her chair as she added persuasively  it wont hurt a bit now and the longer you leave it the worse it will be dr mann is ready at any time and once over you will be at peace for months come my hero give your orders and take one of the girls to support you in the trying hour have bab she will enjoy it and amuse you with her chatter  as if i needed girls round for such a trifle as that returned thorny with a shrug though he groaned inwardly at the prospect before him as most of us do on such occasions i wouldnt take bab at any price shed only get into some scrape and upset the whole plan betty is the chicken for mea real little lady and as nice and purry as a kitten  very well ask her mother and take good care of her  let her tuck her dolly in and she will be contented anywhere theres a fine air and the awning is on the phaeton so you wont feel the sun start about three and drive carefully  betty was charmed to go for thorny was a sort of prince in her eyes and to be invited to such a grand expedition was an overwhelming honor bab was not surprised for since sanchos loss she had felt herself in disgrace and been unusually meek ben let her severely alone which much afflicted her for he was her great admiration and had been pleased to express his approbation of her agility and courage so often that she was ready to attempt any foolhardy feat to recover his regard but vainly did she risk her neck jumping off the highest beams in the barn trying to keep her balance standing on the donkeys back and leaping the lodge gate at a bound ben vouchsafed no reward by a look a smile a word of commendation and bab felt that nothing but sanchos return would ever restore the broken friendship  into faithful bettys bosom did she pour forth her remorseful lamentations often bursting out with the passionate exclamation if i could only find sanch and give him back to ben i wouldnt care if i tumbled down and broke all my legs right away such abandonment of woe made a deep impression on betty and she fell into the way of consoling her sister by cheerful prophecies and a firm belief that the organman would yet appear with the lost darling  ive got five cents of my berry money and ill buy you an orange if i see any promised betty stepping to kiss bab as the phaeton came to the door and thorny handed in a young lady whose white frock was so stiff with starch that it crackled like paper  lemons will do if oranges are gone  i like em to suck with lots of sugar answered bab feeling that the sour sadly predominated in her cup just now  dont she look sweet the dear murmured mrs moss proudly surveying her youngest  she certainly did sitting under the fringed canopy with belinda all in her best upon her lap as she turned to smile and nod with a face so bright and winsome under the little blue hat that it was no wonder mother and sister thought there never was such a perfect child as our betty  dr mann was busy when they arrived but would be ready in an hour so they did their shopping at once having made sure of the whip as they came along thorny added some candy to babs lemon and belinda had a cake which her mamma obligingly ate for her betty thought that aladdins palace could not have been more splendid than the jewellers shop where the canine cuffbuttons were bought but when they came to the bookstore she forgot gold silver and precious stones to revel in picturebooks while thorny selected bens modest school outfit seeing her delight and feeling particularly lavish with plenty of money in his pocket the young gentleman completed the childs bliss by telling her to choose whichever one she liked best out of the pile of walter cranes toybooks lying in bewildering colors before her  this one bab always wanted to see the dreadful cupboard and theres a picture of it here answered betty clasping a gorgeous copy of bluebeard to the little bosom which still heaved with the rapture of looking at that delicious mixture of lovely fatimas in pale azure gowns pink sister annes on the turret top crimson tyrants and yellow brothers with forests of plumage blowing wildly from their mushroomshaped caps  very good there you are then  now come on for the fun is over and the grind begins said thorny marching away to his doom with his tongue in his tooth and trepidation in his manly breast  shall i shut my eyes and hold your head quavered devoted betty as they went up the stairs so many reluctant feet had mounted before them  nonsense child never mind me  you look out of window and amuse yourself we shall not be long i guess and in went thorn silently hoping that the dentist had been suddenly called away or some person with an excruciating toothache would be waiting to take ether and so give our young man an excuse for postponing his job  but no dr mann was quite at leisure and full of smiling interest awaited his victim laying forth his unpleasant little tools with the exasperating alacrity of his kind glad to be released from any share in the operation betty retired to the back window to be as far away as possible and for half in hour was so absorbed in her book that poor thorny might have groaned dismally without disturbing her  done now directly only a trifle of  polishing off and a look round said dr mann at last and thorny with a yawn that nearly rent him asunder called out  thank goodness pack up bettykin  im all ready and shutting her book with a start she slipped down from the easy chair in a great hurry  but looking round took time and before the circuit of thornys mouth was satisfactorily made betty had become absorbed by a more interesting tale than even the immortal bluebeard a noise of childrens voices in the narrow alleyway behind the house attracted her attention the long window opened directly on the yard and the gate swung in the wind curious as fatima betty went to look but all she saw was a group of excited boys peeping between the bars of another gate further down  whats the matter she asked of two small girls who stood close by her longing but not daring to approach the scene of action  boys chasing a great black cat i believe answered one child  want to come and see added the other politely extending the invitation to the stranger  the thought of a cat in trouble would have nerved betty to face a dozen boys so she followed at once meeting several lads hurrying away on some important errand to judge from their anxious countenances  hold tight jimmy and let em peek if they want to he cant hurt anybody now said one of the dusty huntsmen who sat on the wide coping of the wall while two others held the gate as if a cat could only escape that way  you peek first susy and see if it looks nice said one little girl boosting her friend so that she could look through the bars in the upper part of the gate  no it s only an ugly old dog responded susy losing all interest at once and descending with a bounce  hes mad and juds gone to get his gun so we can shoot him called out one mischievous boy resenting the contempt expressed for their capture  aint neither howled another lad from his perch  mad dogs wont drink and this one is lapping out of a tub of water  well he may be and we dont know him and he hasnt got any muzzle on and the police will kill him if jud dont answered the sanguinary youth who had first started the chase after the poor animal which had come limping into town so evidently a lost dog that no one felt any hesitation in stoning him  we must go right home my mother is dreadful fraid of mad dogs and so is yours said susy and having satisfied their curiosity the young ladies prudently retired  but betty had not had her peep and could not resist one look for she had heard of these unhappy animals and thought bab would like to know how they looked so she stood on tiptoe and got a good view of a dusty brownish dog lying on the grass close by with his tongue hanging out while he panted as if exhausted by fatigue and fear for he still cast apprehensive glances at the wall which divided him from his tormentors  his eyes are just like sanchs said betty to herself unconscious that she spoke aloud till she saw the creature prick up his cars and half rise as if he had been called  he looks as if he knew me but it isnt our sancho he was a lovely dog betty said that to the little boy peeping in beside her but before he could make any reply the brown beast stood straight up with an inquiring bark while his eyes shone like topaz and the short tail wagged excitedly  why thats just the way sanch used to do cried betty bewildered by the familiar ways of this unfamiliarlooking dog  as if the repetition of his name settled his own doubts he leaped toward the gate and thrust a pink nose between the bars with a howl of recognition as bettys face was more clearly seen the boys tumbled precipitately from their perches and the little girl fell back alarmed yet could not bear to run away and leave those imploring eyes pleading to her through the bars so eloquently  he acts just like our dog but i dont see how it can be him  sancho sancho is it really you called betty at her wits end what to do  bow wow wow answered the wellknown bark and the little tail did all it could to emphasize the sound while the eyes were so full of dumb love and joy the child could not refuse to believe that this ugly stray was their own sancho strangely transformed  all of a sudden the thought rushed into her mind how glad ben would beand bab would feel all happy again i must carry him home  never stopping to think of danger and forgetting all her doubts betty caught the gate handle out of jimmys grasp exclaiming eagerly he is our dog let me go in i aint afraid  not till jud comes back he told us we mustnt answered the astonished jimmy thinking the little girl as mad as the dog  with a confused idea that the unknown jud had gone for a gun to shoot sanch betty gave a desperate pull at the latch and ran into the yard bent on saving her friend that it was a friend there could be no further question for though the creature rushed at her as if about to devour her at a mouthful it was only to roll ecstatically at her feet lick her hands and gaze into her face trying to pant out the welcome which he could not utter an older and more prudent person would have waited to make sure before venturing in but confiding betty knew little of the danger which she might have run her heart spoke more quickly than her head and not stopping to have the truth proved she took the brown dog on trust and found it was indeed dear sanch  sitting on the grass she hugged him close careless of tumbled hat dusty paws on her clean frock or a row of strange boys staring from the wall  darling doggy where have you been so long she cried the great thing sprawling across her lap as if he could not get near enough to his brave little protector did they make you black and beat you dear oh sanch where is your tailyour pretty tail  a plaintive growl and a pathetic wag was all the answer he could make to these tender inquiries for never would the story of his wrongs be known and never could the glory of his doggish beauty be restored betty was trying to comfort him with pats and praises when a new face appeared at the gate and thornys authoritative voice called out  betty moss what on earth are you doing in  there with that dirty beast  its sanch its sanch oh come and see shrieked betty flying up to lead forth her prize but the gate was held fast for some one said the words mad dog and thorny was very naturally alarmed because he had already seen one dont stay there another minute get up on that bench and ill pull you over directed thorny mounting the wall to rescue his charge in hot haste for the dog did certainly behave queerly limping hurriedly to and fro as if anxious to escape no wonder when sancho heard a voice he knew and recognized another face yet did not meet as kind a welcome as before  no im not coming out till he does  it is sanch and im going to take him home to ben answered betty decidedly as she wet her handkerchief in the rain water to bind up the swollen paw that had travelled many miles to rest in her little hand again  youre crazy child  that is no more bens dog than i am  see if it isnt cried betty perfectly unshaken in her faith and recalling the words of command as well as she could she tried to put sancho through his little performance as the surest proof that she was right the poor fellow did his best weary and footsore though he was but when it came to taking his tail in his mouth to waltz he gave it up and dropping down hid his face in his paws as he always did when any of his tricks failed the act was almost pathetic now for one of the paws was bandaged and his whole attitude expressed the humiliation of a broken spirit  that touched thorny and quite convinced both of the dogs sanity and identity he sprung down from the wall with bens own whistle which gladdened sanchos longing ear as much as the boys rough caresses comforted his homesick heart  now lets carry him right home and surprise ben  wont he be pleased said betty so in earnest that she tried to lift the big brute in spite of his protesting yelps  you are a little trump to find him out in spite of all the horrid things that have been done to him we must have a rope to lead him for hes got no collar and no muzzle he has got friends though and id like to see any one touch him now out of the way there boy looking as commanding as a drummajor thorny cleared a passage and with one arm about his neck betty proudly led her treasure magnanimously ignoring his late foes and keeping his eye fixed on the faithful friend whose tender little heart had known him in spite of all disguises  i found him sir and the lad who had been most eager for the shooting stepped forward to claim any reward that might be offered for the now valuable victim  i kept him safe till she came added the jailer jimmy speaking for himself  i said he wasnt mad cried a third feeling that his discrimination deserved approval  jud aint my brother said the fourth eager to clear his skirts from all offence  but all of you chased and stoned him i suppose youd better look out or youll get reported to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  with this awful and mysterious threat thorny slammed the doctors gate in the faces of the mercenary youths nipping their hopes in the bud and teaching them a good lesson  after one astonished stare lita accepted sancho without demur and they greeted one another cordially nose to nose instead of shaking hands then the dog nestled into his old place under the linen duster with a grunt of intense content and soon fell fast asleep quite worn out with fatigue no roman conqueror bearing untold treasures with him ever approached the eternal city feeling richer or prouder than did miss betty as she rolled rapidly toward the little brown house with the captive won by her own arms poor belinda was forgotten in a corner bluebeard was thrust under the cushion and the lovely lemon was squeezed before its time by being sat upon for all the child could think of was bens delight babs remorseful burden lifted off mas surprise and miss celias pleasure she could hardly realize the happy fact and kept peeping under the cover to be sure that the dear dingy bunch at her feet was truly there  ill tell you how well do it said thorny breaking a long silence as betty composed herself with an irrepressible wriggle of delight after one of these refreshing peeps well keep sanch hidden and smuggle him into bens old room at your house then ill drive on to the barn and not say a word but send ben to get something out of that room you just let him in to see what hell do ill bet you a dollar he wont know his own dog  i dont believe i can keep from screaming right out when i see him but ill try oh wont it be funand betty clapped her hands in joyful anticipation of that exciting moment  a nice little plan but master thorny forgot the keen senses of the amiable animal snoring peacefully among his boots and when they stopped at the lodge he had barely time to say in a whisper  bens coming cover sanch and let me get him in quick before the dog was out of the phaeton like a bombshell and the approaching boy went down as if shot for sancho gave one leap and the two rolled over and over with a shout and a bark of rapturous recognition  who is hurt asked mrs moss running out with floury hands uplifted in alarm  is it a bear cried bab rushing after her beater in hand for a dancing bear was the delight of her heart  sanchos found sanchos found  shouted thorny throwing up his hat like a lunatic  found found found echoed betty dancing wildly about as if she too had lost her little wits  where how when who did it asked mrs moss clapping her dusty hands delightedly  it isnt its an old dirty brown thing stammered bab as the dog came uppermost for a minute and then rooted into bens jacket as if he smelt a woodchuck and was bound to have him out directly  then thorny with many interruptions from betty poured forth the wondrous tale to which bab and his mother listened breathlessly while the muffins burned as black as a coal and nobody cared a bit  my precious lamb how did you dare to do such a thing exclaimed mrs moss hugging the small heroine with mingled admiration and alarm  id have dared and slapped those horrid boys too i wish id gone and bab felt that she had for ever lost the chance of distinguishing herself  who cut his tail off demanded ben in a menacing tone as he came uppermost in his turn dusty red and breathless but radiant  the wretch who stole him  i suppose and he deserves to be hung answered thorny hotly  if ever i catch him illill cut his nose off roared ben with such a vengeful glare that sanch barked fiercely and it was well that the unknown wretch was not there for it would have gone hardly with him since even gentle betty frowned while bab brandished the eggbeater menacingly and their mother indignantly declared that it was too bad  relieved by this general outburst they composed their outraged feelings and while the returned wanderer went from one to another to receive a tender welcome from each the story of his recovery was more calmly told ben listened with his eye devouring the injured dog and when thorny paused he turned to the little heroine saying solemnly as he laid her hand with his own on sanchos head  betty moss ill never forget what you did from this minute half of sanch is your truly own and if i die you shall have the whole of him and ben sealed the precious gift with a sounding kiss on either chubby check  betty was so deeply touched by this noble bequest that the blue eyes filled and would have overflowed if sanch had not politely offered his tongue like a red pockethandkerchlef and so made her laugh the drops away while bab set the rest off by saying gloomily  i mean to play with all the mad dogs i can find then folks will think im smart and give me nice things  poor old bab ill forgive you now and lend you my half whenever you want it said ben feeling at peace now with all mankind including girls who tagged  come and show him to celia begged thorny eager to fight his battles over again  better wash him up first hes a sight to see poor thing suggested mrs moss as she ran in suddenly remembering her muffins  it will take a lot of washings to get that brown stuff off  see his pretty pink skin is all stained with it well bleach him out and his curls will grow and hell be as good as everall but  ben could not finish and a general wail went up for the departed tassel that would never wave proudly in the breeze again  ill buy him a new one  now form the procession and let us go in style said thorny cheerily as he swung betty to his shoulder and marched away whistling hail the conquering hero comes while ben and his bowwow followed arminarm and bab brought up the rear banging on a milkpan with the eggbeater    chapter xviii  bows and arrows  if sanchos abduction made a stir one may easily imagine with what warmth and interest he was welcomed back when his wrongs and wanderings were known for several days he held regular levees that curious boys and sympathizing girls might see and pity the changed and curtailed dog sancho behaved with dignified affability and sat upon his mat in the coachhouse pensively eying his guests and patiently submitting to their caresses while ben and thorny took turns to tell the few tragical facts which were not shrouded in the deepest mystery if the interesting sufferer could only have spoken what thrilling adventures and hairbreadth escapes he might have related but alas he was dumb and the secrets of that memorable month never were revealed  the lame paw soon healed the dingy color slowly yielded to many washings the woolly coat began to knot up into little curls a new collar handsomely marked made him a respectable dog and sancho was himself again but it was evident that his sufferings were not forgotten his once sweet temper was a trifle soured and with a few exceptions he had lost his faith in mankind before he had been the most benevolent and hospitable of dogs now he eyed all strangers suspiciously and the sight of a shabby man made him growl and bristle up as if the memory of his wrongs still burned hotly within him  fortunately his gratitude was stronger than his resentment and he never seemed to forget that he owed his life to bettyrunning to meet her whenever she appeared instantly obeying her commands and suffering no one to molest her when he walked watchfully beside her with her hand upon his neck as they had walked out of the almost fatal backyard together faithful friends for ever  miss celia called them little una and her lion and read the pretty story to the children when they wondered what she meant ben with great pains taught the dog to spell betty and surprised her with a display of this new accomplishment which gratified her so much that she was never tired of seeing sanch paw the five red letters into place then come and lay his nose in her hand as if he added thats the name of my dear mistress  of course bab was glad to have everything pleasant and friendly again but in a little dark corner of her heart there was a drop of envy and a desperate desire to do something which would make every one in her small world like and praise her as they did betty trying to be as good and gentle did not satisfy her she must do something brave or surprising and no chance for distinguishing herself in that way seemed likely to appear betty was as fond as ever and the boys were very kind to her but she felt that they both liked little betcinda as they called her best because she found sanch and never seemed to know that she had done any thing brave in defending him against all odds bab did not tell any one how she felt but endeavored to be amiable while waiting for her chance to come and when it did arrive made the most of it though there was nothing heroic to add a charm  miss celias arm had been doing very well but would of course be useless for some time longer finding that the afternoon readings amused herself as much as they did the children she kept them up and brought out all her old favorites enjoying a double pleasure in seeing that her young audience relished them as much as she did when a child for to all but thorny they were brand new out of one of these stories came much amusement for all and satisfaction for one of the party  celia did you bring our old bows asked her brother eagerly as she put down the book from which she had been reading miss edgeworths capital story of waste not want not or two strings to your bow  yes i brought all the playthings we left stored away in uncles garret when we went abroad the bows are in the long box where you found the mallets fishingrods and bats the old quivers and a few arrows are there also i believe what is the idea now asked miss celia in her turn as thorny bounced up in a great hurry  im going to teach ben to shoot  grand fun this hot weather and byandby well have an archery meeting and you can give us a prize come on ben ive got plenty of whipcord to rig up the bows and then well show the ladies some firstclass shooting  i cant never had a decent bow in my life  the little gilt one i used to wave round when i was a coopid wasnt worth a cent to go answered ben feeling as if that painted prodigy must have been a very distant connection of the respectable young person now walking off arm in arm with the lord of the manor  practice is all you want  i used to be a capital shot but i dont believe i could hit any thing but a barndoor now answered thorny encouragingly  as the boys vanished with much tramping of boots and banging of doors bab observed in the youngladyish tone she was apt to use when she composed her active little mind and body to the feminine task of needlework  we used to make bows of whalebone when we were little girls but we are too old to play so now  id like to but bab wont cause she s most leven years old said honest betty placidly rubbing her needle in the ruster as she called the family emerybag  grown people enjoy archery as bow and arrow shooting is called especially in england i was reading about it the other day and saw a picture of queen victoria with her bow so you neednt be ashamed of it bab said miss celia rummaging among the books and papers in her sofa corner to find the magazine she wanted thinking a new play would be as good for the girls as for the big boys  a queen just think and betty looked much impressed by the fact as well as uplifted by the knowledge that her friend did not agree in thinking her silly because she preferred playing with a harmless homemade toy to firing stones or snapping a popgun  in old times bows and arrows were used to fight great battles with and we read how the english archers shot so well that the air was dark with arrows and many men were killed  so did the indians have em and ive got some stone arrowheadsfound em by the river in the dirt cried bab waking up for battles interested her more than queens  while you finish your stints ill tell you a little story about the indians said miss celia lying back on her cushions while the needles began to go again for the prospect of a story could not be resisted  a century or more ago in a small settlement on the banks of the connecticutwhich means the long river of pinesthere lived a little girl called matty kilburn on a hill stood the fort where the people ran for protection in any danger for the country was new and wild and more than once the indians had come down the river in their canoes and burned the houses killed men and carried away women and children matty lived alone with her father but felt quite safe in the log house for he was never far away one afternoon as the farmers were all busy in their fields the bell rang suddenlya sign that there was danger nearand dropping their rakes or axes the men hurried to their houses to save wives and babies and such few treasures as they could mr kilburn caught up his gun with one hand and his little girl with the other and ran as fast as he could toward the fort but before he could reach it he heard a yell and saw the red men coming up from the river then he knew it would be in vain to try to get in so he looked about for a safe place to hide matty till he could come for her he was a brave man and could fight so he had no thought of hiding while his neighbors needed help but the dear little daughter must be cared for first  in the corner of the lonely pasture which they dared not cross stood a big hollow elm and there the farmer hastily hid matty dropping her down into the dim nook round the mouth of which young shoots had grown so that no one would have suspected any hole was there  lie still child till i come say your prayers and wait for father said the man as he parted the leaves for a last glance at the small frightened face looking up at him  come soon whispered matty and tried to smile bravely as a stout settlers girl should  mr kilburn went away and was taken prisoner in the fight carried off and for years no one knew whether he was alive or dead people missed matty but supposed she was with her father and never expected to see her again a great while afterward the poor man came back having escaped and made his way through the wilderness to his old home his first question was for matty but no one had seen her and when he told them where he had left her they shook their heads as if they thought he was crazy but they went to look that he might be satisfied and he was for they they found some little bones some faded bits of cloth and two rusty silver buckles marked with mattys name in what had once been her shoes an indian arrow lay there too showing why she had never cried for help but waited patiently so long for father to come and find her  if miss celia expected to see the last bit of hem done when her story ended she was disappointed for not a dozen stitches had been taken betty was using her crash towel for a handkerchief and babs lay on the ground as she listened with snapping eyes to the little tragedy  is it true asked betty hoping to find relief in being told that it was not  yes i have seen the tree and the mound where the fort was and the rusty buckles in an old farmhouse where other kilburns live near the spot where it all happened answered miss celia looking out the picture of victoria to console her auditors  well play that in the old appletree  betty can scrooch down and ill be the father and put leaves on her and then ill be a great injun and fire at her i can make arrows and it will be fun wont it cried bab charmed with the new drama in which she could act the leading parts  no it wont i dont like to go in a cobwebby hole and have you play kill me ill make a nice fort of hay and be all safe and you can put dinah down there for matty i dont love her any more now her last eye has tumbled out and you may shoot her just as much as yon like  before bab could agree to this satisfactory arrangement thorny appeared singing as he aimed at a fat robin whose red waistcoat looked rather warm and winterish that august day      so he took up his bow     and he feathered his arrow     and said i will shoot     this little cocksparrow  but he didnt chirped the robin flying away with a contemptuous flirt of his rustyblack tail  that is exactly what you must promise not to do boys  fire away at your targets as much as you like but do not harm any living creature said miss celia as ben followed armed and equipped with her own longunused accoutrements  of course we wont if you say so but with a little practice i could bring down a bird as well as that fellow you read to me about with his woodpeckers and larks and herons answered thorny who had much enjoyed the article while his sister lamented over the destruction of the innocent birds  youd do well to borrow the squires old stuffed owl for a target there would be some chance of your hitting him he is so big said his sister who always made fun of the boy when he began to brag  thornys only reply was to send his arrow straight up so far out of sight that it was a long while coming down again to stick quivering in the ground near by whence sancho brought it in his mouth evidently highly approving of a game in which he could join  not bad for a beginning  now ben fire away  but bens experience with bows was small and in spite of his praiseworthy efforts to imitate his great exemplar the arrow only turned a feeble sort of somersault and descended perilously near babs uplifted nose  if you endanger other peoples life and liberty in your pursuit of happiness i shall have to confiscate your arms boys take the orchard for your archery ground that is safe and we can see you as we sit here i wish i had two hands so that i could paint you a fine gay target and miss celia looked regretfully at the injured arm which as yet was of little use  i wish you could shoot too you used to beat all the girls and i was proud of you answered thorny with the air of a fond elder brother though at the time he alluded to he was about twelve and hardly up to his sisters shoulder  thank you i shall be happy to give my place to bab and betty if you will make them some bows and arrows they could not use those long ones  the young gentlemen did not take the hint as quickly as miss celia hoped they would in fact both looked rather blank at the suggestion as boys generally do when it is proposed that girlsespecially small onesshall join in any game they are playing  praps it would be too much trouble began betty in her winning little voice  i can make my own declared bab with an independent toss of the head  not a bit ill make you the jolliest small bow that ever was belinda thorny hastened to say softened by the appealing glance of the little maid  you can use mine bab youve got such a strong fist i guess you could pull it added ben remembering that it would not be amiss to have a comrade who shot worse than he did for he felt very inferior to thorny in many ways and being used to praise had missed it very much since he retired to private life  i will be umpire and brighten up the silver arrow i sometimes pin my hair with for a prize unless we can find something better proposed miss celia glad to see that question settled and every prospect of the new play being a pleasant amusement for the hot weather  it was astonishing how soon archery became the fashion in that town for the boys discussed it enthusiastically all that evening formed the william tell club next day with bab and betty as honorary members and before the week was out nearly every lad was seen like young norval with bended bow and quiver full of arrows shooting away with a charming disregard of the safety of their fellow citizens banished by the authorities to secluded spots the members of the club set up their targets and practised indefatigably especially ben who soon discovered that his early gymnastics had given him a sinewy arm and a true eye and taking sanch into partnership as pickerup he got more shots out of an hour than those who had to run to and fro  thorny easily recovered much of his former skill but his strength had not fully returned and he soon grew tired bab on the contrary threw herself into the contest heart and soul and tugged away at the new bow miss celia gave her for bens was too heavy no other girls were admitted so the outsiders got up a club of their own and called it the victoria the name being suggested by the magazine article which went the rounds as a general guide and reference book bab and betty belonged to this club and duly reported the doings of the boys with whom they had a right to shoot if they chose but soon waived the right plainly seeing that their absence would be regarded in the light of a favor  the archery fever raged as fiercely as the baseball epidemic had done before it and not only did the magazine circulate freely but miss edgeworths story which was eagerly read and so much admired that the girls at once mounted green ribbons and the boys kept yards of whipcord in their pockets like the provident benjamin of the tale  every one enjoyed the new play very much and something grew out of it which was a lasting pleasure to many long after the bows and arrows were forgotten seeing how glad the children were to get a new story miss celia was moved to send a box of booksold and newto the town library which was but scantily supplied as country libraries are apt to be this donation produced a good effect for other people hunted up all the volumes they could spare for the same purpose and the dusty shelves in the little room behind the postoffice filled up amazingly coming in vacation time they were hailed with delight and ancient books of travel as well as modern tales were feasted upon by happy young folks with plenty of time to enjoy them in peace  the success of her first attempt at being a public benefactor pleased miss celia very much and suggested other ways in which she might serve the quiet town where she seemed to feel that work was waiting for her to do she said little to any one but the friend over the sea yet various plans were made then that blossomed beautifully byandby    chapter xix  speaking pieces  the first of september came all too soon and school began  among the boys and girls who went trooping up to the east corner knowledgebox as they called it was our friend ben with a pile of neat books under his arm he felt very strange and decidedly shy but put on a bold face and let nobody guess that though nearly thirteen he had never been to school before miss celia had told his story to teacher and she being a kind little woman with young brothers of her own made things as easy for him as she could in reading and writing he did very well and proudly took his place among lads of his own age but when it came to arithmetic and geography he had to go down a long way and begin almost at the beginning in spite of thornys efforts to tool him along fast it mortified him sadly but there was no help for it and in some of the classes he had dear little betty to console with him when he failed and smile contentedly when he got above her as he soon began to dofor she was not a quick child and plodded through first parts long after sister bab was flourishing away among girls much older than herself  fortunately ben was a short boy and a clever one so he did not look out of place among the ten and eleven year olders and fell upon his lessons with the same resolution with which he used to take a new leap or practise patiently till he could touch his heels with his head that sort of exercise had given him a strong elastic little body this kind was to train his mind and make its faculties as useful quick and sure as the obedient muscles nerves and eye which kept him safe where others would have broken their necks he knew this and found much consolation in the fact that though mental arithmetic was a hopeless task he could turn a dozen somersaults and come up as steady as a judge when the boys laughed at him for saying that china was in africa he routed them entirely by his superior knowledge of the animals belonging to that wild country and when first class in reading was called he marched up with the proud consciousness that the shortest boy in it did better than tall moses towne or fat sam kitteridge  teacher praised him all she honestly could and corrected his many blunders so quietly that he soon ceased to be a deep distressful red during recitation and tugged away so manfully that no one could help respecting him for his efforts and trying to make light of his failures so the first hard week went by and though the boys heart had sunk many a time at the prospect of a protracted wrestle with his own ignorance he made up his mind to win and went at it again on the monday with fresh zeal all the better and braver for a good cheery talk with miss celia in the sunday evening twilight  he did not tell her one of his greatest trials however because he thought she could not help him there some of the children rather looked down upon him called him tramp and beggar twitted him with having been a circus boy and lived in a tent like a gypsy they did not mean to be cruel but did it for the sake of teasing never stopping to think how much such sport can make a fellowcreature suffer being a plucky fellow ben pretended not to mind but he did feel it keenly because he wanted to start afresh and be like other boys he was not ashamed of the old life but finding those around him disapproved of it he was glad to let it be forgotten even by himself for his latest recollections were not happy ones and present comforts made past hardships seem harder than before  he said nothing of this to miss celia but she found it out and liked him all the better for keeping some of his small worries to himself bab and betty came over monday afternoon full of indignation at some boyish insult sam had put upon ben and finding them too full of it to enjoy the reading miss celia asked what the matter was then both little girls burst out in a rapid succession of broken exclamations which did not give a very clear idea of the difficulty  sam didnt like it because ben jumped farther than he did  and he said ben ought to be in the poorhouse  and ben said he ought to be in it pigpen  so he hadsuch a greedy thing bringing lovely big apples and not giving any one a single bite  then he was mad and we all laughed and he said want to fight  and ben said no thanky not much fun in pounding a featherbed  oh he was awfully mad then and chased ben up the big maple  hes there now for sam wont let him come down till he takes it all back  ben wont and i do believe hell have to stay up all night said betty distressfully  he wont care and well have fun firing up his supper  nut cakes and cheese will go splendidly and may be baked pears wouldnt get smashed hes such a good catch added bab decidedly relishing the prospect  if he does not come by teatime we will go and look after him it seems to me i have heard something about sams troubling him before havent i asked miss celia ready to defend her protege against all unfair persecution  yesm sam and mose are always plaguing ben they are big boys and we cant make them stop i wont let the girls do it and the little boys dont dare to since teacher spoke to them answered bab  why does not teacher speak to the big ones  ben wont tell of them or let us  he says hell fight his own battles and hates telltales i guess he wont like to have us tell you but i dont care for it is too bad and betty looked ready to cry over her friends tribulations  im glad you did for i will attend to it and stop this sort of thing said miss celia after the children had told some of the tormenting speeches which had tried poor ben  just then thorny appeared looking much amused and the little girls both called out in a breath did you see ben and get him down  he got himself down in the neatest way you can imagine and thorny laughed at the recollection  where is sam asked bab  staring up at the sky to see where ben has flown to  oh tell about it begged betty  well i came along and found ben treed and sam stoning him i stopped that at once and told the fat boy to be off he said he wouldnt till ben begged his pardon and ben said he wouldnt do it if he stayed up for a week i was just preparing to give that rascal a scientific thrashing when a load of hay came along and ben dropped on to it so quietly that sam who was trying to bully me never saw him go it tickled me so i told sam i guessed id let him off that time and walked away leaving him to hunt for ben and wonder where the dickens he had vanished to  the idea of sams bewilderment amused the others as much as thorny and they all had a good laugh over it before miss celia asked  where has ben gone now  oh hell take a little ride and then slip down and race home full of the fun of it but ive got to settle sam i wont have our ben hectored by any one  but yourself put in his sister with a sly smile for thorny was rather domineering at times  he doesnt mind my poking him up now and then its good for him and i always take his part against other people sam is a bully and so is mose and ill thrash them both if they dont stop  anxious to curb her brothers pugnacious propensities miss celia proposed milder measures promising to speak to the boys herself if there was any more trouble  i have been thinking that we should have some sort of merrymaking for ben on his birthday my plan was a very simple one but i will enlarge it and have all the young folks come and ben shall be king of the fun he needs encouragement in welldoing for he does try and now the first hard part is nearly over i am sure he will get on bravely if we treat him with respect and show our regard for him others will follow our example and that will be better than fighting about it  so it will  what shall we do to make our party tiptop asked thorny falling into the trap at once for he dearly loved to get up theatricals and had not had any for a long time  we will plan something splendid a grand combination as you used to call your droll mixtures of tragedy comedy melodrama and farce answered his sister with her head already full of lively plots  well startle the natives  i dont believe they ever saw a play in all their lives hey bab  ive seen a circus  we dress up and do babes in the wood added betty with dignity  pho thats nothing  ill show you acting that will make your hair stand on end and you shall act too bab will be capital for the naughty girls began thorny excited by the prospect of producing a sensation on the boards and always ready to tease the girls  before betty could protest that she did not want her hair to stand up or bab could indignantly decline the role offered her a shrill whistle was heard and miss celia whispered with a warning look  hush ben is coming and he must not know any thing about this yet  the next day was wednesday and in the afternoon miss celia went to hear the children speak pieces though it was very seldom that any of the busy matrons and elder sisters found time or inclination for these displays of youthful oratory miss celia and mrs moss were all the audience on this occasion but teacher was both pleased and proud to see them and a general rustle went through the school as they came in all the girls turning from the visitors to nod at bab and betty who smiled all over their round faces to see ma sitting up side of teacher and the boys grinned at ben whose heart began to beat fast at the thought of his dear mistress coming so far to hear him say his piece  thorny had recommended marco bozzaris but ben preferred john gilpin and ran the famous race with much spirit making excellent time in some parts and having to be spurred a little in others but came out all right though quite breathless at the end sitting down amid great applause some of which curiously enough seemed to come from outside which in fact it did for thorny was bound to hear but would not come in lest his presence should abash one orator at least  other pieces followed all more or less patriotic and warlike among the boys sentimental among the girls sam broke down in his attempt to give one of websters great speeches little cy fay boldly attacked      again to the battle achaians  and shrieked his way through it in a shrill small voice bound to do honor to the older brother who had trained him even if he broke a vessel in the attempt billy chose a wellworn piece but gave it a new interest by his style of delivery for his gestures were so spasmodic he looked as if going into a fit and he did such astonishing things with his voice that one never knew whether a howl or a growl would come next when      the woods against a stormy sky     their giant branches tossed  billys arms went round like the sails of a windmill the hymns of lofty cheer not only shook the depths of the desert gloom but the small children on their little benches and the schoolhouse literally rang to the anthems of the free when the ocean eagle soared billy appeared to be going bodily up and the pines of the forest roared as if they had taken lessons of van amburghs biggest lion womans fearless eye was expressed by a wild glare manhoods brow severely high by a sudden clutch at the reddish locks falling over the orators hot forehead and a sounding thump on his blue checked bosom told where the fiery heart of youth was located what sought they thus far he asked in such a natural and inquiring tone with his eye fixed on mamie peters that the startled innocent replied dunno which caused the speaker to close in haste devoutly pointing a stubby finger upward at the last line  this was considered the gem of the collection and billy took his seat proudly conscious that his native town boasted an orator who in time would utterly eclipse edward everett and wendell phillips  sally folsom led off with the coral grove chosen for the express purpose of making her friend almira mullet start and blush when she recited the second line of that pleasing poem      where the purple mullet and goldfish rove  one of the older girls gave wordsworths lost love in a pensive tone clasping her hands and bringing out the o as if a sudden twinge of toothache seized her when she ended      but she is in her grave and o      the difference to me  bab always chose a funny piece and on this afternoon set them all laughing by the spirit with which she spoke the droll poem pussys class which some of my young readers may have read the meou and the sptzz were capital and when the fond mamma rubbed her nose the children shouted for miss bab made a paw of her hand and ended with an impromptu purr which was considered the best imitation ever presented to an appreciative public betty bashfully murmurred little white lily swaying to and fro as regularly as if in no other way could the rhymes be ground out of her memory  that is all i believe  if either of the ladies would like to say a few words to the children i should be pleased to have them said teacher politely pausing before she dismissed school with a song  please m  id like to speak my piece answered miss celia obeying a sudden impulse and stepping forward with her hat in her hand she made a pretty courtesy before she recited mary howitts sweet little ballad mabel on midsummer day  she looked so young and merry and used such simple but expressive gestures and spoke in such a clear soft voice that the children sat as if spellbound learning several lessons from this new teacher whose performance charmed them from beginning to end and left a moral which all could understand and carry away in that last verse      tis good to make all duty sweet     to be alert and kind     tis good like littie mabel     to have a willing mind  of course there was an enthusiastic clapping when miss celia sat down but even while hands applauded consciences pricked and undone tasks complaining words and sour faces seemed to rise up reproachfully before many of the children as well as their own faults of elocution  now we will sing said teacher and a great clearing of throats ensued but before a note could be uttered the halfopen door swung wide and sancho with bens hat on walked in upon his hindlegs and stood with his paws meekly folded while a voice from the entry sang rapidly      benny had a little dog     his fleece was white as snow     and everywhere that benny went     the dog was sure to go      he went into the school one day     which was against the rule     it made the children laugh and play     to see a dog  mischievous thorny got no further for a general explosion of laughter drowned the last words and bens command out you rascal sent sanch to the rightabout in doublequick time  miss celia tried to apologize for her bad brother and teacher tried to assure her that it didnt matter in the least as this was always a merry time and mrs moss vainly shook her finger at her naughty daughters they as well as the others would have their laugh out and only partially sobered down when the bell rang for attention they thought they were to be dismissed and repressed their giggles as well as they could in order to get a good start for a vociferous roar when they got out but to their great surprise the pretty lady stood up again and said in her friendly way  i just want to thank you for this pleasant little exhibition and ask leave to come again i also wish to invite you all to my boys birthday party on saturday week the archery meeting is to be in the afternoon and both clubs will be there i believe in the evening we are going to have some fun when we can laugh as much as we please without breaking any of the rules in bens name i invite you and hope you will all come for we mean to make this the happiest birthday he ever had  there were twenty pupils in the room but the eighty hands and feet made such a racket at this announcement that an outsider would have thought a hundred children at least must have been at it miss celia was a general favorite because she nodded to all the girls called the boys by their last names even addressing some of the largest as mr which won their hearts at once so that if she had invited them all to come and be whipped they would have gone sure that it was some delightful joke with what eagerness they accepted the present invitation one can easily imagine though they never guessed why she gave it in that way and bens face was a sight to see he was so pleased and proud at the honor done him that he did not know where to look and was glad to rush out with the other boys and vent his emotions in whoops of delight he knew that some little plot was being concocted for his birthday but never dreamed of any thing so grand as asking the whole school teacher and all the effect of the invitation was seen with comical rapidity for the boys became overpowering in their friendly attentions to ben even sam fearing he might be left out promptly offered the peaceful olivebranch in the shape of a big apple warm from his pocket and mose proposed a trade of jackknives which would be greatly to bens advantage but thorny made the noblest sacrifice of all for he said to his sister as they walked home together  im not going to try for the prize at all  i shoot so much better than the rest having had more practice you know that it is hardly fair ben and billy are next best and about even for bens strong wrist makes up for billys true eye and both want to win if i am out of the way ben stands a good chance for the other fellows dont amount to much  bab does she shoots nearly as well as ben and wants to win even more than he or billy she must have her chance at any rate  so she may but she wont do any thing girls cant though it s good exercise and pleases them to try  if i had full use of both my arms id show you that girls can do a great deal when they like dont be too lofty young man for you may have to come down laughed miss celia amused by his airs  no fear and thorny calmly departed to set his targets for bens practice  we shall see and from that moment miss celia made bab her especial pupil feeling that a little lesson would be good for mr thorny who rather lorded it over the other young people there was a spice of mischief in it for miss celia was very young at heart in spite of her twentyfour years and she was bound to see that her side had a fair chance believing that girls can do whatever they are willing to strive patiently and wisely for  so she kept bab at work early and late giving her all the hints and help she could with only one efficient hand and bab was delighted to think she did well enough to shoot with the club her arms ached and her fingers grew hard with twanging the bow but she was indefatigable and being a strong tall child of her age with a great love of all athletic sports she got on fast and well soon learning to send arrow after arrow with ever increasing accuracy nearer and nearer to the bullseye  the boys took very little notice of her being much absorbed in their own affairs but betty did for bab what sancho did for ben and trotted after arrows till her short legs were sadly tired though her patience never gave out she was so sure bab would win that she cared nothing about her own success practising little and seldom hitting any thing when she tried    chapter xx  bens birthday  a superb display of flags flapped gayly in the breeze on the september morning when ben proudly entered his teens an irruption of bunting seemed to have broken out all over the old house for banners of every shape and size color and design flew from chimneytop to gable porch and gateway making the quiet place look as lively as a circus tent which was just what ben most desired and delighted in  the boys had been up very early to prepare the show and when it was ready enjoyed it hugely for the fresh wind made the pennons cut strange capers the winged lion of venice looked as if trying to fly away home the chinese dragon appeared to brandish his forked tail as he clawed at the burmese peacock the doubleheaded eagle of russia pecked at the turkish crescent with one beak while the other seemed to be screaming to the english royal beast come on and lend a paw in the hurry of hoisting the siamese elephant got turned upside down and now danced gayly on his head with the stars and stripes waving proudly over him a green flag with a yellow harp and sprig of shamrock hung in sight of the kitchen window and katy the cook got breakfast to the tune of st patricks day in the morning sanchos kennel was half hidden under a rustling paper imitation of the gorgeous spanish banner and the scarlet sunandmoon flag of arabia snapped and flaunted from the pole over the coachhouse as a delicate compliment to lita arabian horses being considered the finest in the world  the little girls came out to see and declared it was the loveliest sight they ever beheld while thorny played hail columbia on his fife and ben mounting the gatepost crowed long and loud like a happy cockerel who had just reached his majority he had been surprised and delighted with the gifts he found in his room on awaking and guessed why miss celia and thorny gave him such pretty things for among them was a matchbox made like a mousetrap the doggy buttons and the horsey whip were treasures indeed for miss celia had not given them when they first planned to do so because sanchos return seemed to be joy and reward enough for that occasion but he did not forget to thank mrs moss for the cake she sent him nor the girls for the red mittens which they had secretly and painfully knit babs was long and thin with a very pointed thumb bettys short and wide with a stubby thumb and all their mothers pulling and pressing could not make them look alike to the great affliction of the little knitters ben however assured them that he rather preferred odd ones as then he could always tell which was right and which left he put them on immediately and went about cracking the new whip with an expression of content which was droll to see while the children followed after full of admiration for the hero of the day  they were very busy all the morning preparing for the festivities to come and as soon as dinner was over every one scrambled into his or her best clothes as fast as possible because although invited to come at two impatient boys and girls were seen hovering about the avenue as early as one  the first to arrive however was an uninvited guest for just as bab and betty sat down on the porch steps in their stiff pink calico frocks and white ruffled aprons to repose a moment before the party came in a rustling was heard among the lilacs and out stepped alfred tennyson barlow looking like a small robin hood in a green blouse with a silver buckle on his broad belt a feather in his little cap and a bow in his hand  i have come to shoot  i heard about it  my papa told me what arching meant will there be any little cakes i like them  with these opening remarks the poet took a seat and calmly awaited a response the young ladies i regret to say giggled then remembering their manners hastened to inform him that there would be heaps of cakes also that miss celia would not mind his coming without an invitation they were quite sure  she asked me to come that day  i have been very busy i had measles do you have them here asked the guest as if anxious to compare notes on the sad subject  we had ours ever so long ago  what have you been doing besides having measles said betty showing a polite interest  i had a fight with a bumblebee  who beat demanded bab  i did  i ran away and he couldnt catch me  can you shoot nicely  i hit a cow she did not mind at all  i guess she thought it was a fly  did your mother know you were coming asked bab feeling an interest in runaways  no she is gone to drive so i could not ask her  it is very wrong to disobey my sundayschool book says that children who are naughty that way never go to heaven observed virtuous betty in a warning tone  i do not wish to go was the startling reply  why not asked betty severely  they dont have any dirt there  my mamma says so i am fond of dirt i shall stay here where there is plenty of it and the candid youth began to grub in the mould with the satisfaction of a genuine boy  i am afraid youre a very bad child  oh yes i am  my papa often says so and he knows all about it replied alfred with an involuntary wriggle suggestive of painful memories then as if anxious to change the conversation from its somewhat personal channel he asked pointing to a row of grinning heads above the wall do you shoot at those  bab and betty looked up quickly and recognized the familiar faces of their friends peering down at them like a choice collection of trophies or targets  i should think youd be ashamed to peek before the party was ready cried bab frowning darkly upon the merry young ladies  miss celia told us to come before two and be ready to receive folks if she wasnt down added betty importantly  it is striking two now  come along girls and over scrambled sally folsom followed by three or four kindred spirits just as their hostess appeared  you look like amazons storming a fort she said as the girls cattle up each carrying her bow and arrows while green ribbons flew in every direction  how do you do sir  i have been hoping you would call again added miss celia shaking hands with the pretty boy who regarded with benign interest the giver of little cakes  here a rush of boys took place and further remarks were cut short for every one was in a hurry to begin so the procession was formed at once miss celia taking the lead escorted by ben in the post of honor while the boys and girls paired off behind arm in arm bow on shoulder in martial array thorny and billy were the band and marched before fifing and drumming yankee doodle with a vigor which kept feet moving briskly made eyes sparkle and young hearts dance under the gay gowns and summer jackets the interesting stranger was elected to bear the prize laid out on a red pincushion and did so with great dignity as he went beside the standard bearer cy fay who bore bens choicest flag snowwhite with a green wreath surrounding a painted bow and arrow and with the letters w t c done in red below  such a merry march all about the place out at the lodge gate up and down the avenue along the winding paths till they halted in the orchard where the target stood and seats were placed for the archers while they waited for their turns various rules and regulations were discussed and then the fun began miss celia had insisted that the girls should be invited to shoot with the boys and the lads consented without much concern whispering to one another with condescending shrugs let em try if they like they cant do any thing  there were various trials of skill before the great match came off and in these trials the young gentlemen discovered that two at least of the girls could do something for bab and sally shot better than many of the boys and were well rewarded for their exertions by the change which took place in the faces and conversation of their mates  why bab you do as well as if id taught you myself said thorny much surprised and not altogether pleased at the little girls skill  a lady taught me and i mean to beat every one of you answered bab saucily while her sparkling eyes turned to miss celia with a mischievous twinkle in them  not a bit of it declared thorny stoutly but he went to ben and whispered do your best old fellow for sister has taught bab all the scientific points and the little rascal is ahead of billy  she wont get ahead of me said ben picking out his best arrow and trying the string of his bow with a confident air which reassured thorny who found it impossible to believe that a girl ever could would or should excel a boy in any thing he cared to try  it really did look as if bab would beat when the match for the prize came off and the children got more and more excited as the six who were to try for it took turns at the bullseye thorny was umpire and kept account of each shot for the arrow which went nearest the middle would win each had three shots and very soon the lookerson saw that ben and bab were the best marksmen and one of them would surely get the silver arrow  sam who was too lazy to practise soon gave up the contest saying as thorny did it wouldnt be fair for such a big fellow to try with the little chaps which made a laugh as his want of skill was painfully evident but mose went at it gallantly and if his eye had been as true as his arms were strong the little chaps would have trembled but his shots were none of them as near as billys and he retired after the third failure declaring that it was impossible to shoot against the wind though scarcely a breath was stirring  sally folsom was bound to beat bab and twanged away in great style all in vain however as with tall maria newcomb the third girl who attempted the trial being a little nearsighted she had borrowed her sisters eyeglasses and thereby lessened her chance of success for the pinch on her nose distracted her attention and not one of her arrows went beyond the second ring to her great disappointment billy did very well but got nervous when his last shot came and just missed the bullseye by being in a hurry  bab and ben each had one turn more and as they were about even that last arrow would decide the victory both had sent a shot into the bullseye but neither was exactly in the middle so there was room to do better even and the children crowded round crying eagerly now ben now bab hit her up ben beat him bab while thorny looked as anxious as if the fate of the country depended on the success of his man babs turn came first and as miss celia examined her bow to see that all was right the little girl said with her eyes on her rivals excited face  i want to beat but ben will feel so bad i most hope i shant  losing a prize sometimes makes one happier than gaining it you have proved that you could do better than most of them so if you do not beat you may still feet proud answered miss celia giving back the bow with a smile that said more than her words  it seemed to give bab a new idea for in a minute all sorts of recollections wishes and plans rushed through her lively little mind and she followed a sudden generous impulse as blindly as she often did a wilful one  i guess hell beat she said softly with a quick sparkle of the eyes as she stepped to her place and fired without taking her usual careful aim  her shot struck almost as near the centre on the right as her last one had hit on the left and there was a shout of delight from the girls as thorny announced it before he hurried back to ben whispering anxiously  steady old man steady you must beat that or we shall never hear the last of it  ben did not say she wont get ahead of me as he had said at the first he set his teeth threw off his hat and knitting his brows with a resolute expression prepared to take steady aim though his heart beat fast and his thumb trembled as he pressed it on the bowstring  i hope youll beat i truly do said bab at his elbow and as if the breath that framed the generous wish helped it on its way the arrow flew straight to the bullseye hitting apparently the very spot where babs best shot had left a hole  a tie a tie cried the girls as a general rush took place toward the target  no bens is nearest  bens beat hooray shouted the boys throwing up their hats there was only a hairsbreadth difference and bab could honestly have disputed the decision but she did not though for an instant she could not help wishing that the cry had been babs beat hurrah it sounded so pleasant then she saw bens beaming face thornys intense relief and caught the look miss celia sent her over the heads of the boys and decided with a sudden warm glow all over her little face that losing a prize did sometimes make one happier than winning it up went her best hat and she burst out in a shrill rah rah rah that sounded very funny coming all alone after the general clamor had subsided  good for you bab you are an honor to the club and im proud of you said prince thorny with a hearty handshake for as his man had won he could afford to praise the rival who had put him on his mettle though she was a girl  bab was much uplifted by the royal commendation but a few minutes later felt pleased as well as proud when ben having received the prize came to her as she stood behind a tree sucking her blistered thumb while betty braided up her dishevelled locks  i think it would be fairer to call it a tie bab for it really was and i want you to wear this i wanted the fun of beating but i dont care a bit for this girls thing and id rather see it on you  as he spoke ben offered the rosette of green ribbon which held the silver arrow and babs eyes brightened as they fell upon the pretty ornament for to her the girls thing was almost as good as the victory  oh no you must wear it to show who won miss celia wouldnt like it i dont mind not getting it i did better than all the rest and i guess i shouldnt like to beat you answered bab unconsciously putting into childish words the sweet generosity which makes so many sisters glad to see their brothers carry off the prizes of life while they are content to know that they have earned them and can do without the praise  but if bab was generous ben was just and though he could not explain the feeling would not consent to take all the glory without giving his little friend a share  you must wear it i shall feel real mean if you dont you worked harder than i did and it was only luck my getting this do bab to please me he persisted awkwardly trying to fasten the ornament in the middle of babs white apron  then i will now do you forgive me for losing sancho asked bab with a wistful look which made ben say heartily  i did that when he came home  and you dont think im horrid  not a bit of it you are firstrate and ill stand by you like a man for you are most as good as a boy cried ben anxious to deal handsomely with his feminine rival whose skill had raised her immensely in his opinion  feeling that he could not improve that last compliment bab was fully satisfied and let him leave the prize upon her breast conscious that she had some claim to it  that is where it should be and ben is a true knight winning the prize that he may give it to his lady while he is content with the victory said miss celia laughingly to teacher as the children ran off to join in the riotous games which soon made the orchard ring  he learned that at the circus tunnyments as he calls them he is a nice boy and i am much interested in him for he has the two things that do most toward making a man patience and courage answered teacher also as she watched the young knight play and the honored lady tearing about in a game of tag  bab is a nice child too said miss celia she is as quick as a flash to catch an idea and carry it out though very often the ideas are wild ones she could have won just now i fancy if she had tried but took the notion into her head that it was nobler to let ben win and so atone for the trouble she gave him in losing the dog i saw a very sweet look on her face just now and am sure that ben will never know why he beat  she does such things at school sometimes and i cant bear to spoil her little atonements though they are not always needed or very wise answered teacher not long ago i found that she had been giving her lunch day after day to a poor child who seldom had any and when i asked her why she said with tears i used to laugh at abby because she had only crusty dry bread and so she wouldnt bring any i ought to give her mine and be hungry it was so mean to make fun of her poorness  did you stop the sacrifice  no i let bab go halves and added an extra bit to my own lunch so i could make my contribution likewise  come and tell me about abby  i want to make friends with our poor people for soon i shall have a right to help them and putting her arm in teachers miss celia led her away for a quiet chat in the porch making her guests visit a happy holiday by confiding several plans and asking advice in the friendliest way    chapter xxi  cupids last appearance  a picnic supper on the grass followed the games and then as twilight began to fall the young people were marshalled to the coachhouse now transformed into a rustic theatre one big door was open and seats arranged lengthwise faced the red tablecloths which formed the curtain a row of lamps made very good footlights and an invisible band performed a wagnerlike overture on combs tin trumpets drums and pipes with an accompaniment of suppressed laughter  many of the children had never seen any thing like it and sat staring about them in mute admiration and expectancy but the older ones criticised freely and indulged in wild speculations as to the meaning of various convulsions of nature going on behind the curtain  while teacher was dressing the actresses for the tragedy miss celia and thorny who were old hands at this sort of amusement gave a potato pantomime as a side show  across an empty stall a green cloth was fastened so high that the heads of the operators were not seen a little curtain flew up disclosing the front of a chinese pagoda painted on pasteboard with a door and window which opened quite naturally this stood on one side several green trees with paper lanterns hanging from the boughs were on the other side and the words tea garden printed over the top showed the nature of this charming spot  few of the children had ever seen the immortal punch and judy so this was a most agreeable novelty and before they could make out what it meant a voice began to sing so distinctly that every word was heard      in china there lived a little man     his name was chingery wangery chan  here the hero took the stage with great dignity clad in a loose yellow jacket over a blue skirt which concealed the hand that made his body a pointed hat adorned his head and on removing this to bow he disclosed a bald pate with a black queue in the middle and a chinese face nicely painted on the potato the lower part of which was hollowed out to fit thornys first finger while his thumb and second finger were in the sleeves of the yellow jacket making a lively pair of arms while he saluted the song went on      his legs were short his feet were small     and this little man could not walk at all  which assertion was proved to be false by the agility with which the little man danced a jig in time to the rollicking chorus      chingery changery ri co day     ekel tekel happy man     uron odesko canty oh oh     gallopy wallopy china go  at the close of the dance and chorus chan retired into the tea garden and drank so many cups of the national beverage with such comic gestures that the spectators were almost sorry when the opening of the opposite window drew all eyes in that direction at the lattice appeared a lovely being for this potato had been pared and on the white surface were painted pretty pink checks red lips black eyes and oblique brows through the tuft of dark silk on the head were stuck several glittering pins and a pink jacket shrouded the plump figure of this capital little chinese lady after peeping coyly out so that all could see and admire she fell to counting the money from a purse so large her small hands could hardly hold it on the window seat while she did this the song went on to explain      miss ki hi was short and squat     she had money and he had not     so off to her he resolved to go     and play her a tune on his little banjo  during the chorus to this verse chan was seen tuning his instrument in the garden and at the end sallied gallantly forth to sing the following tender strain      whang fun li     tang hua ki     hong kong do ra me     ah sin lo     pan to fo     tsing up chin leute  carried away by his passion chan dropped his banjo fell upon his knees and clasping his hands bowed his forehead in the dust before his idol but alas      miss ki hi heard his notes of love     and held her washbowl up above     it fell upon the little man     and this was the end of chingery chan  indeed it was for as the dolls basin of real water was cast forth by the cruel charmer poor chan expired in such strong convulsions that his head rolled down among the audience miss ki hi peeped to see what had become of her victim and the shutter decapitated her likewise to the great delight of the children who passed around the heads pronouncing a potato pantomime firstrate fun  then they settled themselves for the show having been assured by manager thorny that they were about to behold the most elegant and varied combination ever produced on any stage and when one reads the following very inadequate description of the somewhat mixed entertainment it is impossible to deny that the promise made was nobly kept  after some delay and several crashes behind the curtain which mightily amused the audience the performance began with the wellknown tragedy of bluebeard for bab had set her heart upon it and the young folks had acted it so often in their plays that it was very easy to get up with a few extra touches to scenery and costumes thorny was superb as the tyrant with a beard of bright blue worsted a slouched hat and long feather fur cloak red hose rubber boots and a real sword which clanked tragically as he walked he spoke in such a deep voice knit his corked eyebrows and glared so frightfully that it was no wonder poor fatima quaked before him as he gave into her keeping an immense bunch of keys with one particularly big bright one among them  bab was fine to see with miss celias blue dress sweeping behind her a white plume in her flowing hair and a real necklace with a pearl locket about her neck she did her part capitally especially the shriek she gave when she looked into the fatal closet the energy with which she scrubbed the telltale key and her distracted tone when she called out sister anne o sister anne do you see anybody coming while her enraged husband was roaring will you come down madam or shall i come and fetch you  betty made a captivating anneall in white muslin and a hat full of such lovely pink roses that she could not help putting up one hand to feel them as she stood on the steps looking out at the little window for the approaching brothers who made such a din that it sounded like a dozen horsemen instead if two  ben and billy were got up regardless of expense in the way of arms for their belts were perfect arsenals and their wooden swords were big enough to strike terror into any soul though they struck no sparks out of bluebeards blade in the awful combat which preceded the villains downfall and death  the boys enjoyed this part intensely and cries of go it ben hit him again billy two against one isnt fair thornys a match for em now hes down hurray cheered on the combatants till after a terrific struggle the tyrant fell and with convulsive twitchings of the scarlet legs slowly expired while the ladies sociably fainted in each others arms and the brothers waved their swords and shook hands over the corpse of their enemy  this piece was rapturously applauded and all the performers had to appear and bow their thanks led by the defunct bluebeard who mildly warned the excited audience that if they didnt look out the seats would break down and then thered be a nice mess  calmed by this fear they composed themselves and waited with ardor for the next play which promised to be a lively one judging from the shrieks of laughter which came from behind the curtain  sanch s going to be in it i know for i heard ben say hold him still he wont bite whispered sam longing to jounce up and down so great was his satisfaction at the prospect for the dog was considered the star of the company  i hope bab will do something else she is so funny wasnt her dress elegant said sally folsum burning to wear a long silk gown and a feather in her hair  i like betty best shes so cunning and she peeked out of the window just as if she really saw somebody coming answered liddy peckham privately resolving to tease mother for some pink roses before another sunday came  up went the curtain at last and a voice announced a tragedy in three tableaux theres betty was the general exclamation as the audience recognized a familiar face under the little red hood worn by the child who stood receiving a basket from teacher who made a nice mother with her finger up as if telling the small messenger not to loiter by the way  i know what that is cried sally its mabel on midsummer day the piece miss celia spoke dont you know  there isnt any sick baby and mabel had a kerchief pinned about her head i say its red riding hood answered liddy who had begun to learn mary howitts pretty poem for her next piece and knew all about it  the question was settled by the appearance of the wolf in the second scene and such a wolf on few amateur stages do we find so natural an actor for that part or so good a costume for sanch was irresistibly droll in the gray wolfskin which usually lay beside miss celias bed now fitted over his back and fastened neatly down underneath with his own face peeping out at one end and the handsome tail bobbing gayly at the other what a comfort that tail was to sancho none but a bereaved bowwow could ever tell it reconciled him to his distasteful part at once it made rehearsals a joy and even before the public he could not resist turning to catch a glimpse of the noble appendage while his own brief member wagged with the proud consciousness that though the tail did not match the head it was long enough to be seen of all men and dogs  that was a pretty picture for the little maid came walking in with the basket on her arm and such an innocent face inside the bright hood that it was quite natural the gray wolf should trot up to her with deceitful friendliness that she should pat and talk to him confidingly about the butter for grandma and then that they should walk away together he politely carrying her basket she with her hand on his head little dreaming what evil plans were taking shape inside  the children encored that but there was no time to repeat it so they listened to more stifled merriment behind the red tablecloths and wondered whether the next scene would be the wolf popping his head out of the window as red riding hood knocks or the tragic end of that sweet child  it was neither for a nice bed had been made and in it reposed the false grandmother with a ruffled nightcap on a white gown and spectacles betty lay beside the wolf staring at him as if just about to say why grandma what great teeth youve got for sanchos mouth was half open and a red tongue hung out as he panted with the exertion of keeping still this tableau was so very good and yet so funny that the children clapped and shouted frantically this excited the dog who gave a bounce and would have leaped off the bed to bark at the rioters if betty had not caught him by the legs and thorny dropped the curtain just at the moment when the wicked wolf was apparently in the act of devouring the poor little girl with most effective growls  they had to come out then and did so both much dishevelled by the late tussle for sanchos cap was all over one eye and bettys hood was anywhere but on her head she made her courtesy prettily however her fellowactor bowed with as much dignity as a short nightgown permitted and they retired to their wellearned repose  then thorny looking much excited appeared to make the following request as one of the actors in the next piece is new to the business the company must all keep as still as mice and not stir till i give the word its perfectly splendid so dont you spoil it by making a row  what do you suppose it is asked every one and listened with all their might to get a hint if possible but what they heard only whetted their curiosity and mystified them more and more babs voice cried in a loud whisper isnt ben beautiful then there was a thumping noise and miss celia said in an anxious tone oh do be careful while ben laughed out as if he was too happy to care who heard him and thorny bawled whoa in a way which would have attracted attention if litas head had not popped out of her box more than once to survey the invaders of her abode with a much astonished expression  sounds kind of circusy dont it said sam to billy who had come out to receive the compliments of the company and enjoy the tableau at a safe distance  you just wait till you see whats coming  it beats any circus i ever saw answered billy rubbing his hands with the air of a man who had seen many instead of but one  ready be quick and get out of the way when she goes off whispered ben but they heard him and prepared for pistols rockets or combustibles of some sort as ships were impossible under the circumstances and no other she occurred to them  a unanimous oooo was heard when the curtain rose but a stern hush from thorny kept them mutely staring with all their eyes at the grand spectacle of the evening there stood lita with a wide flat saddle on her back a white headstall and reins blue rosettes in her ears and the look of a muchbewildered beast in her bright eyes but who the gauzy spangled winged creature was with a gilt crown on its head a little bow in its hand and one white slipper in the air while the other seemed merely to touch the saddle no one could tell for a minute so strange and splendid did the apparition appear no wonder ben was not recognized in this brilliant disguise which was more natural to him than billys blue flannel or thornys respectable garments he had so begged to be allowed to show himself just once as he used to be in the days when father tossed him up on the barebacked old general for hundreds to see and admire that miss celia had consented much against her will and hastily arranged some bits of spangled tarlatan over the white cotton suit which was to simulate the regulation tights her old dancing slippers fitted and gold paper did the rest while ben sure of his power over lita promised not to break his bones and lived for days on the thought of the moment when he could show the boys that he had not boasted vainly of past splendors  before the delighted children could get their breath lita gave signs of her dislike to the footlights and gathering up the reins that lay on her neck ben gave the old cry houpla and let her go as he had often done before straight out of the coachhouse for a gallop round the orchard  just turn about and you can see perfectly well but stay where you are till he comes back commanded thorny as signs of commotion appeared in the excited audience  round went the twenty children as if turned by one crank and sitting there they looked out into the moonlight where the shining figure flashed to and fro now so near they could see the smiling face under the crown now so far away that it glittered like a firefly among the dusky green lita enjoyed that race as heartily as she had done several others of late and caracoled about as if anxious to make up for her lack of skill by speed and obedience how much ben liked it there is no need to tell yet it was a proof of the good which three months of a quiet useful life had done him that even as he pranced gayly under the boughs thick with the red and yellow apples almost ready to be gathered he found this riding in the fresh air with only his mates for an audience pleasanter than the crowded tent the tired horses profane men and painted women friendly as some of them had been to him  after the first burst was over he felt rather glad on the whole that he was going back to plain clothes helpful school and kindly people who cared more to have him a good boy than the most famous cupid that ever stood on one leg with a fast horse under him  you may make as much noise as you like now litas had her run and will be as quiet as a lamb after it pull up ben and come in sister says youll get cold shouted thorny as the rider came cantering round after a leap over the lodge gate and back again  so ben pulled up and the admiring boys and girls were allowed to gather about him loud in their praises as they examined the pretty mare and the mythological character who lay easily on her back  he looked very little like the god of love now for he had lost one slipper and splashed his white legs with dew and dust the crown had slipped down upon his neck and the paper wings hung in an appletree where he had left them as he went by no trouble in recognizing ben now but somehow he didnt want to be seen and instead of staying to be praised he soon slipped away making lita his excuse to vanish behind the curtain while the rest went into the house to have a finishingoff game of blindmansbuff in the big kitchen  well ben are you satisfied asked miss celia as she stayed a moment to unpin the remains of his gauzy scarf and tunic  yes m thank you it was tiptop  but you look rather sober  are you tired or is it because you dont want to take these trappings off and be plain ben again she said looking down into his face as he lifted it for her to free him from his gilded collar  i want to take em off for somehow i dont feel respectable and he kicked away the crown he had helped to make so carefully adding with a glance that said more than his words id rather be plain ben than any one else for you like to have me  indeed i do and im so glad to hear you say that because i was afraid youd long to be off to the old ways and all ive tried to do would be undone would you like to go back ben and miss celia held his chin an instant to watch the brown face that looked so honestly back at her  no i wouldntunlesshe was there and wanted me  the chin quivered just a bit but the black eyes were as bright as ever and the boys voice so earnest she knew he spoke the truth and laid her white hand softly on his head as she answered in the tone he loved so much because no one else had ever used it to him  father is not there but i know he wants you dear and i am sure he would rather see you in a home like this than in the place you came from now go and dress but tell me first has it been a happy birthday  oh miss celia i didnt know they could be so beautiful and this is the beautifulest part of it i dont know how to thank you but im going to try and finding words wouldnt come fast enough ben just put his two arms round her quite speechless with gratitude then as if ashamed of his little outburst he knelt down in a great hurry to untie his one shoe  but miss celia liked his answer better than the finest speech ever made her and went away through the moonlight saying to herself  if i can bring one lost lamb into the fold i shall be the fitter for a shepherds wife byandby    chapter xxii  a boys bargain  it was some days before the children were tired of talking over bens birthday party for it was a great event in their small world but gradually newer pleasures came to occupy their minds and they began to plan the nutting frolics which always followed the early frosts while waiting for jack to open the chestnut burrs they varied the monotony of school life by a lively scrimmage long known as the woodpile fight  the girls liked to play in the halfempty shed and the boys merely for the fun of teasing declared that they should not so blocked up the doorway as fast as the girls cleared it seeing that the squabble was a merry one and the exercise better for all than lounging in the sun or reading in school during recess teacher did not interfere and the barrier rose and fell almost as regularly as the tide  it would be difficult to say which side worked the harder for the boys went before school began to build up the barricade and the girls stayed after lessons were over to pull down the last one made in afternoon recess they had their playtime first and while the boys waited inside they heard the shouts of the girls the banging of the wood and the final crash as the wellpacked pile went down then as the lassies came in rosy breathless and triumphant the lads rushed out to man the breach and labor gallantly till all was as tight as hard blows could make it  so the battle raged and bruised knuckles splinters in fingers torn clothes and rubbed shoes were the only wounds received while a great deal of fun was had out of the maltreated logs and a lasting peace secured between two of the boys  when the party was safely over sam began to fall into his old way of tormenting ben by calling names as it cost no exertion to invent trying speeches and slyly utter them when most likely to annoy ben bore it as well as he could but fortune favored him at last as it usually does the patient and he was able to make his own terms with his tormentor  when the girls demolished the woodpile they performed a jubilee chorus on combs and tin kettles played like tambourines the boys celebrated their victories with shrill whistles and a drum accompaniment with fists on the shed walls billy brought his drum and this was such an addition that sam hunted up an old one of his little brothers in order that he might join the drum corps he had no sticks however and casting about in his mind for a good substitute for the genuine thing bethought him of bulrushes  those will do firstrate and there are lots in the mash if i can only get em he said to himself and turned off from the road on his way home to get a supply  now this marsh was a treacherous spot and the tragic story was told of a cow who got in there and sank till nothing was visible but a pair of horns above the mud which suffocated the unwary beast for this reason it was called cowslip marsh the wags said though it was generally believed to be so named for the yellow flowers which grew there in great profusion in the spring  sam had seen ben hop nimbly from one tuft of grass to another when he went to gather cowslips for betty and the stout boy thought he could do the same two or three heavy jumps landed him not among the bulrushes as he had hoped but in a pool of muddy water where he sank up to his middle with alarming rapidity much scared he tried to wade out but could only flounder to a tussock of grass and cling there while he endeavored to kick his legs free he got them out but struggled in vain to coil them up or to hoist his heavy body upon the very small island in this sea of mud down they splashed again and sam gave a dismal groan as he thought of the leeches and watersnakes which might be lying in wait below visions of the lost cow also flashed across his agitated mind and he gave a despairing shout very like a distracted moo  few people passed along the lane and the sun was setting so the prospect of a night in the marsh nerved sam to make a frantic plunge toward the bulrush island which was nearer than the mainland and looked firmer than any tussock round him but he failed to reach this haven of rest and was forced to stop at an old stump which stuck up looking very like the mossgrown horns of the dear departed roosting here sam began to shout for aid in every key possible to the human voice such hoots and howls whistles and roars never woke the echoes of the lonely marsh before or scared the portly frog who resided there in calm seclusion  he hardly expected any reply but the astonished caw of the crow who sat upon a fence watching him with gloomy interest and when a cheerful hullo there sounded from the lane he was so grateful that tears of joy rolled down his fat cheeks  come on im in the mash  lend a hand and get me out bawled sam anxiously waiting for his deliverer to appear for he could only see a hat bobbing along behind the hazelbushes that fringed the lane  steps crashed through the bushes and then over the wall came an active figure at the sight of which sam was almost ready to dive out of sight for of all possible boys who should it be but ben the last person in the world whom he would like to have see him in his present pitiful plight  is it you sam well you are in a nice fix and bens eyes began to twinkle with mischievous merriment as well they might for sam certainly was a spectacle to convulse the soberest person perched unsteadily on the gnarled stump with his muddy legs drawn up his dismal face splashed with mud and the whole lower half of his body as black as if he had been dipped in an inkstand he presented such a comically doleful object that ben danced about laughing like a naughty willothewisp who having led a traveller astray then fell to jeering at him  stop that or ill knock your head off roared sam in a rage  come on and do it i give you leave answered ben sparring away derisively as the other tottered on his perch and was forced to hold tight lest he should tumble off  dont laugh there s a good chap but fish me out somehow or i shall get my death sitting here all wet and cold whined sam changing his tune and feeling bitterly that ben had the upper hand now  ben felt it also and though a very goodnatured boy could not resist the temptation to enjoy this advantage for a moment at least  i wont laugh if i can help it only you do look so like a fat speckled frog i may not be able to hold in ill pull you out pretty soon but first im going to talk to you sam said ben sobering down as he took a seat on the little point of land nearest the stranded samuel  hurry up then im as stiff as a board now and its no fun sitting here on this knotty old thing growled sam with a discontented squirm  dare say not but it is good for you as you say when you rap me over the head look here ive got you in a tight place and i dont mean to help you a bit till you promise to let me alone now then and bens face grew stern with his remembered wrongs as he grimly eyed his discomfited foe  ill promise fast enough if you wont tell anyone about this answered sam surveying himself and his surroundings with great disgust  i shall do as i like about that  then i wont promise a thing im not going to have the whole school laughing at me protested sam who hated to be ridiculed even more than ben did  very well goodnight and ben walked off with his hands in his pockets as coolly as if the bog was sams favorite retreat  hold on dont be in such a hurry shouted sam seeing little hope of rescue if he let this chance go  all right and back came ben ready for further negotiations  ill promise not to plague you if youll promise not to tell on me is that what you want  now i come to think of it there is one thing more i like to make a good bargain when i begin said ben with a shrewd air you must promise to keep mose quiet too he follows your lead and if you tell him to stop it he will if i was big enough id make you hold your tongues i aint so well try this way  yes yes ill see to mose  now bring on a rail theres a good fellow ive got a horrid cramp in my legs began sam thinking he had bought help dearly yet admiring bens cleverness in making the most of his chance  ben brought the rail but just as he was about to lay it from the mainland to the nearest tussock he stopped saying with the naughty twinkle in his black eyes again one more little thing must be settled first and then ill get you ashore promise you wont plague the girls either specially bab and betty you pull their hair and they dont like it  dont neither  wouldnt touch that bab for a dollar she scratches and bites like a mad cat was sams sulky reply  glad of it she can take care of herself  betty cant and if you touch one of her pigtails ill up and tell right out how i found you snivelling in the mash like a great baby so now and ben emphasized his threat with a blow of the suspended rail which splashed the water over poor sam quenching his last spark of resistance  stop i willi will  true as you live and breathe demanded ben sternly binding him by the most solemn oath he knew  true as i live and breathe echoed sam dolefully relinquishing his favorite pastime of pulling bettys braids and asking if she was at home  ill come over there and crook fingers on the bargain said ben settling the rail and running over it to the tuft then bridging another pool and crossing again till he came to the stump  i never thought of that way said sam watching him with much inward chagrin at his own failure  i should think youd written look before you leap in your copybook often enough to get the idea into your stupid head come crook commanded ben leaning forward with extended little finger sam obediently performed the ceremony and then ben sat astride one of the horns of the stump while the muddy crusoe went slowly across the rail from point to point till he landed safely on the shore when he turned about and asked with an ungrateful jeer  now whats going to become of you old lookbeforeyouleap  mud turtles can only sit on a stump and bawl till they are taken off but frogs have legs worth something and are not afraid of a little water answered ben hopping away in an opposite direction since the pools between him and sam were too wide for even his lively legs  sam waddled off to the brook in the lane to rinse the mud from his nether man before facing his mother and was just wringing himself out when ben came up breathless but good natured for he felt that he had made an excellent bargain for himself and friends  better wash your face its as speckled as a tigerlily  heres my handkerchief if yours is wet he said pulling out a dingy article which had evidently already done service as a towel  dont want it muttered sam gruffly as he poured the water out of his muddy shoes  i was taught to say thanky when folks got me out of scrapes  but you never had much bringing up though you do live in a house with a gambrel roof retorted ben sarcastically quoting sams frequent boast then he walked off much disgusted with the ingratitude of man  sam forgot his manners but he remembered his promise and kept it so well that all the school wondered no one could guess the secret of bens power over him though it was evident that he had gained it in some sudden way for at the least sign of sams former tricks ben would crook his little finger and wag it warningly or call out bulrushes and sam subsided with reluctant submission to the great amazement of his mates when asked what it meant sa turned sulky but ben had much fun out of it assuring the other boys that those were the signs and password of a secret society to which he and sam belonged and promised to tell them all about it if sam would give him leave which of course he would not  this mystery and the vain endeavors to find it out caused a lull in the war of the woodpile and before any new game was invented something happened which gave the children plenty to talk about for a time  a week after the secret alliance was formed ben ran in one evening with a letter for miss celia he found her enjoying the cheery blaze of the pinecones the little girls had picked up for her and bab and betty sat in the small chairs rocking luxuriously as they took turns to throw on the pretty fuel miss celia turned quickly to receive the expected letter glanced at the writing postmark and stamp with an air of delighted surprise then clasped it close in both hands saying as she hurried out of the room  he has come he has come now you may tell them thorny  tell its what asked bab pricking up her cars at once  oh its only that george has come and i suppose we shall go and get married right away answered thorny rubbing his hands as if he enjoyed the prospect  are you going to be married  asked betty so soberly that the boys shouted and thorny with difficulty composed himself sufficiently to explain  no child not just yet but sister is and i must go and see that all is done up shipshape and bring you home some weddingcake ben will take care of you while im gone  when shall you go asked bab beginning to long for her share of cake  tomorrow i guess  celia has been packed and ready for a week  we agreed to meet george in new york and be married as soon as he got his best clothes unpacked we are men of our word and off we go wont it be fun  but when will you come back again questioned betty looking anxious  dont know  sister wants to come soon but id rather have our honeymoon somewhere elseniagara newfoundland west point or the rocky mountains said thorny mentioning a few of the places he most desired to see  do you like him asked ben very naturally wondering if the new master would approve of the young manofallwork  dont i george is regularly jolly though now hes a minister perhaps hell stiffen up and turn sober wont it be a shame if he does and thorny looked alarmed at the thought of losing his congenial friend  tell about him miss celia said you might put in bab whose experience of jolly ministers had been small  oh there isnt much about it  we met in switzerland going up mount st bernard in a storm and  where the good dogs live inquired betty hoping they would come into the story  yes we spent the night up there and george gave us his room the house was so full and he wouldnt let me go down a steep place where i wanted to and celia thought hed saved my life and was very good to him then we kept meeting and the first thing i knew she went and was engaged to him i didnt care only she would come home so he might go on studying hard and get through quick that was a year ago and last winter we were in new york at uncles and then in the spring i was sick and we came here and thats all  shall you live here always when you come back asked bab as thorny paused for breath  celia wants to  i shall go to college so i dont mind  george is going to help the old minister here and see how he likes it im to study with him and if he is as pleasant as he used to be we shall have capital timessee if we dont  i wonder if he will want me round said ben feeling no desire to be a tramp again  i do so you neednt fret about that my hearty answered thorny with a resounding slap on the shoulder which reassured ben more than any promises  id like to see a live wedding then we could play it with our dolls ive got a nice piece of mosquito netting for a veil and belindas white dress is clean do you spose miss celia will ask us to hers said betty to bab as the boys began to discuss st bernard dogs with spirit  i wish i could dears answered a voice behind them and there was miss celia looking so happy that the little girls wondered what the letter could have said to give her such bright eyes and smiling lips i shall not be gone long or be a bit changed when i come back to live among you years i hope for i am fond of the old place now and mean it shall be home she added caressing the yellow heads as if they were dear to her  oh goody cried bab while betty whispered with both arms round miss celia  i dont think we could bear to have anybody else come here to live  it is very pleasant to hear you say that and i mean to make others feel so if i can i have been trying a little this summer but when i come back i shall go to work in earnest to be a good ministers wife and you must help me  we will promised both children ready for any thing except preaching in the high pulpit  then miss celia turned to ben saying in the respectful way that always made him feel at least twentyfive  we shall be off tomorrow and i leave you in charge  go on just as if we were here and be sure nothing will be changed as far as you are concerned when we come back  bens face beamed at that but the only way he could express his relief was by making such a blaze in honor of the occasion that he nearly roasted the company  next morning the brother and sister slipped quietly away and the children hurried to school eager to tell the great news that miss celia and thorny had gone to be married and were coming back to live here for ever and ever    chapter xxiii  somebody comes  bab and betty had been playing in the avenue all the afternoon several weeks later but as the shadows began to lengthen both agreed to sit upon the gate and rest while waiting for ben who had gone nutting with a party of boys when they played house bab was always the father and went hunting or fishing with great energy and success bringing home all sorts of game from elephants and crocodiles to hummingbirds and minnows betty was the mother and a most notable little housewife always mixing up imaginary delicacies with sand and dirt in old pans and broken china which she baked in an oven of her own construction  both had worked hard that day and were glad to retire to their favorite loungingplace where bab was happy trying to walk across the wide top bar without falling off and betty enjoyed slow luxurious swings while her sister was recovering from her tumbles on this occasion having indulged their respective tastes they paused for a brief interval of conversation sitting side by side on the gate like a pair of plump gray chickens gone to roost  dont you hope ben will get his bag full  we shall have such fun eating nuts evenings observed bab wrapping her arms in her apron for it was october now and the air was growing keen  yes and ma says we may boil some in our little kettles  ben promised we should have half answered betty still intent on her cookery  i shall save some of mine for thorny  i shall keep lots of mine for miss celia  doesnt it seem more than two weeks since she went away  i wonder what shell bring us  before bab could conjecture the sound of a step and a familiar whistle made both look expectantly toward the turn in the road all ready to cry out in one voice how many have you got neither spoke a word however for the figure which presently appeared was not ben but a strangera man who stopped whistling and came slowly on dusting his shoes in the wayside grass and brushing the sleeves of his shabby velveteen coat as if anxious to freshen himself up a bit  its a tramp lets run away whispered betty after a hasty look  i aint afraid and bab was about to assume her boldest look when a sneeze spoilt it and made her clutch the gate to hold on  at that unexpected sound the man looked up showing a thin dark face with a pair of sharp black eyes which surveyed the little girls so steadily that betty quaked and bab began to wish she had at least jumped down inside the gate  how are you said the man with a goodnatured nod and smile as if to reassure the roundeyed children staring at him  pretty well thank you sir responded bab politely nodding back at him  folks at home asked the man looking over their heads toward the house  only ma all the rest have gone to be married  that sounds lively  at the other place all the folks had gone to a funeral and the man laughed as he glanced at the big house on the hill  why do you know the squire exclaimed bab much surprised and reassured  come on purpose to see him just strolling round till he gets back with an impatient sort of sigh  betty thought you was a tramp but i wasnt afraid i like tramps ever since ben came explained bab with her usual candor  who s ben and the man came nearer so quickly that betty nearly fell backward dont you be scared sissy i like little girls so you set easy and tell me about ben he added in a persuasive tone as he leaned on the gate so near that both could see what a friendly face he had in spite of its eager anxious look  ben is miss celias boy  we found him most starved in the coachhouse and hes been here ever since answered bab comprehensively  tell me about it i like tramps too and the man looked as if he did very much as bab told the little story in a few childish words that were better than a much more elegant account  you were very good to the little feller was all the man said when she ended her somewhat confused tale in which she had jumbled the old coach and miss celia dinnerpails and nutting sancho and circuses  course we were  hes a nice boy and we are fond of him and he likes us said bab heartily  specially me put in betty quite at ease now for the black eyes had softened wonderfully and the brown face was smiling all over  dont wonder a mite you are the nicest pair of little girls ive seen this long time and the man put a hand on either side of them as if he wanted to hug the chubby children but he didnt do it he merely smiled and stood there asking questions till the two chatterboxes had told him every thing there was to tell in the most confiding manner for he very soon ceased to seem like a stranger and looked so familiar that bab growing inquisitive in her turn suddenly said  havent you ever been here before it seems as if id seen you  never in my life  guess youve seen somebody that looks like me and the black eyes twinkled for a minute as they looked into the puzzled little faces before him then he said soberly  im looking round for a likely boy dont you think this ben would suite me i want just such a lively sort of chap  are you a circus man asked bab quickly  well no not now im in better business  im glad of itwe dont approve of em but i do think theyre splendid  bab began by gravely quoting miss celia and ended with an irrepressible burst of admiration which contrasted drolly with her first remark  betty added anxiously we cant let ben go any way  i know he wouldnt want to and miss celia would feel bad please dont ask him  he can do as he likes i suppose  he hasnt got any folks of his own has he  no his father died in california and ben felt so bad he cried and we were real sorry and gave him a piece of ma cause he was so lonesome answered betty in her tender little voice with a pleading look which made the man stroke her smooth check and say quite softly  bless your heart for that i wont take him away child or do a thing to trouble anybody thats been good to him  he s coming now  i hear sanch barking at the squirrels cried bab standing up to get a good look down the road  the man turned quickly and betty saw that he breathed fast as he watched the spot where the low sunshine lay warmly on the red maple at the corner into this glow came unconscious ben whistling rory omoore loud and clear as he trudged along with a heavy bag of nuts over his shoulder and the light full on his contented face sancho trotted before and saw the stranger first for the sun in bens eyes dazzled him since his sad loss sancho cherished a strong dislike to tramps and now he paused to growl and show his teeth evidently intending to warn this one off the premises  he wont hurt you began bab encouragingly but before she could add a chiding word to the dog sanch gave an excited howl and flew at the mans throat as if about to throttle him  betty screamed and bab was about to go to the rescue when both perceived that the dog was licking the strangers face in an ecstasy of joy and heard the man say as he hugged the curly beast  good old sanch i knew he wouldnt forget master and he doesnt  whats the matter called ben coming up briskly with a strong grip of his stout stick there was no need of any answer for as he came into the shadow he saw the man and stood looking at him as if he were a ghost  its father benny dont you know me asked the man with an odd sort of choke in his voice as he thrust the dog away and held out both hands to the boy down dropped the nuts and crying oh daddy daddy ben cast himself into the arms of the shabby velveteen coat while poor sanch tore round them in distracted circles barking wildly as if that was the only way in which he could vent his rapture  what happened next bab and betty never stopped to see but dropping from their roost they went flying home like startled chicken littles with the astounding news that bens father has come alive and sancho knew him right away  mrs moss had just got her cleaning done up and was resting a minute before setting the table but she flew out of her old rockingchair when the excited children told the wonderful tale exclaiming as they ended  where is he  go bring him here  i declare it fairly takes my breath away  before bab could obey or her mother compose herself sancho bounced in and spun round like an insane top trying to stand on his head walk upright waltz and bark all at once for the good old fellow had so lost his head that he forgot the loss of his tail  they are coming they are coming see ma what a nice man he is said bab hopping about on one foot as she watched the slowly approaching pair  my patience dont they look alike i should know he was bens pa anywhere said mrs moss running to the door in a hurry  they certainly did resemble one another and it was almost comical to see the same curve in the legs the same wideawake style of wearing the hat the same sparkle of the eye goodnatured smile and agile motion of every limb old ben carried the bag in one hand while young ben held the other fast looking a little shamefaced at his own emotion now for there were marks of tears on his cheeks but too glad to repress the delight he felt that he had really found daddy this side heaven  mrs moss unconsciously made a pretty little picture of herself as she stood at the door with her honest face shining and both hands ont saying in a hearty tone which was a welcome in itself  im real glad to see you safe and well mr brown  come right in and make yourself to home i guess there isnt a happier boy living than ben is tonight  and i know there isnt a gratefuler man living than i am for your kindness to my poor forsaken little feller answered mr brown dropping both his burdens to give the comely womans hands a hard shake  now dont say a word about it but sit down and rest and well have tea in lessn no time ben must be tired and hungry though hes so happy i dont believe he knows it laughed mrs moss bustling away to hide the tears in her eyes anxious to make things sociable and easy all round  with this end in view she set forth her best china and covered the table with food enough for a dozen thanking her stars that it was baking day and every thing had turned out well ben and his father sat talking by the window till they were bidden to draw up and help themselves with such hospitable warmth that every thing had an extra relish to the hungry pair  ben paused occasionally to stroke the rusty coatsleeve with breadandbuttery fingers to convince himself that daddy had really come and his father disposed of various inconvenient emotions by eating as if food was unknown in california mrs moss beamed on every one from behind the big teapot like a mild full moon while bab and betty kept interrupting one another in their eagerness to tell something new about ben and how sanch lost his tail  now you let mr brown talk a little we all want to hear how he came alive as you call it said mrs moss as they drew round the fire in the settinroom leaving the teathings to take care of themselves  it was not a long story but a very interesting one to this circle of listeners all about the wild life on the plains trading for mustangs the terrible kick from a vicious horse that nearly killed ben sen the long months of unconsciousness in the california hospital the slow recovery the journey back mr smitherss tale of the boys disappearance and then the anxious trip to find out from squire allen where he now was  i asked the hospital folks to write and tell you as soon as i knew whether i was on my head or my heels and they promised but they didnt so i came off the minute i could and worked my way back expecting to find you at the old place i was afraid youd have worn out your welcome here and gone off again for you are as fond of travelling as your father  i wanted to sometimes but the folks here were so dreadful good to me i couldnt confessed ben secretly surprised to find that the prospect of going off with daddy even cost him a pang of regret for the boy had taken root in the friendly soil and was no longer a wandering thistledown tossed about by every wind that blew  i know what i owe em and you and i will work out that debt before we die or our name isnt bb said mr brown with an emphatic slap on his knee which ben imitated half unconsciously as he exclaimed heartily  thats so adding more quietly what are you going to do now go back to smithers and the old business  not likely after the way he treated you sonny ive had it out with him and he wont want to see me again in a hurry answered mr brown with a sudden kindling of the eye that reminded bab of bens face when he shook her after losing sancho  theres more circuses than his in the world but ill have to limber out ever so much before im good for much in that line said the boy stretching his stout arms and legs with a curious mixture of satisfaction and regret  youve been living in clover and got fat you rascal and his father gave him a poke here and there as mr squeers did the plump wackford when displaying him as a specimen of the fine diet at dotheboys hall dont believe i could put you up now if i tried for i havent got my strength back yet and we are both out of practice its just as well for ive about made up my mind to quit the business and settle down somewhere for a spell if i can get any thing to do continued the rider folding his arms and gazing thoughtfully into the fire  i shouldnt wonder a mite if you could right here for mr towne has a great boardingstable over yonder and hes always wanting men said mrs moss eagerly for she dreaded to have ben go and no one could forbid it if his father chose to take him away  that sounds likely  thanky maam  ill look up the concern and try my chance would you call it too great a comedown to have father an ostler after being first rider in the great golden menagerie circus and colossem hey ben asked mr brown quoting the wellremembered showbill with a laugh  no i shouldnt its real jolly up there when the big barn is full and eighty horses have to be taken care of i love to go and see em mr towne asked me to come and be stableboy when i rode the kicking gray the rest were afraid of i hankered to go but miss celia had just got my new books and i knew shed feel bad if i gave up going to school now im glad i didnt for i get on first rate and like it  you done right boy and im pleased with you dont you ever be ungrateful to them that befriended you if you want to prosper ill tackle the stable business a monday and see whats to be done now i ought to be walking but ill be round in the morning maam if you can spare ben for a spell tomorrow wed like to have a good sunday tramp and talk wouldnt we sonny and mr brown rose to go with his hand on bens shoulder as if loth to leave him even for the night  mrs moss saw the longing in his face and forgetting that he was an utter stranger spoke right out of her hospitable heart  its a long piece to the tavern and my little back bedroom is always ready it wont make a mite of trouble if you dont mind a plain place and you are heartily welcome  mr brown looked pleased but hesitated to accept any further favor from the good soul who had already done so much for him and his ben gave him no time to speak however for running to a door he flung it open and beckoned saying eagerly  do stay father it will be so nice to have you this is a tiptop room i slept here the night i came and that bed was just splendid after bare ground for a fortnight  ill stop and as im pretty well done up i guess we may as well turn in now answered the new guest then as if the memory of that homeless little lad so kindly cherished made his heart overflow in spite of him mr brown paused at the door to say hastily with a hand on bab and bettys heads as if his promise was a very earnest one  i dont forget maam these children shall never want a friend while ben browns alive then he shut the door so quickly that the other bens prompt hear hear was cut short in the middle  i spose he means that we shall have a piece of bens father because we gave ben a piece of our mother said betty softly  of course he does and its all fair answered bab decidedly  isnt he a nice man ma  go to bed children was all the answer she got but when they were gone mrs moss as she washed up her dishes more than once glanced at a certain nail where a mans hat had not hung for five years and thought with a sigh what a natural protecting air that slouched felt had  if one wedding were not quite enough for a childs story we might here hint what no one dreamed of then that before the year came round again ben had found a mother bab and betty a father and mr browns hat was quite at home behind the kitchen door but on the whole it is best not to say a word about it    chapter xxiv  the great gate is opened  the browns were up and out so early next morning that bab and betty were sure they had run away in the night but on looking for them they were discovered in the coachhouse criticising lita both with their hands in their pockets both chewing straws and looking as much alike as a big elephant and a small one  thats as pretty a little span as ive seen for a long time said the elder ben as the children came trotting down the path hand in hand with the four blue bows at the ends of their braids bobbing briskly up and down  the nigh one is my favorite but the off one is the best goer though shes dreadfully hard bitted answered ben the younger with such a comical assumption of a jockeys important air that his father laughed as he said in an undertone  come boy we must drop the old slang since weve given up the old business these good folks are making a gentleman of you and i wont be the one to spoil their work hold on my dears and ill show you how they say goodmorning in california he added beckoning to the little girls who now came up rosy and smiling  breakfast is ready sir said betty looking much relieved to find them  we thought youd run away from us explained bab as both put out their hands to shake those extended to them  that would be a mean trick  but im going to run away with you and mr brown whisked a little girl to either shoulder before they knew what had happened while ben remembering the day with difficulty restrained himself from turning a series of triumphant somersaults before them all the way to the door where mrs moss stood waiting for them  after breakfast ben disappeared for a short time and returned in his sunday suit looking so neat and fresh that his father surveyed him with surprise and pride as he came in full of boyish satisfaction in his trim array  heres a smart young chap did you take all that trouble just to go to walk with old daddy asked mr brown stroking the smooth head for they were alone just then mrs moss and the children being up stairs preparing for church  i thought may be youd like to go to meeting first answered ben looking up at him with such a happy face that it was hard to refuse any thing im too shabby sonny else id go in a minute to please you  miss celia said god didnt mind poor clothes and she took me when i looked worse than you do i always go in the morning she likes to have me said ben turning his hat about as if not quite sure what he ought to do  do you want to go asked his father in a tone of surprise  i want to please her if you dont mind  we could have our tramp this afternoon  i havent been to meeting since mother died and it dont seem to come easy though i know i ought to seeing im alive and here and mr brown looked soberly out at the lovely autumn world as if glad to be in it after his late danger and pain  miss celia said church was a good place to take our troubles and to be thankful in i went when i thought you were dead and now id love to go when ive got my daddy safe again  no one saw him so ben could not resist giving his father a sudden hug which was warmly returned as the man said earnestly  ill go and thank the lord hearty for giving me back my boy bettern i left him  for a minute nothing was heard but the loud tick of the old clock and a mournful whine front sancho shut up in the shed lest he should go to church without an invitation  then as steps were heard on the stairs mr brown caught up his hat saying hastily  i aint fit to go with them you tell m and ill slip into a back seat after folks are in i know the way and before ben could reply he was gone nothing was seen of him along the way but he saw the little party and rejoiced again over his boy changed in so many ways for the better for ben was the one thing which had kept his heart soft through all the trials and temptations of a rough life  i promised mary id do my best for the poor baby she had to leave and i tried but i guess a better friend than i am has been raised up for him when he needed her most it wont hurt me to follow him in this road thought mr brown as he came out into the highway from his stroll acrosslots feeling that it would be good for him to stay in this quiet place for his own as well as his sons sake  the bell had done ringing when he reached the green but a single boy sat on the steps and rail to meet him saying with a reproachful look  i wasnt going to let you be alone and have folks think i was ashamed of my father come daddy well sit together  so ben led his father straight to the squires pew and sat beside him with a face so full of innocent pride and joy that people would have suspected the truth if he had not already told many of them mr brown painfully conscious of his shabby coat was rather taken aback as he expressed it but the squires shake of the hand and mrs allens gracious nod enabled him to face the eyes of the interested congregation the younger portion of which stared steadily at him all sermon time in spite of paternal frowns and maternal tweakings in the rear  but the crowning glory of the day came after church when the squire said to ben and sam heard him  ive got a letter for you from miss celia come home with me and bring your father i want to talk to him  the boy proudly escorted his parent to the old carryall and tucking himself in behind with mrs allen had the satisfaction of seeing the slouched felt hat side by side with the squires sunday beaver in front as they drove off at such an unusually smart pace it was evident that duke knew there was a critical eye upon him the interest taken in the father was owing to the son at first but by the time the story was told old ben had won friends for himself not only because of the misfortunes which he had evidently borne in a manly way but because of his delight in the boys improvement and the desire he felt to turn his hand to any honest work that he might keep ben happy and contented in this good home  ill give you a line to towne  smithers spoke well of you and your own ability will be the best recommendation said the squire as he parted from them at his door having given ben the letter  miss celia had been gone a fortnight and every one was longing to have her back the first week brought ben a newspaper with a crinkly line drawn round the marriages to attract attention to that spot and one was marked by a black frame with a large hand pointing at it from the margin thorny sent that but the next week came a parcel for mrs moss and in it was discovered a box of wedding cake for every member of the family including sancho who ate his at one gulp and chewed up the lace paper which covered it this was the third week and as if there could not be happiness enough crowded into it for ben the letter he read on his way home told him that his dear mistress was coming back on the following saturday one passage particularly pleased him  i want the great gate opened so that the new master may go in that way will you see that it is done and all made neat afterward randa will give you the key and you may have out all your flags if you like for the old place cannot look too gay for this homecoming  sunday though it was ben could not help waving the letter over his head as he ran in to tell mrs moss the glad news and begin at once to plan the welcome they would give miss celia for he never called her any thing else  during their afternoon stroll in the mellow sunshine ben continued to talk of her never tired of telling about his happy summer under her roof and mr brown was never weary of hearing for every hour showed him more plainly what a lovely miracle her gentle words had wrought and every hour increased his gratitude his desire to return the kindness in some humble way he had his wish and did his part handsomely when he least expected to have a chance  on monday he saw mr towne and thanks to the squires good word was engaged for a month on trial making himself so useful that it was soon evident he was the right man in the right place he lived on the hill but managed to get down to the little brown house in the evening for a word with ben who just now was as full of business as if the president and his cabinet were coming  every thing was put in applepie order in and about the old house the great gate with much creaking of rusty hinges and some clearing away of rubbish was set wide open and the first creature who entered it was sancho solemnly dragging the dead mullein which long ago had grown above the keyhole october frosts seemed to have spared some of the brightest leaves for this especial occasion and on saturday the arched gateway was hung with gay wreaths red and yellow sprays strewed the flags and the porch was a blaze of color with the red woodbine that was in its glory when the honeysuckle was leafless  fortunately it was a halfholiday so the children could trim and chatter to their hearts content and the little girls ran about sticking funny decorations where no one would ever think of looking for them ben was absorbed in his flags which were sprinkled all down the avenue with a lavish display suggesting several fourth of julys rolled into one mr brown had come to lend a hand and did so most energetically for the breakneck things he did with his son during the decoration fever would have terrified mrs moss out of her wits if she had not been in the house giving last touches to every room while randa and katy set forth a sumptuous tea  all was going well and the train would be due in an hour when luckless bab nearly turned the rejoicing into mourning the feast into ashes she heard her mother say to randa there ought to be a fire in every room it looks so cheerful and the air is chilly spite of the sunshine and never waiting to hear the reply that some of the longunused chimneys were not safe till cleaned off went bab with an apron full of old shingles and made a roaring blaze in the front room fireplace which was of all others the one to be let alone as the flue was out of order  charmed with the brilliant light and the crackle of the tindery fuel miss bab refilled her apron and fed the fire till the chimney began to rumble ominously sparks to fly out at the top and soot and swallows nests to come tumbling down upon the hearth then scared at what she had done the little mischiefmaker hastily buried her fire swept up the rubbish and ran off thinking no one would discover her prank if she never told  everybody was very busy and the big chimney blazed and rumbled unnoticed till the cloud of smoke caught bens eye as he festooned his last effort in the flag line part of an old sheet with the words father has come in red cambric letters half a foot long sewed upon it  hullo i do believe theyve got up a bonfire without asking my leave miss celia never would let us because the sheds and roofs are so old and dry i must see about it catch me daddy im coming down cried ben dropping out of the elm with no more thought of where he might light than a squirrel swinging from bough to bough  his father caught him and followed in haste as his nimblefooted son raced up the avenue to stop in the gateway frightened at the prospect before him for falling sparks had already kindled the roof here and there and the chimney smoked and roared like a small volcano while katys wails and randas cries for water came from within  up there with wet blankets while i get out the hose cried mr brown as he saw at a glance what the danger was  ben vanished and before his father got the garden hose rigged he was on the roof with a dripping blanket over the worst spot mrs moss had her wits about her in a minute and ran to put in the fireboard and stop the draught then stationing randa to watch that the falling cinders did no harm inside she hurried off to help mr brown who might not know where things were but he had roughed it so long that he was the man for emergencies and seemed to lay his hand on whatever was needed by a sort of instinct finding that the hose was too short to reach the upper part of the roof he was on the roof in a jiffy with two pails of water and quenched the most dangerous spots before much harm was done  this he kept up till the chimney burned itself out while ben dodged about among the gables with a watering pot lest some stray sparks should be overlooked and break out afresh  while they worked there betty ran to and fro with a dipper of water trying to help and sancho barked violently as if he objected to this sort of illumination but where was bab who revelled in flurries no one missed her till the fire was out and the tired sooty people met to talk over the danger just escaped  poor miss celia wouldnt have had a roof over her head if it hadnt been for you mr brown said mrs moss sinking into a kitchen chair pale with the excitement  it would have burnt lively but i guess its all right now keep an eye on the roof ben and ill step up garret and see if alls safe there didnt you know that chimney was foul maam asked the man as he wiped the perspiration off his grimy face  randa said it was and i in surprised she made a fire there began mrs moss looking at the maid who just then came in with a pan full of soot  bless you maam i never thought of such a thing nor katy neither that naughty bab must have done it and so dont darst to show herself answered the irate randa whose nice room was in a mess  where is the child asked her mother and a hunt was immediately instituted by betty and sancho while the elders cleared up  anxious betty searched high and low called and cried but all in vain and was about to sit down in despair when sancho made a bolt into his new kennel and brought out a shoe with a foot in it while a doleful squeal came from the straw within  oh bab how could you do it  ma was frightened dreadfully said betty gently tugging at the striped leg as sancho poked his head in for another shoe  is it all burnt up demanded a smothered voice from the recesses of the kennel  only pieces of the roof  ben and his father put it out and i helped answered betty cheering up a little as she recalled her noble exertions  what do they do to folks who set houses afire asked the voice again  i dont know but you neednt be afraid there isnt much harm done i guess and miss celia will forgive you shes so good  thorny wont he calls me a botheration and i guess i am mourned the unseen culprit with sincere contrition  ill ask him he is always good to me  they will be here pretty soon so youd better come out and be made tidy suggested the comforter  i never can come out for every one will hate me sobbed bab among the straw as she pulled in her foot as if retiring for ever from an outraged world  ma wont shes too busy cleaning up so its a good time to come lets run home wash our hands and be all nice when they see us ill love you no matter what anybody else does said betty consoling the poor little sinner and proposing the sort of repentance most likely to find favor in the eyes of the agitated elders  praps id better go home for sanch will want his bed and bab gladly availed herself of that excuse to back out of her refuge a very crumpled dusty young lady with a dejected face and much straw sticking in her hair  betty led her sadly away for she still protested that she never should dare to meet the offended public again but in fifteen minutes both appeared in fine order and good spirits and naughty bab escaped a lecture for the time being as the train would soon be due  at the first sound of the car whistle every one turned goodnatured as if by magic and flew to the gate smiling as if all mishaps were forgiven and forgotten mrs moss however slipped quietly away and was the first to greet mrs celia as the carriage stopped at the entrance of the avenue so that the luggage might go in by way of the lodge  we will walk up and you shall tell us the news as we go for i see you have some said the young lady in her friendly manner when mrs moss had given her welcome and paid her respects to the gentleman who shook hands in a way that convinced her he was indeed what thorny called him regularly jolly though he was a minister  that being exactly what she came for the good woman told her tidings as rapidly as possible and the newcomers were so glad to hear of bens happiness they made very light of babs bonfire though it had nearly burnt their house down  we wont say a word about it for every one must be happy today said mr george so kindly that mrs moss felt a load taken off her heart at once  bab was always teasing me for fireworks but i guess she has had enough for the present laughed thorny who was gallantly escorting babs mother up the avenue  every one is so kind teacher was out with the children to cheer us as we passed and here you all are making things pretty for me said mrs celia smiling with tears in her eyes as they drew near the great gate which certainly did present an animated if not an imposing appearance  randa and katy stood on one side all in their best bobbing delighted courtesies mr brown half hidden behind the gate on the other side was keeping sancho erect so that he might present arms promptly when the bride appeared as flowers were scarce on either post stood a rosy little girl clapping her hands while out from the thicket of red and yellow boughs which made a grand bouquet in the lantern frame came bens head and shoulders as he waved his grandest flag with its gold paper welcome home on a blue ground  isnt it beautiful cried mrs celia throwing kisses to the children shaking hands with her maids and glancing brightly at the stranger who was keeping sanch quiet  most people adorn their gateposts with stone balls vases or griffins your living images are a great improvement love especially the happy boy in the middle said mr george eying ben with interest as he nearly tumbled overboard topheavy with his banner  you must finish what i have only begun answered celia adding gayly as sancho broke loose and came to offer both his paw and his congratulations sanch introduce your master that i may thank him for coming back in time to save my old house  if id saved a dozen it wouldnt have half paid for all youve done for my boy maam answered mr brown bursting out from behind the gate quite red with gratitude and pleasure  i loved to do it so please remember that this is still his home till you make one for him thank god he is no longer fatherless and her sweet face said even more than her words as the white hand cordially shook the brown one with a burn across the back  come on sister  i see the teatable all ready and im awfully hungry interrupted thorny who had not a ray of sentiment about him though very glad ben had got his father back again  come over byandby little friends and let me thank you for your pretty welcomeit certainly is a warm one and mrs celia glanced merrily from the three bright faces above her to the old chimney which still smoked sullenly  oh dont cried bab hiding her face  she didnt mean to added betty pleadingly  three cheers for the bride roared ben dipping his flag as leaning on her husbands arm his dear mistress passed under the gay arch along the leafstrewn walk over the threshold of the house which was to be her happy home for many years  the closed gate where the lonely little wanderer once lay was always to stand open now and the path where children played before was free to all comers for a hospitable welcome henceforth awaited rich and poor young and old sad and gay under the lilacs
