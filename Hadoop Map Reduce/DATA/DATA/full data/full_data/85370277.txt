lady nicotine   chapter i  matrimony and smoking compared   the circumstances in which i gave up smoking were these  i was a mere bachelor drifting toward what i now see to be a tragic middle age i had become so accustomed to smoke issuing from my mouth that i felt incomplete without it indeed the time came when i could refrain from smoking if doing nothing else but hardly during the hours of toil to lay aside my pipe was to find myself soon afterward wandering restlessly round my table no blind beggar was ever more abjectly led by his dog or more loath to cut the string  i am much better without tobacco and already have a difficulty in sympathizing with the man i used to be even to call him up as it were and regard him without prejudice is a difficult task for we forget the old selves on whom we have turned our backs as we forget a street that has been reconstructed does the freed slave always shiver at the crack of a whip i fancy not for i recall but dimly and without acute suffering the horrors of my smoking days there were nights when i awoke with a pain at my heart that made me hold my breath i did not dare move after perhaps ten minutes of dread i would shift my position an inch at a time less frequently i felt this sting in the daytime and believed i was dying while my friends were talking to me i never mentioned these experiences to a human being indeed though a medical man was among my companions i cunningly deceived him on the rare occasions when he questioned me about the amount of tobacco i was consuming weekly often in the dark i not only vowed to give up smoking but wondered why i cared for it next morning i went straight from breakfast to my pipe without the smallest struggle with myself latterly i knew while resolving to break myself of the habit that i would be better employed trying to sleep i had elaborate ways of cheating myself but it became disagreeable to me to know how many ounces of tobacco i was smoking weekly often i smoked cigarettes to reduce the number of my cigars  on the other hand if these sharp pains be excepted i felt quite well my appetite was as good as it is now and i worked as cheerfully and certainly harder to some slight extent i believe i experienced the same pains in my boyhood before i smoked and i am not an absolute stranger to them yet they were most frequent in my smoking days but i have no other reason for charging them to tobacco possibly a doctor who was himself a smoker would have poohpoohed them nevertheless i have lighted my pipe and then as i may say hearkened for them at the first intimation that they were coming i laid the pipe down and ceased to smokeuntil they had passed  i will not admit that once sure it was doing me harm i could not unaided have given up tobacco but i was reluctant to make sure i should like to say that i left off smoking because i considered it a mean form of slavery to be condemned for moral as well as physical reasons but though now i clearly see the folly of smoking i was blind to it for some months after i had smoked my last pipe i gave up my most delightful solace as i regarded it for no other reason than that the lady who was willing to fling herself away on me said that i must choose between it and her this deferred our marriage for six months  i have now come as those who read will see to look upon smoking with my wifes eyes my old bachelor friends complain because i do not allow smoking in the house but i am always ready to explain my position and i have not an atom of pity for them if i cannot smoke here neither shall they when i visit them in the old inn they take a poor revenge by blowing rings of smoke almost in my face this ambition to blow rings is the most ignoble known to man once i was a member of a club for smokers where we practised blowing rings the most successful got a box of cigars as a prize at the end of the year those were days often i think wistfully of them we met in a cozy room off the strand how well i can picture it still timetables lying everywhere with which we could light our pipes some smoked clays but for the arcadia mixture give me a brier my brier was the sweetest ever known it is strange now to recall a time when a pipe seemed to be my best friend  my present state is so happy that i can only look back with wonder at my hesitation to enter upon it our house was taken while i was still arguing that it would be dangerous to break myself of smoking all at once at that time my ideal of married life was not what it is now and i remember jimmys persuading me to fix on this house because the large room upstairs with the three windows was a smokers dream he pictured himself and me there in the summertime blowing rings with our coats off and our feet out at the windows and he said that the closet at the back looking on to a blank wall would make a charming drawingroom for my wife for the moment his enthusiasm carried me away but i see now how selfish it was and i have before me the face of jimmy when he paid us his first visit and found that the closet was not the drawingroom jimmy is a fair specimen of a man not without parts destroyed by devotion to his pipe to this day he thinks that mantelpiece vases are meant for holding pipelights in we are almost certain that when he stays with us he smokes in his bedrooma detestable practice that i cannot permit  illustration  two cigars a day at ninepence apiece come to £27 7s 6d yearly and four ounces of tobacco a week at nine shillings a pound come to £5 17s yearly that makes £33 4s 6d when we calculate the yearly expense of tobacco in this way we are naturally taken aback and our extravagance shocks us more after we have considered how much more satisfactorily the money might have been spent with £33 4s 6d you can buy new oriental rugs for the drawingroom as well as a spring bonnet and a nice dress these are things that give permanent pleasure whereas you have no interest in a cigar after flinging away the stump judging by myself i should say that it was want of thought rather than selfishness that makes heavy smokers of so many bachelors once a man marries his eyes are opened to many things that he was quite unaware of previously among them being the delight of adding an article of furniture to the drawingroom every month and having a bedroom in pink and gold the door of which is always kept locked if men would only consider that every cigar they smoke would buy part of a new pianostool in terracotta plush and that for every pound tin of tobacco purchased away goes a vase for growing dead geraniums in they would surely hesitate they do not consider however until they marry and then they are forced to it for my own part i fail to see why bachelors should be allowed to smoke as much as they like when we are debarred from it  illustration  the very smell of tobacco is abominable for one cannot get it out of the curtains and there is little pleasure in existence unless the curtains are all right as for a cigar after dinner it only makes you dull and sleepy and disinclined for ladies society a far more delightful way of spending the evening is to go straight from dinner to the drawingroom and have a little music it calms the mind to listen to your wifes niece singing oh that we two were maying even if you are not musical as is the case with me there is a great deal in the drawingroom to refresh you there are the japanese fans on the wall which are things of beauty though your artistic taste may not be sufficiently educated to let you know it except by hearsay and it is pleasant to feel that they were bought with money which in the foolish old days would have been squandered on a box of cigars in like manner every pretty trifle in the room reminds you how much wiser you are now than you used to be it is even gratifying to stand in summer at the drawingroom window and watch the very cabbies passing with cigars in their mouths at the same time if i had the making of the laws i would prohibit peoples smoking in the street if they are married men they are smoking drawingroom firescreens and mantelpiece borders for the pinkandgold room if they are bachelors it is a scandal that bachelors should get the best of everything  nothing is more pitiable than the way some men of my acquaintance enslave themselves to tobacco  nay worse they make an idol of some one particular tobacco i know a man who considers a certain mixture so superior to all others that he will walk three miles for it surely every one will admit that this is lamentable it is not even a good mixture for i used to try it occasionally and if there is one man in london who knows tobaccoes it is myself there is only one mixture in london deserving the adjective superb i will not say where it is to be got for the result would certainly be that many foolish men would smoke more than ever but i never knew anything to compare to it it is deliciously mild yet full of fragrance and it never burns the tongue if you try it once you smoke it ever afterward it clears the brain and soothes the temper when i went away for a holiday anywhere i took as much of that exquisite healthgiving mixture as i thought would last me the whole time but i always ran out of it then i telegraphed to london for more and was miserable until it arrived how i tore the lid off the canister that is a tobacco to live for but i am better without it  occasionally i feel a little depressed after dinner still without being able to say why and if my wife has left me i wander about the room restlessly like one who misses something usually however she takes me with her to the drawingroom and reads aloud her delightfully long homeletters or plays soft music to me if the music be sweet and sad it takes me away to a stair in an inn which i climb gayly and shake open a heavy door on the top floor and turn up the gas it is a little room i am in once again and very dusty a pile of papers and magazines stands as high as a table in the corner furthest from the door the cane chair shows the exact shape of marriots back what is left after lighting the fire of a frame picture lies on the hearthrug gilray walks in uninvited he has left word that his visitors are to be sent on to me the room fills my hand feels along the mantelpiece for a brown jar the jar is between my knees i fill my pipe  after a time the music ceases and my wife puts her hand on my shoulder perhaps i start a little and then she says i have been asleep this is the book of my dreams  illustration     chapter ii  my first cigar   illustration  it was not in my chambers but three hundred miles further north that i learned to smoke i think i may say with confidence that a first cigar was never smoked in such circumstances before  at that time i was a schoolboy living with my brother who was a man people mistook our relations and thought i was his son they would ask me how my father was and when he heard of this he scowled at me even to this day i look so young that people who remember me as a boy now think i must be that boys younger brother i shall tell presently of a strange mistake of this kind but at present i am thinking of the evening when my brothers eldest daughter was bornperhaps the most trying evening he and i ever passed together so far as i knew the affair was very sudden and i felt sorry for my brother as well as for myself  we sat together in the study he on an armchair drawn near the fire and i on the couch i cannot say now at what time i began to have an inkling that there was something wrong it came upon me gradually and made me very uncomfortable though of course i did not show this i heard people going up and down stairs but i was not at that time naturally suspicious comparatively early in the evening i felt that my brother had something on his mind as a rule when we were left together he yawned or drummed with his fingers on the arm of his chair to show that he did not feel uncomfortable or i made a pretence of being at ease by playing with the dog or saying that the room was close then one of us would rise remark that he had left his book in the diningroom and go away to look for it taking care not to come back till the other had gone in this crafty way we helped each other on that occasion however he did not adopt any of the usual methods and though i went up to my bedroom several times and listened through the wall i heard nothing at last some one told me not to go upstairs and i returned to the study feeling that i now knew the worst he was still in the armchair and i again took to the couch i could see by the way he looked at me over his pipe that he was wondering whether i knew anything i dont think i ever liked my brother better than on that night and i wanted him to understand that whatever happened it would make no difference between us but the affair upstairs was too delicate to talk of and all i could do was to try to keep his mind from brooding on it by making him tell me things about politics this is the kind of man my brother is he is an astonishing master of facts and i suppose he never read a book yet from a blue book to a volume of verse without catching the author in error about something he reads books for that purpose as a rule i avoided argument with him because he was disappointed if i was right and stormed if i was wrong it was therefore a dangerous thing to begin on politics but i thought the circumstances warranted it to my surprise he answered me in a rambling manner occasionally breaking off in the middle of a sentence and seeming to listen for something i tried him on history and mentioned 1822 as the date of the battle of waterloo merely to give him his opportunity but he let it pass after that there was silence by and by he rose from his chair apparently to leave the room and then sat down again as if he had thought better of it he did this several times always eying me narrowly wondering how i could make it easier for him i took up a book and pretended to read with deep attention meaning to show him that he could go away if he liked without my noticing it at last he jumped up and looking at me boldly as if to show that the house was his and he could do what he liked in it went heavily from the room as soon as he was gone i laid down my book i was now in a state of nervous excitement though outwardly i was quite calm i took a look at him as he went up the stairs and noticed that he had slipped off his shoes on the bottom step all haughtiness had left him now  illustration  in a little while he came back he found me reading he lighted his pipe and pretended to read too i shall never forget that my book was anne judge spinster while his was a volume of blackwood every five minutes his pipe went out and sometimes the book lay neglected on his knee as he stared at the fire then he would go out for five minutes and come back again it was late now and i felt that i should like to go to my bedroom and lock myself in that however would have been selfish so we sat on defiantly at last he started from his chair as some one knocked at the door i heard several people talking and then loud above their voices a younger one  illustration  when i came to myself the first thing i thought was that they would ask me to hold it then i remembered with another sinking at the heart that they might want to call it after me these of course were selfish reflections but my position was a trying one the question was what was the proper thing for me to do i told myself that my brother might come back at any moment and all i thought of after that was what i should say to him i had an idea that i ought to congratulate him but it seemed a brutal thing to do i had not made up my mind when i heard him coming down he was laughing and joking in what seemed to me a flippant kind of way considering the circumstances when his hand touched the door i snatched at my book and read as hard as i could he was swaggering a little as he entered but the swagger went out of him as soon as his eye fell on me i fancy he had come down to tell me and now he did not know how to begin he walked up and down the room restlessly looking at me as he walked the one way while i looked at him as he walked the other way at length he sat down again and took up his book he did not try to smoke the silence was something terrible nothing was to be heard but an occasional cinder falling from the grate this lasted i should say for twenty minutes and then he closed his book and flung it on the table i saw that the game was up and closed anne judge spinster then he said with affected jocularity well young man do you know that you are an uncle there was silence again for i was still trying to think out some appropriate remark after a time i said in a weak voice boy or girl girl he answered then i thought hard again and all at once remembered something both doing well i whispered yes he said sternly i felt that something great was expected of me but i could not jump up and wring his hand i was an uncle i stretched out my arm toward the cigarbox and firmly lighted my first cigar  illustration     chapter iii  the arcadia mixture  illustration   darkness comes and with it the porter to light our stair gas he vanishes into his box already the inn is so quiet that the tap of a pipe on a windowsill startles all the sparrows in the quadrangle the men on my stair emerged from their holes scrymgeour in a dressinggown pushes open the door of the boudoir on the first floor and climbs lazily the sentimental face and the clay with a crack in it are marriots gilray who has been rehearsing his part in the new original comedy from the icelandic ceases muttering and feels his way along his dark lobby jimmy pins a notice on his door called away on business and crosses to me soon we are all in the old room again jimmy on the hearthrug marriot in the cane chair the curtains are pinned together with a pennib and the five of us are smoking the arcadia mixture  pettigrew will be welcomed if he comes but he is a married man and we seldom see him nowadays others will be regarded as intruders if they are smoking common tobaccoes they must either be allowed to try ours or requested to withdraw one need only put his head in at my door to realize that tobaccoes are of two kinds the arcadia and others no one who smokes the arcadia would ever attempt to describe its delights for his pipe would be certain to go out when he was at school jimmy moggridge smoked a cane chair and he has since said that from cane to ordinary mixtures was not so noticeable as the change from ordinary mixtures to the arcadia i ask no one to believe this for the confirmed smoker in arcadia detests arguing with anybody about anything were i anxious to prove jimmys statement i would merely give you the only address at which the arcadia is to be had but that i will not do it would be as rash as proposing a man with whom i am unacquainted for my club you may not be worthy to smoke the arcadia mixture  illustration  even though i became attached to you i might not like to take the responsibility of introducing you to the arcadia this mixture has an extraordinary effect upon character and probably you want to remain as you are before i discovered the arcadia and communicated it to the other fiveincluding pettigrewwe had all distinct individualities but now except in appearanceand the arcadia even tells on thatwe are as like as holly leaves we have the same habits the same ways of looking at things the same satisfaction in each other no doubt we are not yet absolutely alike indeed i intend to prove this but in given circumstances we would probably do the same thing and furthermore it would be what other people would not do thus when we are together we are only to be distinguished by our pipes but any one of us in the company of persons who smoke other tobaccoes would be considered highly original he would be a pigtail in europe  illustration  if you meet in company a man who has ideas and is not shy yet refuses absolutely to be drawn into talk you may set him down as one of us among the first effects of the arcadia is to put an end to jabber gilray had at one time the reputation of being such a brilliant talker that arcadians locked their doors on him but now he is a man that can be invited anywhere the arcadia is entirely responsible for the change perhaps i myself am the most silent of our company and hostesses usually think me shy they ask ladies to draw me out and when the ladies find me as hopeless as a sulky drawer they call me stupid the charge may be true but i do not resent it for i smoke the arcadia mixture and am consequently indifferent to abuse  i willingly gibbet myself to show how reticent the arcadia makes us it happens that i have a connection with nottingham and whenever a man mentions nottingham to me with a certain gleam in his eye i know that he wants to discuss the lace trade but it is a curious fact that the aggressive talker constantly mixes up nottingham and northampton oh you know nottingham he says interestedly and how do you like labouchere for a member do you think i put him right do you imagine me thirsting to tell that mr labouchere is the christian member for northampton do you suppose me swift to explain that mr broadhurst is one of the nottingham members and that the nottingham lambs are notorious in the history of political elections do you fancy me explaining that he is quite right in saying that nottingham has a large marketplace do you see me drawn into half an hours talk about robin hood that is not my way i merely reply that we like mr labouchere pretty well it may be said that i gain nothing by this that the talker will be as curious about northampton as he would have been about nottingham and that bradlaugh and labouchere and boots will serve his turn quite as well as broadhurst and lace and robin hood but that is not so beginning on northampton in the most confident manner it suddenly flashes across him that he has mistaken northampton for nottingham how foolish of me he says i maintain a severe silence he is annoyed my experience of talkers tells me that nothing annoys them so much as a blunder of this kind from the coldly polite way in which i have taken the talkers remarks he discovers the value i put upon them and after that if he has a neighbor on the other side he leaves me alone  enough has been said to show that the arcadians golden rule is to be careful about what he says this does not mean that he is to say nothing as society is at present constituted you are bound to make an occasional remark but you need not make it rashly it has been said somewhere that it would be well for talkative persons to count twenty or to go over the alphabet before they let fall the observation that trembles on their lips the nontalker has no taste for such an unintellectual exercise at the same time he must not hesitate too long for of course it is to his advantage to introduce the subject he ought to think out a topic of which his neighbor will not be able to make very much to begin on the fall of snow or the number of tons of turkeys consumed on christmas day as stated in the daily telegraph is to deserve your fate if you are at a dinnerparty of men only take your host aside and in a few wellconsidered sentences find out from him what kind of men you are to sit between during dinner perhaps one of them is an african traveller a knowledge of this prevents your playing into his hands by remarking that the papers are full of the relief of emin pasha these private inquiries will also save you from talking about mr chamberlain to a neighbor who turns out to be the son of a birmingham elector allow that man his chance and he will not only give you the birmingham gossip but what individual electors said about mr chamberlain to the banker or the tailor and what the grocer did the moment the poll was declared with particulars about the antiquity of birmingham and the fishing to be had in the neighborhood what you ought to do is to talk about emin pasha to this man and to the traveller about mr chamberlain taking care of course to speak in a low voice in that way you may have comparative peace everything however depends on the calibre of your neighbors if they agree to look upon you as an honorable antagonist and so to fight fair the victory will be to him who deserves it that is to say to the craftier man of the two but talkers as a rule do not fight fair they consider silent men their prey it will thus be seen that i distinguish between talkers admitting that some of them are worse than others the lowest in the social scale is he who stabs you in the back as it were instead of crossing swords if one of the gentlemen introduced to you is of that type he will not be ashamed to say speaking of emin pasha i wonder if mr chamberlain is interested in the relief expedition i dont know if i told you that my father and there he is fairly on horseback it is seldom of any use to tempt him into other channels better turn to your traveller and let him describe the different routes to egyptian equatorial provinces with his own views thereon allow him even to draw a map of africa with a fork on the tablecloth a talker of this kind is too full of his subject to insist upon answering questions so that he does not trouble you much it is his own dinner that is spoiled rather than yours treat in the same way as the chamberlain talker the man who sits down beside you and begins remarkable man mr gladstone  there was a ventilator in my room which sometimes said crikcrik reminding us that no one had spoken for an hour occasionally however we had lapses of speech when gilray might tell over againthough not quite as i mean to tell itthe story of his first pipeful of the arcadia or scrymgeour the travelled man would give us the list of famous places in europe where he had smoked but as a rule none of us paid much attention to what the others said and after the last pipe the room emptiedunless marriot insisted on staying behind to bore me with his scruplesby first one and then another putting his pipe into his pocket and walking silently out of the room  illustration     chapter iv  my pipes   in a select company of scoffers my brier was known as the mermaid the mouthpiece was a cigaretteholder and months of unwearied practice were required before you found the angle at which the bowl did not drop off  illustration  this brings me to one of the many advantages that my brier had over all other pipes it has given me a reputation for gallantry to which without it i fear i could lay no claim i used to have a passion for repartee especially in the society of ladies but it is with me as with many other men of parts whose wit has ever to be fired by a long fuse my best things strike me as i wend my way home this embittered my early days and not till the pride of youth had been tamed could i stop to lay in a stock of repartee on likely subjects the night before then my pipe helped me it was the apparatus that carried me to my prettiest compliment having exposed my pipe in some prominent place where it could hardly escape notice i took measures for insuring a visit from a lady young graceful accomplished or i might have it ready for a chance visitor on her arrival i conducted her to a seat near my pipe it is not good to hurry on to the repartee at once so i talked for a time of the weather the theatres the new novel i kept my eye on her and by and by she began to look about her she observed the strangelooking pipe now is the critical moment it is possible that she may pass it by without remark in which case all is lost but experience has shown me that four times out of six she touches it in assumed horror to pass some humorous remark off tumbles the bowl oh she exclaims see what i have done i am so sorry i pull myself together madame i reply calmly and bowing low what else was to be expected you came near my pipeand it lost its head she blushes but cannot help being pleased and i set my pipe for the next visitor by the help of a notebook of course i guarded myself against paying this very neat compliment to any person more than once however after i smoked the arcadia the desire to pay ladies compliments went from me  journeying back into the past i come to a time when my pipe had a mouthpiece of fine amber the bowl and the rest of the stem were of brier but it was a gentlemanly pipe without silver mountings such tobacco i revelled in as may have filled the pouch of pan as he lay smoking on the mountainsides once i saw a beautiful woman with brown hair in and out of which the rays of a morning sun played hideandseek that might not unworthily have been compared to it beguiled by the exquisite arcadia the days and the years passed from me in delicate rings of smoke and i contentedly watched them sailing to the skies how continuous was the line of those lovely circles and how straight one could have passed an iron rod through them from end to end but one day i had a harsh awakening i bit the amber mouthpiece of my pipe through and life was never the same again  it is strange how attached we become to old friends though they be but inanimate objects the old pipe put aside i turned to a meerschaum which had been presented to me years before with the caution that i must not smoke it unless i wore kid gloves there was no savor in that pipe for me i tried another brier and it made me unhappy clays would not keep in with me it seemed as if they knew i was hankering after the old pipe and went out in disgust then i got a new amber mouthpiece for my first love in a week i had bitten that through too and in an overanxious attempt to file off the ragged edges i broke the screw moralists have said that the smoker who has no thought but for his pipe never breaks it that it is he only who while smoking concentrates his mind on some less worthy object that sends his teeth through the amber this may be so for i am a philosopher and when working out new theories i may have been careless even of that which inspired them most  after this second accident nothing went well with me or with my pipe i took the mouthpieces out of other pipes and fixed them on to the mermaid in a little while one of them became too wide another broke as i was screwing it more firmly in then the bowl cracked at the rim and split at the bottom this was an annoyance until i found out what was wrong and plugged up the fissures with sealingwax the wax melted and dropped upon my clothes after a time but it was easily renewed  it was now that i had the happy thought of bringing a cigaretteholder to my assistance but of course one cannot make a pipestem out of a cigaretteholder all at once the thread you wind round the screw has a disappointing way of coming undone when down falls the bowl with an escape of sparks twisting a piece of paper round the screw is an improvement but until you have acquired the knack the operation has to be renewed every time you relight your pipe this involves a sad loss of time and in my case it afforded a butt for the dull wit of visitors otherwise i found it satisfactory and i was soon astonishingly adept at making paper screws eventually my brier became as serviceable as formerly though not perhaps so handsome i fastened on the holder with sealingwax and often a week passed without my having to renew the joint  it was no easy matter lighting a pipe like mine especially when i had no matches i always meant to buy a number of boxes but somehow i put off doing it occasionally i found a box of vestas on my mantelpiece which some caller had left there by mistake or sympathizing perhaps with my case but they were such a novelty that i never felt quite at home with them generally i remembered they were there just after my pipe was lighted   when i kept them in mind and looked forward to using them they were at the other side of the room and it would have been a pity to get up for them besides the most convenient medium for lighting ones pipe is paper after all and if you have not an old envelope in your pocket there is probably a photograph standing on the mantelpiece it is convenient to have the magazines lying handy or a page from a bookhandmade paper burns beautifullywill do to be sure there is the lighting of your paper for this your lamp is practically useless standing in the middle of the table while you are in an easychair by the fireside and as for the tapeandspark contrivance it is the introduction of machinery into the softest joys of life the fire is best it is near you and you drop your burning spill into it with a minimum waste of energy the proper fire for pipes is one in a cheerful blaze if your spill is carelessly constructed the flame runs up into your fingers before you know what you are doing so that it is as well to marry and get your wife to make spills for you before you begin to smoke scatter these about the fireplace then you will be able to reach them without rising the irritating fire is the one that has burned lowwhen the coals are more than half cinders and cling to each other in fear of death with such a fire it is no use attempting to light a pipe all at once your better course now is to drop little bits of paper into the likely places in the fire and have a spill ready to apply to the one that lights first it is an anxious moment for they may merely shrivel up sullenly without catching fire and in that case some men lose their tempers bad to lose your temper over your pipe  illustration  no pipe really ever rivalled the brier in my affections though i can recall a mad month when i fell in love with two little meerschaums which i christened romulus and remus they lay together in one case in regent street and it was with difficulty that i could pass the shop without going in often i took side streets to escape their glances but at last i asked the price it startled me and i hurried home to the brier  i forget when it was that a sort of compromise struck me this was that i should present the pipes to my brother as a birthday gift did i really mean to do this or was i only trying to cheat my conscience who can tell i hurried again into regent street there they were more beautiful than ever i hovered about the shop for quite half an hour that day my indecision and vacillation were pitiful buttoning up my coat i would rush from the window only to find myself back again in five minutes sometimes i had my hand on the shop door then i tore it away and hurried into oxford street then i slunk back again self whispered buy themfor your brother conscience said go home at last i braced myself up for a magnificent effort and jumped into a bus bound for london bridge this saved me for the time  illustration  i now began to calculate how i could become owner of the meerschaumsprior to dispatching them by parcelpost to my brotherwithout paying for them that was my way of putting it i calculated that by giving up my daily paper i should save thirteen shillings in six months after all why should i take in a daily paper to read through columns of public speeches and police cases and murders in paris is only to squander valuable time now when i left home i promised my father not to waste my time my father had been very good to me why then should i do that which i had promised him not to do then again there were the theatres during the past six months i had spent several pounds on theatres was this right my mother who has never i think been in a theatre strongly advised me against frequenting such places i did not take this much to heart at the time theatres did not seem to me to be immoral but after all my mother is older than i am and who am i to set my views up against hers by avoiding the theatres for the next six months i am already say three pounds to the good i had been frittering away my money too on luxuries and luxuries are effeminate thinking the matter over temperately and calmly in that way i saw that i should be thoughtfully saving money instead of spending it by buying romulus and remus as i already called them at the same time i should be gratifying my father and my mother and leading a higher and a nobler life even then i do not know that i should have bought the pipes until the six months were up had i not been driven to it by jealousy on my life love for a pipe is ever like love for a woman though they say it is not so acute many a man thinks there is no haste to propose until he sees a hated rival approaching even if he is not in a hurry for the lady himself he loathes the idea of her giving herself in a moment of madness to that other fellow rather than allow that he proposes himself and so insures her happiness it was so with me romulus and remus were taken from the window to show to a blackbearded swarthy man whom i suspected of designs upon them the moment he entered the shop ah the agony of waiting until he came out he was not worthy of them i never knew how much i loved them until i had nearly lost them as soon as he was gone i asked if he had priced them and was told that he had he was to call again tomorrow i left a deposit of a guinea hurried home for more money and that night romulus and remus were mine but i never really loved them as i loved my brier  illustration     chapter v  my tobaccopouch   illustration  i once knew a lady who said of her husband that he looked nice when sitting with a rug over him my female relatives seemed to have the same opinion of my tobaccopouch for they never saw it even in my own room without putting a book or pamphlet over it they called it that thing and made tongs of their knittingneedles to lift it and when i indignantly returned it to my pocket they raised their hands to signify that i would not listen to reason it seemed to come natural to other persons to present me with new tobaccopouches until i had nearly a score lying neglected in drawers but i am not the man to desert an old friend that has been with me everywhere and thoroughly knows my ways once indeed i came near to being unfaithful to my tobaccopouch and i mean to tell howpartly as a punishment to myself  illustration  the incident took place several years ago gilray and i had set out on a walking tour of the shakespeare country but we separated at stratford which was to be our startingpoint because he would not wait for me i am more of a shakespearian student than gilray and stratford affected me so much that i passed day after day smoking reverently at the hotel door while he being of the pure tourist type not that i would say a word against gilray wanted to rush from one place of interest to another he did not understand what thoughts came to me as i strolled down the stratford streets and in the hotel when i lay down on the sofa he said i was sleeping though i was really picturing to myself shakespeares boyhood gilray even went the length of arguing that it would not be a walking tour at all if we never made a start so upon the whole i was glad when he departed alone the next day was a memorable one to me in the morning i wrote to my london tobacconist for more arcadia i had quarrelled with both of the stratford tobacconists the one of them as soon as he saw my tobaccopouch almost compelled me to buy a new one the second was even more annoying i paid with a halfsovereign for the tobacco i had got from him but after gazing at the pouch he became suspicious of the coin and asked if i could not pay him in silver an insult to my pouch i considered an insult to myself so i returned to those shops no more the evening of the day on which i wrote to london for tobacco brought me a letter from home saying that my sister was seriously ill i had left her in good health so that the news was the more distressing of course i returned home by the first train sitting alone in a dull railway compartment my heart was filled with tenderness and i recalled the occasions on which i had carelessly given her pain suddenly i remembered that more than once she had besought me with tears in her eyes to fling away my old tobaccopouch she had always said that it was not respectable in the bitterness of selfreproach i pulled the pouch from my pocket asking myself whether after all the love of a good woman was not a far more precious possession without giving myself time to hesitate i stood up and firmly cast my old pouch out at the window i saw it fall at the foot of a fence the train shot on  illustration  illustration  by the time i reached home my sister had been pronounced out of danger of course i was much relieved to hear it but at the same time this was a lesson to me not to act rashly the retention of my tobaccopouch would not have retarded her recovery and i could not help picturing my pouch my oldest friend in the world lying at the foot of that fence i saw that i had done wrong in casting it from me i had not even the consolation of feeling that if any one found it he would cherish it for it was so much damaged that i knew it could never appeal to a new owner as it appealed to me i had intended telling my sister of the sacrifice made for her sake but after seeing her so much better i left the room without doing so there was arcadia mixture in the house but i had not the heart to smoke i went early to bed and fell into a troubled sleep from which i awoke with a shiver the rain was driving against my window tapping noisily on it as if calling on me to awake and go back for my tobaccopouch it rained far on into the morning and i lay miserably seeing nothing before me but a wet fence and a tobaccopouch among the grass at the foot of it  on the following afternoon i was again at stratford so far as i could remember i had flung away the pouch within a few miles of the station but i did not look for it until dusk i felt that the porters had their eyes on me by crouching along hedges i at last reached the railway a mile or two from the station and began my search it may be thought that the chances were against my finding the pouch but i recovered it without much difficulty the scene as i flung my old friend out at the window had burned itself into my brain and i could go to the spot today as readily as i went on that occasion there it was lying among the grass but not quite in the place where it had fallen apparently some navvy had found it looked at it and then dropped it it was halffull of water and here and there it was sticking together but i took it up tenderly and several times on the way back to the station i felt in my pocket to make sure that it was really there  illustration  i have not described the appearance of my pouch feeling that to be unnecessary it never i fear quite recovered from its night in the rain and as my female relatives refused to touch it i had to sew it together now and then myself gilray used to boast of a way of mending a hole in a tobaccopouch that was better than sewing you put the two pieces of guttapercha close together and then cut them sharply with scissors this makes them run together he says and i believed him until he experimented upon my pouch however i did not object to a hole here and there wherever i laid that pouch it left a small deposit of tobacco and thus i could generally get together a pipeful at times when other persons would be destitute i never told my sister that my pouch was once all but lost but ever after that when she complained that i had never even tried to do without it i smiled tenderly  illustration     chapter vi  my smokingtable   illustration  had it not been for a bootblack at charing cross i should probably never have bought the smokingtable i had to pass that boy every morning in vain did i scowl at him or pass with my head to the side he always pointed derisively as i thought at my boots probably my boots were speckless but that made no difference he jeered and sneered i have never hated any one as i loathed that boy and to escape him i took to going round by the lowther arcade it was here that my eye fell on the smokingtable in the lowther arcade if the attendants catch you looking at any article for a fraction of a second it is done up in brown paper you have paid your money and they have taken down your address before you realize that you dont want anything in this way i became the owner of my smokingtable and when i saw it in a brownpaper parcel on my return to my chambers i could not think what it was until i cut the strings such a little gem of a table no smokers should be without and i am not ashamed to say that i was in love with mine as soon as i had fixed the pieces together it was of walnut and consisted mainly of a stalk and two round slabs not much bigger than dinnerplates there were holes in the centre of these slabs for the stalk to go through and the one slab stood two feet from the floor the other a foot higher the lower slab was fitted with a walnut tobaccojar and a piperack while on the upper slab were exquisite little recesses for cigars cigarettes matches and ashes these held respectively three cigars two cigarettes and four wax vestas the smokingtable was an ornament to any room and the first night i had it i raised my eyes from my book to look at it every few minutes i got all my pipes together and put them in the rack i filled the jar with tobacco the recesses with three cigars two cigarettes and four matches and then i thought i would have a smoke i swept my hand confidently along the mantelpiece but it did not stop at a pipe i rose and looked for a pipe i had half a dozen but not one was to be seennone on the mantelpiece none on the windowsill none on the hearthrug none being used as bookmarkers i tugged at the bell till william john came in quaking and then i asked him fiercely what he had done with my pipes i was so obviously not to be trifled with that william john as we called him because some thought his name was william while others thought it was john very soon handed me my favorite pipe which he found in the rack on the smokingtable this incident illustrates one of the very few drawbacks of smokingtables not being used to them you forget about them william john however took the greatest pride in the table and whenever he saw a pipe lying on the rug he pounced upon it and placed it like a prisoner in the rack he was also most particular about the three cigars the two cigarettes and the four wax vestas keeping them carefully in the proper compartments where unfortunately i seldom thought of looking for them  illustration  the fatal defect of the smokingtable however was that it was generally rolling about the floorthe stalk in one corner the slabs here and there the cigars on the rug to be trampled on the lid of the tobaccojar beneath a chair every morning william john had to put the table together sometimes i had knocked it over accidentally i would fling a crumpled piece of paper into the wastepaper basket it missed the basket but hit the smokingtable which went down like a wooden soldier when my fire went out just because i had taken my eyes off it for a moment i called it names and flung the tongs at it there was a crashthe smokingtable again in time i might have remedied this but there is one weakness which i could not stand in any smokingtable a smokingtable ought to be so constructed that from where you are sitting you can stretch out your feet twist them round the stalk and so lift the table to the spot where it will be handiest this my smokingtable would never do the moment i had it in the air it wanted to stand on its head  though i still admired smokingtables as much as ever i began to want very much to give this one away the difficulty was not so much to know whom to give it to as how to tie it up my brother was the very person for i owed him a letter and this i thought would do instead for a month i meant to pack the table up and send it to him but i always put off doing it and at last i thought the best plan would be to give it to scrymgeour who liked elegant furniture as a smoker scrymgeour seemed the very man to appreciate a pretty useful little table besides all i had to do was to send william john down with it scrymgeour was out at the time but we left it at the side of his fireplace as a pleasant surprise next morning to my indignation it was back at the side of my fireplace and in the evening scrymgeour came and upbraided me for trying as he most unworthily expressed it to palm the thing off on him he was no sooner gone than i took the table to pieces to send it to my brother i tied the stalk up in brown paper meaning to get a box for the other parts william john sent off the stalk and for some days the other pieces littered the floor my brother wrote me saying he had received something from me for which his best thanks but would i tell him what it was as it puzzled everybody this was his impatient way but i made an effort and sent off the other pieces to him in a hatbox  that was a year ago and since then i have only heard the history of the smokingtable in fragments my brother liked it immensely but he thought it was too luxurious for a married man so he sent it to reynolds in edinburgh not knowing reynolds i cannot say what his opinion was but soon afterward i heard of its being in the possession of grayson who was charmed with it but gave it to pelle because it was hardly in its place in a bachelors establishment later a town man sent it to a country gentleman as just the thing for the country and it was afterward in liverpool as the very thing for a town there i thought it was lost so far as i was concerned one day however boyd a friend of mine who lives in glasgow came to me for a week and about six hours afterward he said that he had a present for me he brought it into my sittingrooma bulky parceland while he was undoing the cords he told me it was something quite novel he had bought it in glasgow the day before when i saw a walnut leg i started in another two minutes i was trying to thank boyd for my own smokingtable i recognized it by the dents i was too much the gentleman to insist on an explanation from boyd but though it seems a harsh thing to say my opinion is that these different persons gave the table away because they wanted to get rid of it william john has it now  illustration     chapter vii  gilray   illustration  gilray is an actor whose life i may be said to have strangely influenced for it was i who brought him and the arcadia mixture together after that his coming to live on our stair was only a matter of rooms being vacant  we met first in the merediths houseboat the tawny owl which was then lying at molesey gilray as i soon saw was a man trying to be miserable and finding it the hardest task in life it is strange that the philosophers have never hit upon this profound truth no man ever tried harder to be unhappy than gilray but the luck was against him and he was always forgetting himself mark tapley succeeded in being jolly in adverse circumstances gilray failed on the whole in being miserable in a delightful houseboat it is however so much more difficult to keep up misery than jollity that i like to think of his attempt as what the dramatic critics call a succès destime  the tawny owl lay on the far side of the island there were ladies in it and gilrays misery was meant to date from the moment when he asked one of them a question and she said no gilray was strangely unlucky during the whole of his time on board his evil genius was there though there was very little room for him and played sad pranks up to the time of his asking the question referred to gilray meant to create a pleasant impression by being jolly and he only succeeded in being as depressing as jaques afterward he was to be unutterably miserable and it was all he could do to keep himself at times from whirling about in waltz tune but then the nearest boat had a piano on board and some one was constantly playing dance music gilray had an idea that it would have been the proper thing to leave molesey when she said no and he would have done so had not the barbelfishing been so good the barbelfishing was altogether unfortunateat least gilrays passion for it was i have thoughtand so sometimes has gilraythat if it had not been for a barbel she might not have said no he was fishing from the houseboat when he asked the question you know how you fish from a houseboat the line is flung into the water and the rod laid down on deck you keep an eye on it barbelfishing in fact reminds one of the independent sort of man who is quite willing to play host to you but wishes you clearly to understand at the same time that he can do without you glad to see you with us if you have nothing better to do but please yourself is what he says to his friends this is also the form of invitation to barbel now it happened that she and gilray were left alone in the houseboat it was evening some chinese lanterns had been lighted and gilray though you would not think it to look at him is romantic he cast his line and turning to his companion asked her the question from what he has told me he asked it very properly and all seemed to be going well she turned away her head which is said not to be a bad sign and had begun to reply when a woful thing happened the line stiffened and there was a whirl of the reel who can withstand that music you can ask a question at any time but even at molesey barbel are only to be got now and then gilray rushed to his rod and began playing the fish he called to his companion to get the landingnet she did so and after playing his barbel for ten minutes gilray landed it then he turned to her again and she said no  gilray sees now that he made a mistake in not departing that night by the last train he overestimated his strength however we had something to do with his staying on and he persuaded himself that he remained just to show her that she had ruined his life once i believe he repeated his question but in reply she only asked him if he had caught any more barbel considering the surprisingly fine weather the barbelfishing and the piano on the other boat gilray was perhaps as miserable as could reasonably have been expected where he ought to have scored best however he was most unlucky she had a hammock swung between two trees close to the boat and there she lay holding a novel in her hand from the hammock she had a fine view of the deck and this was gilrays chance as soon as he saw her comfortably settled he pulled a long face and climbed on deck there he walked up and down trying to look the image of despair when she made some remark to him his plan was to show that though he answered cordially his cheerfulness was the result of a terrible inward struggle he did contrive to accomplish this if he was waiting for her observation but she sometimes took him unawares starting a subject in which he was interested then forgetting his character he would talk eagerly or jest with her across the strip of water until with a start he remembered what he had become he would seek to recover himself after that but of course it was too late to create a really lasting impression even when she left him alone watching him i fear over the top of her novel he disappointed himself for five minutes or so everything would go well he looked as dejected as possible but as he fell he was succeeding he became so selfsatisfied that he began to strut a pleased expression crossed his face and instead of allowing his head to hang dismally he put it well back sometimes when we wanted to please him we said he looked as glum as a mute at a funeral even that however defeated his object for it flattered him so much that he smiled with gratification  illustration  gilray made one great sacrifice by giving up smoking though not indeed such a sacrifice as mine for up to this time he did not know the arcadia mixture perhaps the only time he really did look as miserable as he wished was late at night when we men sat up for a second last pipe before turning in he looked wistfully at us from a corner yet as she had gone to rest cruel fate made this of little account his gloomy face saddened us too and we tried to entice him to shame by promising not to mention it to the ladies he almost yielded and showed us that while we smoked he had been holding his empty brier in his right hand for a moment he hesitated then said fiercely that he did not care for smoking next night he was shown a novel the hero of which had been refused though the ladys hardheartedness had a terrible effect on this fine fellow he strode away blowing great clouds into the air standing there smoking in the moonlight the authoress says in her next chapter de courcy was a strangely romantic figure he looked like a man who had done everything who had been through the furnace and had not come out of it unscathed this was precisely what gilray wanted to look like again he hesitated and then put his pipe in his pocket  it was now that i approached him with the arcadia mixture i seldom recommend the arcadia to men whom i do not know intimately lest in the afteryears i should find them unworthy of it but just as aladdin doubtless rubbed his lamp at times for show there were occasions when i was ostentatiously liberal if after trying the arcadia the lucky smoker to whom i presented it did not start or seize my hand or otherwise show that something exquisite had come into his life i at once forgot his name and his existence i approached gilray then and without a word handed him my pouch while the others drew nearer nothing was to be heard but the water oozing out and in beneath the houseboat gilray pushed the tobacco from him as he might have pushed a bag of diamonds that he mistook for pebbles i placed it against his arm and motioned to the others not to look then i sat down beside gilray and almost smoked into his eyes soon the aroma reached him and rapture struggled into his face slowly his fingers fastened on the pouch he filled his pipe without knowing what he was doing and i handed him a lighted spill he took perhaps three puffs and then gave me a look of reverence that i know well it only comes to a man once in all its glorythe first time he tries the arcadia mixturebut it never altogether leaves him  where do you get it gilray whispered in hoarse delight  the arcadia had him for its own  illustration     chapter viii  marriot   illustration  i have hinted that marriot was our sentimental member he was seldom sentimental until after midnight and then only when he and i were alone why he should have chosen me as the pail into which to pour his troubles i cannot say i let him talk on and when he had ended i showed him plainly that i had been thinking most of the time about something else whether marriot was entirely a humbug or the most conscientious person on our stair readers may decide he was fond of argument if you did not answer him and often wanted me to tell him if i thought he was in love if so why did i think so if not why not what makes me on reflection fancy that he was sincere is that in his statements he would let his pipe go out  of course i cannot give his words but he would wait till all my other guests had gone then softly lock the door and returning to the cane chair empty himself in some such way as this  i have something i want to talk to you about pass me a spill well it is this before i came to your rooms tonight i was cleaning my pipe when all at once it struck me that i might be in love this is the kind of shock that pulls a man up and together my first thought was if it be love well and good i shall go on as a gentleman i know my duty both to her and to myself at present however i am not certain which she is in love there are no degrees of that at least i feel positive it is a tempestuous surging passion or it is nothing the question for me therefore is is this the beginning of a tempestuous surging passion but stop does such a passion have a beginning should it not be in flood before we know what we are about i dont want you to answer  illustration  one of my difficulties is that i cannot reason from experience i cannot say to myself during the spring of 1886 and again in october 1888 your breast has known the insurgence of a tempestuous passion do you now note the same symptoms have you experienced a sudden sinking at the heart followed by thrills of exultation now i cannot even say that my appetite has fallen off but i am smoking more than ever and it is notorious that i experience sudden chills and thrills is this passion no i am not done i have only begun  illustration  in as you like it you remember the love symptoms are described at length but is rosalind to be taken seriously besides though she wore boys clothes she had only the womans point of view i have consulted stevensons chapters on love in his delightful virginibus puerisque and one of them says certainly if i could help it i would never marry a wife who wrote then i noticed a book published after that one and entitled the new arabian nights by mr and mrs robert louis stevenson i shut virginibus puerisque with a sigh and put it away  illustration  but this inquiry need not i feel confident lead to nothing negatively i know love for i do not require to be told what it is not and i have my ideal putting my knowledge together and surveying it dispassionately in the mass i am inclined to think that this is really love  illustration  i may lay down as proposition i that surging tempestuous passion comes involuntarily you are heartwhole when as it were the gates of your bosom open in she sweeps and the gates close so far this is a faithful description of my case whatever it is it came without any desire or volition on my part and it looks as if it meant to stay what i ask myself isfirst what is it secondly where is it thirdly who is it and fourthly what shall i do with it i have thus my work cut out for me  illustration  what is it i reply that i am stumped at once unless i am allowed to fix upon an object definitely and precisely this no doubt is arguing in a circle but descartes himself assumed what he was to try to prove this then being permitted i have chosen my object and we can now go on again what is it some might evade the difficulty by taking a middle course you are not they might say in love as yet but you are on the brink of it the lady is no idol to you at present but neither is she indifferent you would not walk four miles in wet weather to get a rose from her but if she did present you with a rose you would not wittingly drop it down an area in short you have all but lost your heart to this i reply simply love is not a process it is an event you may unconsciously be on the brink of it when all at once the ground gives way beneath you and in you go the difference between love and notlove if i may be allowed the word being so wide my inquiry should produce decisive results on the whole therefore and in the absence of direct proof to the contrary i believe that the passion of love does possess me  illustration  illustration  where is it this is the simplest question of the four it is in the heart it fills the heart to overflowing so that if there were one drop more the heart would run over love is thus plainly a liquid which accounts to some extent for its wellrecognized habit of surging among its effects this may be noted that it makes you miserable if you be not by the loved ones side to hold her hand is ecstasy to press it rapture the fond loveras it might be myselfsees his beloved depart on a railway journey with apprehension he never ceases to remember that engines burst and trains run off the line in an agony he awaits the telegram that tells him she has reached shepherds bush in safety when he sees her talking as if she liked it to another man he is torn he is rent asunder he is dismembered by jealousy he walks beneath her window till the policeman sees him home and when he wakes in the morning it is to murmur her name to himself until he falls asleep again and is late for the office well do i experience such sensations or do i not is this love after all where are the spills  i have been taking for granted that i know who it is but is this wise nothing puzzles me so much as the way some men seem to know by intuition as it were which is the woman for whom they have a passion they take a girl from among their acquaintance and never seem to understand that they may be taking the wrong one however with certain reservations i do not think i go too far in saying that i know who she is there is one other indeed that i have sometimes thoughtbut it fortunately happens that they are related so that in any case i cannot go far wrong after i have seen them again or at least before i propose i shall decide definitely on this point  we have now advanced as far as query iv now what is to be done let us consider this calmly in the first place have i any option in the matter or is love a hurricane that carries one hither and thither as a bottle is tossed in a chopping sea i reply that it all depends on myself rosalind would say no that we are without control over love but rosalind was a woman it is probably true that a woman cannot conquer love man being her ideal in the abstract is irresistible to her in the concrete but man being an intellectual creature can make a magnificent effort and cast love out should i think it advisable i do not question my ability to open the gates of my heart and bid her go that would be a serious thing for her and as man is powerful so i think should he be merciful she has no doubt gained admittance as it were furtively but can i as a gentleman send away a weak confiding woman who loves me simply because she cannot help it nay more in a pathetic case of this kind have i not a certain responsibility does not her attachment to me give her a claim upon me she saw me and love came to her she looks upon me as the noblest and best of my sex i do not say i am it may be that i am not but i have the childs happiness in my hands can i trample it beneath my feet it seems to be my plain duty to take her to me  but there are others to consider for me would it not be the better part to show her that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be my first consideration certainly there is nothing in a man i despise more than conceit in affairs of this sort when i hear one of my sex boasting of his conquests i turn from him in disgust conquest implies effort and to lay ones self out for victories over the other sex always reminds me of pigeonshooting on the other hand we must make allowances for our position of advantage these little ones come into contact with us they see us athletic beautiful in the huntingfield or at the wicket they sit beside us at dinner and listen to our brilliant conversation they have met us and the mischief is done every manexcept perhaps yourself and jimmyknows the names of a few dear girls who have lost their hearts to himsome more some less i do not pretend to be in a different position from my neighbors or in a better one to some slight extent i may be to blame but after all when a man sees cheeks redden and eyes brighten at his approach he loses prudence at the time he does not think what may be the consequences but the day comes when he sees that he must take heed what he is about he communes with himself about the future and if he be a man of honor he maps out in his mind the several courses it is allowed him to follow and chooses that one which he may tread with least pain to others may that day for introspection come to few as it has come to me love is indeed a madness in the brain goodnight  illustration  when he finished i would wake up open the door for marriot and light him to his sleepingchamber with a spill  illustration     illustration  chapter ix  jimmy   with the exception of myself jimmy moggridge was no doubt the most silent of the company that met so frequently in my rooms just as marriots eyebrows rose if the cane chair was not empty when he strode in jimmy held that he had a right to the hearthrug on which he loved to lie prone his back turned to the company and his eyes on his pipe the stem was a long cherrywood but the bowl was meerschaum and jimmy as he smoked lay on the alert as it were to see the meerschaum coloring so one may strain his eyes with intent eagerness until he can catch the hourhand of a watch in action with tobacco in his pocket jimmy could refill his pipe without moving but sometimes he crawled along the hearthrug to let the firelight play more exquisitely on his meerschaum bowl in time of course the arcadia mixture made him more and more like the rest of us but he retained his individuality until he let his bowl fall off otherwise he only differed from us in one way when he saw a matchbox he always extracted a few matches and put them dreamily into his pocket there were times when with a sharp blow on jimmys person we could doubtless have had him blazing like a chandelier  illustration  jimmy was a barristerthough this is scarcely worth mentioningand it had been known to us for years that he made a living by contributing to the saturday review how the secret leaked out i cannot say with certainty jimmy never forced it upon us and i cannot remember any paragraphs in the london correspondence of the provincial papers coupling his name with saturday articles on the other hand i distinctly recall having to wait one day in his chambers while jimmy was shaving and noticing accidentally a long bulky envelope on his table with the saturday reviews mystic crest on it it was addressed to jimmy and contained i concluded a bundle of proofs that was so long ago as 1885 if further evidence is required there is the undoubted fact to which several of us could take oath that at oxford jimmy was notorious for his sarcastic pennearly being sent down indeed for the same again there was the certainty that for years jimmy had been engaged upon literary work of some kind we had been with him buying the largestsized scribbling paper in the market we had heard him muttering to himself as if in pain and we had seen him correcting proofsheets when we caught him at them he always thrust the proofs into a drawer which he locked by putting his leg on itfor the ordinary lock was brokenand remaining in that position till we had retired though he rather shunned the subject as a rule he admitted to us that the work was journalism and not a sarcastic history of the nineteenth century on which we felt he would come out strong lastly jimmy had lost the brightness of his youth and was become silent and moody which is well known to be the result of writing satire  illustration  were it not so notorious that the thousands who write regularly for the saturday have reasons of their own for keeping it dark and merely admitting the impeachment with a nod or smile we might have marvelled at jimmys reticence there were however moments when he thawed so far as practically to allow and every one knows what that means that the saturday was his chief source of income only he would add should you be acquainted with the editor dont mention my contributions to him from this we saw that jimmy and the editor had an understanding on the subject though we were never agreed which of them it was who had sworn the other to secrecy we were proud of jimmys connection with the press and every week we discussed his latest article jimmy never told us except in a roundabout way which were his articles but we knew his style and it was quite exhilarating to pick out his contributions week by week we were never baffled for jimmys touches were unmistakable and have you seen jimmy this week in the saturday on lewis morris or i say do you think buchanan knows it was jimmy who wrote that was what we said when we had lighted our pipes  now i come to the incident that drew from jimmy his extraordinary statement i was smoking with him in his rooms one evening when a clatter at his door was followed by a thud on the floor i knew as well as jimmy what had happened in his presaturday days he had no letterbox only a slit in the door and through this we used to denounce him on certain occasions when we called and he would not let us in lately however he had fitted up a letterbox himself which kept together if you opened the door gently but came clattering to the floor under the weight of heavy letters the letter to which it had succumbed this evening was quite a package and could even have been used as a missile jimmy snatched it up quickly evidently knowing the contents by their bulk and i was just saying to myself more proofs from the saturday when the letter burst at the bottom and in a moment a score of smaller letters were tumbling about my feet in vain did jimmy entreat me to let him gather them up i helped and saw to my bewilderment that all the letters were addressed in childish hands to uncle jim care of editor of mothers pets it was impossible that jimmy could have so many nephews and nieces  seeing that i had him jimmy advanced to the hearthrug as if about to make his statement then changed his mind and thrusting a dozen of the letters into my hands invited me to read the first letter ran dearest uncle jimi must tell you about my canary i love my canary very much it is a yellow canary and it sings so sweetly i keep it in a cage and it is so tame mamma and me wishes you would come and see us and our canary dear uncle jim i love youyour little friend milly aged four years here is the second dear uncle jimyou will want to know about my blackbird it sits in a tree and picks up the crumbs on the window and thomas wants to shoot it for eating the cherries but i wont let thomas shoot it for it is a nice blackbird and i have wrote all this myselfyour loving little bobby aged five years in another jacky aged four and a half described his parrot and i have also vague recollections of harry aged six on his chaffinch and archie five on his linnet what does it mean i demanded of jimmy who while i read had been smoking savagely dont you see that they are in for the prize he growled then he made his statement  i have never jimmy said contributed to the saturday nor indeed to any wellknown paper that however was only because the editors would not meet me halfway after many disappointments fortunewhether good or bad i cannot sayintroduced me to the editor of mothers pets a weekly journal whose title sufficiently suggests its character though you may never have heard of it mothers pets has a wide circulation and is a great property i was asked to join the staff under the name of uncle jim and did not see my way to refuse i inaugurated a new feature mothers pets were cordially invited to correspond with me on topics to be suggested week by week and prizes were to be given for the best letters this feature has been an enormous success and i get the most affectionate letters from mothers consulting me about teething and the like every week they say that i am dearer to their children than most real uncles and they often urge me to go and stay with them there are lots of kisses awaiting me i also get similar invitations from the little beasts themselves pass the arcadia  illustration     illustration  chapter x  scrymgeour   scrymgeour was an artist and a man of means so proud of his profession that he gave all his pictures fancy prices and so wealthy that he could have bought them to him i went when i wanted moneythough it must not be thought that i borrowed in the days of the arcadia mixture i had no bank account as my checks dribbled in i stuffed them into a torn leather case that was kept together by a piece of twine and when want tapped at my chamber door i drew out the check that seemed most willing to come and exchanged with scrymgeour in his detestation of argument scrymgeour resembled myself but otherwise we differed as much as men may differ who smoke the arcadia he read little yet surprised us by a smattering of knowledge about all important books that had been out for a few months until we discovered that he got his information from a friend in india he had also i remember a romantic notion that africa might be civilized by the arcadia mixture as i shall explain presently his devotion to the arcadia very nearly married him against his will but first i must describe his boudoir  we always called it scrymgeours boudoir after it had ceased to deserve the censure just as we called moggridge jimmy because he was jimmy to some of us as a boy scrymgeour deserted his fine rooms in bayswater for the inn some months after the arcadia mixture had reconstructed him but his chambers were the best on our stair and with the help of a workman from the japanese village he converted them into an oriental dream our housekeeper thought little of the rest of us while the boudoir was there to be gazed at and even william john would not spill the coffee in it when the boudoir was ready for inspection scrymgeour led me to it and as the door opened i suddenly remembered that my boots were muddy the ceiling was a great japanese christmas card representing the heavens heavy clouds floated round a pale moon and with the dusk the stars came out the walls instead of being papered were hung with a soft japanese cloth and fantastic figures frolicked round a fireplace that held a bamboo fan there was no mantelpiece the room was very small but when you wanted a blue velvet desk to write on you had only to press a spring against the wall and if you leaned upon the desk the japanese workmen were ready to make you a new one there were springs everywhere shaped like birds and mice and butterflies and when you touched one of them something was sure to come out bloodcolored curtains separated the room from the alcove where scrymgeour was to rest by night and his bed became a bath by simply turning it upside down on one side of the bed was a winebin with a ladder running up to it the door of the sittingroom was a symphony in gray with shadowy reptiles crawling across the panels and the floordark mysteriouspresented a fanciful picture of the infernal regions scrymgeour said hopefully that the place would look cozier after he had his pictures in it but he stopped me when i began to fill my pipe he believed he said that smoking was not a japanese custom and there was no use taking japanese chambers unless you lived up to them here was a revelation scrymgeour proposed to live his life in harmony with these rooms i felt too sad at heart to say much to him then but promising to look in again soon i shook hands with my unhappy friend and went away  illustration  it happened however that scrymgeour had been several times in my rooms before i was able to visit him again my hand was on his doorbell when i noticed a figure i thought i knew lounging at the foot of the stair it was scrymgeour himself and he was smoking the arcadia we greeted each other languidly on the doorstep scrymgeour assuring me that japan in london was a grand idea it gave a zest to life banishing the poor weary conventionalities of ones surroundings this was said while we still stood at the door and i began to wonder why scrymgeour did not enter his rooms a beautiful night he said rapturously a cruel east wind was blowing he insisted that evening was the time for thinking and that east winds brace you up would i have a cigar i would if he asked me inside to smoke it my friend sighed i thought i told you he said that i dont smoke in my chambers it isnt the thing then he explained hesitatingly that he hadnt given up smoking i come down here he said with my pipe and walk up and down i assure you it is quite a new sensation and i much prefer it to lolling in an easychair the poor fellow shivered as he spoke and i noticed that his greatcoat was tightly buttoned up to the throat he had a hacking cough and his teeth were chattering let us go in i said i dont want to smoke he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and opened his door with an affectation of gayety  the room looked somewhat more homelike now but it was very cold scrymgeour had no fire yet he had been told that the smoke would blacken his moon besides i question if he would have dared to remove the fan from the fireplace without consulting a japanese authority he did not even know whether the japanese burned coal i missed a number of the articles of furniture that had graced his former rooms the easels were gone there were none of the old canvases standing against the wall and he had exchanged his comfortable plain old screen for one with lizards crawling over it it would never have done he explained to spoil the room with english things so i got in some more japanese furniture  i asked him if he had sold his canvases whereupon he signed me to follow him to the winebin it was full of them there were no newspapers lying about but scrymgeour hoped to manage to take one in by and by he was only feeling his way at present he said in the dim light shed by a japanese lamp i tripped over a rainbowcolored slipper that tapered to the heel and turned up at the toe i wonder you can get into these things i whispered for the place depressed me and he answered with similar caution that he couldnt i keep them lying about he said confidentially but after i think nobody is likely to call i put on an old pair of english ones at this point the housekeeper knocked at the door and scrymgeour sprang like an acrobat into a japanese dressinggown before he cried come in as i left i asked him how he felt now and he said that he had never been so happy in his life but his hand was hot and he did not look me in the face  illustration  nearly a month elapsed before i looked in again the unfortunate man had now a japanese rug over his legs to keep out the cold and he was gazing dejectedly at an outlandish mess which he called his lunch he insisted that it was not at all bad but it had evidently been on the table some time when i called and he had not even tasted it he ordered coffee for my benefit but i do not care for coffee that has salt in it instead of sugar i said that i had merely looked in to ask him to an early dinner at the club and it was touching to see how he grasped at the idea so complete however was his subjection to that terrible housekeeper who believed in his fad that he dared not send back her dishes untasted as a compromise i suggested that he could wrap up some of the stuff in paper and drop it quietly into the gutter we sallied forth and i found him so weak that he had to be assisted into a hansom he still maintained however that japanese chambers were worth making some sacrifice for and when the other arcadians saw his condition they had the delicacy not to contradict him they thought it was consumption  if we had not taken scrymgeour in hand i dare not think what his craze might have reduced him to a friend asked him into the country for ten days and of course he was glad to go as it happened my chambers were being repapered at the time and scrymgeour gave me permission to occupy his rooms until his return the other arcadians agreed to meet me there nightly and they were indefatigable in their efforts to put the boudoir to rights jimmy wrote letters to editors of a most cutting nature on the moon breaking the table as he stepped on and off it and we gave the butterflies to william john the reptiles had to crawl off the door and we made pipelights of the japanese fans marriot shot the candles at the mice and birds and gilray by improvising an entertainment behind the bloodred curtains contrived to give them the dilapidated appearance without which there is no real comfort in short the boudoir soon assumed such a homely aspect that scrymgeour on his return did not recognize it when he realized where he was he lighted up at once  illustration     chapter xi  his wifes cigars   illustration  though pettigrew who is a much more successful journalist than jimmy says pointedly of his wife that she encourages his smoking instead of putting an end to it i happen to know that he has cupboard skeletons pettigrew has been married for years and frequently boasted of his wifes interest in smoking until one night an accident revealed the true state of matters to me late in the night when traffic is hushed and the river has at last a chance of making itself heard pettigrews window opens cautiously and he casts something wrapped in newspaper into the night the window is then softly closed and all is again quiet at other times pettigrew steals along the curbstone dropping his skeletons one by one nevertheless his cupboard beneath the bookcase is so crammed that he dreams the lock has given way the key is always in his pocket yet when his children approach the cupboard he orders them away so fearful is he of something happening when his wife has retired he sometimes unlocks the cupboard with nervous hand when the door bursts gladly open and the things roll on to the carpet they are the cigars his wife gives him as birthday presents on the anniversary of his marriage and at other times and such a model wife is she that he would do anything for her except smoke them they are celebros regalia rothschilds twelve and six the hundred i discovered pettigrews secret one night when as i was passing his house a packet of celebros alighted on my head i demanded an explanation and i got it on the promise that i would not mention the matter to the other arcadians  illustration  several years having elapsed said pettigrew since i pretended to smoke and enjoy my first celebro i could not now undeceive my wifeit would be such a blow to her at the time it could have been done easily she began by making trial of a few there were seven of them in an envelope and i knew at once that she had got them for a shilling she had heard me saying that eightpence is a sad price to pay for a cigari prefer them at tenpenceand a few days afterward she produced her first celebros each of them had and has a gold ribbon round it bearing the legend non plus ultra she was shy and timid at that time and i thought it very brave of her to go into the shop herself and ask for the celebros as advertised so i thanked her warmly when she saw me slipping them into my pocket she looked disappointed and said that she would like to see me smoking one my reply would have been that i never cared to smoke in the open air if she had not often seen me do so besides i wanted to please her very much and if what i did was weak i have been severely punished for it the pocket into which i had thrust the celebros also contained my cigarcase and with my hand in the pocket i covertly felt for a villar y villar and squeezed it into the envelope this i then drew forth took out the cigar as distinguished from the celebros and smoked it with unfeigned content my wife watched me eagerly asking six or eight times how i liked it from the way she talked of fine rich bouquet and nutty flavor i gathered that she had been in conversation with the tobacconist and i told her the cigars were excellent yes they were as choice a brand as i had ever smoked she clapped her hands joyously at that and said that if she had not made up her mind never to do so she would tell me what they cost next she asked me to guess the price i answered eighty shillings a hundred and then she confessed that she got the seven for a shilling on our way home she made arch remarks about men who judged cigars simply by their price i laughed gayly in reply begging her not to be too hard on me and i did not even feel uneasy when she remarked that of course i would never buy those horridly expensive villar y villars again when i left her i gave the celebros to an acquaintance against whom i had long had a grudgewe have not spoken sincebut i preserved the envelope as a pretty keepsake this you see happened shortly before our marriage  illustration  i have had a consignment of celebros every month or two since then and dispose of them quietly as i may they are accumulating in the cupboard i despise myself but my guile was kindly meant at first and every thoughtful man will see the difficulties in the way of a confession now who can say what might happen if i were to fling that cupboard door open in presence of my wife i smoke less than i used to do for if i were to buy my cigars by the box i could not get them smuggled into the house besides she would knowi dont say how i merely make the statementthat i had been buying cigars so i get half a dozen at a time perhaps you will sympathize with me when i say that i have had to abandon my favorite brand i cannot get villar y villars that look like celebros and my wife is quicker in those matters than she used to be one day for instance she noticed that the cigars in my case had not the gold ribbon round them and i almost fancied she became suspicious i explained that the ribbon was perhaps a little ostentatious but she said it was an intimation of nutty flavor and now i take ribbons off the celebros and put them on the other cigars the boxes in which the celebros arrive have a picturesque design on the lid and a good deal of lace frilling round the edge and she likes to have a box lying about the top layer of that box is cigars in gold ribbons placed there by myself and underneath are the celebros i never get down to the celebros  for a long time my secret was locked in my breast as carefully as i shall lock my next weeks gift away in the cupboard if i can find room for it but a few of my most intimate friends have an inkling of it now when my friends drop in i am compelled to push the celebro box toward them and if they would simply take a cigar and ask no questions all would be well for as i have said there are cigars on the top but they spoil everything by remarking that they have not seen the brand before should my wife not be present this is immaterial for i have long had a reputation of keeping good cigars then i merely remark that it is a new brand and they smoke probably observing that it reminds them of a cabana which is natural seeing that it is a cabana in disguise if my wife is present however she comes forward smiling and remarks with a fond look in my direction that they are her birthday present to her jack then they start back and say they always smoke a pipe these celebros were making me a bad name among my friends so i have given a few of them to understandi dont care to put it more plainlythat if they will take a cigar from the top layer they will find it all right one of them however has a personal illwill to me because my wife told his wife that i preferred celebro cigars at twelve and six a hundred to any other now he is expected to smoke the same and he takes his revenge by ostentatiously offering me a celebro when i call on him  illustration     illustration  chapter xii  gilrays flowerpot   i charge gilrays unreasonableness to his ignoble passion for cigarettes and the story of his flowerpot has therefore an obvious moral the want of dignity he displayed about that flowerpot on his return to london would have made any one sorry for him i had my own work to look after and really could not be tending his chrysanthemum all day after he came back however there was no reasoning with him and i admit that i never did water his plant though always intending to do so  the great mistake was in not leaving the flowerpot in charge of william john no doubt i readily promised to attend to it but gilray deceived me by speaking as if the watering of a plant was the merest pastime he had to leave london for a short provincial tour and as i see now took advantage of my good nature  as gilray had owned his flowerpot for several months during which time i take him at his word he had watered it daily he must have known he was misleading me he said that you got into the way of watering a flowerpot regularly just as you wind up your watch that certainly is not the case i always wind up my watch and i never watered the flowerpot of course if i had been living in gilrays rooms with the thing always before my eyes i might have done so i proposed to take it into my chambers at the time but he would not hear of that why how gilray came by this chrysanthemum i do not inquire but whether in the circumstances he should not have made a clean breast of it to me is another matter undoubtedly it was an unusual thing to put a man to the trouble of watering a chrysanthemum daily without giving him its history my own belief has always been that he got it in exchange for a pair of boots and his old dressinggown he hints that it was a present but as one who knows him well i may say that he is the last person a lady would be likely to give a chrysanthemum to besides if he was so proud of the plant he should have stayed at home and watered it himself  illustration  he says that i never meant to water it which is not only a mistake but unkind my plan was to run downstairs immediately after dinner every evening and give it a thorough watering one thing or another however came in the way i often remembered about the chrysanthemum while i was in the office but even gilray could hardly have expected me to ask leave of absence merely to run home and water his plant you must draw the line somewhere even in a government office when i reached home i was tired inclined to take things easily and not at all in a proper condition for watering flowerpots then arcadians would drop in i put it to any sensible man or woman could i have been expected to give up my friends for the sake of a chrysanthemum again it was my custom of an evening if not disturbed to retire with my pipe into my cane chair and there pass the hours communing with great minds or when the mood was on me trifling with a novel often when i was in the middle of a chapter gilrays flowerpot stood up before my eyes crying for water he does not believe this but it is the solemn truth at those moments it was touch and go whether i watered his chrysanthemum or not where i lost myself was in not hurrying to his rooms at once with a tumbler i said to myself that i would go when i had finished my pipe but by that time the flowerpot had escaped my memory this may have been weakness all i know is that i should have saved myself much annoyance if i had risen and watered the chrysanthemum there and then but would it not have been rather hard on me to have had to forsake my books for the sake of gilrays flowers and flowerpots and plants and things what right has a man to go and make a garden of his chambers  illustration  all the three weeks he was away gilray kept pestering me with letters about his chrysanthemum he seemed to have no faith in mea detestable thing in a man who calls himself your friend i had promised to water his flowerpot and between friends a promise is surely sufficient it is not so however when gilray is one of them i soon hated the sight of my name in his handwriting it was not as if he had said outright that he wrote entirely to know whether i was watering his plant his references to it were introduced with all the appearance of afterthoughts often they took the form of postscripts by the way are you watering my chrysanthemum or the chrysanthemum ought to be a beauty by this time or you must be quite an adept now at watering plants gilray declares now that in answer to one of these ingenious epistles i wrote to him saying that i had just been watering his chrysanthemum my belief is that i did no such thing or if i did i meant to water it as soon as i had finished my letter he has never been able to bring this home to me he says because he burned my correspondence as if a business man would destroy such a letter it was yet more annoying when gilray took to postcards to hear the postmans knock and then discover when you are expecting an important communication that it is only a postcard about a flowerpotthat is really too bad and then i consider that some of the postcards bordered upon insult one of them said what about chrysanthemumreply at once this was just like gilrays overbearing way but i answered politely and so far as i knew truthfully chrysanthemum all right  knowing that there was no explaining things to gilray i redoubled my exertions to water his flowerpot as the day for his return drew near once indeed when i rang for water i could not for the life of me remember what i wanted it for when it was brought had i had any forethought i should have left the tumbler stand just as it was to show it to gilray on his return but unfortunately william john had misunderstood what i wanted the water for and put a decanter down beside it another time i was actually on the stair rushing to gilrays door when i met the housekeeper and stopping to talk to her lost my opportunity again to show how honestly anxious i was to fulfil my promise i need only add that i was several times awakened in the watches of the night by a haunting consciousness that i had forgotten to water gilrays flowerpot on these occasions i spared no trouble to remember again in the morning i reached out of bed to a chair and turned it upside down so that the sight of it when i rose might remind me that i had something to do with the same object i crossed the tongs and poker on the floor gilray maintains that instead of playing fools tricks like these fools tricks i should have got up and gone at once to his rooms with my waterbottle what and disturbed my neighbors besides could i reasonably be expected to risk catching my death of cold for the sake of a wretched chrysanthemum one reads of men doing such things for young ladies who seek lilies in dangerous ponds or edelweiss on overhanging cliffs but gilray was not my sweetheart nor i feel certain any other persons  i come now to the day prior to gilrays return i had just reached the office when i remembered about the chrysanthemum it was my last chance if i watered it once i should be in a position to state that whatever condition it might be in i had certainly been watering it i jumped into a hansom told the cabby to drive to the inn and twenty minutes afterward had one hand on gilrays door while the other held the largest watercan in the house opening the door i rushed in the can nearly fell from my hand there was no flowerpot i rang the bell mr gilrays chrysanthemum i cried what do you think william john said he coolly told me that the plant was dead and had been flung out days ago i went to the theatre that night to keep myself from thinking all next day i contrived to remain out of gilrays sight when we met he was stiff and polite he did not say a word about the chrysanthemum for a week and then it all came out with a rush i let him talk with the servants flinging out the flowerpots faster than i could water them what more could i have done a coolness between us was inevitable this i regretted but my mind was made up on one point i would never do gilray a favor again  illustration     chapter xiii  the grandest scene in history   illustration  though scrymgeour only painted in watercolors i thinki never looked at his pictureshe had one superb idea which we often advised him to carry out when he first mentioned it the room became comparatively animated so much struck were we all and we entreated him to retire to stratford for a few months before beginning the picture his idea was to paint shakespeare smoking his first pipe of the arcadia mixture  many hundreds of volumes have been written about the glories of the elizabethan age the sublime period in our history then were englishmen on fire to do immortal deeds high aims and noble ambitions became their birthright there was nothing they could not or would not do for england sailors put a girdle round the world every captain had a generals capacity every fightingman could have been a captain all the women from the queen downward were heroines lofty statesmanship guided the conduct of affairs a sublime philosophy was in the air the period of great deeds was also the period of our richest literature london was swarming with poetic geniuses immortal dramatists wandered in couples between stage doors and taverns  illustration  all this has been said many times and we read these glowing outbursts about the elizabethan age as if to the beating of a drum but why was this period riper for magnificent deeds and noble literature than any other in english history we all know how the thinkers historians and critics of yesterday and today answer that question but our hearts and brains tell us that they are astray by an amazing oversight they have said nothing of the influence of tobacco the elizabethan age might be better named the beginning of the smoking era no unprejudiced person who has given thought to the subject can question the propriety of dividing our history into two periodsthe presmoking and the smoking when raleigh in honor of whom england should have changed its name introduced tobacco into this country the glorious elizabethan age began i am aware that those hateful persons called original researchers now maintain that raleigh was not the man but to them i turn a deaf ear i know i feel that with the introduction of tobacco england woke up from a long sleep suddenly a new zest had been given to life the glory of existence became a thing to speak of men who had hitherto only concerned themselves with the narrow things of home put a pipe into their mouths and became philosophers poets and dramatists smoked until all ignoble ideas were driven from them and into their place rushed such high thoughts as the world had not known before petty jealousies no longer had hold of statesmen who smoked and agreed to work together for the public weal soldiers and sailors felt when engaged with a foreign foe that they were fighting for their pipes the whole country was stirred by the ambition to live up to tobacco every one in short had now a lofty ideal constantly before him two stories of the period never properly told hitherto illustrate this we all know that gabriel harvey and spenser lay in bed discussing english poetry and the forms it ought to take this was when tobacco was only known to a select few of whom spenser the friend of raleigh was doubtless one that the two friends smoked in bed i cannot doubt many poets have done the same thing since then there is the beautiful armada story in a famous armada picture the english sailors are represented smoking which makes it all the more surprising that the story to which i refer has come down to us in an incorrect form according to the historians when the armada hove in sight the english captains were playing at bowls instead of rushing off to their ships on receipt of the news they observed let us first finish our game i cannot believe that this is what they said my conviction is that what was really said was let us first finish our pipessurely a far more impressive and

she will have to sit wearily till morning marlowes praises would sink deeper into wills heart if the author of the jew of malta were less unsteady on his legs and yet he takes kits words kindly and is glad to hear that titus andronicus produced the other day pleases the man whose praise is most worth having will shakespeare looks up to kit marlowe and titus andronicus is the work of a young playwright who has tried to write like kit marlowe knows it and he takes it as something of a compliment though he does not believe in imitation himself he would return now to his seat beside ned alleyn but the floor of the room is becoming unsteady and ned seems a long way off besides shakespeares cup would never require refilling if there were not some one there to help him drink  illustration  the fun becomes fast and furious and the landlord of the globe puts in an appearance ostensibly to do his guests honor by serving them himself but he is fearful of how the rioting may end and if he dared he would turn nash into the street tom is the only man there whom the landlordif that man had only been a boswellpersonally dislikes indeed nash is no great favorite even with his comrades he has a bitter tongue and his heart is not to be mellowed by wine the table roars over his sallies of which the landlord himself is dimly conscious that he is the butt and kempe and cowley wince under his satire those excellent comedians fall out over a trifling difference of opinion and handsome nashhe tells us himself that he was handsome so there can be no doubt about itmaintains that they should decide the dispute by fistcuffs without further loss of time while kempe and cowley threaten to break each others headswhich indeed would be no great matter if they did it quietlyburbage is reciting vehemently with no one heeding him and marlowe insists on quarrelling with armin about the existence of a deity for when kit is drunk he is an infidel armin will not quarrel with anybody and marlowe is exasperated  illustration  but where is shakespeare all this time he has retired to a side table with alleyn who has another historical play that requires altering their conversation is of comparatively little importance what we are to note with bated breath is that will is filling a pipe his face is placid for he does not know that the tobacco ned is handing him is the arcadia mixture i love ned alleyn and like to think that shakespeare got the arcadia from him  for a moment let us turn from shakespeare at this crisis in his life alleyn has left him and is paying the score marlowe remains where he fell nash has forgotten where he lodges and so sets off with peele to an alehouse in pye corner where george is only too well known kempe and cowley are sent home in baskets  again we turn to the figure in the corner and there is such a light on his face that we shade our eyes he is smoking the arcadia and as he smokes the tragedy of hamlet takes form in his brain  this is the picture that scrymgeour will never dare to paint i know that there is no mention of tobacco in shakespeares plays but those who smoke the arcadia tell their secret to none and of other mixtures they scorn to speak     chapter xiv  my brother henry   illustration  strictly speaking i never had a brother henry and yet i cannot say that henry was an impostor he came into existence in a curious way and i can think of him now without malice as a child of smoke the first i heard of henry was at pettigrews house which is in a london suburb so conveniently situated that i can go there and back in one day i was testing some new cabanas i remember when pettigrew remarked that he had been lunching with a man who knew my brother henry not having any brother but alexander i felt that pettigrew had mistaken the name oh no pettigrew said he spoke of alexander too even this did not convince me and i asked my host for his friends name scudamour was the name of the man and he had met my brothers alexander and henry years before in paris then i remembered scudamour and i probably frowned for i myself was my own brother henry i distinctly recalled scudamour meeting alexander and me in paris and calling me henry though my name begins with a j i explained the mistake to pettigrew and here for the time being the matter rested however i had by no means heard the last of henry  illustration  several times afterward i heard from various persons that scudamour wanted to meet me because he knew my brother henry at last we did meet in jimmys chambers and almost as soon as he saw me scudamour asked where henry was now this was precisely what i feared i am a man who always looks like a boy there are few persons of my age in london who retain their boyish appearance as long as i have done indeed this is the curse of my life though i am approaching the age of thirty i pass for twenty and i have observed old gentlemen frown at my precocity when i said a good thing or helped myself to a second glass of wine there was therefore nothing surprising in scudamours remark that when he had the pleasure of meeting henry henry must have been about the age that i had now reached all would have been well had i explained the real state of affairs to this annoying man but unfortunately for myself i loathe entering upon explanations to anybody about anything this it is to smoke the arcadia when i ring for a timetable and william john brings coals instead i accept the coals as a substitute much then did i dread a discussion with scudamour his surprise when he heard that i was henry and his comments on my youthful appearance besides i was smoking the best of all mixtures there was no likelihood of my meeting scudamour again so the easiest way to get rid of him seemed to be to humor him i therefore told him that henry was in india married and doing well remember me to henry when you write to him was scudamours last remark to me that evening  illustration  a few weeks later some one tapped me on the shoulder in oxford street it was scudamour heard from henry he asked i said i had heard by the last mail anything particular in the letter i felt it would not do to say that there was nothing particular in a letter which had come all the way from india so i hinted that henry was having trouble with his wife by this i meant that her health was bad but he took it up in another way and i did not set him right ah ah he said shaking his head sagaciously im sorry to hear that poor henry poor old boy was all i could think of replying how about the children scudamour asked oh the children i said with what i thought presence of mind are coming to england to stay with alexander he asked my answer was that alexander was expecting them by the middle of next month and eventually scudamour went away muttering poor henry in a month or so we met again no word of henrys getting leave of absence asked scudamour i replied shortly that henry had gone to live in bombay and would not be home for years he saw that i was brusque so what does he do but draw me aside for a quiet explanation i suppose he said you are annoyed because i told pettigrew that henrys wife had run away from him the fact is i did it for your good you see i happened to make a remark to pettigrew about your brother henry and he said that there was no such person of course i laughed at that and pointed out not only that i had the pleasure of henrys acquaintance but that you and i had talked about the old fellow every time we met well pettigrew said this is a most remarkable thing for he meaning you said to me in this very room sitting in that very chair that alexander was his only brother i saw that pettigrew resented your concealing the existence of your brother henry from him so i thought the most friendly thing i could do was to tell him that your reticence was doubtless due to the unhappy state of poor henrys private affairs naturally in the circumstances you did not want to talk about henry i shook scudamour by the hand telling him that he had acted judiciously but if i could have stabbed him in the back at that moment i dare say i would have done it  i did not see scudamour again for a long time for i took care to keep out of his way but i heard first from him and then of him one day he wrote to me saying that his nephew was going to bombay and would i be so good as to give the youth an introduction to my brother henry he also asked me to dine with him and his nephew i declined the dinner but i sent the nephew the required note of introduction to henry the next i heard of scudamour was from pettigrew by the way said pettigrew scudamour is in edinburgh at present i trembled for edinburgh is where alexander lives what has taken him there i asked with assumed carelessness pettigrew believed it was business but he added scudamour asked me to tell you that he meant to call on alexander as he was anxious to see henrys children a few days afterward i had a telegram from alexander who generally uses this means of communication when he corresponds with me  do you know a man scudamour reply was what alexander said i thought of answering that we had met a man of that name when we were in paris but after consideration i replied boldly know no one of name of scudamour  about two months ago i passed scudamour in regent street and he scowled at me this i could have borne if there had been no more of henry but i knew that scudamour was now telling everybody about henrys wife  by and by i got a letter from an old friend of alexanders asking me if there was any truth in a report that alexander was going to bombay soon afterward alexander wrote to me saying he had been told by several persons that i was going to bombay in short i saw that the time had come for killing henry so i told pettigrew that henry had died of fever deeply regretted and asked him to be sure to tell scudamour who had always been interested in the deceaseds welfare pettigrew afterward told me that he had communicated the sad intelligence to scudamour how did he take it i asked well pettigrew said reluctantly he told me that when he was up in edinburgh he did not get on well with alexander but he expressed great curiosity as to henrys children ah i said the children were both drowned in the forth a sad affairwe cant bear to talk of it i am not likely to see much of scudamour again nor is alexander scudamour now goes about saying that henry was the only one of us he really liked  illustration     illustration  chapter xv  houseboat arcadia   scrymgeour had a houseboat called of course the arcadia to which he was so illadvised as to invite us all at once he was at that time lying near cookham attempting to catch the advent of summer on a canvas and we were all unhappily able to accept his invitation looking back to this nightmare of a holiday i am puzzled at our not getting on well together for who should be happy in a houseboat if not five bachelors well known to each other and all smokers of the same tobacco marriot says now that perhaps we were happy without knowing it but that is nonsense we were miserable  i have concluded that we knew each other too well though accustomed to gather together in my rooms of an evening in london we had each his private chambers to retire to but in the arcadia solitude was impossible there was no escaping from each other  illustration  scrymgeour i think said that we were unhappy because each of us acted as if the houseboat was his own we retorted that the boyby no means a william johnwas at the bottom of our troubles and then scrymgeour said that he had always been against having a boy we had been opposed to a boy at first too fancying that we should enjoy doing our own cooking seeing that there were so many of us this should not have been difficult but the kitchen was small and we were always striking against each other and knocking things over we had to break a windowpane to let the smoke out then gilray in kicking the stove because he had burned his fingers on it upset the thing and before we had time to intervene a leg of mutton jumped out and darted into the coalbunk jimmy foolishly placed our six tumblers on the windowsill to dry and a gust of wind toppled them into the river the draughts were a nuisance this was owing to windows facing each other being left open and as a result articles of clothing disappeared so mysteriously that we thought there must be a thief or a somnambulist on board the third or fourth day however going into the saloon unexpectedly i caught my straw hat disappearing on the wings of the wind when last seen it was on its way to maidenhead bowling along at the rate of several miles an hour so we thought it would be as well to have a boy as far as i remember this was the only point unanimously agreed upon during the whole time we were aboard they told us at the ferry hotel that boys were rather difficult to get in cookham but we instituted a vigorous housetohouse search and at last we ran a boy to earth and carried him off  it was most unfortunate for all concerned that the boy did not sleep on board there was however no room for him so he came at seven in the morning and retired when his labors were over for the day i say he came but in point of fact that was the difficulty with the boy he couldnt come he came as far as he could that is to say he walked up the towpath until he was opposite the houseboat and then he hallooed to be taken on board whereupon some one had to go in the dingy for him all the time we were in the houseboat that boy was never five minutes late wet or fine calm or rough 7 am found the boy on the towpath hallooing no sooner were we asleep than the dewy morn was made hideous by the boy lying in bed with the blankets over our heads to deaden his cries his fresh lusty young voice pierced woodwork blankets sheets everything yaho ahoy yaho aho ahoy so he kept it up what followed may easily be guessed we all lay as silent as the grave each waiting for some one else to rise and bring the impatient lad across at last the stillness would be broken by some ones yelling out that he would do for that boy a second would mutter horribly in his sleep a third would make himself a favorite for the moment by shouting through the wooden partition that it was the fifths turn this morning the fifth would tell us where he would see the boy before he went across for him then there would be silence again eventually some one would put an ulster over his nightshirt and sternly announce his intention of going over and taking the boys life hearing this the others at once dropped off to sleep for a few days we managed to trick the boy by pulling up our blinds and so conveying to his mind the impression that we were getting up then he had not our breakfast ready when we did get up which naturally enraged us  as soon as he got on board that boy made his presence felt he was very strong and energetic in the morning and spent the first halfhour or so in flinging coals at each other this was his way of breaking them and he was by nature so patient and humble that he rather flattered himself when a coal broke at the twentieth attempt we used to dream that he was breaking coals on our heads often one of us dashed into the kitchen threatening to drop him into the river if he did not sit quite still on a chair for the next two hours under these threats he looked sufficiently scared to satisfy anybody but as soon as all was quiet again he crept back to the coalbunk and was at his old games  illustration  it didnt matter what we did the boy put a stop to it we tried whist and in ten minutes there was a hoy hie yaho from the opposite shore it was the boy come back with the vegetables if we were reading yaho hie and some one had to cross for that boy and the watercan the boy was on the towpath just when we had fallen into a snooze he had to be taken across for the milk immediately we had lighted our pipes on the whole it is an open question whether it was not even more annoying to take him over than to go for him two or three times we tried to be sociable and went into the village together but no sooner had we begun to enjoy ourselves than we remembered that we must go back and let the boy ashore tennyson speaks of a company making believe to be merry while all the time the spirit of a departed one haunted them in their play that was exactly the effect of the boy on us  even without the boy i hardly think we should have been a sociable party the sight of so much humanity gathered in one room became a nuisance we resorted to all kinds of subterfuge to escape from each other and the one who finished breakfast first generally managed to make off with the dingy the others were then at liberty to view him in the distance in midstream lying on his back in the bottom of the boat and it was almost more than we could stand the only way to bring him back was to bribe the boy into saying that he wanted to go across to the village for bacon or black lead or sardines thus even the boy had his uses  things gradually got worse and worse i remember only one day when as many as four of us were on speaking terms even this temporary sociability was only brought about in order that we might combine and fall upon jimmy with the more crushing force jimmy had put us in an article representing himself as a kind of superior person who was making a study of us the thing was such a gross caricature and so dull that it was jimmy we were sorry for rather than ourselves still we gathered round him in a body and told him what we thought of the matter affairs might have gone more smoothly after this if we four had been able to hold together unfortunately jimmy won marriot over and next day there was a row all round which resulted in our division into five parties  one day pettigrew visited us he brought his gladstone bag with him but did not stay over night he was glad to go for at first none of us i am afraid was very civil to him though we afterward thawed a little he returned to london and told every one how he found us i admit we were not prepared to receive company the houseboat consisted of five apartmentsa saloon three bedrooms and a kitchen when he boarded us we were distributed as follows i sat smoking in the saloon marriot sat smoking in the first bedroom gilray in the second jimmy in the third and scrymgeour in the kitchen the boy did not keep scrymgeour company he had been ordered on deck where he sat with his legs crossed the picture of misery because he had no coals to break a few days after pettigrews visit we followed him to london leaving scrymgeour behind where we soon became friendly again  illustration     chapter xvi  the arcadia mixture again   illustration  one day some weeks after we left scrymgeours houseboat i was alone in my rooms very busy smoking when william john entered with a telegram it was from scrymgeour and said you have got me into a dreadful mess come down here first train  wondering what mess i could have got scrymgeour into i goodnaturedly obeyed his summons and soon i was smoking placidly on the deck of the houseboat while scrymgeour sullen and nervous tramped back and forward i saw quickly that the only tobacco had something to do with his troubles for he began by announcing that one evening soon after we left him he found that we had smoked all his arcadia he would have dispatched the boy to london for it but the boy had been all day in the village buying a loaf and would not be back for hours cookham cigars scrymgeour could not smoke cigarettes he only endured if made from the arcadia  at cookham he could only get tobacco that made him uncomfortable having recently begun to use a new pouch he searched his pockets in vain for odd shreds of the mixture to which he had so contemptibly become a slave in a very bad temper he took to his dingy vowing for a little while that he would violently break the chains that bound him to one tobacco and afterward when he was restored to his senses that he would jilt the arcadia gradually he had pulled some distance down the river without regarding the cliveden woods when he all but ran into a blaze of chinese lanterns it was a houseboat calledlet us change its name to the heathen chinee staying his dingy with a jerk scrymgeour looked up when a wonderful sight met his eyes on the open window of an apparently empty saloon stood a round tin of tobacco marked arcadia mixture  illustration  scrymgeour sat gaping the only sound to be heard except a soft splash of water under the houseboat came from the kitchen where a servant was breaking crockery for supper the romantic figure in the dingy stretched out his hand and then drew it back remembering that there was a law against this sort of thing he thought to himself if i were to wait until the owner returns no doubt a man who smokes the arcadia would feel for me then his fatal horror of explanations whispered to him the owner may be a stupid garrulous fellow who will detain you here half the night explaining your situation scrymgeour i want to impress upon the reader was like myself the sort of a man who if asked whether he did not think in memoriam mr brownings greatest poem would say yes as the easiest way of ending the conversation obviously he would save himself trouble by simply annexing the tin he seized it and rowed off  smokers who know how tobacco develops the finer feelings hardly require to be told what happened next suddenly scrymgeour remembered that he was probably leaving the owner of the heathen chinee without any arcadia mixture he at once filled his pouch and pulling softly back to the houseboat replaced the tin on the window his bosom swelling with the pride of those who give presents at the same moment a hand gripped him by the neck and a girl somewhere on deck screamed  scrymgeours captor who was no other than the owner of the heathen chinee dragged him fiercely into the houseboat and stormed at him for five minutes my friend shuddered as he thought of the explanations to come when he was allowed to speak and gradually he realized that he had been mistaken for someone elseapparently for some young blade who had been carrying on a clandestine flirtation with the old gentlemans daughter it will take an hour thought scrymgeour to convince him that i am not that person and another hour to explain why i am really here then the weak creature had an idea might not the simplest plan be to say that his surmises are correct promise to give his daughter up and row away as quickly as possible he began to wonder if the girl was pretty but saw it would hardly do to say that he reserved his defence until he could see her  i admit he said at last that i admire your daughter but she spurned my advances and we parted yesterday forever  yesterday  or was it the day before  why sir i have caught you redhanded  this is an accident scrymgeour explained and i promise never to speak to her again then he added as an afterthought however painful that may be to me  before scrymgeour returned to his dingy he had been told that he would be drowned if he came near that houseboat again as he sculled away he had a glimpse of the flirting daughter whom he described to me briefly as being of such engaging appearance that six yards was a trying distance to be away from her  here thought scrymgeour that night over a pipe of the mixture the affair ends though i dare say the young lady will call me terrible names when she hears that i have personated her lover i must take care to avoid the father now for he will feel that i have been following him perhaps i should have made a clean breast of it but i do loathe explanations  illustration  two days afterward scrymgeour passed the father and daughter on the river the lady said thank you to him with her eyes and still more remarkable the old gentleman bowed  scrymgeour thought it over she is grateful to me he concluded for drawing away suspicion from the other man but what can have made the father so amiable suppose she has not told him that i am an impostor he should still look upon me as a villain and if she has told him he should be still more furious it is curious but no affair of mine three times within the next few days he encountered the lady on the towpath or elsewhere with a young gentleman of empty countenance who he saw must be the real lothario once they passed him when he was in the shadow of a tree and the lady was making pretty faces with a cigarette in her mouth the houseboat heathen chinee lay but a short distance off and scrymgeour could see the owner gazing after his daughter placidly a pipe between his lips  illustration  he must be approving of her conduct now was my friends natural conclusion then one forenoon scrymgeour travelled to town in the same compartment as the old gentleman who was exceedingly frank and made sly remarks about romantic young people who met by stealth when there was no reason why they should not meet openly what does he mean scrymgeour asked himself uneasily he saw terribly elaborate explanations gathering and shrank from them  then scrymgeour was one day out in a punt when he encountered the old gentleman in a canoe the old man said purple with passion that he was on his way to pay mr scrymgeour a business visit oh yes he continued i know who you are if i had not discovered you were a man of means i would not have let the thing go on and now i insist on an explanation  explanations  they made for scrymgeours houseboat with almost no words on the young mans part but the father blurted out several thingsas that his daughter knew where he was going when he left the heathen chinee and that he had an hour before seen scrymgeour making love to another girl  dont deny it cried the indignant father i recognized you by your velvet coat and broad hat  then scrymgeour began to see more clearly the girl had encouraged the deception and had been allowed to meet her lover because he was supposed to be no adventurer but the wealthy mr scrymgeour she must have told the fellow to get a coat and hat like his to help the plot at the time the artist only saw all this in a jumble  scrymgeour had bravely resolved to explain everything now but his bewilderment may be conceived when on entering his saloon with the ladys father the first thing they saw was the lady herself the old gentleman gasped and his daughter looked at scrymgeour imploringly  now said the father fiercely explain  the ladys tears became her vastly hardly knowing what he did scrymgeour put his arm around her  well go on i said when at this point scrymgeour stopped  there is no more to tell he replied you see the girl allowed me towell protect herandand the old gentleman thinks we are engaged  i dont wonder what does the lady say  she says that she ran along the bank and got into my houseboat by the plank meaning to see me before her father arrived and to entreat me to run away  with her  no without her  but what does she say about explaining matters to her father  she says she dare not and as for me i could not that was why i telegraphed to you   you want me to be intercessor no scrymgeour your only honorable course is marriage  but you must help me it is all your fault teaching me to like the arcadia mixture  i thought this so impudent of scrymgeour that i bade him goodnight at once all the men on the stair are still confident that he would have married her had the lady not cut the knot by eloping with scrymgeours double  illustration     chapter xvii  the romance of a pipecleaner   illustration  we continued to visit the arcadia though only one at a time now and gilray who went most frequently also remained longest in other words he was in love again and this time she lived at cookham marriots love affairs i pushed from me with a wave of my pipe but gilrays second case was serious  in time however he returned to the arcadia mixture though not until the houseboat was in its winter quarters i witnessed his complete recovery the scene being his chambers really it is rather a pathetic story and so i give the telling of it to a rose which the lady once presented to gilray conceive the rose lying as i saw it on gilrays hearthrug and then imagine it whispering as follows  a wire was round me that white night on the river when she let him take me from her then i hated the wire alas hear the end  my moments are numbered and if i would expose him with my dying sigh i must not sentimentalize over my own decay they were in a punt her hand trailing in the water when i became his when they parted that night at cookham lock he held her head in his hands and they gazed in each others eyes then he turned away quickly when he reached the punt again he was whistling several times before we came to the houseboat in which he and another man lived he felt in his pocket to make sure that i was still there at the houseboat he put me in a tumbler of water out of sight of his friend and frequently he stole to the spot like a thief to look at me early next morning he put me in his buttonhole calling me sweet names when his friend saw me he too whistled but not in the same way then my owner glared at him this happened many months ago  illustration  next evening i was in a garden that slopes to the river i was on his breast and so for a moment was she his voice was so soft and low as he said to her the words he had said to me the night before that i slumbered in a dream when i awoke suddenly he was raging at her and she cried i know not why they quarrelled so quickly but it was about some one whom he called that fellow while she called him a friend of papas he looked at her for a long time again and then said coldly that he wished her a very goodevening she bowed and went toward a house humming a merry air while he pretended to light a cigarette made from a tobacco of which he was very fond till very late that night i heard him walking up and down the deck of the houseboat his friend shouting to him not to be an ass me he had flung fiercely on the floor of the houseboat about midnight he came downstairs his face white and snatching me up put me in his pocket again we went into the punt and he pushed it within sight of the garden there he pulled in his pole and lay groaning in the punt letting it drift while he called her his beloved and a little devil suddenly he took me from his pocket kissed me and cast me down from him into the night i fell among reeds head downward and there i lay all through the cold horrid night the gray morning came at last then the sun and a boat now and again i thought i had found my grave when i saw his punt coming toward the reeds he searched everywhere for me and at last he found me so delighted and affectionate was he that i forgave him my sufferings only i was jealous of a letter in his other pocket which he read over many times murmuring that it explained everything  her i never saw again but i heard her voice he kept me now in a leather case in an inner pocket where i was squeezed very flat what they said to each other i could not catch but i understood afterward for he always repeated to me what he had been saying to her and many times he was loving many times angry like a bad man at last came a day when he had a letter from her containing many things he had given her among them a ring on which she had seemed to set great store what it all meant i never rightly knew but he flung the ring into the thames calling her all the old wicked names and some new ones i remember how we rushed to her house along the bank this time and that she asked him to be her brother but he screamed denunciations at her again speaking of that fellow and saying that he was going tomorrow to manitoba  so far as i know they saw each other no more he walked on the deck so much now that his friend went back to london saying he could get no sleep sometimes we took long walks alone often we sat for hours looking at the river for on those occasions he would take me out of the leather case and put me on his knee one day his friend came back and told him that he would soon get over it he himself having once had a similar experience but my master said no one had ever loved as he loved and muttered vixi vixi to himself till the other told him not to be a fool but to come to the hotel and have something to eat over this they quarrelled my master hinting that he would eat no more but he ate heartily after his friend was gone  after a time we left the houseboat and were in chambers in a great inn i was still in his pocket and heard many conversations between him and people who came to see him and he would tell them that he loathed the society of women when they told him as one or two did that they were in love he always said that he had gone through that stage ages ago still at nights he would take me out of my case when he was alone and look at me after which he walked up and down the room in an agitated manner and cried vixi  by and by he left me in a coat that he was no longer wearing before this he had always put me into whatever coat he had on i lay neglected i think for a month until one day he felt the pockets of the coat for something else and pulled me out i dont think he remembered what was in the leather case at first but as he looked at me his face filled with sentiment and next day he took me with him to cookham the winter was come and it was a cold day there were no boats on the river he walked up the bank to the garden where was the house in which she had lived but the place was now deserted on the garden gate he sat down taking me from his pocket and here i think he meant to recall the days that were dead but a cold piercing wind was blowing and many times he looked at his watch putting it to his ear as if he thought it had stopped after a little he took to flinging stones into the water for something to do and then he went to the hotel and stayed there till he got a train back to london we were home many hours before he meant to be back and that night he went to a theatre  that was my last day in the leather case he keeps something else in it now he flung me among old papers smokingcaps slippers and other odds and ends into a box where i have remained until tonight a month or more ago he rummaged in the box for some old letters and coming upon me unexpectedly he jagged his finger on the wire where on earth did you come from he asked me then he remembered and flung me back among the papers with a laugh now we come to tonight an hour ago i heard him blowing down something then stamping his feet from his words i knew that his pipe was stopped i heard him ring a bell and ask angrily who had gone off with his pipecleaners he bustled through the room looking for them or for a substitute and after a time he cried aloud i have it that would do but where was it i saw the thing last he pulled out several drawers looked through his desk and then opened the box in which i lay he tumbled its contents over until he found me and then he pulled me out exclaiming eureka my heart sank for i understood all as i fell leaf by leaf on the hearthrug where i now lie he took the wire off me and used it to clean his pipe  illustration     illustration  chapter xviii  what could he do   this was another of marriots perplexities of the heart he had been on the continent and i knew from his face the moment he returned that i would have a night of him  illustration  on the 4th of september he began playing agitatedly with my tobaccopouch which was not for hands like his i had walked from spondinig to franzenshohe which is a tyrolese inn near the top of stelvio pass from the inn to a very fine glacier is only a stroll of a few minutes but the path is broken by a roaring stream the only bridge across this stream is a plank which seemed to give way as i put my foot on it i drew back for the stream would be called one long waterfall in england though a passionate admirer of courage i easily lose my head myself and i did not dare to venture across the plank i walked up the stream looking in vain for another crossing and finally sat down on a wilderness of stones from which i happened to have a good view of the plank in parties of two and three a number of tourists strolled down the path but they were all afraid to cross the bridge i saw them test it with their alpenstocks but none would put more than one foot on it they gathered there at their wits end suddenly i saw that there was some one on the plank it was a young lady i stood up and gazed she was perhaps a hundred yards away from me but i could distinctly make out her swaying girlish figure her deerstalker cap and the ends of her boa as i think those long furry things are called floating in the wind in a moment she was safe on the other side but on the middle of the plank she had turned to kiss her hand to some of her more timid friends and it was then that i fell in love with her no doubt it was the very place for romance if one was sufficiently clad but i am not susceptible as it is called and i had never loved before on the other hand i was always a firm believer in love at first sight which as you will see immediately is at the very root of my present sufferings  the other tourists their fears allayed now crossed the plank but i hurried away anywhere and found myself an hour afterward on a hillside surrounded by tinkling cows all that time i had been thinking of a plank with a girl on it i returned hastily to the inn to hear that the heroine of the bridge and her friends had already driven off up the pass my intention had been to stay at franzenshohe over night but of course i at once followed the line of carriages which could be seen crawling up the winding road it was no difficult matter to overtake them and in half an hour i was within a few yards of the hindmost carriage it contained her of whom i was in pursuit her back was toward me but i recognized the cap and the boa i confess that i was nervous about her face which i had not yet seen so often had i been disappointed in ladies when they showed their faces that i muttered jimmys aphorism to myself the saddest thing in life is that most women look best from the back but when she looked round all anxiety was dispelled so far as your advice is concerned it cannot matter to you what she was like briefly she was charming  i am naturally shy and so had more difficulty in making her acquaintance than many travellers would have had it was at the baths of bormio that we came together i had bribed a waiter to seat me next her father at dinner but when the time came i could say nothing to him so anxious was i to create a favorable impression in the evening however i found the family gathered round a pole with skittles at the foot of it they were wondering how italian skittles was played and though i had no idea i volunteered to teach them fortunately none of them understood italian and consequently the expostulations of the boy in charge were disregarded it is not my intention to dwell upon the nevertobeforgotten daysah and still more the eveningswe spent at the baths of bormio i had loved her as she crossed the plank but daily now had i more cause to love her and it was at bormio that she learnedi say it with all humilityto love me the seat in the garden on which i proposed is doubtless still to be seen with the chair near it on which her papa was at that very moment sitting with one of his feet on a small table during the three sunny days that followed my life was one delicious dream with no sign that the awakening was at hand  so far i had not mentioned the incident at franzenshohe to her perhaps you will call my reticence contemptible but the fact is i feared to fall in her esteem i could not have spoken of the plank without admitting that i was afraid to cross it and then what would she who was a heroine think of a man who was so little of a hero thus though i had told her many times that i fell in love with her at first sight she thought i referred to the time when she first saw me she liked to hear me say that i believed in no love but love at first sight and looking back i can recall saying it at least once on every seat in the garden at the baths of bormio  do you know tirano a hamlet in a nest of vines where italian soldiers strut and women sleep in the sun beside baskets of fruit how happily we entered it were we the same persons who left it within an hour i was now travelling with her party and at tirano while the others rested she and i walked down a road between vines and indian corn why i should then have told her that i loved her for a whole day before she saw me i cannot tell it may have been something she said perhaps only an irresistible movement of her head for her grace was ever taking me by surprise and she was a revelation a thousand times a day but whatever it was that made me speak out i suddenly told her that i fell in love with her as she stood upon the plank at franzenshohe i remember her stopping short at a point where there had probably once been a gate to the vineyard and i thought she was angry with me for not having told her of the franzenshohe incident before soon the pallor of her face alarmed me she entreated me to say it was not at franzenshohe that i first loved her and i fancied she was afraid lest her behavior on the bridge had seemed a little bold i told her it was divine and pictured the scene as only an anxious lover could do then she burst into tears and we went back silently to her relatives she would not say a word to me  illustration  we drove to sondrio and before we reached it i dare say i was as pale as she a horrible thought had flashed upon me at sondrio i took her papa aside and without telling him what had happened questioned him about his impressions of franzenshohe you remember the little bridge he said that we were all afraid to cross by jove i have often wondered who that girl was that ventured over it first  i hastened away from him to think my fears had been confirmed it was not she who had first crossed the plank therefore it was not she with whom i had fallen in love nothing could be plainer than that i was in love with the wrong person all the time i had loved another but who was she besides did i love her certainly not yes but why did i love this one the whole foundation of my love had been swept away yet the love remained which is absurd  at colico i put the difficulty to her father but he is stout and did not understand its magnitude he said he could not see how it mattered as for her i have never mentioned it to her again but she is always thinking of it and so am i a wall has risen up between us and how to get over it or whether i have any right to get over it i know not will you help meand her  certainly not i said  illustration     illustration  chapter xix  primus   primus is my brothers eldest son and he once spent his easter holidays with me i did not want him nor was he anxious to come but circumstances were too strong for us and to be just to primus he did his best to show me that i was not in his way he was then at the age when boys begin to address each other by their surnames  i have said that i always took care not to know how much tobacco i smoked in a week and therefore i may be hinting a libel on primus when i say that while he was with me the arcadia disappeared mysteriously though he spoke respectfully of the mixtureas became my nephewhe tumbled it on to the table so that he might make a telephone out of the tins and he had a passion for what he called snipping cigars scrymgeour gave him a cigarcutter which was pistolshaped you put the cigar end in a hole pull the trigger and the cigar was snipped the simplicity of the thing fascinated primus and after his return to school i found that he had broken into my cabana boxes and snipped nearly three hundred cigars  illustration  as soon as he arrived primus laid siege to the heart of william john captured it in six hours and demoralized it in twentyfour we who had known william john for years considered him very practical but primus fired him with tales of dark deeds at old poppyswhich was primuss handy name for his preceptorand in a short time william john was so full of romance that we could not trust him to black our boots he and primus had a scheme for seizing a lugger and becoming pirates when primus was to be captain william john first lieutenant and old poppy a prisoner to the crew was added a boy with a catapult one johnny fox who was another victim of the tyrant poppy and they practised walking the plank at scrymgeours window the plank was pushed nearly halfway out at the window and you walked up it until it toppled and you were flung into the quadrangle such was the romance of william john that he walked the plank with his arms tied shouting scornfully by request captain kidd i defy you ha ha the buccaneer does not live who will blanch the cheeks of dick the doughty tar then william john disappeared and had to be put in poultices  while william john was in bed slowly recovering from his heroism the pirate captain and johnny fox got me into trouble by stretching a string across the square six feet from the ground against which many tall hats struck to topple in the dust an improved sling from the lowther arcade kept the glazier constantly in the inn primus and johnny fox strolled into holborn knocked a bootblacks cap off and returned with lumps on their foreheads they were observed one day in hyde parkwhither it may be feared they had gone with cigarettesrunning after sheep from which ladies were flying while streetarabs chased the pirates and a policeman chased the streetarabs the only book they read was the comic history of rome the property of gilray this they liked so much that primus papered the inside of his box with pictures from it the only authors they consulted me about were two big swells called descartes and james payn of whom primus discovered that the one could always work best in bed while the other thought latin and greek a mistake it was the intention of the pirates to call old poppys attention to these gentlemens views  illustration  soon after primus came to me i learned that his schoolmaster had given him a holiday task all the fellows in his form had to write an essay entitled my holidays and how i turned them to account and to send it to their preceptor primus troubled his head little about the task while the composition of it was yet afar off but as his time drew near he referred to it with indignation and to his masters action in prescribing it as a low trick he frightened the housekeeper into tears by saying that he would not write a line of the task and what was more he would cheek his master for imposing it and i also heard that he and johnny had some thought of writing the essay in a form suggested by their perusal of the comic history of rome one day i found a paper in my chambers which told me that the task was nevertheless receiving serious consideration it was the instructions given by primuss master with regard to the essay which was to be in the form of a letter and not less than five hundred words in length the writer it was suggested should give a general sketch of how he was passing his time what books he was reading and how he was making the home brighter i did not know that primus had risen equal to the occasion until one day after his departure when i received his epistle from the schoolmaster who wanted me to say whether it was a true statement here is primuss essay on his holidays and how he made the home brighter  illustration  respected siri venture to address you on a subject of jeneral interest to all engaged in education and the subject i venture to address you on is my hollidays and how i turned them to account three weeks and two days has now elapsed since i quitted your scholastic establishment and i quitted your scholastic establishment with tears in my eyes it being the one of all the scholastic establishments i have been at that i loved to reside in and everybody was of an amiable disposition hollidays is good for making us renew our studdies with redoubled vigor the mussels needing to be invigorated and i have not overworked mind and body in my hollidays i found my uncle well and drove in a handsome to the door and he thought i was much improved both in appearance and manners and i said it was jew to the loving care of my teacher making improvement in appearance and manners a pleasure to the youth of england my uncle was partiklarly pleased with the improvement i had made not only in my appearance and manners but also in my studies and i told him casear was the latin writer i liked best and quoted veni vidi vici and some others which i regret i cannot mind at present with your kind permission i should like to write you a line about how i spend my days during the hollidays and my first way of spending my days during the hollidays is whatsoever my hands find to do doing it with all my might also setting my face nobly against hurting the fealings of others and minding to say before i go to sleep something attempted something done to earn a nights repose as advised by you my esteemed communicant i spend my days during the hollidays getting up early so as to be down in time for breakfast and not to give no trouble at breakfast i behave like a model so as to set a good example and then i go out for a walk with my esteemed young friend john fox whom i chose carefully for a friend fearing to corrupt my morals by holding communications with rude boys the j fox whom i mentioned is esteemed by all who knows him as of a unusually gentle disposition and you know him respected sir yourself he being in my form and best known in regretble slang as foxy we walks in hyde park admiring the works of nature and keeps up our classics when we see a tree by calling it arbor and then going through the declensions but we never climbs trees for fear of messing the clothes bestowed upon us by our beloved parents in the sweat of their brow and we scorns to fling stones at the beautiful warblers which fill the atmosfere with music in the afternoons i spend my days during the hollidays talking with the housekeeper about the things she understands like not taking off my flannels till june 15 and also praising the matron at the school for seeing about the socks in the evening i devote myself to whatever good cause i can think of and i always take off my boots and put on my slippers so as not to soil the carpet i should like respected sir to inform you of the books i read when my duties does not call me elsewhere and the books i read are the works of william shakespeare john milton albert tennyson and francis bacon me and john fox also reads the history of rome so as to prime ourselves with the greatness of the past and we hopes the glorious examples of romulus and remus but especially hannibal will sink into our minds to spur us along i am desirous to acquaint you with the way i make my uncles home brighter but the 500 words is up so looking forward eagerly to resume my studdies i am respected sir your dilligent pupil  illustration     chapter xx  primus to his uncle   illustration  though we all pretended to be glad when primus went we spoke of him briefly at times and i read his letters aloud at our evening meetings here is a series of them from my desk primus was now a year and a half older and his spelling had improved   i  november 16th  dear unclethough i have not written to you for a long time i often think about you and mr gilray and the rest and the arcadia mixture and i beg to state that my mother will have informed you i am well and happy but a little overworked as i am desirous of pleasing my preceptor by obtaining a credible position in the exams and we breakfast at 730 sharp i suppose you are to give me a sixshilling thing again as a christmas present so i drop you a line not to buy something i dont want as it is only thirtynine days to christmas i think ill have a book again but not a fairy tale or any of that sort nor the swiss family robinson nor any of the old books there is a rattling story called kidnapped by h rider haggard but it is only five shillings so if you thought of it you could make up the six shillings by giving me a football belt last year you gave me the formation of character and i read it with great mental improvement and all that but this time i want a change namely 1 not a fairy tale 2 not an old book 3 not mental improvement book dont fix on anything without telling me first what it is tell william john i walked into darky and settled him in three rounds best regards to mr gilray and the others   ii  november 19th  dear uncleour preceptor is against us writing letters he doesnt see so i have to carry the paper to the dormitory up my waistcoat and write there and i wish old poppy smoked the arcadia mixture to make him more like you never mind about the football belt as i got johnny foxs for two white mice so i dont want kidnapped which i wrote about to you as i want you to stick to sixshilling book there is one called dead mans rock that dickson secundus has heard about and it sounds well but it is never safe to go by the name so dont buy it till i hear more about it if you see biographies of it in the newspapers you might send them to me as it should be about pirates by the title but the author does not give his name which is rather suspicious so remember dont buy it yet and also find out price whether illustrated and how many pages ballantynes story this year is about the firebrigade but i dont think ill have it as he is getting rather informative and i have one of his about the firebrigade already of course i dont fix not to have it only dont buy it at present dont buy dead mans rock either i am working diligently and tell the housekeeper my socks is all right we may fix on dead mans rock but it is best not to be in a hurry   iii  november 24th  dear unclei dont think ill have dead mans rock as hope has two stories out this year and he is a safe man to go to the worst of it is that they are threeandsix each and dickson secundus says they are continuations of each other so it is best to have them both or neither the two at threeandsix would make seven shillings and i wonder if you would care to go that length this year i am getting on first rate with my greek and will do capital if my health does not break down with overpressure perhaps if you bought the two you would get them for 6s 6d or what do you say to the housekeepers giving me a shilling of it and not sending the neckties  illustration   iv  november 26th  dear unclei was disappointed at not hearing from you this morning but conclude you are very busy i dont want hopes books but i think ill rather have a football we played gloucester on tuesday and beat them all to sticks five goals two tries to one try it would cost 7s 6d and ill make up the oneandsix myself out of my pocketmoney but you can pay it all just now and then ill pay you later when i am more flush than i am at present id better buy it myself or you might not get the right kind so you might send the money in a postal order by return you get the postal orders at the nearest postoffice and inclose them in a letter i want the football at once 1 not a book of any kind whatever 2 a football but ill buy it myself 3 price 7s 6d 4 send postal order   v  november 29th  dear unclekindly inform william john that i am in receipt of his favor of yesterday prox and also your message saying am i sure it is a football i want i have to inform you that i have changed my mind and think ill stick to a book or two books according to price after all dickson secundus has seen a newspaper biography of dead mans rock and it is ripping but unfortunately there is a lot in it about a girl so dont buy dead mans rock for me i told fox about hopes two books and he advises me to get one of them 3s 6d and to take the rest of the money 2s 6d in cash making in all six shillings i dont know if i should like that plan though fair to both parties as dickson secundus once took money from his father instead of a book and it went like winking with nothing left to show for it but ill think it over between my scholastic tasks and write to you again so do nothing till you hear from me and mind i dont want football    vi  december 3d  dear uncledont buy hopes books there is a grand story out by jules verne about a man who made a machine that enabled him to walk on his head through space with seventyfive illustrations but the worst of it is it costs half a guinea of course i dont ask you to give so much as that but it is a pity it cost so much as it is evidently a ripping book and nothing like it tenandsix is a lot of money what do you think i inclose for your consideration a newspaper account of it which says it will fire the imagination and teach boys to be manly and selfreliant of course you could not give it to me but i think it would do me good and am working so hard that i have no time for physical exercise it is to be got at all booksellers psfox has read dead mans rock and likes it a 1   vii  december 4th  dear unclei was thinking about jules vernes book last night after i went to bed and i see a way of getting it which both dickson secundus and fox consider fair i want you to give it to me as my christmas present for both this year and next year thus i wont want a present from you next christmas but i dont mind that so long as i get this book one sixshilling book this year and another next year would come to 12s and jules vernes book is only 10s 6d so this plan will save you 1s 6d in the long run i think you should buy it at once in case they are all sold out before christmas   viii  december 5th  my dear unclei hope you havent bought the book yet as dickson secundus has found out that there is a shop in the strand where all the books are sold cheap you get threepence off every shilling so you would get a tenandsix book for 7s 1012d that will let you get me a cheapish one next year after all i inclose the address    ix  december 7th   dear uncledickson secundus was looking today at the formation of character which you gave me last year and he has found out that it was bought in the shop in the strand that i wrote you about so you got it for 4s 6d we have been looking up the books i got from you at other christmases and they all have the stamp on them which shows they were bought at that shop some of them i got when i was a kid and that was the time you gave me 2s and 3s 6d books but dickson secundus and fox have been helping me to count up how much you owe me as follows                                         nominal

thus 6s 412d is the exact sum the best plan will be for you not to buy anything for me till i get my holidays when my father is to bring me to london tell william john i am coming  psi told my father about the arcadia mixture and that is why he is coming to london  illustration     illustration  chapter xxi  englishgrown tobacco   pettigrew asked me to come to his house one evening and test some tobacco that had been grown in his brothers devonshire garden i had so far had no opportunity of judging for myself whether this attempt to grow tobacco on english soil was to succeed very complimentary was pettigrews assertion that he had restrained himself from trying the tobacco until we could test it in company at the dinnertable while mrs pettigrew was present we managed to talk for a time of other matters but the tobacco was on our minds and i was glad to see that despite her raillery my hostess had a genuine interest in the coming experiment she drew an amusing picture no doubt a little exaggerated of her husbands difficulty in refraining from testing the tobacco until my arrival declaring that every time she entered the smokingroom she found him staring at it pettigrew took this in good part and informed me that she had carried the tobacco several times into the drawingroom to show it proudly to her friends he was very delighted he said that i was to remain over night as that would give us a long evening to test the tobacco thoroughly a neighbor of his had also been experimenting and pettigrew who has a considerable sense of humor told me a diverting story about this gentleman and his friends having passed judgment on homegrown tobacco after smoking one pipe of it we were laughing over the ridiculously unsatisfactory character of this test so called when we adjourned to the smokingroom before we did so mrs pettigrew bade me goodnight she had also left strict orders with the servants that we were on no account to be disturbed  as soon as we were comfortably seated in our smokingchairs which takes longer than some people think pettigrew offered me a cabana i would have preferred to begin at once with the tobacco but of course he was my host and i put myself entirely in his hands i noticed that from the moment his wife left us he was a little excited talking more than is his wont he seemed to think that he was not doing his duty as a host if the conversation flagged for a moment and what was still more curious he spoke of everything except his garden tobacco i emphasize this here at starting lest any one should think that i was in any way responsible for the manner in which our experiment was conducted if fault there was it lies at pettigrews door i remember distinctly asking himnot in a halfhearted way but boldlyto produce his tobacco i did this at an early hour of the proceedings immediately after i had lighted a second cigar the reason i took that cigar will be obvious to every gentleman who smokes had i declined it pettigrew might have thought that i disliked the brand which would have been painful to him however he did not at once bring out the tobacco indeed his precise words i remember were that we had lots of time as his guest i could not press him further  pettigrew smokes more quickly than i do and he had reached the end of his second cigar when there was still five minutes of mine left it distresses me to have to say what followed he hastily lighted a third cigar and then unlocking a cupboard produced about two ounces of his garden tobacco his object was only too plain having just begun a third cigar he could not be expected to try the tobacco at present but there was nothing to prevent my trying it i regarded pettigrew rather contemptuously and then i looked with much interest at the tobacco it was of an inky color when i looked up i caught pettigrews eye on me he withdrew it hurriedly but soon afterward i saw him looking in the same sly way again there was a rather painful silence for a time and then he asked me if i had anything to say i replied firmly that i was looking forward to trying the tobacco with very great interest by this time my cigar was reduced to a stump but for reasons that pettigrew misunderstood i continued to smoke it somehow our chairs had got out of position now and we were sitting with our backs to each other i felt that pettigrew was looking at me covertly over his shoulder and took a side glance to make sure of this our eyes met and i bit my lip if there is one thing i loathe it is to be looked at in this shamefaced manner  i continued to smoke the stump of my cigar until it scorched my underlip and at intervals pettigrew said without looking round that my cigar seemed everlasting i treated his innuendo with contempt but at last i had to let the cigarend go not to make a fuss i dropped it very quietly but pettigrew must have been listening for the sound he wheeled round at once and pushed the garden tobacco toward me never perhaps have i thought so little of him as at that moment my indignation probably showed in my face for he drew back saying that he thought i wanted to try it now i had never said that i did not want to try it the reader has seen that i went to pettigrews house solely with the object of trying the tobacco had pettigrew then any ground for insinuating that i did not mean to try it restraining my passion i lighted a third cigar and then put the question to him bluntly did he or did he not mean to try that tobacco i dare say i was a little brusque but it must be remembered that i had come all the way from the inn at considerable inconvenience to give the tobacco a thorough trial  illustration  as is the way with men of pettigrews type when you corner them he attempted to put the blame on me why had i not tried the tobacco he asked instead of taking a third cigar for reply i asked bitingly if that was not his third cigar he admitted it was but said that he smoked more quickly than i did as if that put his behavior in a more favorable light i smoked my third cigar very slowly not because i wanted to put off the experiment for as every one must have noted i was most anxious to try it but just to see what would happen when pettigrew had finished his cigarand i thought he would never be done with ithe gazed at the garden tobacco for a time and then took a pipe from the mantelpiece he held it first in one hand then in the other and then he brightened up and said he would clean his pipes this he did very slowly when he had cleaned all his pipes he again looked at the garden tobacco which i pushed toward him he glared at me as if i had not been doing a friendly thing and then said in an apologetic manner that he would smoke a pipe until my cigar was finished i said all right cordially thinking that he now meant to begin the experiment but conceive my feelings when he produced a jar of the arcadia mixture he filled his pipe with this and proceeded to light it looking at me defiantly his excuse about waiting till i had finished was too pitiful to take notice of i finished my cigar in a few minutes and now was the time when i would have liked to begin the experiment as pettigrews guest however i could not take that liberty though he impudently pushed the garden tobacco toward me i produced my pipe my intention being only to half fill it with arcadia so that pettigrew and i might finish our pipes at the same time custom however got the better of me and inadvertently i filled my pipe only noticing this when it was too late to remedy the mistake pettigrew thus finished before me and though i advised him to begin on the garden tobacco without waiting for me he insisted on smoking half a pipeful of arcadia just to keep me company it was an extraordinary thing that try as we might we could not finish our pipes at the same time  about 2 am pettigrew said something about going to bed and i rose and put down my pipe we stood looking at the fireplace for a time and he expressed regret that i had to leave so early in the morning then he put out two of the lights and after that we both looked at the garden tobacco he seemed to have a sudden idea for rather briskly he tied the tobacco up into a neat paper parcel and handed it to me saying that i would perhaps give it a trial at the inn i took it without a word but opening my hand suddenly i let it fall my first impulse was to pick it up but then it struck me that pettigrew had not noticed what had happened and that were he to see me pick it up he might think that i had not taken sufficient care of it so i let it lie and bidding him goodnight went off to bed i was at the foot of the stair when i thought that after all i should like the tobacco so i returned i could not see the package anywhere but something was fizzing up the chimney and pettigrew had the tongs in his hand he muttered something about his wife taking up wrong notions next morning that lady was very satirical about our having smoked the whole two ounces  illustration     illustration  chapter xxii  how heroes smoke   on a tigerskin from the iceclad regions of the sunless north recline the heroes of ouida rosescented cigars in their mouths themselves gloriously indolent and disdainful but perhaps huddled a little too closely together on account of the limited accommodation strathmore is here but i never felt sure of strathmore was there not less in him than met the eye his place whiteladies was a home for kings and queens but he was not the luxurious magnanimous creature he feigned to be a host may be known by the cigars he keeps and though it is perhaps a startling thing to say we have good reason for believing that strathmore did not buy good cigars i question very much whether he had many havanas even of the second quality at whiteladies if he had he certainly kept them locked up only once does he so much as refer to them when at his own place and then in the most general and suspicious way bah he exclaims to a friend there is phil smoking these wretched muskscented cigarettes again they are only fit for lady georgie or eulalie papellori what taste when there are my havanas and cheroots the remark in whatever way considered is suggestive in the first place it is made late in the evening after strathmore and his friend have left the smokingroom thus it is a safe observation i would not go so far as to say that he had no havanas in the house the likelihood is that he had a few in his cigarcase kept there for show rather than use these if i understand the man would be a good brand but of small sizeperhaps reinasand they would hardly be of a wellknown crop in color they would be darksay maduroand he would explain that he bought them because he liked fullflavored weeds possibly he had a villar y villar box with six or eight in the bottom of it but boxes are not cigars what he did provide his friends with was manillas he smoked them himself and how careful he was of them is seen on every other page he is constantly stopping in the middle of his conversation to curl a loose leaf round his manilla when one would have expected a hero like strathmore to fling away a cigar when its leaves began to untwist and light another so thrifty is strathmore that he even laboriously curls the leaves round his cigaretteshe does not so much as pretend that they are egyptian nay even when quarrelling with errol his beloved friend whom he shoots through the heart he takes a cigarette from his mouth and winds a loosened leaf round it  illustration  if strathmores manillas were capitan generals they would cost him about 24s a hundred the probability however is that they were of inferior quality say 17s 6d it need hardly be said that a good manilla does not constantly require to have its leaves curled when errol goes into the garden to smoke he has every other minute to strike a fusee from which it may be inferred that his cigar frequently goes out this is in itself suspicious errol too is more than once seen by his host wandering in the grounds at night with a cigar between his teeth strathmore thinks his susceptible friend has a love affair on hand but is it not at least as probable an explanation that errol had a private supply of cigars at whiteladies and from motives of delicacy did not like to smoke them in his hosts presence once indeed we do see strathmore smoking a good cigar though we are not told how he came by it when talking of the vavasour he sticks his penknife through his cabana with the object obviously of smoking it to the bitter end another lady novelist who is also an authority on tobacco miss rhoda broughton contemptuously dismisses a claimant for the heroship of one of her stories as the kind of man who turns up his trousers at the foot it would have been just as withering to say that he stuck a penknife through his cigars  illustration  there is another true hero with me whose creator has unintentionally misrepresented him it is he of comin thro the rye a gentleman whom the maidens of the nineteenth century will not willingly let die he is grand no doubt and yet the more one thinks about him the plainer it becomes that had the heroine married him she would have been bitterly disenchanted in her company he was magnanimous godlike prodigal but in his smokingroom he showed himself in his true colors every lady will remember the scene where he rushes to the heroines home and implores her to return with him to the bedside of his dying wife the sudden announcement that his wifewhom he had thought in a good state of healthis dying is surely enough to startle even a miser out of his niggardliness much less a hero and yet what do we find vasher doing the heroine in frantic excitement has to pass through his smoking room and on the table she seeswhat a halfsmoked cigar he was in the middle of it when a servant came to tell him of his wifes dying request and before hastening to execute her wishes he carefully laid what was left of his cigar upon the tablemeaning of course to relight it when he came back though she did not think so our heroines father was a much more remarkable man than vasher he blew out long comfortable clouds that made the whole of his large family cough and wink again no ordinary father could do that  among my smokingroom favorites is the hero of miss adeline sergeants story touch and go he is a war correspondent and when he sees a body of the enemy bearing down upon him and the wounded officer whom he has sought to save he imperturbably offers his companion a cigar they calmly smoke on while the foe gallop up there is something grand in this even though the kind of cigar is not mentioned  illustration  i see a bearded hero with slouch hat and shepherds crook a clay pipe in his mouth he is a bohemianever a popular type of hero and the bohemian is to be known all the world over by the pipe which he prefers to a cigar the tall scornful gentleman who leans lazily against the door blowing great clouds of smoke into the air is the hero of a hundred novels that is how he is always standing when the heroine having need of something she has left in the drawingroom glides down the stairs at night in her dressinggown her beautiful hair released from its ribbons streaming down her neck and shoulders and comes most unexpectedly upon him he is young the senior over whose face a smile flickers for a moment when the heroine says something naïve and whom she entirely misunderstanding her feelings thinks she hates smokes unostentatiously but though a little inclined to quiet chaff he is a man of deep feeling by and by he will open out and gather her up in his arms the scorners chair is filled i see him shadowlike a sadeyed blasé gentleman who has been adored by all the beauties of fifteen seasons and yet speaks of woman with a contemptuous sneer great however is love and the vulgar little girl who talks slang will prove to him in our next volume that there is still one peerless beyond all others of her sex ah a wondrous thing is love on every side of me there are dark handsome men with something sinister in their smile casting away their cigars with a muffled curse no novel would be complete without them when they are foiled by the brave girl of the narrative it is the recognized course with them to fling away their cigars with a muffled curse any kind of curse would do but muffled ones are preferred  illustration     chapter xxiii  the ghost of christmas eve   illustration  a few years ago as some may remember a startling ghostpaper appeared in the monthly organ of the society for haunting houses the writer guaranteed the truth of his statement and even gave the name of the yorkshire manorhouse in which the affair took place the article and the discussion to which it gave rise agitated me a good deal and i consulted pettigrew about the advisability of clearing up the mystery the writer wrote that he distinctly saw his arm pass through the apparition and come out at the other side and indeed i still remember his saying so next morning he had a scared face but i had presence of mind to continue eating my rolls and marmalade as if my brier had nothing to do with the miraculous affair  illustration  seeing that he made a paper of it i suppose he is justified in touching up the incidental details he says for instance that we were told the story of the ghost which is said to haunt the house just before going to bed as far as i remember it was only mentioned at luncheon and then sceptically instead of there being snow falling outside and an eerie wind wailing through the skeleton trees the night was still and muggy lastly i did not know until the journal reached my hands that he was put into the room known as the haunted chamber nor that in that room the fire is noted for casting weird shadows upon the walls this however may be so the legend of the manorhouse ghost he tells precisely as it is known to me the tragedy dates back to the time of charles i and is led up to by a pathetic lovestory which i need not give suffice it that for seven days and nights the old steward had been anxiously awaiting the return of his young master and mistress from their honeymoon on christmas eve after he had gone to bed there was a great clanging of the doorbell flinging on a dressinggown he hastened downstairs according to the story a number of servants watched him and saw by the light of his candle that his face was an ashy white he took off the chains of the door unbolted it and pulled it open what he saw no human being knows but it must have been something awful for without a cry the old steward fell dead in the hall perhaps the strangest part of the story is this that the shadow of a burly man holding a pistol in his hand entered by the open door stepped over the stewards body and gliding up the stairs disappeared no one could say where such is the legend i shall not tell the many ingenious explanations of it that have been offered every christmas eve however the silent scene is said to be gone through again and tradition declares that no person lives for twelve months at whom the ghostly intruder points his pistol  on christmas day the gentleman who tells the tale in a scientific journal created some sensation at the breakfasttable by solemnly asserting that he had seen the ghost most of the men present scouted his story which may be condensed into a few words he had retired to his bedroom at a fairly early hour and as he opened the door his candlelight was blown out he tried to get a light from the fire but it was too low and eventually he went to bed in the semidarkness he was wakenedhe did not know at what hourby the clanging of a bell he sat up in bed and the ghoststory came in a rush to his mind his fire was dead and the room was consequently dark yet by and by he knew though he heard no sound that his door had opened he cried out who is that but got no answer by an effort he jumped up and went to the door which was ajar his bedroom was on the first floor and looking up the stairs he could see nothing he felt a cold sensation at his heart however when he looked the other way going slowly and without a sound down the stairs was an old man in a dressinggown he carried a candle from the top of the stairs only part of the hall is visible but as the apparition disappeared the watcher had the courage to go down a few steps after him at first nothing was to be seen for the candlelight had vanished a dim light however entered by the long narrow windows which flank the hall door and after a moment the onlooker could see that the hall was empty he was marvelling at this sudden disappearance of the steward when to his horror he saw a body fall upon the hall floor within a few feet of the door the watcher cannot say whether he cried out nor how long he stood there trembling he came to himself with a start as he realized that something was coming up the stairs fear prevented his taking flight and in a moment the thing was at his side then he saw indistinctly that it was not the figure he had seen descend he saw a younger man in a heavy overcoat but with no hat on his head he wore on his face a look of extravagant triumph the guest boldly put out his hand toward the figure to his amazement his arm went through it the ghost paused for a moment and looked behind it it was then the watcher realized that it carried a pistol in its right hand he was by this time in a highly strung condition and he stood trembling lest the pistol should be pointed at him the apparition however rapidly glided up the stairs and was soon lost to sight such are the main facts of the story none of which i contradicted at the time  illustration  illustration  i cannot say absolutely that i can clear up this mystery but my suspicions are confirmed by a good deal of circumstantial evidence this will not be understood unless i explain my strange infirmity wherever i went i used to be troubled with a presentiment that i had left my pipe behind often even at the dinnertable i paused in the middle of a sentence as if stricken with sudden pain then my hand went down to my pocket sometimes even after i felt my pipe i had a conviction that it was stopped and only by a desperate effort did i keep myself from producing it and blowing down it i distinctly remember once dreaming three nights in succession that i was on the scotch express without it more than once i know i have wandered in my sleep looking for it in all sorts of places and after i went to bed i generally jumped out just to make sure of it my strong belief then is that i was the ghost seen by the writer of the paper i fancy that i rose in my sleep lighted a candle and wandered down to the hall to feel if my pipe was safe in my coat which was hanging there the light had gone out when i was in the hall probably the body seen to fall on the hall floor was some other coat which i had flung there to get more easily at my own i cannot account for the bell but perhaps the gentleman in the haunted chamber dreamed that part of the affair i had put on the overcoat before reascending indeed i may say that next morning i was surprised to find it on a chair in my bedroom also to notice that there were several long streaks of candlegrease on my dressinggown i conclude that the pistol which gave my face such a look of triumph was my brier which i found in the morning beneath my pillow the strangest thing of all perhaps is that when i awoke there was a smell of tobaccosmoke in the bedroom  illustration     chapter xxiv  not the arcadia   illustration  those who do not know the arcadia may have a mixture that their uneducated palate loves but they are always ready to try other mixtures the arcadian however will never help himself from an outsiders pouch nevertheless there was one black week when we all smoked the ordinary tobaccoes owing to a terrible oversight on the part of our purveyor there was no arcadia to smoke  we ought to have put our pipes aside and existed on cigars but the pipes were old friends and desert them we could not each of us bought a different mixture but they tasted alike and were equally abominable i fell ill doctor southwick knowing no better called my malady by a learned name but i knew to what i owed it never shall i forget my delight when jimmy broke into my room one day with a poundtin of the arcadia weak though i was i opened my window and seizing the halfempty packet of tobacco that had made me ill hurled it into the street the tobacco scattered before it fell but i sat at the window gloating over the packet which lay a dirty scrap of paper where every cab might pass over it what i call the street is more strictly a square for my windows were at the back of the inn and their view was somewhat plebeian the square is the meetingplace of five streets and at the corner of each the paper was caught up in a draught that bore it along to the next  here it may be thought i gladly forgot the cause of my troubles but i really watched the paper for days my doctor came in while i was still staring at it and instead of prescribing more medicine he made a bet with me it was that the scrap of paper would disappear before the dissolution of the government i said it would be fluttering around after the government was dissolved and if i lost the doctor was to get a new stethoscope if i won my bill was to be accounted discharged thus strange as it seemed i had now cause to take a friendly interest in paper that i had previously loathed formerly the sight of it made me miserable now i dreaded losing it but i looked for it when i rose in the morning and i could tell at once by its appearance what kind of night it had passed nay more i believed i was able to decide how the wind had been since sundown whether there had been much traffic and if the fireengine had been out there is a firestation within view of the windows and the paper had a specially crushed appearance as if the heavy engine ran over it however though i felt certain that i could pick my scrap of paper out of a thousand scraps the doctor insisted on making sure the bet was consigned to writing on the very piece of paper that suggested it the doctor went out and captured it himself on the back of it the conditions of the wager were formally drawn up and signed by both of us then we opened the window and the paper was cast forth again the doctor solemnly promised not to interfere with it and i gave him a convalescents word of honor to report progress honestly  several days elapsed and i no longer found time heavy on my hands my attention was divided between two papers the scrap in the square and my daily copy of the times any morning the one might tell me that i had lost my bet or the other that i had won it and i hurried to the window fearing that the paper had migrated to another square and hoping my times might contain the information that the government was out i felt that neither could last very much longer it was remarkable how much my interest in politics had increased since i made this wager  illustration  the doctor i believe relied chiefly on the scavengers he thought they were sure to pounce upon the scrap soon i did not however see why i should fear them they came into the square so seldom and stayed so short a time when they did come that i disregarded them if the doctor knew how much they kept away he might say i bribed them but perhaps he knew their ways i got a fright one day from a dog it was one of those lowlooking animals that infest the square occasionally in halfdozens but seldom alone it ran up one of the side streets and before i realized what had happened it had the paper in its mouth then it stood still and looked around for me that was indeed a trying moment i stood at the window  the impulse seized me to fling open the sash and shake my fist at the brute but luckily i remembered in time my promise to the doctor i question if man was ever so interested in mongrel before at one of the street corners there was a house to let being meantime as i had reason to believe in the care of the wife of a police constable a cat was often to be seen coming up from the area to lounge in the doorway to that cat i firmly believe i owe it that i did not then lose my wager faithful animal it came up to the door it stretched itself in the act of doing so it caught sight of the dog and put up its back the dog resenting this demonstration of feeling dropped the scrap of paper and made for the cat i sank back into my chair  there was a greater disaster to be recorded next day a workingman in the square looking about him for a pipelight espied the paper frisking near the curbstone he picked it up with the obvious intention of lighting it at the stove of a wandering vender of hot chestnuts who had just crossed the square the workingman followed twisting the paper as he went whengood luck againa young butcher almost ran into him and the loafer with true presence of mind at once asked him for a match at any rate a match passed between them and to my infinite relief the paper was flung away  i concealed the cause of my excitement from william john he nevertheless wondered to see me run to the window every time the wind seemed to be rising and getting anxious when it rained seeing that my health prevented my leaving the house he could not make out why i should be so interested in the weather once i thought he was fairly on the scent a sudden blast of wind had caught up the paper and whirled it high in the air i may have uttered an ejaculation for he came hurrying to the window he found me pointing unwittingly to what was already a white speck sailing to the roof of the firestation is it a pigeon he asked i caught at the idea yes a carrierpigeon i murmured in reply they sometimes i believe send messages to the firestations in that way coolly as i said this i was conscious of grasping the windowsill in pure nervousness till the scrap began to flutter back into the square  next it was squeezed between two of the bars of a drain that was the last i saw of it and the following morning the doctor had won his stethoscopeonly by a few hours however for the governments end was announced in the evening papers my defeat discomfited me for a little but soon i was pleased that i had lost i would not care to win a bet over any mixture but the arcadia  illustration     illustration  chapter xxv  a face that haunted marriot   this is not a love affair marriot shouted apologetically  he had sat the others out again but when i saw his intention i escaped into my bedroom and now refused to come out  look here he cried changing his tone if you dont come out ill tell you all about it through the keyhole it is the most extraordinary story and i cant keep it to myself on my word of honor it isnt a love affairat least not exactly  i let him talk after i had gone to bed  you must know he said dropping cigarette ashes onto my pillow every minute that some time ago i fell in with jack gorings father colonel goring jack and i had been david and jonathan at cambridge and though we had not met for years i looked forward with pleasure to meeting him again he was a widower and his father and he kept joint house but the house was dreary now for the colonel was alone in it jack was off on a scientific expedition to the pacific all the girls had been married for years after dinner my host and i had rather a dull hour in the smokingroom i could not believe that jack had grown very stout ill show you his photograph said the colonel an album was brought down from a dusty shelf and then i had to admit that my old friend had become positively corpulent but it is not jack i want to speak about i turned listlessly over the pages of the album stopping suddenly at the face of a beautiful girl you are not asleep are you  i am not naturally sentimental as you know and even now i am not prepared to admit that i fell in love with this face it was not i think that kind of attraction possibly i should have passed the photograph by had it not suggested old times to meold times with a veil over them for i could not identify the face that i had at some period of my life known the original i felt certain but i tapped my memory in vain the lady was a lovely blonde with a profusion of fair hair and delicate features that were roman when they were not greek to describe a beautiful woman is altogether beyond me no doubt this face had faults i fancy for instance that there was little character in the chin and that the eyes were melting rather than expressive it was a vignette the hands being clasped rather fancifully at the back of the head my fingers drummed on the album as i sat there pondering but when or where i had met the original i could not decide the colonel could give me no information the album was jacks he said and probably had not been opened for years the photograph too was an old one he was sure it had been in the house long before his sons marriage so that and here the hardhearted old gentleman chuckled it could no longer be like the original as he seemed inclined to become witty at my expense i closed the album and soon afterward i went away i say wake up  illustration  from that evening the face haunted me i do not mean that it possessed me to the exclusion of everything else but at odd moments it would rise before me and then i fell into a revery you must have noticed my thoughtfulness of late often i have laid down my paper at the club and tried to think back to the original she was probably better known to jack goring than to myself all i was sure of was that she had been known to both of us jack and i had first met at cambridge i thought over the ladies i had known there especially those who had been friends of gorings jack had never been a ladys man precisely but as he used to say comparing himself with me he had a heart the annals of our cambridge days were searched in vain i tried the country house in which he and i had spent a good many of our vacations suddenly i remembered the readingparty in devonshirebut no she was dark once jack and i had a romantic adventure in glencoe in which a lady and her daughter were concerned we tried to make the most of it but in our hearts we knew after we had seen her by the morning light that the daughter was not beautiful then there was the french girl at algiers jack had kept me hanging on in algiers a week longer than we meant to stay the pose of the head the hands clasped behind it a trick so irritatingly familiar to mewas that the french girl no the lady i was struggling to identify was certainly english im sure youre asleep  a month elapsed before i had an opportunity of seeing the photograph again an idea had struck me which i meant to carry out this was to trace the photograph by means of the photographer i did not like however to mention the subject to colonel goring again so i contrived to find the album while he was out of the smokingroom the number of the photograph and the address of the photographer were all i wanted but just as i had got the photograph out of the album my host returned i slipped the thing quickly into my pocket and he gave me no chance of replacing it thus it was owing to an accident that i carried the photograph away my theft rendered me no assistance true the photographers name and address were there but when i went to the place mentioned it had disappeared to make way for residential chambers i have a few other cambridge friends here and i showed some of these the photograph one i am now aware is under the impression that i am to be married soon but the others were rational grierson of the war office recognized the portrait at once she is playing small parts at the criterion he said finchley who is a promising man at the bar also recognized her her portraits were in all the illustrated papers five years ago he told me at the time when she got twelve months they contradicted each other about her however and i satisfied myself that she was neither an actress at the criterion nor the adventuress of 1883 it was of course conceivable that she was an actress but if so her face was not known in the fancy stationers windows are you listening  i saw that the mystery would remain unsolved until jacks return home and when i had a letter from him a week ago asking me to dine with him tonight i accepted eagerly he was just home he said and i would meet an old cambridge man we were to dine at jacks club and i took the photograph with me i recognized jack as soon as i entered the waitingroom of the club a very short very fat smoothfaced man was sitting beside him with his hands clasped behind his head i believe i gasped dont you remember tom rufus jack asked who used to play the female part at the cambridge adc why you helped me to choose his wig at foxs i have a photograph of him in costume somewhere at home you might recall him by his trick of sitting with his hands clasped behind his head i shook rufuss hand i went in to dinner and probably behaved myself now that it is over i cannot help being thankful that i did not ask jack for the name of the lady before i saw rufus goodnight i think ive burned a hole in the pillow  illustration     illustration  chapter xxvi  arcadians at bay   i have said that jimmy spent much of his time in contributing to various leading wastepaper baskets and that of an evening he was usually to be found prone on my hearthrug when he entered my room he was ever willing to tell us what he thought of editors but his meerschaum with the cherrywood stem gradually drove all passion from his breast and instead of upbraiding more successful men than himself he then lazily scribbled letters to them on my wallpaper the wall to the right of the fireplace was thick with these epistles which seemed to give jimmy relief though william john had to scrape and scrub at them next morning

competition which took place on the night of the jubilee celebrations when all the rest of london including william john was in the streets the arcadians met as usual and scrymgeour at my request put on the shutters to keep out the din it so happened that jimmy and gilray were that night in wicked moods for jimmy who was so anxious to be a journalist had just had his seventeenth article returned from the st johns gazette and gilray had been slated for his acting of a new part in all the leading papers they were now disgracing the tobacco they smoked by quarrelling about whether critics or editors were the more disreputable class when in walked pettigrew who had not visited us for months pettigrew is as successful a journalist as jimmy is unfortunate and the pallor of his face showed how many jubilee articles he had written during the past two months pettigrew offered each of us a splendidad his wifes new brand which we dropped into the fireplace then he filled my little remus with arcadia and sinking weariedly into a chair said  my dear jimmy the curse of journalism is not that editors wont accept our articles but that they want too many from us  this seemed such monstrous nonsense to jimmy that he turned his back on pettigrew and gilray broke in with a diatribe against critics  critics said pettigrew are to be pitied rather than reviled  then gilray and jimmy had a common foe whether it was pettigrews appearance among us or the fireworks outside that made us unusually talkative that night i cannot say but we became quite brilliant and when jimmy began to give us his dream about killing an editor gilray said that he had a dream about criticising critics and pettigrew not to be outdone said that he had a dream of what would become of him if he had to write any more jubilee articles then it was that marriot suggested a competition let each of the grumblers he said describe his dream and the man whose dream seems the most exhilarating will get from the judges a jubilee poundtin of the arcadia the grumblers agreed but each wanted the others to dream first at last jimmy began as follows  illustration     illustration  chapter xxvii  jimmys dream   i see before me said jimmy savagely a court where i james moggridge am arraigned on a charge of assaulting the editor of the st johns gazette so as to cause death little interest is manifested in the case on being arrested i had pleaded guilty and up to today it had been anticipated that the matter would be settled out of court no apology however being forthcoming the law has to take its course the defence is that the assault was fair comment on a matter of public interest and was warranted in substance and in fact on making his appearance in the dock the prisoner is received with slight cheering  mr john jones is the first witness called for the prosecution he says i am assistant editor of the st johns gazette it is an evening newspaper of pronounced radical views i never saw the prisoner until today but i have frequently communicated with him it was part of my work to send him back his articles this often kept me late  in crossexamination the witness denies that he has ever sent the prisoner other peoples articles by mistake pressed he says he may have done so once the defendant generally inclosed letters with his articles in which he called attention to their special features sometimes these letters were of a threatening nature but there was nothing unusual in that  crossexamined the letters were not what he would call alarming he had not thought of taking any special precautions himself of course in his position he had to take his chance so far as he could remember it was not for his own sake that the prisoner wanted his articles published but in the interests of the public he the prisoner was vexed he said to see the paper full of such inferior matter witness had frequently seen letters to the editor from other disinterested contributors couched in similar language if he was not mistaken he saw a number of these gentlemen in court applause from the persons referred to  mr snodgrass says i am a poet i do not compose during the day the strain would be too great every evening i go out into the streets and buy the latest editions of the evening journals if there is anything in them worthy commemoration in verse i compose there is generally something i cannot say to which paper i send most of my poems as i send to all one of the weaknesses of the st johns gazette is its poetry it is not worthy of the name it is doggerel i have sought to improve it but the editor rejected my contributions i continued to send them hoping that they would educate his taste one night i had sent him a very long poem which did not appear in the paper next day i was very indignant and went straight to the office that was on jubilee day i was told that the editor had left word that he had just gone into the country for two days hisses i forced my way up the stairs however and when i reached the top i did not know which way to go there were a number of doors with no admittance printed on them more hissing i heard voices in altercation in a room near me i thought that was likely to be the editors i opened the door and went in the prisoner was in the room he had the editor on the floor and was jumping on him i said is that the editor he said yes i said have you killed him he said yes again i said oh and went away that is all i remember of the affair  illustration  crossexamined it did not occur to me to interfere i thought very little of the affair at the time i think i mentioned it to my wife in the evening but i will not swear to that i am not the herr bablerr who compelled his daughter to marry a man she did not love so that i might write an ode in celebration of the nuptials i have no daughter i am a poet  the foreman printer deposed to having had his attention called to the murder of the editor about three oclock he was very busy at the time about an hour afterward he saw the body and put a placard over it he spoke of the matter to the assistant editor who suggested that they had better call in the police that was done  a clerk in the countinghouse says i distinctly remember the afternoon of the murder i can recall it without difficulty as it was on the following evening that i went to the theatrea rare occurrence with me i was running up the stairs when i met a man coming down i recognized the prisoner as that man he said i have killed your editor i replied then you ought to be ashamed of yourself we had no further conversation  j oleary is next called he says i am an irishman by birth i had to fly my country when an iniquitous coercion act was put in force at present i am a journalist and i write fenian letters for the st johns gazette i remember the afternoon of the murder it was the subeditor who told me of it he asked me if i would write a par on the subject for the fourth edition i did so but as i was in a hurry to catch a train it was only a few lines we did him fuller justice next day  crossexamined witness denies that he felt any elation on hearing that a new topic had been supplied for writing on he was sorry rather  a policeman gives evidence that about halfpast four on jubilee day he saw a small crowd gather round the entrance to the offices of the st johns gazette he thought it his duty to inquire into the matter he went inside and asked an officeboy what was up the boy said he thought the editor had been murdered but advised him to inquire upstairs he did so and the boys assertion was confirmed he came down again and told the crowd that it was the editor who had been killed the crowd then dispersed  a detective from scotland yard explains the method of the prisoners capture moggridge wrote to the superintendent saying that he would be passing scotland yard on the following wednesday on business three detectives including witness were told off to arrest him and they succeeded in doing so loud and prolonged applause  the judge interposes here he fails he says to see that this evidence is relevant so far as he can see the question is not whether a murder has been committed but whether under the circumstances it is a criminal offence the prisoner should never have been tried here at all it was a case for the petty sessions if the counsel cannot give some weighty reason for proceeding with further evidence he will now put it to the jury  illustration  after a few remarks from the counsel for the prosecution and the counsel for the defence who calls attention to the prisoners high and unblemished character the judge sums up it is for the jury he says to decide whether the prisoner has committed a criminal offence that was the point and in deciding it the jury should bear in mind the desirability of suppressing merely vexatious cases people should not go to law over trifles still the jury must remember that without exception all human life was sacred after some further remarks from the judge the jury who deliberate for rather more than threequarters of an hour return a verdict of guilty the prisoner is sentenced to a fine of five florins or three days imprisonment  illustration     illustration  chapter xxviii  gilrays dream   conceive me said gilray with glowing face invited to write a criticism of the critics dramatic society for the standard i select the standard because that paper has treated me most cruelly however i loathe them all my dream is the following criticism  what is the critics dramatic society we found out on wednesday afternoon and as we went to drury lane in the interests of the public it is only fair that the public should know too besides in that case we can all bear it together be it known then that this dramatic society is composed of critics who gave the school for scandal at a matinée on wednesday just to show how the piece should be played mr augustus harris had kindly put the theatre at their disposal for which he will have to answer when he joins sheridan in the elysian fields as the performance was by far the worst ever perpetrated it would be a shame to deprive the twentieth century of the programme some of the players as will be seen are too well known to escape obloquy the others may yet be able to sink into oblivion     sir peter teazle                  mr john ruskin   joseph surface                   mr w e henley   charles surface              mr harry labouchere   crabtree                            mr w archer   sir benjamin backbite           mr clement scott   moses                           mr walter sichel   old rowley                      mr joseph knight   sir oliver                      mr wh pollock   trip                               mr g a sala   snake                              mr moy thomas   sir harry bumper with song     mr george moore   servants guests etc     messrs saville clarke          joseph hatton percy fitzgerald etc                       assisted by    lady teazle                    miss rosie le dene   mrs candour                 miss jenny montalban   lady sneerwell               miss rosalind labelle                       the hon mrs major turnley   maria                                  miss jones   it was a sin of omission on the part of the critics dramatic society not to state that the piece played was a new and original comedy in many acts had they had the courage to do this and to change the title no one would even have known on the other hand it was a sin of commission to allow that professor henry morley was responsible for the stage management mr morley being a man of letters whom some worthy people respect but perhaps sins of omission and commission counterbalance the audience was put in a bad humor before the performance began owing to the curtains rising fifteen minutes late however once the curtain did rise it was an unconscionable time in falling what is known as the business of the first act including the caterwauling of sir benjamin backbite and crabtree in their revolutions round joseph was gone through with a deliberation that was cruelty to the audience and just when the act seemed over at last these indefatigable amateurs began to dance a minuet a sigh ran round the theatre at thisa sigh as full of suffering as when a minister having finished his thirdly and lastly starts off again with i cannot allow this opportunity to pass possibly the critics dramatic society are congratulating themselves on the undeniable fact that the sighs and hisses grew beautifully less as the performance proceeded but that was because the audience diminished too one man cannot be expected to sigh like twenty though indeed some of the audience of wednesday sighed like at least half a dozen  illustration  if it be true that all meneven criticshave their redeeming points and failings then was there no charles and no joseph surface at this unique matinée for the ungainly gentleman who essayed the part of charles made or rather meant to make him spotless and mr henleys joseph was twinbrother to mr irvings mephistopheles perhaps the idea of mr labouchere and his friend mr henley was that they would make one young man between them they found it hard work mr labouchere has yet to learn that buffoonery is not exactly wit and that charles surfaces who dig their uncle olivers in the ribs and then turn to the audience for applause are among the things that the nineteenth century can do without according to the programme mr george moorethe sir harry bumperwas to sing the song heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen mr moore did not sing it but mr labouchere did the explanation of this we understand was not that sir harrys heart failed him at the eleventh hour but that mr labouchere threatened to fling up his part unless the song was given to him however mr moore heard mr labouchere singing the song and that was revenge enough for any man to mr henley the part of joseph evidently presented no serious difficulties in his opinion joseph is a whining hypocrite who rolls his eyes when he wishes to look natural obviously he is a slavish admirer of mr irving if joseph had taken his snuff as this one does lady sneerwell would have sent him to the kitchen if he had made love to lady teazle as this one does she would have suspected him of weak intellect sheridans joseph was a man of culture mr henleys is a buffoon it is not perhaps so much this gentlemans fault as his misfortune that his acting is without either art or craft but then he was not compelled to play joseph surface indeed we may go further and say that if he is a man with friends he must have been dissuaded from it the sir peter teazle of mr ruskin reminded us of other sir peter teazlesprobably because sir peter is played nowadays with his courtliness omitted  illustration  mr william archer was the crabtree or rather mr archer and the prompter between them until we caught sight of the prompter we had credited mr archer with being a ventriloquist given to casting his voice to the wings mr clement scotttheir benjamin backbitewas a ventriloquist too but not in such a large way as mr archer his voice so far as we could make out from an occasional rumble was in his boots where his courage kept it company there was no more ambitious actor in the cast than mr pollock mr pollock was sir oliver and he gave a highly original reading of that old gentleman what mr pollocks private opinion of the character of sir oliver may be we cannot say it would be worth an interviewers while to find out but if he thinks sir oliver was a windmill we can inform him at once that he is mistaken of mr sichels moses all that occurs to us to say is that when he let his left arm hang down and raised the other aloft he looked very like a teapot mr joseph knight was old rowley in that character all we saw of him was his back and we are bound to admit that it was unexceptional sheridan calls one of his servants snake and the other trip mr moy thomas tried to look as like a snake as he could and with some success the trip of mr sala however was a little heavy and when he came between the audience and the other actors there was a temporary eclipse as for the minor parts the gentlemen who personated them gave a capital rendering of supers suffering from stagefever wednesday is memorable in the history of the stage but we would forget it if we could  illustration     illustration  chapter xxix  pettigrews dream   my dream said pettigrew contrasts sadly with those of my young friends they dream of revenge but my dream is tragic i see my editor writing my obituary notice this is how it reads  mr pettigrew ma whose sad death is recorded in another column was in his fortysecond year not his fortyfourth as stated in the evening papers and had done a good deal of jubilee work before he accepted the commission that led to his death it is an open secret that he wrote seventy of the jubilee sketches which have appeared in this paper the pamphlet now selling in the streets for a penny entitled jubilees of the past was his he wrote the introductory chapter to fifty years of progress and his jubilee statesmen is now in a second edition the idea of a collection of jubilee odes was not his but the publishers at the same time his friends and relatives attach no blame to them mr pettigrew shivered when the order was given to him but he accepted it and the general impression among those who knew him was that a man who had survived jubilee statesmen could do anything as it turns out we had overestimated mr pettigrews powers of endurance  illustration  as the jubilee odes will doubtless yet be collected by another hand little need be said here of the work mr pettigrew was to make his collection as complete as the limited space at his disposal two volumes would allow the only original writing in the book being a sketch of the various schemes suggested for the celebration of the jubilee it was this sketch that killed him on the morning of the 27th when he intended beginning it he rose at an unusually early hour and was seen from the windows of the house pacing the garden in an apparently agitated state of mind he ate no breakfast one of his daughters states that she noticed a wild look in his eyes during the morning meal but as she did not remark on it at the time much stress need not be laid on this the others say that he was unusually quiet and silent all however noticed one thing generally when he had literary work to do he was anxious to begin upon his labors and spent little time at the breakfasttable on this occasion he sat on even after the breakfast things were removed he seemed reluctant to adjourn to the study his wife asked him several times if he meant to begin the jubilee odes that day and he always replied in the affirmative but he talked nervously of other things and to her surprisethough she thought comparatively little of it at the timedrew her on to a discussion on summer bonnets as a rule this was a subject which he shunned at last he rose and going slowly to the window looked out for a quarter of an hour his wife asked him again about the jubilee odes and he replied that he meant to begin directly then he went round the morningroom looking at the pictures on the walls as if for the first time after that he leaned for a little while against the mantelpiece and then as if an idea had struck him began to wind up the clock he went through the house winding up the clocks though this duty was usually left to a servant and when that was over he came back to the breakfastroom and talked about waterbury watches his wife had to go to the kitchen and he followed her on their way back they passed the nursery and he said he thought he would go in and talk to the nurse this was very unlike him at last his wife said that it would soon be luncheontime and then he went to the study some ten minutes afterward he wandered into the diningroom where she was arranging some flowers he seemed taken aback at seeing her but said after a moments thought that the study door was locked and he could not find the key this astonished her as she had dusted the room herself that morning she went to see and found the study door standing open when she returned to the diningroom he had disappeared they searched for him everywhere and eventually discovered him in the drawingroom turning over a photograph album he then went back to the study his wife accompanied him and as was her custom filled his pipe for him he smoked a mixture to which he was passionately attached he lighted his pipe several times but it always went out his wife put a new nib into his pen placed some writing material on the table and then retired shutting the door behind her  illustration  about half an hour afterward mrs pettigrew sent one of the children to the study on a trifling errand as he did not return she followed him she found him sitting on his fathers knee where she did not remember ever having seen him before mr pettigrew was holding his watch to the boys ears the study table was littered with several hundreds of jubilee odes other odes had slipped to the floor mrs pettigrew asked how he was getting on and her unhappy husband replied that he was just going to begin his hands were trembling and he had given up trying to smoke he sought to detain her by talking about the boys curls but she went away taking the child with her as she closed the door he groaned heavily and she reopened it to ask if he felt unwell he answered in the negative and she left him the last person to see mr pettigrew alive was eliza day the housemaid she took a letter to him between twelve and one oclock usually he disliked being disturbed at his writing but this time in answer to her knock he cried eagerly come in when she entered he insisted on her taking a chair and asked her how all her people were and if there was anything he could do for them several times she rose to leave but he would not allow her to do so eliza mentioned this in the kitchen when she returned to it her master was naturally a reserved man who seldom spoke to his servants which rendered his behavior on this occasion the more remarkable  illustration  as announced in the evening papers yesterday the servant sent to the study at halfpast one to see why mr pettigrew was not coming to lunch found him lifeless on the floor the knife clutched in his hand showed that he had done the fatal deed himself and dr southwick of hyde park who was on the spot within ten minutes of the painful discovery is of opinion that life had been extinct for about half an hour the body was lying among jubilee odes on the table were a dozen or more sheets of copy which though only spoiled pages showed that the deceased had not succumbed without a struggle on one he had begun fifty years have come and gone since a fair english maiden ascended the throne of england another stopped short at to every loyal englishman the jubil a third sheet commenced with though there have been a number of royal jubilees in the history of the world probably none has awakened the same interest as and a fourth began 1887 will be known to all future ages as the year of jub one sheet bore the sentence heaven help me and it is believed that these were the last words the deceased ever penned  mr pettigrew was a most estimable man in private life and will be greatly missed in the circles to which he had endeared himself he leaves a widow and a small family it may be worth adding that when discovered dead there was a smile upon his face as if he had at last found peace he must have suffered great agony that forenoon and his death is best looked upon as a happy release                                       marriot scrymgeour and i awarded the tin of arcadia to pettigrew because he alone of the competitors seemed to believe that his dream might be realized  illustration     illustration  chapter xxx  the murder in the inn   sometimes i think it is all a dream and that i did not really murder the waits perhaps they are living still yet the scene is very vivid before me though the affair took placeif it ever did take placeso long ago that i cannot be expected to remember the details the time when i must give up smoking was drawing near so that i may have been unusually irritable and determined whatever the cost to smoke my last poundtin of the arcadia in peace i think my brier was in my mouth when i did it but after the lapse of months i cannot say whether there were three of them or only two so far as i can remember i took the man with the beard first  the incident would have made more impression on me had there been any talk about it so far as i could discover it never got into the papers the porters did not seem to think it any affair of theirs though one of them must have guessed why i invited the waits upstairs he saw me open the door to them he was aware that this was their third visit in a week and only the night before he had heard me shout a warning to them from my inn window but of course the porters must allow themselves a certain discretion in the performance of their duties then there was the pleasant gentleman of the next door but two who ran against me just as i was toppling the second body over the railing we were not acquainted but i knew him as the man who had flung a waterjug at the waits the night before he stopped short when he saw the body it had rolled out of the sofarug and looked at me suspiciously he is one of the waits i said i beg your pardon he replied i did not understand when he had passed a few yards he turned round better cover him up he said our people will talk then he strolled away an air from the grand duchess lightly trolling from his lips we still meet occasionally and nod if no one is looking  i am going too fast however what i meant to say was that the murder was premeditated in the case of a reprehensible murder i know this would be considered an aggravation of the offence of course it is an open question whether all the murders are not reprehensible but let that pass to my own mind i should have been indeed deserving of punishment had i rushed out and slain the waits in a moment of fury if one were to give way to his passion every time he is interrupted in his work or his sleep by bawlers our thoroughfares would soon be choked with the dead no one values human life or understands its sacredness more than i do i merely say that there may be times when a man having stood a great deal and thought it over calmly is justified in taking the law into his own handsalways supposing he can do it decently quietly and without scandal the epidemic of waits broke out early in december and every other night or so these torments came in the still hours and burst into song beneath my windows they made me nervous i was more wretched on the nights they did not come than on the nights they came for i had begun to listen for them and was never sure they had gone into another locality before four oclock in the morning as for their songs they were more like musichall ditties than christmas carols so one morningit was i think the 23d of decemberi warned them fairly fully and with particulars of what would happen if they disturbed me again having given them this warning can it be said that i was to blameat least to any considerable extent  christmas eve had worn into christmas morning before the waits arrived on that fateful occasion i opened the windowif my memory does not deceive meat once and looked down at them i could not swear to their being the persons whom i had warned the night before perhaps i should have made sure of this but in any case these were practised waits their whine rushed in at my open window with a vigor that proved them no tyros besides the night was a cold one and i could not linger at an open casement i nodded pleasantly to the waits and pointed to my door then i ran downstairs and let them in they came up to my chambers with me as i have said the lapse of time prevents my remembering how many of them there were three i fancy at all events i took them into my bedroom and strangled them one by one they went off quite peaceably the only difficulty was in the disposal of the bodies i thought of laying them on the curbstone in different passages but i was afraid the police might not see that they were waits in which case i might be put to inconvenience so i took a spade and dug two or three large holes in the quadrangle of the inn then i carried the bodies to the place in my rug one at a time shoved them in and covered them up a close observer might have noticed in that part of the quadrangle for some time after a small mound such as might be made by an elbow under the bedclothes nobody however seems to have descried it and yet i see it often even now in my dreams  illustration     chapter xxxi  the perils of not smoking   illustration  when the arcadians heard that i had signed an agreement to give up smoking they were first incredulous then sarcastic then angry instead of coming as usual to my room they went one night in a body to pettigrews and there as i afterward discovered a scheme for saving me was drawn up so little did they understand the firmness of my character that they thought i had weakly yielded to the threats of the lady referred to in my first chapter when of course i had only yielded to her arguments and they agreed to make an appeal on my behalf to her pettigrew as a married man himself was appointed intercessor and i understand that the others not only accompanied him to her door but waited in an alley until he came out i never knew whether the reasoning brought to bear on the lady was of pettigrews devising or suggested by jimmy and the others but it was certainly unselfish of pettigrew to lie so freely on my account at the time however the plot enraged me for the lady conceived the absurd idea that i had sent pettigrew to her undoubtedly it was a bold stroke pettigrews scheme was to play upon his hostesss attachment for me by hinting to her that if i gave up smoking i would probably die finding her attentive rather than talkative he soon dared to assure her that he himself loathed tobacco and only took it for his health  by the doctors orders mark you he said impressively dr southwick of hyde park  she expressed polite surprise at this and then pettigrew believing he had made an impression told his story as concocted  my own case he said is one much in point i suffered lately from sore throat accompanied by depression of spirits and loss of appetite the ailment was so unusual with me that i thought it prudent to put myself in dr southwicks hands as far as possible i shall give you his exact words  when did you give up smoking he asked abruptly after examining my throat  illustration  three months ago i replied taken by surprise but how did you know i had given it up  never mind how i know he said severely i told you that however much you might desire to do so you were not to take to not smoking this is how you carry out my directions  well i answered sulkily i have been feeling so healthy for the last two years that i thought i could indulge myself a little you are aware how i abominate tobacco  quite so he said and now you see the result of this miserable selfindulgence two years ago i prescribed tobacco for you to be taken three times a day and you yourself admit that it made a new man of you instead of feeling thankful you complain of the brief unpleasantness that accompanies its consumption and now in the teeth of my instructions you give it up i must say the ways of patients are a constant marvel to me  but how i asked do you know that my reverting to the pleasant habit of not smoking is the cause of my present ailment  oh he said you are not sure of that yourself are you  i thought i replied there might be a doubt about it though of course i have forgotten what you told me two years ago  it matters very little he said whether you remember what i tell you if you do not follow my orders but as for knowing that indulgence in not smoking is what has brought you to this state how long is it since you noticed these symptoms  i can hardly say i answered still i should be able to think back i had my first sore throat this year the night i saw mr irving at the lyceum and that was on my wifes birthday the 3d of october how long ago is that  why that is more than three months ago are you sure of the date  quite certain i told him so you see i had my first sore throat before i risked not smoking again  i dont understand this he said do you mean to say that in the beginning of may you were taking my prescription daily you were not missing a day now and thenforgetting to order a new stock of cigars when the others were done or flinging them away before they were half smoked patients do such things  no i assure you i compelled myself to smoke at least  at least what come now if i am to be of any service to you there must be no reserve  well now that i think of it i was only smoking one cigar a day at that time  ah we have it now he cried one cigar a day when i ordered you three i might have guessed as much when i tell nonsmokers that they must smoke or i will not be answerable for the consequences they entreat me to let them break themselves of the habit of not smoking gradually one cigarette a day to begin with they beg of me promising to increase the dose by degrees why man one cigarette a day is poison it is worse than not smoking  but that is not what i did  the idea is the same he said like the others you make all this moan about giving up completely a habit you should never have acquired for my own part i cannot even understand where the subtle delights of not smoking come in compared with health they are surely immaterial  of course i admit that  then if you admit it why pamper yourself  i suppose because one is weak in matters of habit you have many cases like mine  i have such cases every week he told me indeed it was having so many cases of the kind that made me a specialist in the subject when i began practice i had not the least notion how common the nontobacco throat as i call it is  but the disease has been known has it not for a long time  yes he said but the cause has only been discovered recently i could explain the malady to you scientifically as many medical men would prefer to do but you are better to have it in plain english  certainly but i should like to know whether the symptoms in other cases have been in every way similar to mine  they have doubtless differed in degree but not otherwise he answered for instance you say your sore throat is accompanied by depression of spirits  yes indeed the depression sometimes precedes the sore throat  exactly i presume too that you feel most depressed in the eveningsay immediately after dinner  that is certainly the time i experience the depression most  the result he said if i may venture on somewhat delicate matters is that your depression of spirits infects your wife and family even your servants  that is quite true i answered our home has by no means been so happy as formerly when a man is out of spirits i suppose he tends to be brusque and undemonstrative to his wife and to be easily irritated by his children certainly that has been the case with me of late  yes he exclaimed and all because you have not carried out my directions men ought to see that they have no right to indulge in not smoking if only for the sake of their wives and families a bachelor has more excuse perhaps but think of the example you set your children in not making an effort to shake this selfindulgence off in short smoke for the sake of your wife and family if you wont smoke for the sake of your health  i think this is pretty nearly the whole of pettigrews story but i may add that he left the house in depression of spirits and then infected jimmy and the others with the same ailment so that they should all have hurried in a cab to the house of dr southwick  honestly pettigrew said i dont think she believed a word i told her  if she had only been a man marriot sighed we could have got round her  how asked pettigrew  why of course said marriot we could have sent her a tin of the arcadia  illustration     chapter xxxii  my last pipe   illustration  the night of my last smoke drew near without any demonstration on my part or on that of my friends i noticed that none of them was now comfortable if left alone with me and i knew i cannot tell how that though they had too much delicacy to refer in my presence to my coming happiness they often talked of it among themselves they smoked hard and looked covertly at me and had an idea that they were helping me they also addressed me in a low voice and took their seats noiselessly as if some one were ill in the next room  we have a notion scrymgeour said with an effort on my second night that you would rather we did not feast you tomorrow evening  oh i want nothing of that kind i said  so i fancied jimmy broke in those things are rather a mockery but of course if you thought it would help you in any way  or if there is anything else we could do for you interposed gilray you have only to mention it  though they irritated rather than soothed me i was touched by their kindly intentions for at one time i feared my friends would be sarcastic the next night was my last and i found that they had been looking forward to it with genuine pain as will have been seen their custom was to wander into my room one by one but this time they came together they had met in the boudoir and came up the stair so quietly that i did not hear them they all looked very subdued and marriot took the cane chair so softly that it did not creak i noticed that after a furtive glance at me each of them looked at the centretable on which lay my brier romulus and remus three other pipes that all had their merits though they never touched my heart until now my clay tobaccojar and my old pouch i had said goodby to these before my friends came in and i could now speak with a comparatively firm voice marriot and gilray and scrymgeour signed to jimmy as if some plan of action had been arranged and jimmy said huskily sitting upon the hearthrug  pettigrew isnt coming he was afraid he would break down  illustration  then we began to smoke it was as yet too early in the night for my last pipe but soon i regretted that i had not arranged to spend this night alone jimmy was the only one of the arcadians who had been at school with me and he was full of reminiscences which he addressed to the others just as if i were not present  he was the life of the old school jimmy said referring to me and when i shut my eyes i can hear his merry laugh as if we were both in knickerbockers still  what sort of character did he have among the fellows gilray whispered  the very best he was the soul of honor and we all anticipated a great future for him even the masters loved him indeed i question if he had an enemy  i remember my first meeting with him at the university said marriot and that i took to him at once he was speaking at the debating society that night and his enthusiasm quite carried me away  and how we shall miss him here said scrymgeour and in my houseboat i think i had better sell the houseboat do you remember his favorite seat at the door of the saloon  do you know said marriot looking a little scared i thought i would be the first of our lot to go often i have kept him up late in this very room talking of my own troubles and little guessing why he sometimes treated them a little testily  so they talked meaning very well and by and by it struck one oclock a cold shiver passed through me and marriot jumped from his chair it had been agreed that i should begin my last pipe at one precisely whatever my feelings were up to this point i had kept them out of my face but i suppose a change came over me now i tried to lift my brier from the table but my hand shook and the pipe tapped tapped on the deal like an auctioneers hammer  let me fill it jimmy said and he took my old brier from me he scraped it energetically so that it might hold as much as possible and then he filled it not one of them i am glad to remember proposed a cigar for my last smoke or thought it possible that i would say farewell to tobacco through the medium of any other pipe than my brier i liked my brier best i have said this already but i must say it again jimmy handed the brier to gilray who did not surrender it until it reached my mouth then scrymgeour made a spill and marriot lighted it in another moment i was smoking my last pipe the others glanced at one another hesitated and put their pipes into their pockets  there was little talking for they all gazed at me as if something astounding might happen at any moment the clock had stopped but the ventilator was clicking although jimmy and the others saw only me i tried not to see only them i conjured up the face of a lady and she smiled encouragingly and then i felt safer but at times her face was lost in smoke or suddenly it was marriots face eager doleful wistful  at first i puffed vigorously and wastefully then i became scientific and sent out rings of smoke so strong and numerous that half a dozen of them were in the air at a time in past days i had often followed a ring over the table across chairs and nearly out at the window but that was when i blew one by accident and was loath to let it go now i distributed them among my friends who let them slip away into the lookingglass i think i had almost forgotten what i was doing and where i was when an awful thing happened my pipe went out  illustration  there are remnants in it yet jimmy cried with forced cheerfulness while gilray blew the ashes off my sleeve marriot slipped a cushion behind my back and scrymgeour made another spill again i smoked but no longer recklessly  it is revealing no secret to say that a drowning man sees his whole past unfurl before him like a panorama so little however was i now on the eve of a great happiness like a drowning man that nothing whatever passed before me i lost sight even of my friends and though jimmy was on his knees at my feet his hand clasping mine he disappeared as if his open mouth had swallowed the rest of his face i had only one thoughtthat i was smoking my last pipe unconsciously i crossed my legs and one of my slippers fell off jimmy i think slipped it on to my foot marriot stood over me gazing into the bowl of my pipe but i did not see him  now i was puffing tremendously but no smoke came the room returned to me i saw jimmy clearly i felt marriot overhead and i heard them all whispering still i puffed i knew that my pipe was empty but still i puffed gilrays fingers tried to draw my brier from my mouth but i bit into it with my teeth and still i puffed  when i came to i was alone i had a dim consciousness of having been shaken by several hands of a voice that i think was scrymgeours saying that he would often write to methough my new home was to be within the fourmile radiusand of another voice that i think was jimmys telling marriot not to let me see him breaking down but though i had ceased to puff my brier was still in my mouth and indeed i found it there when william john shook me into life next morning  illustration  my parting with william john was almost sadder than the scene of the previous night i rang for him when i had tied up all my treasures in brown paper and i told him to give the tobaccojar to jimmy romulus to marriot remus to gilray and the pouch to scrymgeour william john bore up till i came to the pouch when he fairly blubbered i had to hurry into my bedroom but i mean to do something yet for william john not even scrymgeour knew so well as he what my pouch had been to me and till i die i shall always regret that i did not give it to william john i kept my brier  illustration     chapter xxxiii  when my wife is asleep and all the house is still   illustration  perhaps the heading of this paper will deceive some readers into thinking that i smoke nowadays in camera it is i know a common jest among smokers that such a promise as mine is seldom kept and i allow that the arcadians tempt me still but never shall it be said of me with truth that i have broken my word i smoke no more and indeed though the scenes of my bachelorhood frequently rise before me in dreams painted as scrymgeour could not paint them i am glad when i wake up that they are only dreams those selfish days are done and i see that though they were happy days the happiness was a mistake as for the struggle that is supposed to take place between a man and tobacco after he sees smoking in its true colors i never experienced it i have not even any craving for the arcadia now though it is a tobacco that should only be smoked by our greatest men were we to present a tin of it to our national heroes instead of the freedom of the city they would probably thank us more jimmy and the others are quite unworthy to smoke it indeed if i had my way they would give up smoking altogether nothing perhaps shows more completely how i have severed my bonds than this that my wife is willing to let our friends smoke in the study but i will not hear of it there shall be no smoking in my house and i have determined to speak to jimmy about smoking out at our spare bedroom window it is a mere contemptible pretence to say that none of the smoke comes back into the room the curtains positively reek of it and we must have them washed at once i shall speak plainly to jimmy because i want him to tell the others they must understand clearly on what terms they are received in this house and if they prefer making chimneys of themselves to listening to music by all means let them stay at home  but when my wife is asleep and all the house is still i listen to the man through the wall at such times i have my brier in my mouth but there is no harm in that for it is empty i did not like to give away my brier knowing no one who understood it and i always carry it about with me now to remind me of my dark past when the man through the wall lights up i put my cold pipe in my mouth and we have a quiet hour together  illustration  i have never to my knowledge seen the man through the wall for his door is round the corner and besides i have no interest in him until halfpast eleven pm we begin then i know him chiefly by his pipes and them i know by his taps on the wall as he knocks the ashes out of them he does not smoke the arcadia for his temper is hasty and he breaks the coals with his foot though i am compelled to say that i do not consider his character very lovable he has his good points and i like his attachment to his brier he scrapes it on the whole a little roughly but that is because he is so anxious to light up again and i discovered long ago that he has signed an agreement with his wife to go to bed at halfpast twelve for some time i could not understand why he had a silver rim put on the bowl i noticed the change in the tap at once and the natural conclusion would have been that the bowl had cracked but it never had the tap of a cracked bowl i was reluctant to believe that the man through the wall was merely some vulgar fellow and i felt that he could not be so or else he would have smoked his meerschaum more at last i understood the bowl had worn away on one side and the silver rim had been needed to keep the tobacco in undoubtedly this was the explanation for even before the rim came i was a little puzzled by the taps of the brier he never seemed to hit the wall with the whole mouth of the bowl but of course the reason was that he could not at the same time i do not exonerate him from blame he is a clumsy smoker to burn his bowl at one side and i am afraid he lets the stem slip round in his teeth of course i see that the mouthpiece is loose but a piece of blottingpaper would remedy that  his meerschaum is not such a good one as jimmys though jimmys boastfulness about his meerschaum was hard to bear none of us ever denied the pipes worth the man through the wall has not a cherrywood stem to his meerschaum and consequently it is too light a ring has been worn into the palm of his left hand owing to his tapping the meerschaum there and it is as marked as jimmys ring for though jimmy tapped more strongly the man through the wall has to tap oftener  what i chiefly dislike about the man through the wall is his treatment of his clay a clay i need scarcely say has an entirely different tap from a meerschaum but the man through the wall does not treat these two pipes as if they were on an equality he ought to tap his clay on the palm of his hand but he seldom does so and i am strongly of opinion that when he does it is only because he has forgotten that this is not the meerschaum were he to tap the clay on the walls or on the ribs of the fireplace he would smash it so he taps it on a coal about this there is something contemptible i am not complaining because he has little affection for his clay in face of all that has been said in honor of clays and knowing that this statement will occasion an outcry against me i admit that i never cared for clays myself a rank tobacco is less rank through a churchwarden but to smoke the arcadia through a clay is to incur my contempt and even my resentment but to disbelieve in clays is one thing and to treat them badly is another if the man through the wall has decided after reflection and experiment that his clay is a mistake i say let him smoke it no more but so long as he does smoke it i would have it receive consideration from him i very much question whether if he reads his heart he could learn from it that he loves his meerschaum more than his clay yet because the meerschaum cost more he taps it on his palm this is a serious charge to bring against any man but i do not make it lightly  the man through the wall smokes each of these three pipes nightly beginning with the brier thus he does not like a hot pipe some will hold that he ought to finish with the brier as it is his favorite but i am not of that opinion undoubtedly i think the first pipe is the sweetest indeed i feel bound to make a statement here i have an uneasy feeling that i never did justice to meerschaums and for this reason i only smoked them after my brier was hot so that i never gave them a fair chance if i had begun the day with a meerschaum might it not have shown itself in a new light that is a point i shall never be able to decide now but i often think of it and i leave the verdict to others  illustration  even though i did not know that the man through the wall must retire at halfpast twelve his taps at that hour would announce it he then gives each of his pipes a final tap not briskly as before but slowly as if he was thinking between each tap i have sometimes decided to send him a tin of the only tobacco to smoke but on the whole i could not undertake the responsibility of giving a man whom i have only studied for a few months such a testimonial therefore when his last tap says goodnight to me i take my cold brier out of my mouth tap it on the mantelpiece smile sadly and go to bed  illustration
