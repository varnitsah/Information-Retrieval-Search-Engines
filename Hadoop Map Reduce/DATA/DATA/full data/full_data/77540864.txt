the nineteenth century                        hortus inclusus                    the stormcloud of the                   nineteenth century                       two lectures            delivered at the london institution               february 4th and 11th 1884    contents                                                    page  preface                                            iii  lecture i

directed work contain many passages which stand in need of support and some i do not doubt more or less of correction which i always prefer to receive openly from the better knowledge of friends after setting down my own impressions of the matter in clearness as far as they reach than to guard myself against by submitting my manuscript before publication to annotators whose stricture or suggestion i might often feel pain in refusing yet hesitation in admitting  but though thus hastily and to some extent incautiously thrown into form the statements in the text are founded on patient and in all essential particulars accurately recorded observations of the sky during fifty years of a life of solitude and leisure and in all they contain of what may seem to the reader questionable or astonishing are guardedly and absolutely true  in many of the reports given by the daily press my assertion of radical change during recent years in weather aspect was scouted as imaginary or insane i am indeed every day of my yet spared life more and more grateful that my mind is capable of imaginative vision and liable to the noble dangers of delusion which separate the speculative intellect of humanity from the dreamless instinct of brutes but i have been able during all active work to use or refuse my power of contemplative imagination with as easy command of it as a physicists of his telescope the times of morbid are just as easily distinguished by me from those of healthy vision as by men of ordinary faculty dream from waking nor is there a single fact stated in the following pages which i have not verified with a chemists analysis and a geometers precision  the first lecture is printed with only addition here and there of an elucidatory word or phrase precisely as it was given on the 4th february in repeating it on the 11th i amplified several passages and substituted for the concluding one which had been printed with accuracy in most of the leading journals some observations which i thought calculated to be of more general interest to these with the additions in the first text i have now prefixed a few explanatory notes to which numeral references are given in the pages they explain and have arranged the fragments in connection clear enough to allow of their being read with ease as a second lecture                           herne hill 12th march 1884    the stormcloud of the nineteenth century       the stormcloud of the nineteenth century   let me first assure my audience that i have no arrière pensée in the title chosen for this lecture i might indeed have meant and it would have been only too like me to mean any number of things by such a titlebut tonight i mean simply what i have said and propose to bring to your notice a series of cloud phenomena which so far as i can weigh existing evidence are peculiar to our own times yet which have not hitherto received any special notice or description from meteorologists  so far as the existing evidence i say of former literature can be interpreted the stormcloudor more accurately plaguecloud for it is not always stormywhich i am about to describe to you never was seen but by now living or lately living eyes it is not yet twenty years that thisi may well call it wonderful cloud has been in its essence recognizable there is no description of it so far as i have read by any ancient observer neither homer nor virgil neither aristophanes nor horace acknowledge any such clouds among those compelled by jove chaucer has no word of them nor dante1 milton none nor thomson in modern times scott wordsworth and byron are alike unconscious of them and the most observant and descriptive of scientific men de saussure is utterly silent concerning them taking up the traditions of air from the year before scotts death i am able by my own constant and close observation to certify you that in the forty following years 1831 to 1871 approximatelyfor the phenomena in question came on graduallyno such clouds as these are and are now often for months without intermission were ever seen in the skies of england france or italy  in those old days when weather was fine it was luxuriously fine when it was badit was often abominably bad but it had its fit of temper and was done with itit didnt sulk for three months without letting you see the sunnor send you one cyclone inside out every saturday afternoon and another outside in every monday morning  in fine weather the sky was either blue or clear in its light the clouds either white or golden adding to not abating the luster of the sky in wet weather there were two different species of cloudsthose of beneficent rain which for distinctions sake i will call the nonelectric raincloud and those of storm usually charged highly with electricity the beneficent raincloud was indeed often extremely dull and gray for days together but gracious nevertheless felt to be doing good and often to be delightful after drought capable also of the most exquisite coloring under certain conditions2 and continually traversed in clearing by the rainbowand secondly the stormcloud always majestic often dazzlingly beautiful and felt also to be beneficent in its own way affecting the mass of the air with vital agitation and purging it from the impurity of all morbific elements  in the entire system of the firmament thus seen and understood there appeared to be to all the thinkers of those ages the incontrovertible and unmistakable evidence of a divine power in creation which had fitted as the air for human breath so the clouds for human sight and nourishmentthe father who was in heaven feeding day by day the souls of his children with marvels and satisfying them with bread and so filling their hearts with food and gladness  their hearts you will observe it is said not merely their belliesor indeed not at all in this sense their belliesbut the heart itself with its blood for this life and its faith for the next the opposition between this idea and the notions of our own time may be more accurately expressed by modification of the greek than of the english sentence the old greek is            greek empiplôn trophês kai euphrosynês           tas kardias hêmôn  filling with meat and cheerfulness our hearts the modern greek should be            greek empiplôn anemou kai aphrosynês           tas gasteras hêmôn  filling with wind and foolishness our stomachs  you will not think i waste your time in giving you two cardinal examples of the sort of evidence which the higher forms of literature furnish respecting the cloudphenomena of former times  when in the close of my lecture on landscape last year at oxford i spoke of stationary clouds as distinguished from passing ones some blockheads wrote to the papers to say that clouds never were stationary those foolish letters were so far useful in causing a friend to write me the pretty one i am about to read to you quoting a passage about clouds in homer which i had myself never noticed though perhaps the most beautiful of its kind in the iliad in the fifth book after the truce is broken and the aggressor trojans are rushing to the onset in a tumult of clamor and charge homer says that the greeks abiding them stood like clouds my correspondent giving the passage writes as follows  sirlast winter when i was at ajaccio i was one day reading homer by the open window and came upon the lines            greek all emenon nephelêsin eoikotes has te kroniôn           nênemiês estêsen ep akropoloisin oressin           atremas ophr heudêsi menos boreao kai allôn           zachreiôn anemôn hoite nephea skioenta           pnoiêsin lygyrêsi diaskidnasin aentes           hôs danaoi trôas menon empedon oud ephebonto   but they stood like the clouds which the son of kronos stablishes in calm upon the mountains motionless when the rage of the north and of all the fiery winds is asleep as i finished these lines i raised my eyes and looking across the gulf saw a long line of clouds resting on the top of its hills the day was windless and there they stayed hour after hour without any stir or motion i remember how i was delighted at the time and have often since that day thought on the beauty and the truthfulness of homers simile  perhaps this little fact may interest you at a time when you are attacked for your description of clouds                           i am sir yours faithfully                                       g b hill  with this bit of noonday from homer i will read you a sunset and a sunrise from byron that will enough express to you the scope and sweep of all glorious literature from the orient of greece herself to the death of the last englishman who loved her3 i will read you from sardanapalus the address of the chaldean priest beleses to the sunset and of the greek slave myrrha to the morning      the sun goes down methinks he sets more slowly      taking his last look of assyrias empire      how red he glares amongst those deepening clouds4      like the blood he predicts5 if not in vain      thou sun that sinkest and ye stars which rise      i have outwatchd ye reading ray by ray      the edicts of your orbs which make time tremble      for what he brings the nations t is the furthest      hour of assyrias years and yet how calm      an earthquake should announce so great a fall      a summers sun discloses it yon disk      to the starread chaldean bears upon      its everlasting page the end of what      seemd everlasting but oh thou true sun      the burning oracle of all that live      as fountain of all life and symbol of      him who bestows it wherefore dost thou limit      thy lore unto calamity6 why not      unfold the rise of days more worthy thine      allglorious burst from ocean why not dart      a beam of hope athwart the future years      as of wrath to its days hear me oh hear me      i am thy worshiper thy priest thy servant      i have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall      and bowd my head beneath thy midday beams      when my eye dared not meet thee i have watchd      for thee and after thee and prayd to thee      and sacrificed to thee and read and feard thee      and askd of thee and thou hast answerdbut      only to thus much while i speak he sinks      is goneand leaves his beauty not his knowledge      to the delighted west which revels in      its hues of dying glory yet what is      death so it be but glorious t is a sunset      and mortals may be happy to resemble      the gods but in decay  thus the chaldean priest to the brightness of the setting sun hear now the greek girl myrrha of his rising      the day at last has broken what a night      hath usherd it how beautiful in heaven      though varied with a transitory storm      more beautiful in that variety7      how hideous upon earth where peace and hope      and love and revel in an hour were trampled      by human passions to a human chaos      not yet resolved to separate elements      t is warring still and can the sun so rise      so bright so rolling back the clouds into      vapors more lovely than the unclouded sky      with golden pinnacles and snowy mountains      and billows purpler than the oceans making      in heaven a glorious mockery of the earth      so likewe almost deem it permanent      so fleetingwe can scarcely call it aught      beyond a vision t is so transiently      scatterd along the eternal vault and yet      it dwells upon the soul and soothes the soul      and blends itself into the soul until      sunrise and sunset form the haunted epoch      of sorrow and of love  how often nowyoung maids of londondo you make sunrise the haunted epoch of either  thus much then of the skies that used to be and clouds more lovely than the unclouded sky and of the temper of their observers i pass to the account of clouds that are andi say it with sorrowof the distemper of their observers  but the general division which i have instituted between badweather and fairweather clouds must be more carefully carried out in the subspecies before we can reason of it farther and before we begin talk either of the subgenera and subspecies or supergenera and superspecies of cloud perhaps we had better define what every cloud is and must be to begin with  every cloud that can be is thus primarily definable visible vapor of water floating at a certain height in the air the second clause of this definition you see at once implies that there is such a thing as visible vapor of water which does not float at a certain height in the air you are all familiar with one extremely cognizable variety of that sort of vaporlondon particular but that especial blessing of metropolitan society is only a stronglydeveloped and highlyseasoned condition of a form of watery vapor which exists just as generally and widely at the bottom of the air as the clouds doon what for convenience sake we may call the top of itonly as yet thanks to the sagacity of scientific men we have got no general name for the bottom cloud though the whole question of cloud nature begins in this broad fact that you have one kind of vapor that lies to a certain depth on the ground and another that floats at a certain height in the sky perfectly definite in both cases the surface level of the earthly vapor and the roof level of the heavenly vapor are each of them drawn within the depth of a fathom under their line drawn for the day and for the hour the clouds will not stoop and above theirs the mists will not rise each in their own region high or deep may expatiate at their pleasure within that they climb or declinewithin that they congeal or melt away but below their assigned horizon the surges of the cloud sea may not sink and the floods of the mist lagoon may not be swollen  that is the first idea you have to get well into your minds concerning the abodes of this visible vapor next you have to consider the manner of its visibility is it you have to ask with cloud vapor as with most other things that they are seen when they are there and not seen when they are not there or has cloud vapor so much of the ghost in it that it can be visible or invisible as it likes and may perhaps be all unpleasantly and malignantly there just as much when we dont see it as when we do to which i answer comfortably and generally that on the whole a cloud is where you see it and isnt where you dont that when theres an evident and honest thundercloud in the northeast you neednt suppose theres a surreptitious and slinking one in the northwestwhen theres a visible fog at bermondsey it doesnt follow theres a spiritual one more than usual at the west end and when you get up to the clouds and can walk into them or out of them as you like you find when youre in them they wet your whiskers or take out your curls and when youre out of them they dont and therefore you may with probability assumenot with certainty observe but with probabilitythat theres more water in the air where it damps your curls than where it doesnt if it gets much denser than that it will begin to rain and then you may assert certainly with safety that there is a shower in one place and not in another and not allow the scientific people to tell you that the rain is everywhere but palpable in tooley street and impalpable in grosvenor square  that i say is broadly and comfortably so on the wholeand yet with this kind of qualification and farther condition in the matter if you watch the steam coming strongly out of an enginefunnel8at the top of the funnel it is transparentyou cant see it though it is more densely and intensely there than anywhere else six inches out of the funnel it becomes snowwhiteyou see it and you see it observe exactly where it isit is then a real and proper cloud twenty yards off the funnel it scatters and melts away a little of it sprinkles you with rain if you are underneath it but the rest disappears yet it is still therethe surrounding air does not absorb it all into space in a moment there is a gradually diffusing current of invisible moisture at the end of the visible streaman invisible yet quite substantial vapor but not according to our definition a cloud for a cloud is vapor visible  then the next bit of the question of course is what makes the vapor visible when it is so why is the compressed steam transparent the loose steam white the dissolved steam transparent again  the scientific people tell you that the vapor becomes visible and chilled as it expands many thanks to them but can they show us any reason why particles of water should be more opaque when they are separated than when they are close together or give us any idea of the difference of the state of a particle of water which wont sink in the air from that of one that wont rise in it9  and here i must parenthetically give you a little word of i will venture to say extremely useful advice about scientific people in general their first business is of course to tell you things that are so and do happenas that if you warm water it will boil if you cool it it will freeze and if you put a candle to a cask of gunpowder it will blow you up their second and far more important business is to tell you what you had best do under the circumstancesput the kettle on in time for tea powder your ice and salt if you have a mind for ices and obviate the chance of explosion by not making the gunpowder but if beyond this safe and beneficial business they ever try to explain anything to you you may be confident of one of two thingseither that they know nothing to speak of about it or that they have only seen one side of itand not only havent seen but usually have no mind to see the other when for instance professor tyndall explains the twisted beds of the jungfrau to you by intimating that the matterhorn is growing flat10 or the clouds on the lee side of the matterhorn by the winds rubbing against the windward side of it11you may be pretty sure the scientific people dont know much to speak of yet either about rockbeds or cloudbeds and even if the explanation so to call it be sound on one side windward or lee you may as i said be nearly certain it wont do on the other take the very top and center of scientific interpretation by the greatest of its masters newton explained to youor at least was once supposed to have explainedwhy an apple fell but he never thought of explaining the exactly correlative but infinitely more difficult question how the apple got up there  you will not therefore so please you expect me to explain anything to youi have come solely and simply to put before you a few facts which you cant see by candlelight or in railroad tunnels but which are making themselves now so very distinctly felt as well as seen that you may perhaps have to roof if not wall half london afresh before we are many years older  i go back to my pointthe way in which clouds as a matter of fact become visible i have defined the floating or sky cloud and defined the falling or earth cloud but theres a sort of thing between the two which needs a third definition namely mist in the 22d page of his glaciers of the alps professor tyndall says that the marvelous blueness of the sky in the earlier part of the day indicated that the air was charged almost to saturation with transparent aqueous vapor well in certain weather that is true you all know the peculiar clearness which precedes rainwhen the distant hills are looking nigh i take it on trust from the scientific people that there is then a quantityalmost to saturationof aqueous vapor in the air but it is aqueous vapor in a state which makes the air more transparent than it would be without it what state of aqueous molecule is that absolutely unreflective12 of lightperfectly transmissive of light and showing at once the color of blue water and blue air on the distant hills  i put the questionand pass round to the other side such a clearness though a certain forerunner of rain is not always its forerunner far the contrary thick air is a much more frequent forerunner of rain than clear air in cool weather you will often get the transparent prophecy but in hot weather or in certain not hitherto defined states of atmosphere the forerunner of rain is mist in a general way after you have had two or three days of rain the air and sky are healthily clear and the sun bright if it is hot also the next day is a little mistierthe next misty and sultryand the next and the next getting thicker and thickerend in another storm or period of rain  i suppose the thick air as well as the transparent is in both cases saturated with aqueous vaporbut also in both observe vapor that floats everywhere as if you mixed mud with the sea and it takes no shape anywhere you may have it with calm or with wind it makes no difference to it you have a nasty haze with a bitter east wind or a nasty haze with not a leaf stirring and you may have the clear blue vapor with a fresh rainy breeze or the clear blue vapor as still as the sky above what difference is there between these aqueous molecules that are clear and those that are muddy these that must sink or rise and those that must stay where they are these that have form and stature that are bellied like whales and backed like weasels and those that have neither backs nor fronts nor feet nor faces but are a mistand no moreover two or three thousand square miles  i again leave the questions with you and pass on  hitherto i have spoken of all aqueous vapor as if it were either transparent or whitevisible by becoming opaque like snow but not by any accession of color but even those of us who are least observant of skies know that irrespective of all supervening colors from the sun there are white clouds brown clouds gray clouds and black clouds are these indeedwhat they appear to beentirely distinct monastic disciplines of cloud black friars and white friars and friars of orders gray or is it only their various nearness to us their denseness and the failing of the light upon them that makes some clouds look black13 and others snowy  i can only give you qualified and cautious answer there are by differences in their own character dominican clouds and there are franciscanthere are the black hussars of the bandiera della morte and there are the scots grays whose horses can run upon the rock but if you ask me as i would have you ask me why argent and why sable how baptized in white like a bride or a novice and how hooded with blackness like a judge of the vehmgericht tribunali leave these questions with you and pass on  admitting degrees of darkness we have next to ask what color from sunshine can the white cloud receive and what the black  you wont expect me to tell you all that or even the little that is accurately known about that in a quarter of an hour yet note these main facts on the matter  on any pure white and practically opaque cloud or thing like a cloud as an alp or milan cathedral you can have cast by rising or setting sunlight any tints of amber orange or moderately deep roseyou cant have lemon yellows or any kind of green except in negative hue by opposition and though by stormlight you may sometimes get the reds cast very deep beyond a certain limit you cannot gothe alps are never vermilion color nor flamingo color nor canary color nor did you ever see a full scarlet cumulus of thundercloud  on opaque white vapor then remember you can get a glow or a blush of color never a flame of it  but when the cloud is transparent as well as pure and can be filled with light through all the body of it you then can have by the light reflected14 from its atoms any force conceivable by human mind of the entire group of the golden and ruby colors from intensely burnished gold color through a scarlet for whose brightness there are no words into any depth and any hue of tyrian crimson and byzantine purple these with full blue breathed between them at the zenith and green blue nearer the horizon form the scales and chords of color possible to the morning and evening sky in pure and fine weather the keynote of the opposition being vermilion against green blue both of equal tone and at such a height and acme of brilliancy that you cannot see the line where their edges pass into each other  no colors that can be fixed in earth can ever represent to you the luster of these cloudy ones but the actual tints may be shown you in a lower key and to a certain extent their power and relation to each other  i have painted the diagram here shown you with colors prepared for me lately by messrs newman which i find brilliant to the height that pigments can be and the ready kindness of mr wilson barrett enables me to show you their effect by a white light as pure as that of the day the diagram is enlarged from my careful sketch of the sunset of 1st october 1868 at abbeville which was a beautiful example of what in fine weather about to pass into storm a sunset could then be in the districts of kent and picardy unaffected by smoke in reality the ruby and vermilion clouds were by myriads more numerous than i have had time to paint but the general character of their grouping is well enough expressed all the illumined clouds are high in the air and nearly motionless beneath them electric stormcloud rises in a threatening cumulus on the right and drifts in dark flakes across the horizon casting from its broken masses radiating shadows on the upper clouds these shadows are traced in the first place by making the misty blue of the open sky more transparent and therefore darker and secondly by entirely intercepting the sunbeams on the bars of cloud which within the shadowed spaces show dark on the blue instead of light  but mind all that is done by reflected lightand in that light you never get a green ray from the reflecting cloud there is no such thing in nature as a green lighted cloud relieved from a red skythe cloud is always red and the sky green and green observe by transmitted not reflected light  but now note there is another kind of cloud pure white and exquisitely delicate which acts not by reflecting nor by refracting but as it is now called diffracting the suns rays the particles of this cloud are saidwith what truth i know not15to send the sunbeams round them instead of through them somehow or other at any rate they resolve them into their prismatic elements and then you have literally a kaleidoscope in the sky with every color of the prism in absolute purity but above all in force now the ruby red and the greenwith purple and violetblue in a virtual equality more definite than that of the rainbow the red in the rainbow is mostly brick red the violet though beautiful often lost at the edge but in the prismatic cloud the violet the green and the ruby are all more lovely than in any precious stones and they are varied as in a birds breast changing their places depths and extent at every instant  the main cause of this change being that the prismatic cloud itself is always in rapid and generally in fluctuating motion a light veil of clouds had drawn itself says professor tyndall in describing his solitary ascent of monte rosa between me and the sun and this was flooded with the most brilliant dyes orange red green blueall the hues produced by diffractionwere exhibited in the utmost splendor  three times during my ascent the short ascent of the last peak similar veils drew themselves across the sun and at each passage the splendid phenomena were renewed there seemed a tendency to form circular zones of color round the sun but the clouds were not sufficiently uniform to permit of this and they were consequently broken into spaces each steeped with the color due to the condition of the cloud at the place  three times you observe the veil passed and three times another came or the first faded and another formed and so it is always as far as i have registered prismatic cloud and the most beautiful colors i ever saw were on those that flew fastest  this second diagram is enlarged admirably by mr arthur severn from my sketch of the sky in the afternoon of the 6th of august 1880 at brantwood two hours before sunset you are looking west by north straight towards the sun and nearly straight towards the wind from the west the wind blows fiercely towards you out of the blue sky under the blue space is a flattened dome of earthcloud clinging to and altogether masking the form of the mountain known as the old man of coniston  the top of that dome of cloud is two thousand eight hundred feet above the sea the mountain two thousand six hundred the cloud lying two hundred feet deep on it behind it westward and seaward alls clear but when the wind out of that blue clearness comes over the ridge of the earthcloud at that moment and that line its own moisture congeals into these whitei believe iceclouds threads and meshes and tresses and tapestries flying failing melting reappearing spinning and unspinning themselves coiling and uncoiling winding and unwinding faster than eye or thought can follow and through all their dazzling maze of frosty filaments shines a painted window in palpitation its pulses of color interwoven in motion intermittent in fireemerald and ruby and pale purple and violet melting into a blue that is not of the sky but of the sunbeampurer than the crystal softer than the rainbow and brighter than the snow  but you must please here observe that while my first diagram did with some adequateness represent to you the color facts there spoken of the present diagram can only explain not reproduce them the bright reflected colors of clouds can be represented in painting because they are relieved against darker colors or in many cases are dark colors the vermilion and ruby clouds being often much darker than the green or blue sky beyond them but in the case of the phenomena now under your attention the colors are all brighter than pure whitethe entire body of the cloud in which they show themselves being white by transmitted light so that i can only show you what the colors are and where they arebut leaving them dark on the white ground only artificial and very high illumination would give the real effect of thempainting cannot  enough however is here done to fix in your minds the distinction between those two species of cloudone either stationary16 or slow in motion reflecting unresolved light the other fastflying and transmitting resolved light what difference is there in the nature of the atoms between those two kinds of clouds i leave the question with you for today merely hinting to you my suspicion that the prismatic cloud is of finelycomminuted water or ice17 instead of aqueous vapor but the only clue i have to this idea is in the purity of the rainbow formed in frost mist lying close to water surfaces such mist however only becomes prismatic as common rain does when the sun is behind the spectator while prismatic clouds are on the contrary always between the spectator and the sun  the main reason however why i can tell you nothing yet about these colors of diffraction or interference is that whenever i try to find anything firm for you to depend on i am stopped by the quite frightful inaccuracy of the scientific peoples terms which is the consequence of their always trying to write mixed latin and english so losing the grace of the one and the sense of the other and in this point of the diffraction of light i am stopped dead by their confusion of idea also in using the words undulation and vibration as synonyms when says professor tyndall you are told that the atoms of the sun vibrate at different rates and produce waves of different sizesyour experience of waterwaves will enable you to form a tolerably clear notion of what is meant  tolerably clearyour toleration must be considerable then do you suppose a waterwave is like a harpstring vibration is the movement of a body in a state of tensionundulation that of a body absolutely lax in vibration not an atom of the body changes its place in relation to anotherin undulation not an atom of the body remains in the same place with regard to another in vibration every particle of the body ignores gravitation or defies itin undulation every particle of the body is slavishly submitted to it in undulation not one wave is like another in vibration every pulse is alike and of undulation itself there are all manner of visible conditions which are not true conditions a flag ripples in the wind but it does not undulate as the sea doesfor in the sea the water is taken from the trough to put on to the ridge but in the flag though the motion is progressive the bits of bunting keep their place you see a field of corn undulating as if it was waterit is different from the flag for the ears of corn bow out of their places and return to themand yet it is no more like the undulation of the sea than the shaking of an aspen leaf in a storm or the lowering of the lances in a battle  and the best of the jest is that after mixing up these two notions in their heads inextricably the scientific people apply both when neither will fit and when all undulation known to us presumes weight and all vibration impactthe undulating theory of light is proposed to you concerning a medium which you can neither weigh nor touch  all communicable vibrationof course i meanand in dead matter you may fall a shivering on your own account if you like but you cant get a billiardball to fall a shivering on its own account18  yet observe that in thus signalizing the inaccuracy of the terms in which they are taught i neither accept nor assail the conclusions respecting the oscillatory states of light heat and sound which have resulted from the postulate of an elastic though impalpable and imponderable ether possessing the elasticity of air this only i desire you to mark with attentionthat both light and sound are sensations of the animal frame which remain and must remain wholly inexplicable whatever manner of force pulse or palpitation may be instrumental in producing them nor does any such force become light or sound except in its rencontre with an animal the leaf hears no murmur in the wind to which it wavers on the branches nor can the clay discern the vibration by which it is thrilled into a ruby the eye and the ear are the creators alike of the ray and the tone and the conclusion follows logically from the right conception of their living powerhe that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall not he see  for security therefore and simplicity of definition of light you will find no possibility of advancing beyond platos the power that through the eye manifests color but on that definition you will find alike by plato and all great subsequent thinkers a moral science of light founded far and away more important to you than all the physical laws ever learned by vitreous revelation concerning which i will refer you to the sixth lecture which i gave at oxford in 1872 on the relation of art to the science of light the eagles nest reading now only the sentence introducing its subjectthe fiat lux of creation is therefore in the deep sense fiat anima and is as much when you understand it the ordering of intelligence as the ordering of vision it is the appointment of change of what had been else only a mechanical effluence from things unseen to things unseeingfrom stars that did not shine to earth that did not perceivethe change i say of that blind vibration into the glory of the sun and moon for human eyes so making possible the communication out of the unfathomable truth of that portion of truth which is good for us and animating to us and is set to rule over the day and over the night of our joy and our sorrow  returning now to our subject at the point from which i permitted myself i trust not without your pardon to diverge you may incidentally but carefully observe that the effect of such a sky as that represented in the second diagram so far as it can be abstracted or conveyed by painting at all implies the total absence of any pervading warmth of tint such as artists usually call tone every tint must be the purest possible and above all the white partly lest you should think from my treatment of these two phases of effect that i am insensible to the quality of toneand partly to complete the representation of states of weather undefiled by plaguecloud yet capable of the most solemn dignity in saddening color i show you diagram 3 the record of an autumn twilight of the year 1845sketched while i was changing horses between verona and brescia the distant sky in this drawing is in the glowing calm which is always taken by the great italian painters for the background of their sacred pictures a broad field of cloud is advancing upon it overhead and meeting others enlarging in the distance these are rainclouds which will certainly close over the clear sky and bring on rain before midnight but there is no power in them to pollute the sky beyond and above them they do not darken the air nor defile it nor in any way mingle with it their edges are burnished by the sun like the edges of golden shields and their advancing march is as deliberate and majestic as the fading of the twilight itself into a darkness full of stars  these three instances are all i have time to give of the former conditions of serene weather and of nonelectric raincloud but i must yet to complete the sequence of my subject show you one example of a good oldfashioned healthy and mighty storm  in diagram 4 mr severn has beautifully enlarged my sketch of a july thundercloud of the year 1858 on the alps of the val daosta seen from turin that is to say some twentyfive or thirty miles distant you see that no mistake is possible here about what is good weather and what bad or which is cloud and which is sky but i show you this sketch especially to give you the scale of heights for such clouds in the atmosphere these thunder cumuli entirely hide the higher alps it does not however follow that they have buried them for most of their own aspect of height is owing to the approach of their nearer masses but at all events you have cumulus there rising from its base at about three thousand feet above the plain to a good ten thousand in the air  white cirri in reality parallel but by perspective radiating catch the sunshine above at a height of from fifteen to twenty thousand feet but the storm on the mountains gathers itself into a full miles depth of massy cloud every fold of it involved with thunder but every form of it every action every color magnificentdoing its mighty work in its own hour and its own dominion nor snatching from you for an instant nor defiling with a stain the abiding blue of the transcendent sky or the fretted silver of its passionless clouds  we so rarely now see cumulus cloud of this grand kind that i will yet delay you by reading the description of its nearer aspect in the eagles nest  the rain which flooded our fields the sunday before last was followed as you will remember by bright days of which tuesday the 20th february 1872 was in london notable for the splendor towards the afternoon of its white cumulus clouds there has been so much black east wind lately and so much fog and artificial gloom besides that i find it is actually some two years since i last saw a noble cumulus cloud under full light i chanced to be standing under the victoria tower at westminster when the largest mass of them floated past that day from the northwest and i was more impressed than ever yet by the awfulness of the cloudform and its unaccountableness in the present state of our knowledge the victoria tower seen against it had no magnitude it was like looking at mont blanc over a lamppost the domes of cloudsnow were heaped as definitely their broken flanks were as gray and firm as rocks and the whole mountain of a compass and height in heaven which only became more and more inconceivable as the eye strove to ascend it was passing behind the tower with a steady march whose swiftness must in reality have been that of a tempest yet along all the ravines of vapor precipice kept pace with precipice and not one thrust another  what is it that hews them out why is the blue sky pure therethe cloud solid here and edged like marble and why does the state of the blue sky pass into the state of cloud in that calm advance  it is true that you can more or less imitate the forms of cloud with explosive vapor or steam but the steam melts instantly and the explosive vapor dissipates itself the cloud of perfect form proceeds unchanged it is not an explosion but an enduring and advancing presence the more you think of it the less explicable it will become to you  thus far then of clouds that were once familiar now at last entering on my immediate subject i shall best introduce it to you by reading an entry in my diary which gives progressive description of the most gentle aspect of the modern plaguecloud                                     bolton abbey 4th july 1875  halfpast eight morning the first bright morning for the last fortnight  at halfpast five it was entirely clear and entirely calm the moorlands glowing and the wharfe glittering in sacred light and even the thinstemmed fieldflowers quiet as stars in the peace in which      all trees and simples great and small        that balmy leaf do bear      than they were painted on a wall        no more do move nor steir   but an hour ago the leaves at my window first shook slightly they are now trembling continuously as those of all the trees under a gradually rising wind of which the tremulous action scarcely permits the direction to be definedbut which falls and returns in fits of varying force like those which precede a thunderstormnever wholly ceasing the direction of its upper current is shown by a few ragged white clouds moving fast from the north which rose at the time of the first leafshaking behind the edge of the moors in the east  this wind is the plaguewind of the eighth decade of years in the nineteenth century a period which will assuredly be recognized in future meteorological history as one of phenomena hitherto unrecorded in the courses of nature and characterized preeminently by the almost ceaseless action of this calamitous wind while i have been writing these sentences the white clouds above specified have increased to twice the size they had when i began to write and in about two hours from this timesay by eleven oclock if the wind continuethe whole sky will be dark with them as it was yesterday and has been through prolonged periods during the last five years i first noticed the definite character of this wind and of the clouds it brings with it in the year 1871 describing it then in the july number of fors clavigera but little at that time apprehending either its universality or any probability of its annual continuance i am able now to state positively that its range of power extends from the north of england to sicily and that it blows more or less during the whole of the year except the early autumn this autumnal abdication is i hope beginning it blew but feebly yesterday though without intermission from the north making every shady place cold while the sun was burning its effect on the sky being only to dim the blue of it between masses of ragged cumulus today it has entirely fallen and there seems hope of bright weather the first for me since the end of may when i had two fine days at aylesbury the third may 28th being black again from morning to evening there seems to be some reference to the blackness caused by the prevalence of this wind in the old french name of bise gray wind and indeed one of the darkest and bitterest days of it i ever saw was at vevay in 1872                                       the first time i recognized the clouds brought by the plaguewind as distinct in character was in walking back from oxford after a hard days work to abingdon in the early spring of 1871 it would take too long to give you any account this evening of the particulars which drew my attention to them but during the following months i had too frequent opportunities of verifying my first thoughts of them and on the first of july in that year wrote the description of them which begins the fors clavigera of august thus  it is the first of july and i sit down to write by the dismalest light that ever yet i wrote by namely the light of this midsummer morning in midengland matlock derbyshire in the year 1871  for the sky is covered with gray cloudnot raincloud but a dry black veil which no ray of sunshine can pierce partly diffused in mist feeble mist enough to make distant objects unintelligible yet without any substance or wreathing or color of its own and everywhere the leaves of the trees are shaking fitfully as they do before a thunderstorm only not violently but enough to show the passing to and fro of a strange bitter blighting wind dismal enough had it been the first morning of its kind that summer had sent but during all this spring in london and at oxford through meager march through changelessly sullen april through despondent may and darkened june morning after morning has come grayshrouded thus  and it is a new thing to me and a very dreadful one i am fifty years old and more and since i was five have gleaned the best hours of my life in the sun of spring and summer mornings and i never saw such as these till now  and the scientific men are busy as ants examining the sun and the moon and the seven stars and can tell me all about them i believe by this time and how they move and what they are made of  and i do not care for my part two copper spangles how they move nor what they are made of i cant move them any other way than they go nor make them of anything else better than they are made but i would care much and give much if i could be told where this bitter wind comes from and what it is made of  for perhaps with forethought and fine laboratory science one might make it of something else  it looks partly as if it were made of poisonous smoke very possibly it may be there are at least two hundred furnace chimneys in a square of two miles on every side of me but mere smoke would not blow to and fro in that wild way it looks more to me as if it were made of dead mens soulssuch of them as are not gone yet where they have to go and may be flitting hither and thither doubting themselves of the fittest place for them  you know if there are such things as souls and if ever any of them haunt places where they have been hurt there must be many about us just now displeased enough  the last sentence refers of course to the battles of the francogerman campaign which was especially horrible to me in its digging as the germans should have known a moat flooded with waters of death between the two nations for a century to come  since that midsummer day my attention however otherwise occupied has never relaxed in its record of the phenomena characteristic of the plaguewind and i now define for you as briefly as possible the essential signs of it  1 it is a wind of darknessall the former conditions of tormenting winds whether from the north or east were more or less capable of coexisting with sunlight and often with steady and bright sunlight but whenever and wherever the plaguewind blows be it but for ten minutes the sky is darkened instantly  2 it is a malignant quality of wind unconnected with any one quarter of the compass it blows indifferently from all attaching its own bitterness and malice to the worst characters of the proper winds of each quarter it will blow either with drenching rain or dry rage from the southwith ruinous blasts from the westwith bitterest chills from the northand with venomous blight from the east  its own favorite quarter however is the southwest so that it is distinguished in its malignity equally from the bise of provence which is a north wind always and from our own old friend the east  3 it always blows tremulously making the leaves of the trees shudder as if they were all aspens but with a peculiar fitfulness which gives themand i watch them this moment as i writean expression of anger as well as of fear and distress you may see the kind of quivering and hear the ominous whimpering in the gusts that precede a great thunderstorm but plaguewind is more panicstruck and feverish and its sound is a hiss instead of a wail  when i was last at avallon in south france i went to see faust played at the little country theater it was done with scarcely any means of pictorial effect except a few old curtains and a blue light or two but the night on the brocken was nevertheless extremely appalling to mea strange ghastliness being obtained in some of the witch scenes merely by fine management of gesture and drapery and in the phantom scenes by the halfpalsied halffurious faltering or fluttering past of phantoms stumbling as into graves as if of not only soulless but senseless dead moving with the very action the rage the decrepitude and the trembling of the plaguewind  4 not only tremulous at every moment it is also intermittent with a rapidity quite unexampled in former weather there are indeed daysand weeks on which it blows without cessation and is as inevitable as the gulf stream but also there are days when it is contending with healthy weather and on such days it will remit for half an hour and the sun will begin to show itself and then the wind will come back and cover the whole sky with clouds in ten minutes and so on every halfhour through the whole day so that it is often impossible to go on with any kind of drawing in color the light being never for two seconds the same from morning till evening  5 it degrades while it intensifies ordinary storm but before i read you any description of its efforts in this kind i must correct an impression which has got abroad through the papers that i speak as if the plaguewind blew now always and there were no more any natural weather on the contrary the winter of 18789 was one of the most healthy and lovely i ever saw ice inconiston lake shone under the calm clear frost in one marble field as strong as the floor of milan cathedral half a mile across and four miles down and the first entries in my diary which i read you shall be from the 22d to 26th june 1876 of perfectly lovely and natural weather                                     sunday 25th june 1876  yesterday an entirely glorious sunset unmatched in beauty since that at abbevilledeep scarlet and purest rose on purple gray in bars and stationary plumy sweeping filaments above in upper sky like using up the brush said joanie remaining in glory every moment best changing from one good into another but only in color or lightform steady for half an hour full and the clouds afterwards fading into the gray against amber twilight stationary in the same form for about two hours at least the darkening rose tint remained till halfpast ten the grand time being at nine  the day had been fineexquisite green light on afternoon hills                                     monday 26th june 1876  yesterday an entirely perfect summer light on the old man lancaster bay all clear ingleborough and the great pennine fault as on a map divine beauty of western color on thyme and rosethen twilight of clearest warm amber far into night of pale amber all night long hills darkclear against it  and so it continued only growing more intense in blue and sunlight all day after breakfast i came in from the well under strawberry bed to say i had never seen anything like it so pure or intense in italy and so it went glowing on cloudless with soft north wind all day                                     16th july  the sunset almost too bright through the blinds for me to read humboldt at tea byfinally new moon like a limelight reflected on breezestruck water traces across dark calm of reflected hills  these extracts are i hope enough to guard you against the absurdity of supposing that it all only means that i am myself soured or doting in my old age and always in an ill humor depend upon it when old men are worth anything they are better humored than young ones and have learned to see what good there is and pleasantness in the world they are likely so soon to have orders to quit  now thentake the following sequences of accurate description of thunderstorm with plaguewind                                     22d june 1876  thunderstorm pitch dark with no blacknessbut deep high filthiness of lurid yet not sublimely lurid smokecloud dense manufacturing mist fearful squalls of shivery wind making mr severns sail quiver like a man in a fever fitall about four afternoonbut only two or three claps of thunder and feeble though near flashes i never saw such a dirty weak foul storm it cleared suddenly after raining all afternoon at halfpast eight to nine into pure natural weatherlow rainclouds on quite clear green wet hills                                     brantwood 13th august 1879  the most terrific and horrible thunderstorm this morning i ever remember it waked me at six or a little beforethen rolling incessantly like railway luggage trains quite ghastly in its mockery of themthe air one loathsome mass of sultry and foul fog like smoke scarcely raining at all but increasing to heavier rollings with flashes quivering vaguely through all the air and at last terrific double streams of reddishviolet fire not forked or zigzag but rippled rivuletstwo at the same instant some twenty to thirty degrees apart and lasting on the eye at least half a second with grand artillerypeals following not rattling crashes or irregular cracklings but delivered volleys it lasted an hour then passed off clearing a little without rain to speak ofnot a glimpse of blueand now halfpast seven seems settling down again into manchester devils darkness  quarter to eight morningthunder returned all the air collapsed into one black fog the hills invisible and scarcely visible the opposite shore heavy rain in short fits and frequent though less formidable flashes and shorter thunder while i have written this sentence the cloud has again dissolved itself like a nasty solution in a bottle with miraculous and unnatural rapidity and the hills are in sight again a doubleforked flashrippled i mean like the othersstarts into its frightful ladder of light between me and wetherlam as i raise my eyes all black above a rugged spray cloud on the eaglet the eaglet is my own name for the bold and elevated crag to the west of the little lake above coniston mines it had no name among the country people and is one of the most conspicuous features of the mountain chain as seen from brantwood  halfpast eightthree times light and three times dark since last i wrote and the darkness seeming each time as it settles more loathsome at last stopping my reading in mere blindness one lurid gleam of white cumulus in upper leadblue sky seen for half a minute through the sulphurous chimneypot vomit of blackguardly cloud beneath where its rags were thinnest                                     thursday 22d feb 1883  yesterday a fearfully dark mist all afternoon with steady south plaguewind of the bitterest nastiest poisonous blight and fretful flutter i could scarcely stay in the wood for the horror of it today really rather bright blue and bright semicumuli with the frantic old man blowing sheaves of lancets and chisels across the lakenot in strength enough or whirl enough to raise it in spray but tracing every squalls outline in black on the silver gray waves and whistling meanly and as if on a flute made of a file                                     sunday 17th august 1879  raining in foul drizzle slow and steady sky pitchdark and i just get a little light by sitting in the bowwindow diabolic clouds over everything and looking over my kitchen garden yesterday i found it one miserable mass of weeds gone to seed the roses in the higher garden putrefied into brown sponges feeling like dead snails and the halfripe strawberries all rotten at the stalks  6 and now i come to the most important sign of the plaguewind and the plaguecloud that in bringing on their peculiar darkness they blanch the sun instead of reddening it and here i must note briefly to you the uselessness of observation by instruments or machines instead of eyes in the first year when i had begun to notice the specialty of the plaguewind i went of course to the oxford observatory to consult its registrars they have their anemometer always on the twirl and can tell you the force or at least the pace of a gale19 by day or night but the anemometer can only record for you how often it has been driven round not at all whether it went round steadily or went round trembling and on that point depends the entire question whether it is a plague breeze or a healthy one and whats the use of telling you whether the winds strong or not when it cant tell you whether its a strong medicine or a strong poison  but againyou have your sunmeasure and can tell exactly at any moment how strong or how weak or how wanting the sun is but the sunmeasurer cant tell you whether the rays are stopped by a dense shallow cloud or a thin deep one in healthy weather the sun is hidden behind a cloud as it is behind a tree and when the cloud is past it comes out again as bright as before but in plaguewind the sun is choked out of the whole heaven all day long by a cloud which may be a thousand miles square and five miles deep  and yet observe that thin scraggy filthy mangy miserable cloud for all the depth of it cant turn the sun red as a good businesslike fog does with a hundred feet or so of itself by the plaguewind every breath of air you draw is polluted half round the world in a london fog the air itself is pure though you choose to mix up dirt with it and choke yourself with your own nastiness  now im going to show you a diagram of a sunset in entirely pure weather above london smoke i saw it and sketched it from my old post of observationthe top garret of my fathers house at herne hill there when the wind is south we are outside of the smoke and above it and this diagram admirably enlarged from my own drawing by my now in all things best aidedecamp mr collingwood shows you an oldfashioned sunsetthe sort of thing turner and i used to have to look atnobody else ever would constantly every sunset and every dawn in fine weather had something of the sort to show us this is one of the last pure sunsets i ever saw about the year 1876and the point i want you to note in it is that the air being pure the smoke on the horizon though at last it hides the sun yet hides it through gold and vermilion now dont go away fancying theres any exaggeration in that study the prismatic colors i told you were simply impossible to paint these which are transmitted colors can indeed be suggested but no more the brightest pigment we have would look dim beside the truth  i should have liked to have blotted down for you a bit of plaguecloud to put beside this but heaven knows you can see enough of it nowadays without any trouble of mine and if you want in a hurry to see what the sun looks like through it youve only to throw a bad halfcrown into a basin of soap and water  blanched sunblighted grassblinded manif in conclusion you ask me for any conceivable cause or meaning of these thingsi can tell you none according to your modern beliefs but i can tell you what meaning it would have borne to the men of old time remember for the last twenty years england and all foreign nations either tempting her or following her have blasphemed20 the name of god deliberately and openly and have done iniquity by proclamation every man doing as much injustice to his brother as it is in his power to do of states in such moral gloom every seer of old predicted the physical gloom saying the light shall be darkened in the heavens thereof and the stars shall withdraw their shining all greek all christian all jewish prophecy insists on the same truth through a thousand myths but of all the chief to former thought was the fable of the jewish warrior and prophet for whom the sun hasted not to go down with which i leave you to compare at leisure the physical result of your own wars and prophecies as declared by your own elect journal not fourteen days agothat the empire of england on which formerly the sun never set has become one on which he never rises  what is best to be done do you ask me the answer is plain whether you can affect the signs of the sky or not you can the signs of the times whether you can bring the sun back or not you can assuredly bring back your own cheerfulness and your own honesty you may not be able to say to the winds peace be still but you can cease from the insolence of your own lips and the troubling of your own passions and all that it would be extremely well to do even though the day were coming when the sun should be as darkness and the moon as blood but the paths of rectitude and piety once regained who shall say that the promise of old time would not be found to hold for us alsobring ye all the tithes into my storehouse and prove me now herewith saith the lord god if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it     lecture ii                                     march 11th 1884   it was impossible for me this spring to prepare as i wished to have done two lectures for the london institution but finding its members more interested in the subject chosen than i had anticipated i enlarged my lecture at its second reading by some explanations and parentheses partly represented and partly farther developed in the following notes which led me on however as i arranged them into branches of the subject untouched in the former lecture and it seems to me of no inferior interest  footnote 1 the vapor over the pool of anger in the inferno the clogging stench which rises from caina and the fog of the circle of anger in the purgatorio resemble indeed the cloud of the plaguewind very closelybut are conceived only as supernatural the reader will no doubt observe throughout the following lecture my own habit of speaking of beautiful things as natural and of ugly ones as unnatural in the conception of recent philosophy the world is one kosmos in which diphtheria is held to be as natural as song and cholera as digestion to my own mind and the more distinctly the more i see know and feel the earth as prepared for the abode of man appears distinctly ruled by agencies of health and disease of which the first may be aided by his industry prudence and piety while the destroying laws are allowed to prevail against him in the degree in which he allows himself in idleness folly and vice had the point been distinctly indicated where the degrees of adversity necessary for his discipline pass into those intended for his punishment the world would have been put under a manifest theocracy but the declaration of the principle is at least distinct enough to have convinced all sensitive and earnest persons from the beginning of speculation in the eyes and mind of man and it has been put in my power by one of the singular chances which have always helped me in my work when it was in the right direction to present to the university of oxford the most distinct expression of this first principle of mediæval theology which so far as i know exists in fifteenthcentury art it is one of the drawings of the florentine book which i bought for a thousand pounds against the british museum some ten or twelve years since being a compendium of classic and mediæval religious symbolism in the two pages of it forming one picture given to oxford the delivery of the law on sinai is represented on the left hand contrary to the scriptural narrative but in deeper expression of the benediction of the sacred law to all nations as in the midst of bright and calm light the figure of the deity being supported by luminous and level clouds and attended by happy angels while opposite on the right hand the worship of the golden calf is symbolized by a single decorated pillar with the calf on its summit surrounded by the clouds and darkness of a furious storm issuing from the mouths of fiendsuprooting the trees and throwing down the rocks above the broken tables of the law of which the fragments lie in the foreground  footnote 2 these conditions are mainly in the arrangement of the lower rainclouds in flakes thin and detached enough to be illuminated by early or late sunbeams their textures are then more softly blended than those of the upper cirri and have the qualities of painted instead of burnished or inflamed color  they were thus described in the 4th chapter of the 7th part of modern painters  often in our english mornings the rainclouds in the dawn form soft level fields which melt imperceptibly into the blue or when of less extent gather into apparent bars crossing the sheets of broader cloud above and all these bathed throughout in an unspeakable light of pure rosecolor and purple and amber and blue not shining but mistysoft the barred masses when seen nearer found to be woven in tresses of cloud like floss silk looking as if each knot were a little swathe or sheaf of lighted rain  no clouds form such skies none are so tender various inimitable turner himself never caught them correggio putting out his whole strength could have painted themno other man  footnote 3 i did not in writing this sentence forget mr gladstones finely scholastic enthusiasm for homer nor mr newtons for atheniani wish it had not been also for halicarnassian sculpture but byron loved greece herselfthrough her deathand to his own while the subsequent refusal of england to give greece one of our own princes for a king has always been held by me the most ignoble cowardly and lamentable of all our base commercial impolicies  footnote 4 deepening cloudsbyron never uses an epithet vainlyhe is the most accurate and therefore the most powerful of all modern describers the deepening of the cloud is essentially necessary to the redness of the orb ordinary observers are continually unaware of this fact and imagine that a red sun can be darker than the sky round it thus mr gould though a professed naturalist and passing most of his life in the open air over and over again in his british birds draws the setting sun dark on the sky  footnote 5 like the blood he predictsthe astrological power of the planet mars was of course ascribed to it in the same connection with its red color the reader may be interested to see the notice in modern painters of turners constant use of the same symbol partly an expression of his own personal feeling partly the employment of a symbolic language known to all careful readers of solar and stellar tradition  he was very definitely in the habit of indicating the association of any subject with circumstances of death especially the death of multitudes by placing it under one of his most deeply crimsoned sunset skies  the color of blood is thus plainly taken for the leading tone in the stormclouds above the slaveship it occurs with similar distinctness in the much earlier picture of ulysses and polypheme in that of napoleon at st helena and subdued by softer hues in the old téméraire  the sky of this goldau is in its scarlet and crimson the deepest in tone of all that i know in turners drawings  another feeling traceable in several of his former works is an acute sense of the contrast between the careless interests and idle pleasures of daily life and the state of those whose time for labor or knowledge or delight is passed forever there is evidence of this feeling in the introduction of the boys at play in the churchyard of kirkby lonsdale and the boy climbing for his kite among the thickets above the little mountain churchyard of brignalbank it is in the same tone of thought that he has placed here the two figures fishing leaning against these shattered flanks of rockthe sepulchral stones of the great mountain field of death  footnote 6 thy lore unto calamityit is i believe recognized by all who have in any degree become interested in the traditions of chaldean astrology that its warnings were distinctits promises deceitful horace thus warns leuconoe against reading the babylonian numbers to learn the time of her deathhe does not imply their promise of previous happiness and the continually deceptive character of the delphic oracle itself tempted always rather to fatal than to fortunate conduct unless the inquirer were more than wise in his reading byron gathers into the bitter question all the sorrow of former superstition while in the lines italicized just above he sums in the briefest and plainest english all that we yet know or may wisely think about the sun it is the burning oracle other oracles there are by sound or feeling but this by fire of all that lives the only means of our accurate knowledge of the things round us and that affect our lives it is the fountain of all lifebyron does not say the originthe origin of life would be the origin of the sun itself but it is the visible source of vital energy as the spring is of a stream though the origin is the sea and symbol of him who bestows itthis the sun has always been to every one who believes there is a bestower and a symbol so perfect and beautiful that it may also be thought of as partly an apocalypse  footnote 7 more beautiful in that varietythis line with the one italicized beneath expresses in myrrhas mind the feeling which i said in the outset every thoughtful watcher of heaven necessarily had in those old days whereas now the variety is for the most part only in modes of disagreeableness and the vapor instead of adding light to the unclouded sky takes away the aspect and destroys the functions of sky altogether  footnote 8 steam out of an engine funnelcompare the sixth paragraph of professor tyndalls forms of water and the following seventh one in which the phenomenon of transparent steam becoming opaque is thus explained every bit of steam shrinks when chilled to a much more minute particle of water the liquid particles thus produced form a kind of water dust of exceeding fineness which floats in the air and is called a cloud  but the author does not tell us in the first place what is the shape or nature of a bit of steam nor in the second place how the contraction of the individual bits of steam is effected without any diminution of the whole mass of them but on the contrary during its steady expansion in the third place he assumes that the particles of water dust are solid not vesicular which is not yet ascertained in the fourth place he does not tell us how their number and size are related to the quantity of invisible moisture in the air in the fifth place he does not tell us how cool invisible moisture differs from hot invisible moisture and in the sixth he does not tell us why the cool visible moisture stays while the hot visible moisture melts away so much for the present state of scientific information or at least communicativeness on the first and simplest conditions of the problem before us  in its wider range that problem embraces the total mystery of volatile power in substance and of the visible states consequent on suddenand presumably therefore imperfectvaporization as the smoke of frankincense or the sacred fume of modern devotion which now fills the inhabited world as that of the rose and violet its deserts whatit would be useful to know is the actual bulk of an atom of orange perfumewhat of one of vaporized tobacco or gunpowderand where do these artificial vapors fall back in beneficent rain or through what areas of atmosphere exist as invisible though perhaps not innocuous cloud  all these questions were put closely and precisely fourandtwenty years ago in the 1st chapter of the 7th part of modern painters paragraphs 4 to 9 of which i can here allow space only for the last which expresses the final difficulties of the matter better than anything said in this lecture  but farther these questions of volatility and visibility and hue are all complicated with those of shape how is a cloud outlined granted whatever you choose to ask concerning its material or its aspect its loftiness and luminousnesshow of its limitation what hews it into a heap or spins it into a web cold is usually shapeless i suppose extending over large spaces equally or with gradual diminution you cannot have in the open air angles and wedges and coils and cliffs of cold yet the vapor stops suddenly sharp and steep as a rock or thrusts itself across the gates of heaven in likeness of a brazen bar or braids itself in and out and across and across like a tissue of tapestry or falls into ripples like sand or into waving shreds and tongues as fire on what anvils and wheels is the vapor pointed twisted hammered whirled as the potters clay by what hands is the incense of the sea built up into domes of marble  footnote 9 the opposed conditions of the higher and lower orders of cloud with the balanced intermediate one are beautifully seen on mountain summits of rock or earth on snowy ones they are far more complex but on rock summits there are three distinct forms of attached cloud in serene weather the first that of cloud veil laid over them and falling in folds through their ravines the obliquely descending clouds of the entering chorus in aristophanes secondly the ascending cloud which develops itself loosely and independently as it rises and does not attach itself to the hillside while the falling veil cloud clings to it close all the way downand lastly the throned cloud which rests indeed on the mountain summit with its base but rises high above into the sky continually changing its outlines but holding its seat perhaps all day long  these three forms of cloud belong exclusively to calm weather attached drift cloud see note 11 can only be formed in the wind  footnote 10 glaciers of the alps page 10let a pound weight be placed upon a cube of granite size of supposed cube not mentioned the cube is flattened though in an infinitesimal degree let the weight be removed the cube remains a little flattened let us call the cube thus flattened no 1 starting with no 1 as a new mass let the pound weight be laid upon it we have a more flattened mass no 2 apply this to squeezed rocks to those for example which form the base of an obelisk like the matterhornthe conclusion seems inevitable that the mountain is sinking by its own weight etc etc similarly the nelson statue must be gradually flattening the nelson column and in time cleopatras needle will be as flat as her pincushion  footnote 11 glaciers of the alps page 146the sun was near the western horizon and i remained alone upon the grat to see his last beams illuminate the mountains which with one exception were without a trace of cloud  this exception was the matterhorn the appearance of which was extremely instructive the obelisk appeared to be divided in two halves by a vertical line drawn from its summit halfway down to the windward of which we had the bare cliffs of the mountain and to the left of it a cloud which appeared to cling tenaciously to the rocks  in reality however there was no clinging the condensed vapor incessantly got away but it was ever renewed and thus a river of cloud had been sent from the mountain over the valley of aosta the wind in fact blew lightly up the valley of st nicholas charged with moisture and when the air that held it rubbed against the cold cone of the matterhorn the vapor was chilled and precipitated in his lee  it is not explained why the wind was not chilled by rubbing against any of the neighboring mountains nor why the cone of the matterhorn mostly of rock should be colder than cones of snow the phenomenon was first described by de saussure who gives the same explanation as tyndall and from whom in the first volume of modern painters i adopted it without sufficient examination afterwards i reexamined it and showed its fallacy with respect to the cap or helmet cloud in the fifth volume of modern painters page 124 in the terms given in the subjoined notea but i still retained the explanation of saussure for the leeside cloud engraving in plate 69 the modes of its occurrence on the aiguille dru of which the most ordinary one was afterwards represented by tyndall in his glaciers of the alps under the title of bannercloud its less imaginative title in modern painters of leeside cloud is more comprehensive for this cloud forms often under the brows of farterraced precipices where it has no resemblance to a banner no true explanation of it has ever yet been given for the first condition of the problem has hitherto been unobservednamely that such cloud is constant in certain states of weather under precipitous rocksbut never developed with distinctness by domes of snow  illustration  but my former expansion of saussures theory is at least closer to the facts than professor tyndalls rubbing against the rocks and i therefore allow room for it here with its illustrative woodcut  when a moist wind blows in clear weather over a cold summit it has not time to get chilled as it approaches the rock and therefore the air remains clear and the sky bright on the windward side but under the lee of the peak there is partly a back eddy and partly still air and in that lull and eddy the wind gets time to be chilled by the rock and the cloud appears as a boiling mass of white vapor rising continually with the return current to the upper edge of the mountain where it is caught by the straight wind and partly torn partly melted away in broken fragments  in the accompanying figure the dark mass represents the mountain peak the arrow the main direction of the wind the curved lines show the directions of such current and its concentration and the dotted line encloses the space in which cloud forms densely floating away beyond and above in irregular tongues and flakes  footnote a but both saussure and i ought to have knownwe did know but did not think of itthat the covering or capcloud forms on hot summits as well as cold onesthat the red and bare rocks of mont pilate hotter certainly after a days sunshine than the cold stormwind which sweeps to them from the alps nevertheless have been renowned for their helmet of cloud ever since the romans watched the cloven summit gray against the south from the ramparts of vindonissa giving it the name from which the good catholics of lucerne have warped out their favorite piece of terrific sacred biography and both my master and i should also have reflected that if our theory about its formation had been generally true the helmet cloud ought to form on every cold summit at the approach of rain in approximating proportions to the bulk of the glaciers which is so far from being the case that not only a the capcloud may often be seen on lower summits of grass or rock while the higher ones are splendidly clear which may be accounted for by supposing the wind containing the moisture not to have risen so high but b the capcloud always shows a preference for hills of a conical form such as the mole or niesen which can have very little power in chilling the air even supposing they were cold themselves while it will entirely refuse to form huge masses of mountain which supposing them of chilly temperament must have discomforted the atmosphere in their neighborhood for leagues  footnote 12 see below on the different uses of the word reflection note 14 and note that throughout this lecture i use the words aqueous molecules alike of water liquid or vaporized not knowing under what conditions or at what temperatures waterdust becomes watergas and still less supposing pure watergas blue and pure air blue what are the changes in either which make them what sailors call dirty  but it is one of the worst omissions of the previous lecture that i have not stated among the characters of the plaguecloud that it is always dirtya and never blue under any conditions neither when deep in the distance nor when in the electric states which produce sulphurous blues in natural cloud but see the next note  footnote a in my final collation of the lectures given at oxford last year on the art of england i shall have occasion to take notice of the effect of this character of plaguecloud on our younger painters who have perhaps never in their lives seen a clean sky  footnote 13 black cloudsfor the sudden and extreme local blackness of thundercloud see

which an object possesses whatever the angle it is seen at and the light which it reverberates at one angle only the alps under the rosea of sunset are exactly of the same color whether you see them from berne or schaffhausen but the gilding to our eyes of a burnished cloud depends i believe at least for a measure of its luster upon the angle at which the rays incident upon it are reflected to the eye just as much as the glittering of the sea beneath itor the sparkling of the windows of the houses on the shore  previously at page 10 in calling the molecules of transparent atmospheric absolutely unreflective of light i mean in like manner unreflective from their surfaces their blue color seen against a dark ground is indeed a kind of reflection but one of which i do not understand the nature it is seen most simply in wood smoke blue against trees brown against clear light but in both cases the color is communicated to or left in the transmitted rays  so also the green of the sky p 13 is said to be given by transmitted light yellow rays passing through blue air much yet remains to be known respecting translucent colors of this kind only let them always be clearly distinguished in our minds from the firmly possessed color of opaque substances like grass or malachite  footnote a in speaking at p 11 of the first lecture of the limits of depth in the rosecolor cast on snow i ought to have noted the greater strength of the tint possible under the light of the tropics the following passage in mr cunninghams natural history of the strait of magellan is to me of the greatest interest because of the beautiful effect described as seen on the occasion of his visit to the small town of santa rosa near valparaiso the day though clear had not been sunny so that although the snowy heights of the andes had been distinctly visible throughout the greater part of our journey they had not been illuminated by the rays of the sun but now as we turned the corner of a street the chain of the cordillera suddenly burst on our gaze in such a blaze of splendor that it almost seemed as if the windows of heaven had been opened for a moment permitting a flood of crimson light to stream forth upon the snow the sight was so unexpected and so transcendently magnificent that a breathless silence fell upon us for a few moments while even the driver stopped his horses this deep red glow lasted for three or four minutes and then rapidly faded into that lovely rosy hue so characteristic of snow at sunset among the alps  footnote 15 diffractionsince these passages were written i have been led in conversation with a scientific friend to doubt my statement that the colored portions of the lighted clouds were brighter than the white ones he was convinced that the resolution of the rays would diminish their power and in thinking over the matter i am disposed to agree with him although my impression at the time has been always that the diffracted colors rose out of the white as a rainbow does out of the gray but whatever the facts may be in this respect the statement in the text of the impossibility of representing diffracted color in painting is equally true it may be that the resolved hues are darker than the white as colored panes in a window are darker than the colorless glass but all are alike in a key which no artifice of painting can approach  for the rest the phenomena of diffraction are not yet arranged systematically enough to be usefully discussed some of them involving the resolution of the light and others merely its intensification my attention was first drawn to them near st laurent on the jura mountains by the vivid reflection so it seemed of the image of the sun from a particular point of a cloud in the west after the sun itself was beneath the horizon but in this image there were no prismatic colors neither is the constantly seen metamorphosis of pine forests into silver filigree on ridges behind which the sun is rising or setting accompanied with any prismatic hue the trees become luminous but not iridescent on the other hand in his great account of his ascent of mont blanc with mr huxley professor tyndall thus describes the suns remarkable behavior on that occasionas we attained the brow which forms the entrance to the grand plateau he hung his disk upon a spike of rock to our left and surrounded by a glory of interference spectra of the most gorgeous colors blazed down upon us glaciers of the alps p 76  nothing irritates me more myself than having the color of my own descriptions of phenomena in anywise attributed by the reader to accidental states either of my mind or bodybut i cannot for once forbear at least the innocent question to professor tyndall whether the extreme beauty of these interference spectra may not have been partly owing to the extreme sobriety of the observer no refreshment it appears having been attainable the night before at the grands mulets except the beverage diluted with dirty snow of which i have elsewhere quoted the professors pensive reportmy memory of that tea is not pleasant  footnote 16 either stationary or slow in motion reflecting unresolved light  the rate of motion is of course not essentially connected with the method of illumination their connection in this instance needs explanation of some points which could not be dealt with in the time of a single lecture  it is before said with reserve only that a cloud is where it is seen and is not where it is not seen but thirty years ago in modern painters i pointed out see the paragraph quoted in note 8th the extreme difficulty of arriving at the cause of cloud outline or explaining how if we admitted at any given moment the atmospheric moisture to be generally diffused it could be chilled by formal chills into formal clouds how for instance in the upper cirri a thousand little chills alternating with a thousand little warmths could stand still as a thousand little feathers  but the first step to any elucidation of the matter is in the firmly fixing in our minds the difference between windless clouds unaffected by any conceivable local accident and windy clouds affected by some change in their circumstances as they move  in the sunset at abbeville represented in my first diagram the air is absolutely calm at the ground surface and the motion of its upper currents extremely slow there is no local reason assignable for the presence of the cirri above or of the thundercloud below there is no conceivable cause either in the geology or the moral character of the two sides of the town of abbeville to explain why there should be decorative fresco on the sky over the southern suburb and a muttering heap of gloom and danger over the northern the electric cloud is as calm in motion as the harmless one it changes its forms indeed but imperceptibly and so far as can be discerned only at its own will is exalted and with its own consent abased  but in my second diagram are shown forms of vapor sustaining at every instant all kinds of varying local influences beneath fastened down by mountain attraction above flung afar by distracting winds here spread abroad into blanched sheets beneath the sunshine and presently gathered into strands of coiled cordage in the shade their total existence is in metamorphosis and their every aspect a surprise or a deceit  footnote 17 finely comminuted water or ice  my impression that these clouds were glacial was at once confirmed by a member of my audience dr john rae in conversation after the lecture in which he communicated to me the perfectly definite observations which he has had the kindness to set down with their dates for me in the following letter                      4 addison gardens kensington 4th feb 1884  dear siri have looked up my old journal of thirty years ago written in pencil because it was impossible to keep ink unfrozen in the snowhut in which i passed the winter of 18534 at repulse bay on the arctic circlea  on the 1st of february 1854 i find the following  a beautiful appearance of some cirrus clouds near the sun the central part of the cloud being of a fine pink or red then green and pink fringe this continued for about a quarter of an hour the same was observed on the 27th of the month but not so bright distance of clouds from sun from 3° to 6°  on the 1st february the temperature was 38° below zero and on the 27th february 26° below  on the 23d and 30th of march the same splendid appearance of clouds as mentioned in last months journal was observed on the first of these days about 1030 am it was extremely beautiful the clouds were about 8° or 10° from the sun below him and slightly to the eastwardhaving a green fringe all round then pink the center part at first green and then pink or red  the temperature was 21° below zero fahrenheit  there may have been other colorsblue perhapsbut i merely noted the most prominent and what i call green may have been bluish although i do not mention this last color in my notes  from the lowness of the temperature at the time the clouds must have been frozen moisture  the phenomenon is by no means common even in the arctic zone  the second beautiful cloudpicture shown this afternoon brought so visibly to my memory the appearance seen by me as above described that i could not avoid remarking upon it                           believe me very truly yours                          john rae md frs  now this letter enables me to leave the elements of your problem for you in very clear terms  your skyaltogethermay be composed of one or more of four things       molecules of water in warm weather      molecules of ice in cold weather      molecules of watervapor in warm weather      molecules of icevapor in cold weather  but of the size distances or modes of attraction between these different kinds of particles i find no definite information anywhere except the somewhat vague statement by sir william thomson that if a drop of water could be magnified so as to be as large as the earth and have a diameter of eight thousand miles then a molecule of this water in it would appear somewhat larger than a shot what kind of shot and somewhat smaller than a cricketball  and as i finally review the common accounts given of cloud formation i find it quite hopeless for the general reader to deal with the quantity of points which have to be kept in mind and severally valued before he can account for any given phenomena i have myself in many of the passages of modern painters before referred to conceived of cloud too narrowly as always produced by cold whereas the temperature of a cloud must continually like that of our visible breath in frosty weather or of the visible current of steam or the smoking of a warm lake surface under sudden frost be above that of the surrounding atmosphere and yet i never remember entering a cloud without being chilled by it and the darkness of the plaguewind unless in electric states of the air is always accompanied by deadly chill  nor so far as i can read has any proper account yet been given of the balance in serene air of the warm air under the cold in which the warm air is at once compressed by weight and expanded by heat and the cold air is thinned by its elevation yet contracted by its cold there is indeed no possibility of embracing the conditions in a single sentence any more than in a single thought but the practical balance is effected in calm air so that its lower strata have no tendency to rise like the air in a fire balloon nor its higher strata to fall unless they congeal into rain or snow  i believe it will be an extreme benefit to my younger readers if i write for them a little grammar of ice and air collecting the known facts on all these matters and i am much minded to put by my ecclesiastical history for a while in order to relate what is legible of the history of the visible heaven  footnote a i trust that dr rae will forgive my making the reader better aware of the real value of this communication by allowing him to see also the following passage from the kind private letter by which it was supplemented  many years in the hudsons bay companys service i and my men became educated for arctic work in which i was five different times employed in two of which expeditions we lived wholly by our own hunting and fishing for twelve months once in a stone house very disagreeable and another winter in a snow hut better without fire of any kind to warm us on the first of these expeditions 18467 my little party there being no officer but myself surveyed seven hundred miles of coast of arctic america by a sledge journey which parry ross bach and lyon had failed to accomplish costing the country about £70000 or £80000 at the lowest computation the total expense of my little party including my own pay was under fourteen hundred pounds sterling  my arctic work has been recognized by the award of the founders gold medal of the royal geographical society before the completion of the whole of it  footnote 18 you cant get a billiard ball to fall a shivering on its own accounti am under correction in this statement by the lucasian professor of cambridge with respect to the molecules of bodies capable of epipolizing light nothing seems more natural than to suppose that the incident vibrations of the luminiferous ether produce vibratory movements among the ultimate molecules of sensitive substances and that the molecules in return swinging on their own account produce vibrations in the luminous ether and thus cause the sensation of light the periodic times of these vibrations depend upon the periods in which the molecules are disposed to swing on the changes of refrangibility of light p 549  it seems to me a pleasant conclusion this of recent science and suggestive of a perfectly regenerate theology the let there be light of the former creation is first expanded into let there be a disposition of the molecules to swing and the destinies of mankind no less than the vitality of the universe depend thereafter upon this amiable but perhaps capricious and at all events not easily influenced or anticipated disposition  is it not also strange that in a treatise entering into so high mathematical analysis as that from which i quote the false word swing expressing the action of a body liable to continuous arrest by gravitation should be employed to signify the oscillation wholly unaffected by gravity of substance in which the motion once originated may cease only with the essence of the body  it is true that in men of high scientific caliber such as the writer in this instance carelessness in expression does not affect the security of their conclusions but in men of lower rank mental defects in language indicate fatal flaws in thought and although the constant habit to which i owe my often foolishly praised command of languageof never allowing a sentence to pass proof in which i have not considered whether for the vital word in it a better could be found in the dictionary makes me somewhat morbidly intolerant of careless diction it may be taken for an extremely useful and practical rule that if a man can think clearly he will write well and that no good science was ever written in bad english so that before you consider whether a scientific author says a true or a false thing you had better first look if he is able properly to say anythingand secondly whether his conceit permits him to say anything properly  thus when professor tyndall endeavoring to write poetically of the sun tells you that the lilies of the field are his workmanship you may observe first that since the sun is not a man nothing that he does is workmanship while even the figurative statement that he rejoices as a strong man to run his course is one which professor tyndall has no intention whatever of admitting and you may then observe in the second place that if even in that figurative sense the lilies of the field are the suns workmanship in the same sense the lilies of the hothouse are the stoves workmanshipand in perfectly logical parallel you who are alive here to listen to me because you have been warmed and fed through the winter are the workmanship of your own coalscuttles  again when mr balfour stewart begins a treatise on the conservation of energy which is to conclude as we shall see presently with the prophecy of its total extinction as far as the present world is concernedby clothing in a properly scientific garb our innocent impression that there is some difference between the blow of a rifle stock and a rifle ball he prepares for the scientific toilet by telling us in italics that the something which the rifle ball possesses in contradistinction to the rifle stock is clearly the power of overcoming resistance since it can penetrate through oakwood or through wateror alas that it should be so often tried through the human body and this power of penetration italics now mine is the distinguishing characteristic of a substance moving with very great velocity let us define by the term energy this power which the rifle ball possesses of overcoming obstacles or of doing work  now had mr stewart been a better scholar he would have felt even if he had not known that the greek word energy could only be applied to the livingand of living with perfect propriety only to the mental action of animals and that it could no more be applied as a scientific garb to the flight of a rifle ball than to the fall of a dead body and if he had attained thus much even of the science of language it is just possible that the small forte and faculty of thought he himself possesses might have been energized so far as to perceive that the force of all inertly moving bodies whether rifle stock rifle ball or rolling world is under precisely one and the same relation to their weights and velocities that the effect of their impact dependsnot merely on their pace but their constitution and on the relative forms and stability of the substances they encounter and that there is no more quality of energy though much less quality of art in the swiftly penetrating shot or crushing ball than in the deliberately contemplative and administrative puncture by a gnats proboscis or a seamstress needle  mistakes of this kind beginning with affectations of diction do not always invalidate general statements or conclusionsfor a bad writer often equivocates out of a blunder as he equivocates into onebut i have been strict in pointing out the confusions of idea admitted in scientific books between the movement of a swing that of a sounding violin chord and that of an agitated liquid because these confusions have actually enabled professor tyndall to keep the scientific world in darkness as to the real nature of glacier motion for the last twenty years and to induce a resultant quantity of aberration in the scientific mind concerning glacial erosion of which another twenty years will scarcely undo the damage  footnote 19 force and paceamong the nearer questions which the careless terminology on which i have dwelt in the above note has left unsettled i believe the reader will be surprised as much as i am myself to find that of the mode of impulse in a common gust of wind whence is its strength communicated to it and how gathered in it and what is the difference of manner in the impulse between compressible gas and incompressible fluid for instance the water at the head of a weir is passing every instant from slower into quicker motion but until broken in the air the fast flowing water is just as dense as the slowly flowing water but a fan alternately compresses and rarefies the air between it and the cheek and the violence of a destructive gust in a gale of wind means a momentary increase in velocity and density of which i cannot myself in the least explainand find in no book on dynamics explainedthe mechanical causation  the following letter from a friend whose observations on natural history for the last seven or eight years have been consistently valuable and instructive to me will be found with that subjoined in the note in various ways interesting but especially in its notice of the inefficiency of ordinary instrumental registry in such matters                      6 moira place southampton feb 8th 1884  dear mr ruskinsome time since i troubled you with a note or two about seabirds etc but perhaps i should never have ventured to trouble you again had not your lecture on the storm clouds touched a subject which has deeply interested me for years past i had of course no idea that you had noticed this thing though i might have known that living the life you do you must have done so as for me it has been a source of perplexity for years so much so that i began to wonder at times whether i was not under some mental delusion about it until the strange theatrical displays of the last few months for which i was more or less prepared led so many to use their eyes unmuzzled by brass or glass for a time i know you do not bother or care much to read newspapers but i have taken the liberty of cutting out and sending a letter of mine sent on the 1st january to an evening papera upon this subject thinking you might like to know that one person at any rate has seen that strange bleared look about the sun shining so seldom except through a ghastly glare of pale persistent haze may it be that the singular coloring of the sunsets marks an end of this long period of plaguecloud and that in them we have promise of steadier weather no those sunsets were entirely distinct phenomena and promised if anything only evilr  i was glad to see that in your lecture you gave the dependants upon the instrumentmakers a warning on the 26th i had a heavy sailingboat lifted and blown from where she lay hauled up a distance of four feet which as the boat has four hundredweight of iron upon her keel gives a windgust or force not easily measured by instruments                           believe me dear mr ruskin                                    yours sincerely                                    robt c leslie  i am especially delighted in this letter by my friends vigorously accurate expression eyes unmuzzled by brass or glass i have had occasion continually in my artlectures to dwell on the great law of human perception and power that the beauty which is good for us is prepared for the natural focus of the sight and the sounds which are delightful to us for the natural power of the nerves of the ear and the art which is admirable in us is the exercise of our own bodily powers and not carving by sandblast nor oratorizing through a speaking trumpet nor dancing with spring heels but more recently i have become convinced that even in matters of science although every added mechanical power has its proper use and sphere yet the things which are vital to our happiness and prosperity can only be known by the rational use and subtle skill of our natural powers we may trust the instrument with the prophecy of storm or registry of rainfall but the conditions of atmospheric change on which depend the health of animals and fruitfulness of seeds can only be discerned by the eye and the bodily sense  take for simplest and nearest example this question of the stress of wind it is not the actual power that is immeasurable if only it would stand to be measured instruments could easily now be invented which would register not only a blast that could lift a sailing boat but one that would sink a ship of the line but lucklesslythe blast wont pose to the instrument nor can the instrument be adjusted to the blast in the gale of which my friend speaks in his next letter 26th january a gust came down the hill above coniston village upon two old oaks which were well rooted in the slate rock and some fifty or sixty feet highthe one some twenty yards below the other the blast tore the highest out of the ground peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orangeswept the head of the lower tree away with it in one ruin and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over the others stump as one would break ones cane over some peoples heads if one got the chance in wind action of this kind the amount of actual force used is the least part of the businessit is the suddenness of its concentration and the lifting and twisting strength as of a wrestler which make the blast fatal none of which elements of stormpower can be recognized by mechanical tests in my friends next letter however he gives us some evidence of the consistent strength of this same gale and of the electric conditions which attended itthe prefatory notice of his pet bird i had meant for loves meinie but it will help us through the grimness of our studies here                                     march 3d 1884  my small blackheaded gull jack is still flourishing and the time is coming when i look for that singularly sudden change in the plumage of his head which took place last march i have asked all my oceangoing friends to note whether these little birds are not the gulls par excellence of the sea and so far all i have heard from them confirms this it seems almost incredible but my son a sailor who met that hurricane of the 26th of january writes to me to say that out in the bay of biscay on the morning after the gale though it was blowing like blazes i observed some little gulls of jackys species and they followed us half way across the bay seeming to find shelter under the lee of our ship some alighted now and then and rested upon the water as if tired when one considers that these birds must have been at sea all that night somewhere it gives one a great idea of their strength and endurance my sons ship though a powerful ocean steamer was for two whole hours battling head to sea off the eddystone that night and for that time the lead gave no increase of soundings so that she could have made no headway during those two hours while all the time her yards had the st elmos fire at their ends looking as though a blue light was burning at each yardarm and this was about all they could see                           yours sincerely                          robt c leslie  the next letter from a correspondent with whom i have the most complete sympathy in some expressions of his postscript which are yet i consider more for my own private ear than for the public eye describes one of the more malignant phases of the plaguewind which i forgot to notice in my lecture                           burnham somerset february 7th 1884  dear siri read with great interest your first lecture at oxford on cloud and wind very indifferently reported in the times you have given a name to a wind ive known for years you call it the plaguei call it the devilwind e g on april 29th 1882 morning warmer then rain storms from east afternoon rain squalls wind west by south rough barometer falling awfully 430 pm tremendous windapril 30th all the leaves of the trees all plants black and dead as if a fiery blast had swept over them all the hedges on windward side black as black tea  another devilwind came towards the end of last summer the next day all the leaves were falling sere and yellow as if it were late autumn                           i am dear sir                                    yours faithfully                                      a h birkett  i remember both these blights well they were entirely terrific but only sudden maxima of the constant morbific power of this windwhich if mr birkett saw my personal notices of intercalated among the scientific ones he would find alluded to in terms quite as vigorously damning as he could desire and the actual effect of it upon my thoughts and work has been precisely that which would have resulted from the visible phantom of an evil spirit the absolute opponent of the queen of the airtyphon against athenain a sense of which i had neither the experience nor the conception when i wrote the illustrations of the myth of perseus in modern painters not a word of all those explanations of homer and pindar could have been written in weather like that of the last twelve years and i am most thankful to have got them written before the shadow came and i could still see what homer and pindar saw i quote one passage onlyvol v p 141for the sake of a similitude which reminds me of one more thing i have to say hereand a bit of its notewhich i think is a precious little piece not of wordpainting but of simply told feelingthat if people knew it is my real power  on the yorkshire and derbyshire hills when the raincloud is low and much broken and the steady west wind fills all space with its strengthb the sungleams fly like golden vultures they are flashes rather than shinings the dark spaces and the dazzling race and skim along the acclivities and dart and dip from crag to dell swallowlike  the dipping of the shadows here described of course is caused only by that of the dingles they cross but i have not in any of my books yet dwelt enough on the difference of character between the dipping and the mounting winds our wildest phase of the west wind here at coniston is swallowlike with a vengeance coming down on the lake in swirls which spurn the spray under them as a fiery horse does the dust on the other hand the softly ascending winds express themselves in the grace of their cloud motion as if set to the continuous music of a distant songc  the reader will please note also that whenever either in modern painters or elsewhere i speak of rate of flight in clouds i am thinking of it as measured by the horizontal distance overpast in given time and not as apparent only owing to the nearness of the spectator all low clouds appear to move faster than high ones the pace being supposed equal in both but when i speak of quick or slow cloud it is always with respect to a given altitude in a fine summer morning a cloud will wait for you among the pines folded to and fro among their stems with a branch or two coming out here and a spire or two there you walk through it and look back to it at another time on the same spot the fury of cloudflood drifts past you like the rhine at schaffhausen  the space even of the doubled lecture does not admit of my entering into any general statement of the action of the plaguecloud in switzerland and italy but i must not omit the following notes of its aspect in the high alps                                sallenches 11th september 1882  this morning at halfpast five the mont blanc summit was clear and the greater part of the aiguilles du plan and midi clear darkall against pure cirri lighted beneath by sunrise the sun of course not visible yet from the valley  by seven oclock the plagueclouds had formed in brown flakes down to the base of the aiguille de bionassay entirely covering the snowy ranges the sun as it rose to us here shone only for about ten minutesgilding in its old glory the range of the doronsbefore one had time to look from peak to peak of it the plaguecloud formed from the west hid mont joli and steadily choked the valley with advancing streaks of duncolored mist nowtwenty minutes to ninethere is not one ray of sunshine on the whole valley or on its mountains from the forclaz down to cluse  these phenomena are only the sequel of a series of still more strange and sad conditions of the air which have continued among the savoy alps for the last eight days themselves the sequel of others yet more general prolonged and harmful but the weather was perfectly fine at dijon and i doubt not at chamouni on the 1st of this month on the 2d in the evening i saw from the jura heavy thunderclouds in the west on the 3d the weather broke at morez in hot thundershowers with intervals of scorching sun on the 4th 5th and 6th there was nearly continuous rain at st cergues the alps being totally invisible all the time the sky cleared on the night of the 6th and on the 7th i saw from the top of the dole all the western plateaux of jura quite clearly but the entire range of the alps from the moleson to the salève and all beyondsnow crag and hillsidewere wrapped and buried in one unbroken graybrown windingsheet of such cloud as i had never seen till that day touch an alpine summit  the wind from the east so that it blew up over the edge of the dole cliff and admitted of perfect shelter on the slope to the west was bitter cold and extremely violent the sun overhead bright enough and remained so during the afternoon the plaguecloud reaching from the alps only about as far as the southern shore of the lake of geneva but we could not see the salève nor even the north shore farther than to morges i reached the col de la faucille at sunset when for a few minutes the mont blanc and aiguille verte showed themselves in dull red light but were buried again before the sun was quite down in the rising deluge of cloudpoison i saw no farther than the voirons and brezonand scarcely those during the electric heat of the 9th at geneva and last saturday and sunday have been mere whirls and drifts of indecisive but always sullen storm this morning i saw the snows clear for the first time having been during the whole past week on steady watch for them  i have written that the clouds of the 7th were such as i never before saw on the alps often during the past ten years i have seen them on my own hills and in italy in 1874 but it has always chanced to be fine weather or common rain and cold when i have been among the snowy chains and now from the dole for the first time i saw the plaguecloud on them  footnote a the look of the sky  to the editor of the st jamess gazette  siri have been a very constant though not a scientific observer of the sky for a period of forty years and i confess to a certain feeling of astonishment at the way in which the recent celestial phenomena seem to have taken the whole body of scientific observers by surprise it would even appear that something like these extraordinary sunsets was necessary to call the attention of such observers to what has long been a source of perplexity to a variety of common folk like sailors farmers and fishermen but to such people the look of the weather and what comes of that look is of far more consequence than the exact amount of ozone or the depth or width of a band of the spectrum  now to all such observers including myself it has been plain that of late neither the look of the sky nor the character of the weather has been as we should say what it used to be and those whose eyes were strong enough to look now and then toward the sun have noticed a very marked increase of what some would call a watery look about him which might perhaps be better expressed as a white sheen or glare at times developing into solar halo or mock suns as noted in your paper of the 2d of october last year a fisherman would describe it as white and daverylike so far as my observation goes this appearance was only absent here for a limited period during the present summer when we had a week or two of nearly normal weather the summer before it was seldom absent  again those whose business or pleasure has depended on the use of windpower have all remarked the strange persistence of hard westerly and easterly winds the westerly ones at times partaking of an almost tradewindlike force and character the summer of 1882 was especially remarkable for these winds while each stormy november has been followed by a period about midwinter of mild calm weather with dense fog during these strong winds in summer and early autumn the weather would remain bright and sunny and to a landsman would be not remarkable in any way while the barometer has been little affected by them but it has been often observed by those employed on the water that when it ceased blowing half a gale the sky at once became overcast with damp weather or rain this may all seem common enough to most people but to those accustomed to gauge the wind by the number of reefs wanted in a mainsail or foresail it was not so and the number of consecutive days when two or more reefs have been kept tied down during the last few summers has been remarkablealternating at times with equally persistent spells of calm and fog such as we are now passing through again we have had an unusually early appearance of ice in the atlantic and most abnormal weather over central europe while in a letter i have just received from an old hand on board a large australian clipper he speaks of heavy gales and big seas off that coast in almost the height of their summer  now upon all this in our season of long twilights we have bursting upon us some clear weather with a display of cloudforms or vapor at such an elevation that looking at them one day through an opening in the nearer clouds they seemed so distant as to resemble nothing but the delicate grain of ivory upon a billiardball and yet with the fact that twothirds of this earth is covered with water and bearing in mind the effect which a very small increase of sunpower would have in producing cloud and lifting it above its normal level for a time we are asked to believe that this sheen is all dust of some kind or other in order to explain what are now known as the recent sunsets though i venture to think that we shall see more of them yet when the sun comes our way again  at first sight increased sunpower would seem to mean more sunshine but a little reflection would show us that this would not be for long while any considerable addition to the suns power would be followed by such a vast increase of vapor that we should only see him in our latitudes at very short intervals i am aware that all this is most unscientific but i have read column after column of explanation written by those who are supposed to know all about such things and find myself not a jot the wiser for it do you know anybody who isi am sir your obedient servant

of storm in the plains of the south but to get full expression of the very heart and meaning of wind there is no place like a yorkshire moor i think scottish breezes are thinner very bleak and

necessary meaningharmful speakingnot against god only but against man and against all the good works and purposes of nature the word is accurately opposed to euphemy the right or wellspeaking of god and his world and the two modes of speech are those which going out of the mouth sanctify or defile the man  going out of the mouth that is to say deliberately and of purpose a french postilions sacrrréloud with the low nom de dieu following between his teeth is not blasphemy unless against his horsebut mr thackerays close of his waterloo chapter in vanity fair and all the night long amelia was praying for george who was lying on his face dead with a bullet through his heart is blasphemy of the most fatal and subtle kind  and the universal instinct of blasphemy in the modern vulgar scientific mind is above all manifested in its love of what is ugly and natural inthrallment by the abominableso that it is ten to one if in the description of a new bird you learn much more of it than the enumerated species of vermin that stick to its feathers and in the natural history museum of oxford humanity has been hitherto taught not by portraits of great men but by the skulls of cretins  but the deliberate blasphemy of science the assertion of its own virtue and dignity against the always implied and often asserted vileness of all men andgodsheretofore is the most wonderful phenomenon so far as i can read or perceive that hitherto has arisen in the always marvelous course of the worlds mental history  take for brief general type the following 92d paragraph of the forms of water  but while we thus acknowledge our limits there is also reason for wonder at the extent to which science has mastered the system of nature from age to age and from generation to generation fact has been added to fact and law to law the true method and order of the universe being thereby more and more revealed in doing this science has encountered and overthrown various forms of superstition and deceit of credulity and imposture but the world continually produces weak persons and wicked persons and as long as they continue to exist side by side as they do in this our day very debasing beliefs will also continue to infest the world  the debasing beliefs meant being simply those of homer david and st johnaas against a modern french gamins and what the results of the intended education of english gamins of every degree in that new higher theology will be england is i suppose by this time beginning to discern  in the last forsb which i have written on education of a safer kind still possible one practical point is insisted on chieflythat learning by heart and repetition with perfect accent and cultivated voice should be made quite principal branches of school discipline up to the time of going to the university  and of writings to be learned by heart among other passages of indisputable philosophy and perfect poetry i include certain chapters of thenow for the most part forgottenwisdom of solomon and of these there is one selected portion which i should recommend not only schoolboys and girls but persons of every age if they dont know it to learn forthwith as the shortest summary of solomons wisdomnamely the seventeenth chapter of proverbs which being only twentyeight verses long may be fastened in the dullest memory at the rate of a verse a day in the shortest month of the year out of the twentyeight verses i will read you seven for example of their tenorthe last of the seven i will with your good leave dwell somewhat upon you have heard the verses often before but probably without remembering that they are all in this concentrated chapter  1 verse 1better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of good eating with strife  remember in reading this verse that though england has chosen the strife and set every mans hand against his neighbor her house is not yet so full of good eating as she expected even though she gets half of her victuals from america  2 verse 3the fining pot is for silver the furnace for gold but the lord tries the heart  notice the increasing strength of trial for the more precious thing only the meltingpot for the silverthe fierce furnace for the goldbut the fire of the lord for the heart  3 verse 4a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips  that means for you that intending to live by usury and swindling you read mr adam smith and mr stuart mill and other such political economists  4 verse 5whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker  mockethby saying that his poverty is his fault

understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth  and in the beginnings of it solomon would have written had he lived in our day but we will be content with the ends at present no scientific people as i told you at first have taken any notice of the more or less temporary phenomena of which i have tonight given you register but from the constant arrangements of the universe the same respecting which the thinkers of former time came to the conclusion that they were essentially good and to end in good the modern speculator arrives at the quite opposite and extremely uncomfortable conclusion that they are essentially evil and to endin nothing  and i have here a volumec before quoted by a very foolish and very lugubrious author who in his concluding chapter gives usfounded you will observe on a series of ifsthe latest scientific views concerning the order of creation we have spoken already about a medium pervading spacethis is the scientific god you observe differing from the unscientific one in that the purest in heart cannot seenor the softest in heart feelthis spacious deitya medium pervading spacethe office of which italics all mine appears to be to degrade and ultimately extinguish all differential motion it has been well pointed out by thomson that looked at in this light the universe is a system that had a beginning and must have an end for a process of degradation cannot be eternal if we could view the universe as a candle not lit then it is perhaps conceivable to regard it as having been always in existence but if we regard it rather as a candle that has been lit we become absolutely certain that it cannot have been burning from eternity and that a time will come when it will cease to burn we are led to look to a beginning in which the particles of matter were in a diffuse chaotic state but endowed with the power of gravitation and we are led to look to an end in which the whole universe will be one equally heated inert mass and from which everything like life or motion or beauty will have utterly gone away  do you wish me to congratulate you on this extremely cheerful result of telescopic and microscopic observation and so at once close my lecture or may i venture yet to trespass on your time by stating to you any of the more comfortable views held by persons who did not regard the universe in what my author humorously calls this light  in the peculiarly characteristic notice with which the daily news honored my last weeks lecture that courteous journal charged me in the metaphorical term now classical on exchange with hedging to conceal my own opinions the charge was not prudently chosen since of all men now obtaining any portion of popular regard i am pretty well known to be precisely the one who cares least either for hedge or ditch when he chooses to go across country it is certainly true that i have not the least mind to pin my heart on my sleeve for the daily daw or nightly owl to peck at but the essential reason for my not telling you my own opinions on this matter isthat i do not consider them of material consequence to you  it might possibly be of some advantage for you to know whatwere he now living orpheus would have thought or Æschylus or a daniel come to judgment or john the baptist or john the son of thunder but what either you or i or any other jack or tom of us all thinkeven if we knew what to thinkis of extremely small moment either to the gods the clouds or ourselves  of myself however if you care to hear it i will tell you thus much that had the weather when i was young been such as it is now no book such as modern painters ever would or could have been written for every argument and every sentiment in that book was founded on the personal experience of the beauty and blessing of nature all spring and summer long and on the then demonstrable fact that over a great portion of the worlds surface the air and the earth were fitted to the education of the spirit of man as closely as a schoolboys primer is to his labor and as gloriously as a lovers mistress is to his eyes  that harmony is now broken and broken the world round fragments indeed of what existed still exist and hours of what is past still return but month by month the darkness gains upon the day and the ashes of the antipodes glare through the nightd  what consolation or what courage through plague danger or darkness you can find in the conviction that you are nothing more than brute beasts driven by brute forces your other tutors can tell younot i but this i can tell youand with the authority of all the masters of thought since time was timethat while by no manner of vivisection you can learn what a beast is by only looking into your own hearts you may know what a man isand know that his only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him in reverence of something to be worshiped by him and in love of something to be cherished by him and cherishedforever  having these instincts his only rational conclusion is that the objects which can fulfill them may be by his effort gained and by his faith discerned and his only earthly wisdom is to accept the united testimony of the men who have sought these things in the way they were commanded of whom no single one has ever said that his obedience or his faith had been vain or found himself cast out from the choir of the living souls whether here or departed for whom the song was written      god be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine         upon us     that thy way may be known

proved to be connected with the flight of volcanic ashes this has been since i hear disproved again whatever their cause those sunsets were in the sense in which i myself use the word altogether unnatural and terrific but they have no connection with the far more fearful because protracted and increasing power of the plaguewind the letter from whites history of selborne quoted by the rev w r andrews in his letter to the times dated january 8th seems to describe aspects of the sky like these of 1883 just a hundred years before in 1783 and also some of the circumstances noted especially the variation of the wind to all quarters without alteration in the air correspond with the character of the plaguewind but the fog of 1783 made the sun dark with ironcolored raysnot pale with blanching rays i subjoin mr andrews letter extremely valuable in its collation of the records of simultaneous volcanic phenomena praying the reader also to observe the instantaneous acknowledgment by the true naturalist of horror in the violation of beneficent natural law  the recent sunsets and volcanic eruptions  sirit may perhaps be interesting at the present time when so much attention has been given to the late brilliant sunsets and sunrises to be reminded that almost identically the same appearances were observed just a hundred years ago  gilbert white writes in the year 1783 in his 109th letter published in his natural history of selborne  the summer of the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one and full of horrible phenomena for besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom the peculiar haze or smoky fog that prevailed for many weeks in this island and in every part of europe and even beyond its limits was a most extraordinary appearance unlike anything known within the memory of man by my journal i find that i had noticed this strange occurrence from june 23d to july 20th inclusive during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air the sun at noon looked as black as a clouded moon and shed a ferruginous light on the ground and floors of rooms but was particularly lurid and bloodcolored at rising and setting the country people began to look with a superstitious awe at the red lowering aspect of the sun and indeed there was reason for the most enlightened person to be apprehensive for all the while calabria and part of the isle of sicily were torn and convulsed with earthquakes and about that juncture a volcano sprang out of the sea on the coast of norway  other writers also mention volcanic disturbances in this same year 1783 we are told by lyell and geikie that there were great volcanic eruptions in and near iceland a submarine volcano burst forth in the sea thirty miles southwest of iceland which ejected so much pumice that the ocean was covered with this substance to the distance of 150 miles and ships were considerably impeded in their course and a new island was formed from which fire and smoke and pumice were emitted  besides this submarine eruption the volcano skaptarjökull on the mainland on june 11th 1783 threw out a torrent of lava so immense as to surpass in magnitude the bulk of mont blanc and ejected so vast an amount of fine dust that the atmosphere over iceland continued loaded with it for months afterwards it fell in such quantities over parts of caithnessa distance of 600 milesas to destroy the crops and that year is still spoken of by the inhabitants as the year of the ashie  these particulars are gathered from the textbooks of lyell and geikie  i am not aware whether the coincidence in time of the icelandic eruptions and of the peculiar appearance of the sun described by gilbert white has yet been noticed but this coincidence may very well be taken as some little evidence towards explaining the connection between the recent beautiful sunsets and the tremendous volcanic explosion of the isle of krakatoa in august last                 w r andrews f g s                teffont ewyas rectory salisbury january 8th
