19689355	the son of the wolf  jack london   1900    contains    the white silence   the son of the wolf   the men of forty mile   in a far country   to the man on the trail   the priestly prerogative   the wisdom of the trail   the wife of a king   an odyssey of the north     the white silence  carmen wont last more than a couple of days mason spat out a chunk of ice and surveyed the poor animal ruefully then put her foot in his mouth and proceeded to bite out the ice which clustered cruelly between the toes  i never saw a dog with a highfalutin name that ever was worth a rap he said as he concluded his task and shoved her aside they just fade away and die under the responsibility did ye ever see one go wrong with a sensible name like cassiar siwash or husky no sir take a look at shookum here hes snap the lean brute flashed up the white teeth just missing masons throat  ye will will ye a shrewd clout behind the ear with the butt of the dog whip stretched the animal in the snow quivering softly a yellow slaver dripping from its fangs  as i was saying just look at shookum herehes got the spirit bet ye he eats carmen before the weeks out ill bank another proposition against that replied malemute kid reversing the frozen bread placed before the fire to thaw well eat shookum before the trip is over what dye say ruth the indian woman settled the coffee with a piece of ice glanced from malemute kid to her husband then at the dogs but vouchsafed no reply it was such a palpable truism that none was necessary two hundred miles of unbroken trail in prospect with a scant six days grub for themselves and none for the dogs could admit no other alternative the two men and the woman grouped about the fire and began their meager meal the dogs lay in their harnesses for it was a midday halt and watched each mouthful enviously  no more lunches after today said malemute kid and weve got to keep a close eye on the dogstheyre getting vicious theyd just as soon pull a fellow down as not if they get a chance and i was president of an epworth once and taught in the sunday school having irrelevantly delivered himself of this mason fell into a dreamy contemplation of his steaming moccasins but was aroused by ruth filling his cup  thank god weve got slathers of tea ive seen it growing down in tennessee what wouldnt i give for a hot corn pone just now never mind ruth you wont starve much longer nor wear moccasins either the woman threw off her gloom at this and in her eyes welled up a great love for her white lordthe first white man she had ever seenthe first man whom she had known to treat a woman as something better than a mere animal or beast of burden  yes ruth continued her husband having recourse to the macaronic jargon in which it was alone possible for them to understand each other wait till we clean up and pull for the outside well take the white mans canoe and go to the salt water yes bad water rough watergreat mountains dance up and down all the time and so big so far so far awayyou travel ten sleep twenty sleep forty sleephe graphically enumerated the days on his fingersall the time water bad water then you come to great village plenty people just the same mosquitoes next summer wigwams oh so highten twenty pines  hiyu skookum he paused impotently cast an appealing glance at malemute kid then laboriously placed the twenty pines end on end by sign language malemute kid smiled with cheery cynicism but ruths eyes were wide with wonder and with pleasure for she half believed he was joking and such condescension pleased her poor womans heart  and then you step into aa box and pouf up you go he tossed his empty cup in the air by way of illustration and as he deftly caught it cried and biff down you come oh great medicine men you go fort yukon i go arctic citytwentyfive sleepbig string all the timei catch him stringi say hello ruth how are yeand you say is that my good husbandand i say yesand you say no can bake good bread no more sodathen i say look in cache under flour goodby you look and catch plenty soda all the time you fort yukon me arctic city hiyu medicine man ruth smiled so ingenuously at the fairy story that both men burst into laughter a row among the dogs cut short the wonders of the outside and by the time the snarling combatants were separated she had lashed the sleds and all was ready for the trailmush baldy hi mush on mason worked his whip smartly and as the dogs whined low in the traces broke out the sled with the gee pole ruth followed with the second team leaving malemute kid who had helped her start to bring up the rear strong man brute that he was capable of felling an ox at a blow he could not bear to beat the poor animals but humored them as a dog driver rarely doesnay almost wept with them in their misery  come mush on there you poor sorefooted brutes he murmured after several ineffectual attempts to start the load but his patience was at last rewarded and though whimpering with pain they hastened to join their fellows  no more conversation the toil of the trail will not permit such extravagance  and of all deadening labors that of the northland trail is the worst happy is the man who can weather a days travel at the price of silence and that on a beaten track  and of all heartbreaking labors that of breaking trail is the worst at every step the great webbed shoe sinks till the snow is level with the knee then up straight up the deviation of a fraction of an inch being a certain precursor of disaster the snowshoe must be lifted till the surface is cleared then forward down and the other foot is raised perpendicularly for the matter of half a yard he who tries this for the first time if haply he avoids bringing his shoes in dangerous propinquity and measures not his length on the treacherous footing will give up exhausted at the end of a hundred yards he who can keep out of the way of the dogs for a whole day may well crawl into his sleeping bag with a clear conscience and a pride which passeth all understanding and he who travels twenty sleeps on the long trail is a man whom the gods may envy  the afternoon wore on and with the awe born of the white silence the voiceless travelers bent to their work nature has many tricks wherewith she convinces man of his finitythe ceaseless flow of the tides the fury of the storm the shock of the earthquake the long roll of heavens artillerybut the most tremendous the most stupefying of all is the passive phase of the white silence all movement ceases the sky clears the heavens are as brass the slightest whisper seems sacrilege and man becomes timid affrighted at the sound of his own voice sole speck of life journeying across the ghostly wastes of a dead world he trembles at his audacity realizes that his is a maggots life nothing more  strange thoughts arise unsummoned and the mystery of all things strives for utterance  and the fear of death of god of the universe comes over himthe hope of the resurrection and the life the yearning for immortality the vain striving of the imprisoned essenceit is then if ever man walks alone with god  so wore the day away the river took a great bend and mason headed his team for the cutoff across the narrow neck of land but the dogs balked at the high bank again and again though ruth and malemute kid were shoving on the sled they slipped back then came the concerted effort the miserable creatures weak from hunger exerted their last strength upupthe sled poised on the top of the bank but the leader swung the string of dogs behind him to the right fouling masons snowshoes the result was grievous  mason was whipped off his feet one of the dogs fell in the traces and the sled toppled back dragging everything to the bottom again  slash the whip fell among the dogs savagely especially upon the one which had fallen  dontmason entreated malemute kid the poor devils on its last legs  wait and well put my team on mason deliberately withheld the whip till the last word had fallen then out flashed the long lash completely curling about the offending creatures body  carmenfor it was carmencowered in the snow cried piteously then rolled over on her side  it was a tragic moment a pitiful incident of the traila dying dog two comrades in anger  ruth glanced solicitously from man to man but malemute kid restrained himself though there was a world of reproach in his eyes and bending over the dog cut the traces no word was spoken the teams were doublespanned and the difficulty overcome the sleds were under way again the dying dog dragging herself along in the rear as long as an animal can travel it is not shot and this last chance is accorded itthe crawling into camp if it can in the hope of a moose being killed  already penitent for his angry action but too stubborn to make amends mason toiled on at the head of the cavalcade little dreaming that danger hovered in the air the timber clustered thick in the sheltered bottom and through this they threaded their way fifty feet or more from the trail towered a lofty pine for generations it had stood there and for generations destiny had had this one end in viewperhaps the same had been decreed of mason  he stooped to fasten the loosened thong of his moccasin the sleds came to a halt and the dogs lay down in the snow without a whimper the stillness was weird not a breath rustled the frostencrusted forest the cold and silence of outer space had chilled the heart and smote the trembling lips of nature a sigh pulsed through the airthey did not seem to actually hear it but rather felt it like the premonition of movement in a motionless void then the great tree burdened with its weight of years and snow played its last part in the tragedy of life he heard the warning crash and attempted to spring up but almost erect caught the blow squarely on the shoulder  the sudden danger the quick deathhow often had malemute kid faced it the pine needles were still quivering as he gave his commands and sprang into action nor did the indian girl faint or raise her voice in idle wailing as might many of her white sisters at his order she threw her weight on the end of a quickly extemporized handspike easing the pressure and listening to her husbands groans while malemute kid attacked the tree with his ax the steel rang merrily as it bit into the frozen trunk each stroke being accompanied by a forced audible respiration the huh huh of the woodsman  at last the kid laid the pitiable thing that was once a man in the snow but worse than his comrades pain was the dumb anguish in the womans face the blended look of hopeful hopeless query little was said those of the northland are early taught the futility of words and the inestimable value of deeds with the temperature at sixtyfive below zero a man cannot lie many minutes in the snow and live so the sled lashings were cut and the sufferer rolled in furs laid on a couch of boughs before him roared a fire built of the very wood which wrought the mishap behind and partially over him was stretched the primitive flya piece of canvas which caught the radiating heat and threw it back and down upon hima trick which men may know who study physics at the fount  and men who have shared their bed with death know when the call is sounded mason was terribly crushed the most cursory examination revealed it  his right arm leg and back were broken his limbs were paralyzed from the hips and the likelihood of internal injuries was large an occasional moan was his only sign of life  no hope nothing to be done the pitiless night crept slowly byruths portion the despairing stoicism of her race and malemute kid adding new lines to his face of bronze  in fact mason suffered least of all for he spent his time in eastern tennessee in the great smoky mountains living over the scenes of his childhood and most pathetic was the melody of his longforgotten southern vernacular as he raved of swimming holes and coon hunts and watermelon raids it was as greek to ruth but the kid understood and feltfelt as only one can feel who has been shut out for years from all that civilization means  morning brought consciousness to the stricken man and malemute kid bent closer to catch his whispers  you remember when we foregathered on the tanana four years come next ice run i didnt care so much for her then it was more like she was pretty and there was a smack of excitement about it i think but dye know ive come to think a heap of her shes been a good wife to me always at my shoulder in the pinch and when it comes to trading you know there isnt her equal dye recollect the time she shot the moosehorn rapids to pull you and me off that rock the bullets whipping the water like hailstonesand the time of the famine at nuklukyetowhen she raced the ice run to bring the news  yes shes been a good wife to me bettern that other one didnt know id been there  never told you eh well i tried it once down in the states thats why im here been raised together too i came away to give her a chance for divorce she got it  but thats got nothing to do with ruth i had thought of cleaning up and pulling for the outside next yearher and ibut its too late dont send her back to her people kid its beastly hard for a woman to go back think of itnearly four years on our bacon and beans and flour and dried fruit and then to go back to her fish and caribou its not good for her to have tried our ways to come to know theyre bettern her peoples and then return to them take care of her kid why dont youbut no you always fought shy of themand you never told me why you came to this country be kind to her and send her back to the states as soon as you can but fix it so she can come backliable to get homesick you know  and the youngsterits drawn us closer kid i only hope it is a boy think of itflesh of my flesh kid he mustnt stop in this country and if its a girl why she cant sell my furs theyll fetch at least five thousand and ive got as much more with the company and handle my interests with yours i think that bench claim will show up see that he gets a good schooling and kid above all dont let him come back this country was not made for white men  im a gone man kid three or four sleeps at the best youve got to go on  you must go on remember its my wife its my boyo god i hope its a boy you cant stay by meand i charge you a dying man to pull on  give me three days pleaded malemute kid you may change for the better something may turn up  no  just three days  you must pull on  two days  its my wife and my boy kid you would not ask it  one day  no no i charge  only one day we can shave it through on the grub and i might knock over a moose  noall right one day but not a minute more and kid dontdont leave me to face it alone just a shot one pull on the trigger you understand think of it think of it flesh of my flesh and ill never live to see him  send ruth here i want to say goodby and tell her that she must think of the boy and not wait till im dead she might refuse to go with you if i didnt goodby old man goodby  kid i sayasink a hole above the pup next to the slide i panned out forty cents on my shovel there  and kid he stooped lower to catch the last faint words the dying mans surrender of his pride im sorryforyou knowcarmen leaving the girl crying softly over her man malemute kid slipped into his parka and snowshoes tucked his rifle under his arm and crept away into the forest he was no tyro in the stern sorrows of the northland but never had he faced so stiff a problem as this in the abstract it was a plain mathematical propositionthree possible lives as against one doomed one but now he hesitated for five years shoulder to shoulder on the rivers and trails in the camps and mines facing death by field and flood and famine had they knitted the bonds of their comradeship so close was the tie that he had often been conscious of a vague jealousy of ruth from the first time she had come between and now it must be severed by his own hand  though he prayed for a moose just one moose all game seemed to have deserted the land and nightfall found the exhausted man crawling into camp lighthanded heavyhearted an uproar from the dogs and shrill cries from ruth hastened him  bursting into the camp he saw the girl in the midst of the snarling pack laying about her with an ax the dogs had broken the iron rule of their masters and were rushing the grub  he joined the issue with his rifle reversed and the hoary game of natural selection was played out with all the ruthlessness of its primeval environment rifle and ax went up and down hit or missed with monotonous regularity lithe bodies flashed with wild eyes and dripping fangs and man and beast fought for supremacy to the bitterest conclusion then the beaten brutes crept to the edge of the firelight licking their wounds voicing their misery to the stars  the whole stock of dried salmon had been devoured and perhaps five pounds of flour remained to tide them over two hundred miles of wilderness ruth returned to her husband while malemute kid cut up the warm body of one of the dogs the skull of which had been crushed by the ax every portion was carefully put away save the hide and offal which were cast to his fellows of the moment before  morning brought fresh trouble the animals were turning on each other carmen who still clung to her slender thread of life was downed by the pack the lash fell among them unheeded they cringed and cried under the blows but refused to scatter till the last wretched bit had disappearedbones hide hair everything  malemute kid went about his work listening to mason who was back in tennessee delivering tangled discourses and wild exhortations to his brethren of other days  taking advantage of neighboring pines he worked rapidly and ruth watched him make a cache similar to those sometimes used by hunters to preserve their meat from the wolverines and dogs one after the other he bent the tops of two small pines toward each other and nearly to the ground making them fast with thongs of moosehide then he beat the dogs into submission and harnessed them to two of the sleds loading the same with everything but the furs which enveloped mason these he wrapped and lashed tightly about him fastening either end of the robes to the bent pines a single stroke of his hunting knife would release them and send the body high in the air  ruth had received her husbands last wishes and made no struggle poor girl she had learned the lesson of obedience well from a child she had bowed and seen all women bow to the lords of creation and it did not seem in the nature of things for woman to resist the kid permitted her one outburst of grief as she kissed her husbandher own people had no such customthen led her to the foremost sled and helped her into her snowshoes blindly instinctively she took the gee pole and whip and mushed the dogs out on the trail then he returned to mason who had fallen into a coma and long after she was out of sight crouched by the fire waiting hoping praying for his comrade to die  it is not pleasant to be alone with painful thoughts in the white silence the silence of gloom is merciful shrouding one as with protection and breathing a thousand intangible sympathies but the bright white silence clear and cold under steely skies is pitiless  an hour passedtwo hoursbut the man would not die at high noon the sun without raising its rim above the southern horizon threw a suggestion of fire athwart the heavens then quickly drew it back malemute kid roused and dragged himself to his comrades side he cast one glance about him the white silence seemed to sneer and a great fear came upon him there was a sharp report mason swung into his aerial sepulcher and malemute kid lashed the dogs into a wild gallop as he fled across the snow    the son of the wolf  man rarely places a proper valuation upon his womankind at least not until deprived of them he has no conception of the subtle atmosphere exhaled by the sex feminine so long as he bathes in it but let it be withdrawn and an evergrowing void begins to manifest itself in his existence and he becomes hungry in a vague sort of way for a something so indefinite that he cannot characterize it if his comrades have no more experience than himself they will shake their heads dubiously and dose him with strong physic but the hunger will continue and become stronger he will lose interest in the things of his everyday life and wax morbid and one day when the emptiness has become unbearable a revelation will dawn upon him  in the yukon country when this comes to pass the man usually provisions a poling boat if it is summer and if winter harnesses his dogs and heads for the southland a few months later supposing him to be possessed of a faith in the country he returns with a wife to share with him in that faith and incidentally in his hardships this but serves to show the innate selfishness of man it also brings us to the trouble of scruff mackenzie which occurred in the old days before the country was stampeded and staked by a tidalwave of the chechaquas and when the klondikes only claim to notice was its salmon fisheries  scruff mackenzie bore the earmarks of a frontier birth and a frontier life  his face was stamped with twentyfive years of incessant struggle with nature in her wildest moodsthe last two the wildest and hardest of all having been spent in groping for the gold which lies in the shadow of the arctic circle when the yearning sickness came upon him he was not surprised for he was a practical man and had seen other men thus stricken but he showed no sign of his malady save that he worked harder all summer he fought mosquitoes and washed the surething bars of the stuart river for a double grubstake then he floated a raft of houselogs down the yukon to forty mile and put together as comfortable a cabin as any the camp could boast of in fact it showed such cozy promise that many men elected to be his partner and to come and live with him but he crushed their aspirations with rough speech peculiar for its strength and brevity and bought a double supply of grub from the tradingpost  as has been noted scruff mackenzie was a practical man if he wanted a thing he usually got it but in doing so went no farther out of his way than was necessary though a son of toil and hardship he was averse to a journey of six hundred miles on the ice a second of two thousand miles on the ocean and still a third thousand miles or so to his last stampinggroundsall in the mere quest of a wife life was too short so he rounded up his dogs lashed a curious freight to his sled and faced across the divide whose westward slopes were drained by the headreaches of the tanana  he was a sturdy traveler and his wolfdogs could work harder and travel farther on less grub than any other team in the yukon three weeks later he strode into a huntingcamp of the upper tanana sticks they marveled at his temerity for they had a bad name and had been known to kill white men for as trifling a thing as a sharp ax or a broken rifle  but he went among them singlehanded his bearing being a delicious composite of humility familiarity sangfroid and insolence it required a deft hand and deep knowledge of the barbaric mind effectually to handle such diverse weapons but he was a pastmaster in the art knowing when to conciliate and when to threaten with jovelike wrath  he first made obeisance to the chief thlingtinneh presenting him with a couple of pounds of black tea and tobacco and thereby winning his most cordial regard then he mingled with the men and maidens and that night gave a potlach  the snow was beaten down in the form of an oblong perhaps a hundred feet in length and quarter as many across down the center a long fire was built while either side was carpeted with spruce boughs the lodges were forsaken and the fivescore or so members of the tribe gave tongue to their folkchants in honor of their guest  scruff mackenzies two years had taught him the not many hundred words of their vocabulary and he had likewise conquered their deep gutturals their japanese idioms constructions and honorific and agglutinative particles so he made oration after their manner satisfying their instinctive poetrylove with crude flights of eloquence and metaphorical contortions after thlingtinneh and the shaman had responded in kind he made trifling presents to the menfolk joined in their singing and proved an expert in their fiftytwostick gambling game  and they smoked his tobacco and were pleased but among the younger men there was a defiant attitude a spirit of braggadocio easily understood by the raw insinuations of the toothless squaws and the giggling of the maidens they had known few white men sons of the wolf but from those few they had learned strange lessons  nor had scruff mackenzie for all his seeming carelessness failed to note these phenomena in truth rolled in his sleepingfurs he thought it all over thought seriously and emptied many pipes in mapping out a campaign one maiden only had caught his fancynone other than zarinska daughter to the chief in features form and poise answering more nearly to the white mans type of beauty she was almost an anomaly among her tribal sisters he would possess her make her his wife and name herah he would name her gertrude having thus decided he rolled over on his side and dropped off to sleep a true son of his allconquering race a samson among the philistines  it was slow work and a stiff game but scruff mackenzie maneuvered cunningly with an unconcern which served to puzzle the sticks he took great care to impress the men that he was a sure shot and a mighty hunter and the camp rang with his plaudits when he brought down a moose at six hundred yards of a night he visited in chief thlingtinnehs lodge of moose and cariboo skins talking big and dispensing tobacco with a lavish hand nor did he fail to likewise honor the shaman for he realized the medicinemans influence with his people and was anxious to make of him an ally but that worthy was high and mighty refused to be propitiated and was unerringly marked down as a prospective enemy  though no opening presented for an interview with zarinska mackenzie stole many a glance to her giving fair warning of his intent and well she knew yet coquettishly surrounded herself with a ring of women whenever the men were away and he had a chance but he was in no hurry besides he knew she could not help but think of him and a few days of such thought would only better his suit  at last one night when he deemed the time to be ripe he abruptly left the chiefs smoky dwelling and hastened to a neighboring lodge as usual she sat with squaws and maidens about her all engaged in sewing moccasins and beadwork they laughed at his entrance and badinage which linked zarinska to him ran high but one after the other they were unceremoniously bundled into the outer snow whence they hurried to spread the tale through all the camp  his cause was well pleaded in her tongue for she did not know his and at the end of two hours he rose to go  so zarinska will come to the white mans lodge good i go now to have talk with thy father for he may not be so minded and i will give him many tokens but he must not ask too much if he say no good zarinska shall yet come to the white mans lodge  he had already lifted the skin flap to depart when a low exclamation brought him back to the girls side she brought herself to her knees on the bearskin mat her face aglow with true evelight and shyly unbuckled his heavy belt he looked down perplexed suspicious his ears alert for the slightest sound without  but her next move disarmed his doubt and he smiled with pleasure she took from her sewing bag a moosehide sheath brave with bright beadwork fantastically designed she drew his great huntingknife gazed reverently along the keen edge half tempted to try it with her thumb and shot it into place in its new home then she slipped the sheath along the belt to its customary restingplace just above the hip  for all the world it was like a scene of olden timea lady and her knight  mackenzie drew her up full height and swept her red lips with his moustache the to her foreign caress of the wolf it was a meeting of the stone age and the steel but she was none the less a woman as her crimson cheeks and the luminous softness of her eyes attested  there was a thrill of excitement in the air as scruff mackenzie a bulky bundle under his arm threw open the flap of thlingtinnehs tent children were running about in the open dragging dry wood to the scene of the potlach a babble of womens voices was growing in intensity the young men were consulting in sullen groups while from the shamans lodge rose the eerie sounds of an incantation  the chief was alone with his bleareyed wife but a glance sufficed to tell mackenzie that the news was already told so he plunged at once into the business shifting the beaded sheath prominently to the fore as advertisement of the betrothal  o thlingtinneh mighty chief of the sticks and the land of the tanana ruler of the salmon and the bear the moose and the cariboo the white man is before thee with a great purpose many moons has his lodge been empty and he is lonely and his heart has eaten itself in silence and grown hungry for a woman to sit beside him in his lodge to meet him from the hunt with warm fire and good food he has heard strange things the patter of baby moccasins and the sound of childrens voices and one night a vision came upon him and he beheld the raven who is thy father the great raven who is the father of all the sticks and the raven spake to the lonely white man saying bind thou thy moccasins upon thee and gird thy snowshoes on and lash thy sled with food for many sleeps and fine tokens for the chief thlingtinneh for thou shalt turn thy face to where the midspring sun is wont to sink below the land and journey to this great chiefs huntinggrounds there thou shalt make big presents and thlingtinneh who is my son shall become to thee as a father in his lodge there is a maiden into whom i breathed the breath of life for thee this maiden shalt thou take to wife o chief thus spake the great raven thus do i lay many presents at thy feet thus am i come to take thy daughter the old man drew his furs about him with crude consciousness of royalty but delayed reply while a youngster crept in delivered a quick message to appear before the council and was gone  o white man whom we have named moosekiller also known as the wolf and the son of the wolf we know thou comest of a mighty race we are proud to have thee our potlachguest but the kingsalmon does not mate with the dogsalmon nor the raven with the wolf not so cried mackenzie the daughters of the raven have i met in the camps of the wolfthe squaw of mortimer the squaw of tregidgo the squaw of barnaby who came two iceruns back and i have heard of other squaws though my eyes beheld them not son your words are true but it were evil mating like the water with the sand like the snowflake with the sun but met you one mason and his squaw no  he came ten iceruns agothe first of all the wolves and with him there was a mighty man straight as a willowshoot and tall strong as the baldfaced grizzly with a heart like the full summer moon his oh interrupted mackenzie recognizing the wellknown northland figure malemute kid the samea mighty man but saw you aught of the squaw she was full sister to zarinska nay chief but i have heard masonfar far to the north a sprucetree heavy with years crushed out his life beneath but his love was great and he had much gold with this and her boy she journeyed countless sleeps toward the winters noonday sun and there she yet livesno biting frost no snow no summers midnight sun no winters noonday night  a second messenger interrupted with imperative summons from the council  as mackenzie threw him into the snow he caught a glimpse of the swaying forms before the councilfire heard the deep basses of the men in rhythmic chant and knew the shaman was fanning the anger of his people time pressed he turned upon the chief  come i wish thy child and now see here are tobacco tea many cups of sugar warm blankets handkerchiefs both good and large and here a true rifle with many bullets and much powder nay replied the old man struggling against the great wealth spread before him even now are my people come together they will not have this marriage  but thou art chief yet do my young men rage because the wolves have taken their maidens so that they may not marry listen o thlingtinneh ere the night has passed into the day the wolf shall face his dogs to the mountains of the east and fare forth to the country of the yukon and zarinska shall break trail for his dogs and ere the night has gained its middle my young men may fling to the dogs the flesh of the wolf and his bones be scattered in the snow till the springtime lay them bare it was threat and counterthreat mackenzies bronzed face flushed darkly he raised his voice the old squaw who till now had sat an impassive spectator made to creep by him for the door  the song of the men broke suddenly and there was a hubbub of many voices as he whirled the old woman roughly to her couch of skins  again i crylisten o thlingtinneh the wolf dies with teeth fastlocked and with him there shall sleep ten of thy strongest menmen who are needed for the hunting is not begun and the fishing is not many moons away and again of what profit should i die i know the custom of thy people thy share of my wealth shall be very small grant me thy child and it shall all be thine and yet again my brothers will come and they are many and their maws are never filled and the daughters of the raven shall bear children in the lodges of the wolf my people are greater than thy people it is destiny grant and all this wealth is thine moccasins were crunching the snow without mackenzie threw his rifle to cock and loosened the twin colts in his belt  grant o chief and yet will my people say no grant and the wealth is thine then shall i deal with thy people after the wolf will have it so i will take his tokensbut i would warn him mackenzie passed over the goods taking care to clog the rifles ejector and capping the bargain with a kaleidoscopic silk kerchief the shaman and half a dozen young braves entered but he shouldered boldly among them and passed out  pack was his laconic greeting to zarinska as he passed her lodge and hurried to harness his dogs a few minutes later he swept into the council at the head of the team the woman by his side he took his place at the upper end of the oblong by the side of the chief to his left a step to the rear he stationed zarinska her proper place besides the time was ripe for mischief and there was need to guard his back  on either side the men crouched to the fire their voices lifted in a folkchant out of the forgotten past full of strange halting cadences and haunting recurrences it was not beautiful fearful may inadequately express it at the lower end under the eye of the shaman danced half a score of women stern were his reproofs of those who did not wholly abandon themselves to the ecstasy of the rite half hidden in their heavy masses of raven hair all dishevelled and falling to their waists they slowly swayed to and fro their forms rippling to an everchanging rhythm  it was a weird scene an anachronism to the south the nineteenth century was reeling off the few years of its last decade here flourished man primeval a shade removed from the prehistoric cavedweller forgotten fragment of the elder world the tawny wolfdogs sat between their skinclad masters or fought for room the firelight cast backward from their red eyes and dripping fangs the woods in ghostly shroud slept on unheeding  the white silence for the moment driven to the rimming forest seemed ever crushing inward the stars danced with great leaps as is their wont in the time of the great cold while the spirits of the pole trailed their robes of glory athwart the heavens  scruff mackenzie dimly realized the wild grandeur of the setting as his eyes ranged down the furfringed sides in quest of missing faces they rested for a moment on a newborn babe suckling at its mothers naked breast it was forty belowseven and odd degrees of frost he thought of the tender women of his own race and smiled grimly yet from the loins of some such tender woman had he sprung with a kingly inheritancean inheritance which gave to him and his dominance over the land and sea over the animals and the peoples of all the zones singlehanded against fivescore girt by the arctic winter far from his own he felt the prompting of his heritage the desire to possess the wild dangerlove the thrill of battle the power to conquer or to die  the singing and the dancing ceased and the shaman flared up in rude eloquence  through the sinuosities of their vast mythology he worked cunningly upon the credulity of his people the case was strong opposing the creative principles as embodied in the crow and the raven he stigmatized mackenzie as the wolf the fighting and the destructive principle not only was the combat of these forces spiritual but men fought each to his totem they were the children of jelchs the raven the promethean firebringer mackenzie was the child of the wolf or in other words the devil for them to bring a truce to this perpetual warfare to marry their daughters to the archenemy were treason and blasphemy of the highest order no phrase was harsh nor figure vile enough in branding mackenzie as a sneaking interloper and emissary of satan there was a subdued savage roar in the deep chests of his listeners as he took the swing of his peroration  aye my brothers jelchs is allpowerful did he not bring heavenborne fire that we might be warm did he not draw the sun moon and stars from their holes that we might see did he not teach us that we might fight the spirits of famine and of frost but now jelchs is angry with his children and they are grown to a handful and he will not help  for they have forgotten him and done evil things and trod bad trails and taken his enemies into their lodges to sit by their fires and the raven is sorrowful at the wickedness of his children but when they shall rise up and show they have come back he will come out of the darkness to aid them o brothers the firebringer has whispered messages to thy shaman the same shall ye hear let the young men take the young women to their lodges let them fly at the throat of the wolf let them be undying in their enmity then shall their women become fruitful and they shall multiply into a mighty people and the raven shall lead great tribes of their fathers and their fathers fathers from out of the north and they shall beat back the wolves till they are as last years campfires and they shall again come to rule over all the land tis the message of jelchs the raven this foreshadowing of the messiahs coming brought a hoarse howl from the sticks as they leaped to their feet mackenzie slipped the thumbs of his mittens and waited there was a clamor for the fox not to be stilled till one of the young men stepped forward to speak  brothers the shaman has spoken wisely the wolves have taken our women and our men are childless we are grown to a handful the wolves have taken our warm furs and given for them evil spirits which dwell in bottles and clothes which come not from the beaver or the lynx but are made from the grass  and they are not warm and our men die of strange sicknesses i the fox have taken no woman to wife and why twice have the maidens which pleased me gone to the camps of the wolf even now have i laid by skins of the beaver of the moose of the cariboo that i might win favor in the eyes of thlingtinneh that i might marry zarinska his daughter even now are her snowshoes bound to her feet ready to break trail for the dogs of the wolf nor do i speak for myself alone  as i have done so has the bear he too had fain been the father of her children and many skins has he cured thereto i speak for all the young men who know not wives the wolves are ever hungry always do they take the choice meat at the killing to the ravens are left the leavings  there is gugkla he cried brutally pointing out one of the women who was a cripple  her legs are bent like the ribs of a birch canoe she cannot gather wood nor carry the meat of the hunters did the wolves choose her ai ai vociferated his tribesmen  there is moyri whose eyes are crossed by the evil spirit even the babes are affrighted when they gaze upon her and it is said the baldface gives her the trail  was she chosen again the cruel applause rang out  and there sits pischet she does not hearken to my words never has she heard the cry of the chitchat the voice of her husband the babble of her child  she lives in the white silence cared the wolves aught for her no theirs is the choice of the kill ours is the leavings  brothers it shall not be no more shall the wolves slink among our campfires the time is come a great streamer of fire the aurora borealis purple green and yellow shot across the zenith bridging horizon to horizon with head thrown back and arms extended he swayed to his climax  behold the spirits of our fathers have arisen and great deeds are afoot this night he stepped back and another young man somewhat diffidently came forward pushed on by his comrades he towered a full head above them his broad chest defiantly bared to the frost he swung tentatively from one foot to the other  words halted upon his tongue and he was ill at ease his face was horrible to look upon for it had at one time been half torn away by some terrific blow at last he struck his breast with his clenched fist drawing sound as from a drum and his voice rumbled forth as does the surf from an ocean cavern  i am the bearthe silvertip and the son of the silvertip when my voice was yet as a girls i slew the lynx the moose and the cariboo when it whistled like the wolverines from under a cache i crossed the mountains of the south and slew three of the white rivers when it became as the roar of the chinook i met the baldfaced grizzly but gave no trail at this he paused his hand significantly sweeping across his hideous scars  i am not as the fox my tongue is frozen like the river i cannot make great talk my words are few the fox says great deeds are afoot this night good talk flows from his tongue like the freshets of the spring but he is chary of deeds  this night shall i do battle with the wolf i shall slay him and zarinska shall sit by my fire the bear has spoken though pandemonium raged about him scruff mackenzie held his ground  aware how useless was the rifle at close quarters he slipped both holsters to the fore ready for action and drew his mittens till his hands were barely shielded by the elbow gauntlets he knew there was no hope in attack en masse but true to his boast was prepared to die with teeth fastlocked but the bear restrained his comrades beating back the more impetuous with his terrible fist as the tumult began to die away mackenzie shot a glance in the direction of zarinska it was a superb picture she was leaning forward on her snowshoes lips apart and nostrils quivering like a tigress about to spring her great black eyes were fixed upon her tribesmen in fear and defiance so extreme the tension she had forgotten to breathe with one hand pressed spasmodically against her breast and the other as tightly gripped about the dogwhip she was as turned to stone even as he looked relief came to her her muscles loosened with a heavy sigh she settled back giving him a look of more than loveof worship  thlingtinneh was trying to speak but his people drowned his voice then mackenzie strode forward the fox opened his mouth to a piercing yell but so savagely did mackenzie whirl upon him that he shrank back his larynx all agurgle with suppressed sound his discomfiture was greeted with roars of laughter and served to soothe his fellows to a listening mood  brothers the white man whom ye have chosen to call the wolf came among you with fair words he was not like the innuit he spoke not lies he came as a friend as one who would be a brother but your men have had their say and the time for soft words is past  first i will tell you that the shaman has an evil tongue and is a false prophet that the messages he spake are not those of the firebringer his ears are locked to the voice of the raven and out of his own head he weaves cunning fancies and he has made fools of you he has no power  when the dogs were killed and eaten and your stomachs were heavy with untanned hide and strips of moccasins when the old men died and the old women died and the babes at the dry dugs of the mothers died when the land was dark and ye perished as do the salmon in the fall aye when the famine was upon you did the shaman bring reward to your hunters did the shaman put meat in your bellies again i say the shaman is without power thus i spit upon his face though taken aback by the sacrilege there was no uproar some of the women were even frightened but among the men there was an uplifting as though in preparation or anticipation of the miracle all eyes were turned upon the two central figures the priest realized the crucial moment felt his power tottering opened his mouth in denunciation but fled backward before the truculent advance upraised fist and flashing eyes of mackenzie he sneered and resumed  was i stricken dead did the lightning burn me did the stars fall from the sky and crush me pish i have done with the dog now will i tell you of my people who are the mightiest of all the peoples who rule in all the lands at first we hunt as i hunt alone  after that we hunt in packs and at last like the cariboorun we sweep across all the land  those whom we take into our lodges live those who will not come die zarinska is a comely maiden full and strong fit to become the mother of wolves though i die such shall she become for my brothers are many and they will follow the scent of my dogs  listen to the law of the wolf whoso taketh the life of one wolf the forfeit shall ten of his people pay in many lands has the price been paid in many lands shall it yet be paid  now will i deal with the fox and the bear it seems they have cast eyes upon the maiden so behold i have bought her thlingtinneh leans upon the rifle the goods of purchase are by his fire yet will i be fair to the young men to the fox whose tongue is dry with many words will i give of tobacco five long plugs  thus will his mouth be wetted that he may make much noise in the council but to the bear of whom i am well proud will i give of blankets two of flour twenty cups of tobacco double that of the fox and if he fare with me over the mountains of the east then will i give him a rifle mate to thlingtinnehs if not good the wolf is weary of speech yet once again will he say the law whoso taketh the life of one wolf the forfeit shall ten of his people pay  mackenzie smiled as he stepped back to his old position but at heart he was full of trouble the night was yet dark the girl came to his side and he listened closely as she told of the bears battletricks with the knife  the decision was for war in a trice scores of moccasins were widening the space of beaten snow by the fire there was much chatter about the seeming defeat of the shaman some averred he had but withheld his power while others conned past events and agreed with the wolf the bear came to the center of the battleground a long naked huntingknife of russian make in his hand the fox called attention to mackenzies revolvers so he stripped his belt buckling it about zarinska into whose hands he also entrusted his rifle she shook her head that she could not shootsmall chance had a woman to handle such precious things  then if danger come by my back cry aloud my husband no thus my husband  he laughed as she repeated it pinched her cheek and reentered the circle not only in reach and stature had the bear the advantage of him but his blade was longer by a good two inches scruff mackenzie had looked into the eyes of men before and he knew it was a man who stood against him yet he quickened to the glint of light on the steel to the dominant pulse of his race  time and again he was forced to the edge of the fire or the deep snow and time and again with the foot tactics of the pugilist he worked back to the center  not a voice was lifted in encouragement while his antagonist was heartened with applause suggestions and warnings but his teeth only shut the tighter as the knives clashed together and he thrust or eluded with a coolness born of conscious strength at first he felt compassion for his enemy but this fled before the primal instinct of life which in turn gave way to the lust of slaughter the ten thousand years of culture fell from him and he was a cavedweller doing battle for his female  twice he pricked the bear getting away unscathed but the third time caught and to save himself free hands closed on fighting hands and they came together  then did he realize the tremendous strength of his opponent his muscles were knotted in painful lumps and cords and tendons threatened to snap with the strain yet nearer and nearer came the russian steel he tried to break away but only weakened himself the furclad circle closed in certain of and anxious to see the final stroke but with wrestlers trick swinging partly to the side he struck at his adversary with his head involuntarily the bear leaned back disturbing his center of gravity simultaneous with this mackenzie tripped properly and threw his whole weight forward hurling him clear through the circle into the deep snow the bear floundered out and came back full tilt  o my husband zarinskas voice rang out vibrant with danger  to the twang of a bowstring mackenzie swept low to the ground and a bonebarbed arrow passed over him into the breast of the bear whose momentum carried him over his crouching foe the next instant mackenzie was up and about the bear lay motionless but across the fire was the shaman drawing a second arrow mackenzies knife leaped short in the air he caught the heavy blade by the point there was a flash of light as it spanned the fire then the shaman the hilt alone appearing without his throat swayed and pitched forward into the glowing embers  click clickthe fox had possessed himself of thlingtinnehs rifle and was vainly trying to throw a shell into place but he dropped it at the sound of mackenzies laughter  so the fox has not learned the way of the plaything he is yet a woman  come bring it that i may show thee the fox hesitated  come i say he slouched forward like a beaten cur  thus and thus so the thing is done a shell flew into place and the trigger was at cock as mackenzie brought it to shoulder  the fox has said great deeds were afoot this night and he spoke true there have been great deeds yet least among them were those of the fox is he still intent to take zarinska to his lodge is he minded to tread the trail already broken by the shaman and the bear  no good  mackenzie turned contemptuously and drew his knife from the priests throat  are any of the young men so minded if so the wolf will take them by two and three till none are left no good thlingtinneh i now give thee this rifle a second time if in the days to come thou shouldst journey to the country of the yukon know thou that there shall always be a place and much food by the fire of the wolf the night is now passing into the day i go but i may come again and for the last time remember the law of the wolf he was supernatural in their sight as he rejoined zarinska she took her place at the head of the team and the dogs swung into motion a few moments later they were swallowed up by the ghostly forest till now mackenzie had waited he slipped into his snowshoes to follow  has the wolf forgotten the five long plugs mackenzie turned upon the fox angrily then the humor of it struck him  i will give thee one short plug as the wolf sees fit meekly responded the fox stretching out his hand    the men of forty mile  when big jim belden ventured the apparently innocuous proposition that mushice was rather pecooliar he little dreamed of what it would lead to  neither did lon mcfane when he affirmed that anchorice was even more so nor did bettles as he instantly disagreed declaring the very existence of such a form to be a bugaboo  an yed be tellin me this cried lon after the years yeve spint in the land an we atin out the same pot this manys the day but the things agin reasin insisted bettles  look you waters warmer than ice an little the difference once ye break through  still its warmer because it aint froze an you say it freezes on the bottom only the anchorice david only the anchorice an have ye niver drifted along the water clear as glass whin suddin belike a cloud over the sun the mushyice comes bubblin up an up till from bank to bank an bind to bind its drapin the river like a first snowfall unh hunh moren once when i took a doze at the steeringoar but it allus come out the nighest sidechannel an not bubblin up an up but with niver a wink at the helm  no nor you its agin reason ill leave it to any man bettles appealed to the circle about the stove but the fight was on between himself and lon mcfane  reason or no reason its the truth im tellin ye last fall a year gone twas sitka charley and meself saw the sight droppin down the riffle yell remember below fort reliance an regular fall weather it wasthe glint o the sun on the golden larch an the quakin aspens an the glister of light on ivery ripple an beyand the winter an the blue haze of the north comin down hand in hand its well ye know the same with a fringe to the river an the ice formin thick in the eddiesan a snap an sparkle to the air an ye afeelin it through all yer blood atakin new lease of life with ivery suck of it tis then me boy the world grows small an the wandtherlust lays ye by the heels  but its meself as wandthers as i was sayin we apaddlin with niver a sign of ice barrin that by the eddies when the injun lifts his paddle an sings out lon mcfane look ye below so have i heard but niver thought to see as ye know sitka charley like meself niver drew first breath in the land so the sight was new then we drifted with a head over ayther side peerin down through the sparkly water for the world like the days i spint with the pearlers watchin the coral banks agrowin the same as so many gardens under the sea there it was the anchorice clingin an clusterin to ivery rock after the manner of the white coral  but the best of the sight was to come just after clearin the tail of the riffle the water turns quick the color of milk an the top of it in wee circles as when the graylin rise in the spring or theres a splatter of wet from the sky twas the anchorice comin up to the right to the lift as far as iver a man cud see the water was covered with the same  an like so much porridge it was slickin along the bark of the canoe stickin like glue to the paddles its manys the time i shot the selfsame riffle before and its manys the time after but niver a wink of the same have i seen twas the sight of a lifetime do tell dryly commented bettles dye think id blieve such a yarn id ruther say the glister of lightd gone to your eyes and the snap of the air to your tongue twas me own eyes that beheld it an if sitka charley was here hed be the lad to back me but facts is facts an they aint no gettin round em it aint in the nature of things for the water furtherest away from the air to freeze first but me own eyes dont git het up over it admonished bettles as the quick celtic anger began to mount  then yer not after belavin me sence youre so blamed forehanded about it no id blieve nature first and facts  is it the lie yed be givin me threatened lon yed better be askin that siwash wife of yours ill lave it to her for the truth i spake bettles flared up in sudden wrath the irishman had unwittingly wounded him for his wife was the halfbreed daughter of a russian furtrader married to him in the greek mission of nulato a thousand miles or so down the yukon thus being of much higher caste than the common siwash or native wife it was a mere northland nuance which none but the northland adventurer may understand  i reckon you kin take it that way was his deliberate affirmation  the next instant lon mcfane had stretched him on the floor the circle was broken up and half a dozen men had stepped between  bettles came to his feet wiping the blood from his mouth it haint new this takin and payin of blows and dont you never think but that this will be squared an niver in me life did i take the lie from mortal man was the retort courteous an its an avil day ill not be to hand waitin an willin to help ye lift yer debts barrin no manner of way  still got that 3855 lon nodded  but youd better git a more likely caliber minell rip holes through you the size of walnuts  niver fear its me own slugs smell their way with soft noses an theyll spread like flapjacks against the coming out beyand an whenll i have the pleasure of waitin on ye the waterholes a strikin locality taint bad jest be there in an hour and you wont set long on my coming both men mittened and left the post their ears closed to the remonstrances of their comrades it was such a little thing yet with such men little things nourished by quick tempers and stubborn natures soon blossomed into big things  besides the art of burning to bedrock still lay in the womb of the future and the men of fortymile shut in by the long arctic winter grew highstomached with overeating and enforced idleness and became as irritable as do the bees in the fall of the year when the hives are overstocked with honey  there was no law in the land the mounted police was also a thing of the future each man measured an offense and meted out the punishment inasmuch as it affected himself  rarely had combined action been necessary and never in all the dreary history of the camp had the eighth article of the decalogue been violated  big jim belden called an impromptu meeting scruff mackenzie was placed as temporary chairman and a messenger dispatched to solicit father roubeaus good offices their position was paradoxical and they knew it by the right of might could they interfere to prevent the duel yet such action while in direct line with their wishes went counter to their opinions while their roughhewn obsolete ethics recognized the individual prerogative of wiping out blow with blow they could not bear to think of two good comrades such as bettles and mcfane meeting in deadly battle deeming the man who would not fight on provocation a dastard when brought to the test it seemed wrong that he should fight  but a scurry of moccasins and loud cries rounded off with a pistolshot interrupted the discussion then the stormdoors opened and malemute kid entered a smoking colts in his hand and a merry light in his eye  i got him he replaced the empty shell and added your dog scruff yellow fang  mackenzie asked  no the lopeared one the devil nothing the matter with him come out and take a look thats all right after all buess hes got em too yellow fang came back this morning and took a chunk out of him and came near to making a widower of me made a rush for zarinska but she whisked her skirts in his face and escaped with the loss of the same and a good roll in the snow then he took to the woods again hope he dont come back lost any yourself onethe best one of the packshookum started amuck this morning but didnt get very far ran foul of sitka charleys team and they scattered him all over the street and now two of them are loose and raging mad so you see he got his work in the dog census will be small in the spring if we dont do something  and the man census too hows that whos in trouble now oh bettles and lon mcfane had an argument and theyll be down by the waterhole in a few minutes to settle it the incident was repeated for his benefit and malemute kid accustomed to an obedience which his fellow men never failed to render took charge of the affair his quickly formulated plan was explained and they promised to follow his lead implicitly  so you see he concluded we do not actually take away their privilege of fighting and yet i dont believe theyll fight when they see the beauty of the scheme lifes a game and men the gamblers theyll stake their whole pile on the one chance in a thousand  take away that one chance andthey wont play he turned to the man in charge of the post storekeeper weight out three fathoms of your best halfinch manila  well establish a precedent which will last the men of fortymile to the end of time he prophesied then he coiled the rope about his arm and led his followers out of doors just in time to meet the principals  what danged rightd he to fetch my wife in thundered bettles to the soothing overtures of a friend twant called for he concluded decisively twant called for he reiterated again and again pacing up and down and waiting for lon mcfane  and lon mcfanehis face was hot and tongue rapid as he flaunted insurrection in the face of the church then father he cried its with an aisy heart ill roll in me flamy blankets the broad of me back on a bed of coals niver shall it be said that lon mcfane took a lie twixt the teeth without iver liftin a hand an ill not ask a blessin the years have been wild but its the heart was in the right place but its not the heart lon interposed father roubeau its pride that bids you forth to slay your fellow man yer frinch lon replied and then turning to leave him an will ye say a mass if the luck is against me but the priest smiled thrust his moccasined feet to the fore and went out upon the white breast of the silent river a packed trail the width of a sixteeninch sled led out to the waterhole on either side lay the deep soft snow the men trod in single file without conversation and the blackstoled priest in their midst gave to the function the solemn aspect of a funeral it was a warm winters day for fortymilea day in which the sky filled with heaviness drew closer to the earth and the mercury sought the unwonted level of twenty below but there was no cheer in the warmth there was little air in the upper strata and the clouds hung motionless giving sullen promise of an early snowfall and the earth unresponsive made no preparation content in its hibernation  when the waterhole was reached bettles having evidently reviewed the quarrel during the silent walk burst out in a final twant called for while lon mcfane kept grim silence indignation so choked him that he could not speak  yet deep down whenever their own wrongs were not uppermost both men wondered at their comrades they had expected opposition and this tacit acquiescence hurt them it seemed more was due them from the men they had been so close with and they felt a vague sense of wrong rebelling at the thought of so many of their brothers coming out as on a gala occasion without one word of protest to see them shoot each other down it appeared their worth had diminished in the eyes of the community the proceedings puzzled them  back to back david an will it be fifty paces to the man or double the quantity  fifty was the sanguinary reply grunted out yet sharply cut  but the new manila not prominently displayed but casually coiled about malemute kids arm caught the quick eye of the irishman and thrilled him with a suspicious fear  an what are ye doin with the rope hurry up malemute kid glanced at his watch  ive a batch of bread in the cabin and i dont want it to fall besides my feet are getting cold the rest of the men manifested their impatience in various suggestive ways  but the rope kid its bran new an sure yer breads not that heavy it needs raisin with the like of that bettles by this time had faced around father roubeau the humor of the situation just dawning on him hid a smile behind his mittened hand  no lon this rope was made for a man malemute kid could be very impressive on occasion  what man bettles was becoming aware of a personal interest  the other man an which is the one yed mane by that listen lonand you too bettles weve been talking this little trouble of yours over and weve come to one conclusion we know we have no right to stop your fighting true for ye me lad and were not going to but this much we can do and shall domake this the only duel in the history of fortymile set an example for every chechaqua that comes up or down the yukon the man who escapes killing shall be hanged to the nearest tree now go ahead  lon smiled dubiously then his face lighted up pace her off davidfifty paces wheel an niver a cease firin till a lads down for good tis their heartsll niver let them do the deed an its well ye should know it for a true yankee bluff  he started off with a pleased grin on his face but malemute kid halted him  lon its a long while since you first knew me manys the day and you bettles  five year next june high water and have you once in all that time known me to break my word or heard of me breaking it both men shook their heads striving to fathom what lay beyond  well then what do you think of a promise made by me as good as your bond from bettles  the thing to safely sling yer hopes of heaven by promptly endorsed lon mcfane  listen i malemute kid give you my wordand you know what that means that the man who is not shot stretches rope within ten minutes after the shooting he stepped back as pilate might have done after washing his hands  a pause and a silence came over the men of fortymile the sky drew still closer sending down a crystal flight of frostlittle geometric designs perfect evanescent as a breath yet destined to exist till the returning sun had covered half its northern journey  both men had led forlorn hopes in their timeled with a curse or a jest on their tongues and in their souls an unswerving faith in the god of chance but that merciful deity had been shut out from the present deal they studied the face of malemute kid but they studied as one might the sphinx as the quiet minutes passed a feeling that speech was incumbent on them began to grow at last the howl of a wolfdog cracked the silence from the direction of fortymile the weird sound swelled with all the pathos of a breaking heart then died away in a longdrawn sob  well i be danged bettles turned up the collar of his mackinaw jacket and stared about him helplessly  its a gloryus game yer runnin kid cried lon mcfane all the percentage of the house an niver a bit to the man thats buckin the devil himselfd niver tackle such a cinchand damned if i do there were chuckles throttled in gurgling throats and winks brushed away with the frost which rimed the eyelashes as the men climbed the icenotched bank and started across the street to the post but the long howl had drawn nearer invested with a new note of menace a woman screamed round the corner there was a cry of here he comes then an indian boy at the head of half a dozen frightened dogs racing with death dashed into the crowd and behind came yellow fang a bristle of hair and a flash of gray everybody but the yankee fled  the indian boy had tripped and fallen bettles stopped long enough to grip him by the slack of his furs then headed for a pile of cordwood already occupied by a number of his comrades yellow fang doubling after one of the dogs came leaping back the fleeing animal free of the rabies but crazed with fright whipped bettles off his feet and flashed on up the street malemute kid took a flying shot at yellow fang the mad dog whirled a half airspring came down on his back then with a single leap covered half the distance between himself and bettles  but the fatal spring was intercepted lon mcfane leaped from the woodpile countering him in midair over they rolled lon holding him by the throat at arms length blinking under the fetid slaver which sprayed his face then bettles revolver in hand and coolly waiting a chance settled the combat  twas a square game kid lon remarked rising to his feet and shaking the snow from out his sleeves with a fair percentage to meself that bucked it that night while lon mcfane sought the forgiving arms of the church in the direction of father roubeaus cabin malemute kid talked long to little purpose  but would you persisted mackenzie supposing they had fought have i ever broken my word no but that isnt the point answer the question would you malemute kid straightened up scruff ive been asking myself that question ever since and  well  well as yet i havent found the answer    in a far country  when a man journeys into a far country he must be prepared to forget many of the things he has learned and to acquire such customs as are inherent with existence in the new land he must abandon the old ideals and the old gods and oftentimes he must reverse the very codes by which his conduct has hitherto been shaped to those who have the protean faculty of adaptability the novelty of such change may even be a source of pleasure but to those who happen to be hardened to the ruts in which they were created the pressure of the altered environment is unbearable and they chafe in body and in spirit under the new restrictions which they do not understand this chafing is bound to act and react producing divers evils and leading to various misfortunes it were better for the man who cannot fit himself to the new groove to return to his own country if he delay too long he will surely die  the man who turns his back upon the comforts of an elder civilization to face the savage youth the primordial simplicity of the north may estimate success at an inverse ratio to the quantity and quality of his hopelessly fixed habits he will soon discover if he be a fit candidate that the material habits are the less important the exchange of such things as a dainty menu for rough fare of the stiff leather shoe for the soft shapeless moccasin of the feather bed for a couch in the snow is after all a very easy matter but his pinch will come in learning properly to shape his minds attitude toward all things and especially toward his fellow man for the courtesies of ordinary life he must substitute unselfishness forbearance and tolerance thus and thus only can he gain that pearl of great pricetrue comradeship he must not say thank you he must mean it without opening his mouth and prove it by responding in kind in short he must substitute the deed for the word the spirit for the letter  when the world rang with the tale of arctic gold and the lure of the north gripped the heartstrings of men carter weatherbee threw up his snug clerkship turned the half of his savings over to his wife and with the remainder bought an outfit there was no romance in his naturethe bondage of commerce had crushed all that he was simply tired of the ceaseless grind and wished to risk great hazards in view of corresponding returns like many another fool disdaining the old trails used by the northland pioneers for a score of years he hurried to edmonton in the spring of the year and there unluckily for his souls welfare he allied himself with a party of men  there was nothing unusual about this party except its plans even its goal like that of all the other parties was the klondike but the route it had mapped out to attain that goal took away the breath of the hardiest native born and bred to the vicissitudes of the northwest even jacques baptiste born of a chippewa woman and a renegade voyageur having raised his first whimpers in a deerskin lodge north of the sixtyfifth parallel and had the same hushed by blissful sucks of raw tallow was surprised though he sold his services to them and agreed to travel even to the neveropening ice he shook his head ominously whenever his advice was asked  percy cuthferts evil star must have been in the ascendant for he too joined this company of argonauts he was an ordinary man with a bank account as deep as his culture which is saying a good deal he had no reason to embark on such a ventureno reason in the world save that he suffered from an abnormal development of sentimentality he mistook this for the true spirit of romance and adventure many another man has done the like and made as fatal a mistake  the first breakup of spring found the party following the icerun of elk river it was an imposing fleet for the outfit was large and they were accompanied by a disreputable contingent of halfbreed voyageurs with their women and children day in and day out they labored with the bateaux and canoes fought mosquitoes and other kindred pests or sweated and swore at the portages severe toil like this lays a man naked to the very roots of his soul and ere lake athabasca was lost in the south each member of the party had hoisted his true colors  the two shirks and chronic grumblers were carter weatherbee and percy cuthfert the whole party complained less of its aches and pains than did either of them not once did they volunteer for the thousand and one petty duties of the camp a bucket of water to be brought an extra armful of wood to be chopped the dishes to be washed and wiped a search to be made through the outfit for some suddenly indispensable articleand these two effete scions of civilization discovered sprains or blisters requiring instant attention  they were the first to turn in at night with score of tasks yet undone the last to turn out in the morning when the start should be in readiness before the breakfast was begun  they were the first to fall to at mealtime the last to have a hand in the cooking the first to dive for a slim delicacy the last to discover they had added to their own another mans share if they toiled at the oars they slyly cut the water at each stroke and allowed the boats momentum to float up the blade they thought nobody noticed but their comrades swore under their breaths and grew to hate them while jacques baptiste sneered openly and damned them from morning till night but jacques baptiste was no gentleman  at the great slave hudson bay dogs were purchased and the fleet sank to the guards with its added burden of dried fish and pemican then canoe and bateau answered to the swift current of the mackenzie and they plunged into the great barren ground every likelylooking feeder was prospected but the elusive paydirt danced ever to the north at the great bear overcome by the common dread of the unknown lands their voyageurs began to desert and fort of good hope saw the last and bravest bending to the towlines as they bucked the current down which they had so treacherously glided  jacques baptiste alone remained had he not sworn to travel even to the neveropening ice the lying charts compiled in main from hearsay were now constantly consulted  and they felt the need of hurry for the sun had already passed its northern solstice and was leading the winter south again skirting the shores of the bay where the mackenzie disembogues into the arctic ocean they entered the mouth of the little peel river then began the arduous upstream toil and the two incapables fared worse than ever towline and pole paddle and tumpline rapids and portagessuch tortures served to give the one a deep disgust for great hazards and printed for the other a fiery text on the true romance of adventure one day they waxed mutinous and being vilely cursed by jacques baptiste turned as worms sometimes will but the halfbreed thrashed the twain and sent them bruised and bleeding about their work it was the first time either had been manhandled  abandoning their river craft at the headwaters of the little peel they consumed the rest of the summer in the great portage over the mackenzie watershed to the west rat this little stream fed the porcupine which in turn joined the yukon where that mighty highway of the north countermarches on the arctic circle  but they had lost in the race with winter and one day they tied their rafts to the thick eddyice and hurried their goods ashore that night the river jammed and broke several times the following morning it had fallen asleep for good we cant be moren four hundred miles from the yukon concluded sloper multiplying his thumb nails by the scale of the map the council in which the two incapables had whined to excellent disadvantage was drawing to a close  hudson bay post long time ago no use um now jacques baptistes father had made the trip for the fur company in the old days incidentally marking the trail with a couple of frozen toes  sufferin cracky cried another of the party no whites nary white sloper sententiously affirmed but its only five hundred more up the yukon to dawson call it a rough thousand from here weatherbee and cuthfert groaned in chorus  how longll that take baptiste the halfbreed figured for a moment workum like hell no man play out tentwentyfortyfifty days um babies come designating the incapables no can tell mebbe when hell freeze over mebbe not then the manufacture of snowshoes and moccasins ceased somebody called the name of an absent member who came out of an ancient cabin at the edge of the campfire and joined them the cabin was one of the many mysteries which lurk in the vast recesses of the north built when and by whom no man could tell  two graves in the open piled high with stones perhaps contained the secret of those early wanderers but whose hand had piled the stones the moment had come jacques baptiste paused in the fitting of a harness and pinned the struggling dog in the snow the cook made mute protest for delay threw a handful of bacon into a noisy pot of beans then came to attention sloper rose to his feet his body was a ludicrous contrast to the healthy physiques of the incapables yellow and weak fleeing from a south american feverhole he had not broken his flight across the zones and was still able to toil with men his weight was probably ninety pounds with the heavy hunting knife thrown in and his grizzled hair told of a prime which had ceased to be the fresh young muscles of either weatherbee or cuthfert were equal to ten times the endeavor of his yet he could walk them into the earth in a days journey and all this day he had whipped his stronger comrades into venturing a thousand miles of the stiffest hardship man can conceive he was the incarnation of the unrest of his race and the old teutonic stubbornness dashed with the quick grasp and action of the yankee held the flesh in the bondage of the spirit  all those in favor of going on with the dogs as soon as the ice sets say ay ay rang out eight voicesvoices destined to string a trail of oaths along many a hundred miles of pain  contrary minded no for the first time the incapables were united without some compromise of personal interests  and what are you going to do about it weatherbee added belligerently  majority rule majority rule clamored the rest of the party  i know the expedition is liable to fall through if you dont come sloper replied sweetly but i guess if we try real hard we can manage to do without you  what do you say boys the sentiment was cheered to the echo  but i say you know cuthfert ventured apprehensively whats a chap like me to do  aint you coming with us noo then do as you damn well please we wont have nothing to say kind o calkilate yuh might settle it with that canoodlin pardner of yourn suggested a heavygoing westerner from the dakotas at the same time pointing out weatherbee hell be shore to ask yuh what yur agoin to do when it comes to cookin an gatherin the wood then well consider it all arranged concluded sloper  well pull out tomorrow if we camp within five milesjust to get everything in running order and remember if weve forgotten anything the sleds groaned by on their steelshod runners and the dogs strained low in the harnesses in which they were born to die  jacques baptiste paused by the side of sloper to get a last glimpse of the cabin the smoke curled up pathetically from the yukon stovepipe the two incapables were watching them from the doorway  sloper laid his hand on the others shoulder  jacques baptiste did you ever hear of the kilkenny cats the halfbreed shook his head  well my friend and good comrade the kilkenny cats fought till neither hide nor hair nor yowl was left you understandtill nothing was left very good  now these two men dont like work theyll be all alone in that cabin all wintera mighty long dark winter kilkenny catswell the frenchman in baptiste shrugged his shoulders but the indian in him was silent nevertheless it was an eloquent shrug pregnant with prophecy things prospered in the little cabin at first the rough badinage of their comrades had made weatherbee and cuthfert conscious of the mutual responsibility which had devolved upon them besides there was not so much work after all for two healthy men and the removal of the cruel whiphand or in other words the bulldozing halfbreed had brought with it a joyous reaction at first each strove to outdo the other and they performed petty tasks with an unction which would have opened the eyes of their comrades who were now wearing out bodies and souls on the long trail  all care was banished the forest which shouldered in upon them from three sides was an inexhaustible woodyard a few yards from their door slept the porcupine and a hole through its winter robe formed a bubbling spring of water crystal clear and painfully cold but they soon grew to find fault with even that the hole would persist in freezing up and thus gave them many a miserable hour of icechopping the unknown builders of the cabin had extended the sidelogs so as to support a cache at the rear in this was stored the bulk of the partys provisions  food there was without stint for three times the men who were fated to live upon it but the most of it was the kind which built up brawn and sinew but did not tickle the palate  true there was sugar in plenty for two ordinary men but these two were little else than children they early discovered the virtues of hot water judiciously saturated with sugar and they prodigally swam their flapjacks and soaked their crusts in the rich white syrup  then coffee and tea and especially the dried fruits made disastrous inroads upon it the first words they had were over the sugar question and it is a really serious thing when two men wholly dependent upon each other for company begin to quarrel  weatherbee loved to discourse blatantly on politics while cuthfert who had been prone to clip his coupons and let the commonwealth jog on as best it might either ignored the subject or delivered himself of startling epigrams but the clerk was too obtuse to appreciate the clever shaping of thought and this waste of ammunition irritated cuthfert  he had been used to blinding people by his brilliancy and it worked him quite a hardship this loss of an audience he felt personally aggrieved and unconsciously held his muttonhead companion responsible for it  save existence they had nothing in commoncame in touch on no single point  weatherbee was a clerk who had known naught but clerking all his life cuthfert was a master of arts a dabbler in oils and had written not a little the one was a lowerclass man who considered himself a gentleman and the other was a gentleman who knew himself to be such from this it may be remarked that a man can be a gentleman without possessing the first instinct of true comradeship the clerk was as sensuous as the other was aesthetic and his love adventures told at great length and chiefly coined from his imagination affected the supersensitive master of arts in the same way as so many whiffs of sewer gas he deemed the clerk a filthy uncultured brute whose place was in the muck with the swine and told him so and he was reciprocally informed that he was a milkandwater sissy and a cad weatherbee could not have defined cad for his life but it satisfied its purpose which after all seems the main point in life  weatherbee flatted every third note and sang such songs as the boston burglar and the handsome cabin boy for hours at a time while cuthfert wept with rage till he could stand it no longer and fled into the outer cold but there was no escape the intense frost could not be endured for long at a time and the little cabin crowded thembeds stove table and allinto a space of ten by twelve the very presence of either became a personal affront to the other and they lapsed into sullen silences which increased in length and strength as the days went by occasionally the flash of an eye or the curl of a lip got the better of them though they strove to wholly ignore each other during these mute periods  and a great wonder sprang up in the breast of each as to how god had ever come to create the other  with little to do time became an intolerable burden to them this naturally made them still lazier they sank into a physical lethargy which there was no escaping and which made them rebel at the performance of the smallest chore one morning when it was his turn to cook the common breakfast weatherbee rolled out of his blankets and to the snoring of his companion lighted first the slush lamp and then the fire the kettles were frozen hard and there was no water in the cabin with which to wash but he did not mind that waiting for it to thaw he sliced the bacon and plunged into the hateful task of breadmaking cuthfert had been slyly watching through his halfclosed lids  consequently there was a scene in which they fervently blessed each other and agreed henceforth that each do his own cooking a week later cuthfert neglected his morning ablutions but none the less complacently ate the meal which he had cooked weatherbee grinned after that the foolish custom of washing passed out of their lives  as the sugarpile and other little luxuries dwindled they began to be afraid they were not getting their proper shares and in order that they might not be robbed they fell to gorging themselves the luxuries suffered in this gluttonous contest as did also the men  in the absence of fresh vegetables and exercise their blood became impoverished and a loathsome purplish rash crept over their bodies yet they refused to heed the warning  next their muscles and joints began to swell the flesh turning black while their mouths gums and lips took on the color of rich cream instead of being drawn together by their misery each gloated over the others symptoms as the scurvy took its course  they lost all regard for personal appearance and for that matter common decency the cabin became a pigpen and never once were the beds made or fresh pine boughs laid underneath yet they could not keep to their blankets as they would have wished for the frost was inexorable and the fire box consumed much fuel the hair of their heads and faces grew long and shaggy while their garments would have disgusted a ragpicker but they did not care they were sick and there was no one to see besides it was very painful to move about  to all this was added a new troublethe fear of the north this fear was the joint child of the great cold and the great silence and was born in the darkness of december when the sun dipped below the horizon for good it affected them according to their natures  weatherbee fell prey to the grosser superstitions and did his best to resurrect the spirits which slept in the forgotten graves it was a fascinating thing and in his dreams they came to him from out of the cold and snuggled into his blankets and told him of their toils and troubles ere they died he shrank away from the clammy contact as they drew closer and twined their frozen limbs about him and when they whispered in his ear of things to come the cabin rang with his frightened shrieks cuthfert did not understandfor they no longer spokeand when thus awakened he invariably grabbed for his revolver then he would sit up in bed shivering nervously with the weapon trained on the unconscious dreamer cuthfert deemed the man going mad and so came to fear for his life  his own malady assumed a less concrete form the mysterious artisan who had laid the cabin log by log had pegged a windvane to the ridgepole cuthfert noticed it always pointed south and one day irritated by its steadfastness of purpose he turned it toward the east he watched eagerly but never a breath came by to disturb it then he turned the vane to the north swearing never again to touch it till the wind did blow but the air frightened him with its unearthly calm and he often rose in the middle of the night to see if the vane had veeredten degrees would have satisfied him but no it poised above him as unchangeable as fate  his imagination ran riot till it became to him a fetish sometimes he followed the path it pointed across the dismal dominions and allowed his soul to become saturated with the fear he dwelt upon the unseen and the unknown till the burden of eternity appeared to be crushing him everything in the northland had that crushing effectthe absence of life and motion the darkness the infinite peace of the brooding land the ghastly silence which made the echo of each heartbeat a sacrilege the solemn forest which seemed to guard an awful inexpressible something which neither word nor thought could compass  the world he had so recently left with its busy nations and great enterprises seemed very far away recollections occasionally obtrudedrecollections of marts and galleries and crowded thoroughfares of evening dress and social functions of good men and dear women he had knownbut they were dim memories of a life he had lived long centuries agone on some other planet this phantasm was the reality standing beneath the windvane his eyes fixed on the polar skies he could not bring himself to realize that the southland really existed that at that very moment it was aroar with life and action  there was no southland no men being born of women no giving and taking in marriage  beyond his bleak skyline there stretched vast solitudes and beyond these still vaster solitudes  there were no lands of sunshine heavy with the perfume of flowers such things were only old dreams of paradise the sunlands of the west and the spicelands of the east the smiling arcadias and blissful islands of the blestha ha his laughter split the void and shocked him with its unwonted sound there was no sun  this was the universe dead and cold and dark and he its only citizen weatherbee at such moments weatherbee did not count he was a caliban a monstrous phantom fettered to him for untold ages the penalty of some forgotten crime  he lived with death among the dead emasculated by the sense of his own insignificance crushed by the passive mastery of the slumbering ages the magnitude of all things appalled him everything partook of the superlative save himselfthe perfect cessation of wind and motion the immensity of the snowcovered wildness the height of the sky and the depth of the silence that windvaneif it would only move if a thunderbolt would fall or the forest flare up in flame  the rolling up of the heavens as a scroll the crash of doomanything anything but no nothing moved the silence crowded in and the fear of the north laid icy fingers on his heart  once like another crusoe by the edge of the river he came upon a trackthe faint tracery of a snowshoe rabbit on the delicate snowcrust it was a revelation  there was life in the northland he would follow it look upon it gloat over it  he forgot his swollen muscles plunging through the deep snow in an ecstasy of anticipation the forest swallowed him up and the brief midday twilight vanished but he pursued his quest till exhausted nature asserted itself and laid him helpless in the snow  there he groaned and cursed his folly and knew the track to be the fancy of his brain and late that night he dragged himself into the cabin on hands and knees his cheeks frozen and a strange numbness about his feet weatherbee grinned malevolently but made no offer to help him he thrust needles into his toes and thawed them out by the stove a week later mortification set in  but the clerk had his own troubles the dead men came out of their graves more frequently now and rarely left him waking or sleeping he grew to wait and dread their coming never passing the twin cairns without a shudder one night they came to him in his sleep and led him forth to an appointed task frightened into inarticulate horror he awoke between the heaps of stones and fled wildly to the cabin but he had lain there for some time for his feet and cheeks were also frozen  sometimes he became frantic at their insistent presence and danced about the cabin cutting the empty air with an axe and smashing everything within reach  during these ghostly encounters cuthfert huddled into his blankets and followed the madman about with a cocked revolver ready to shoot him if he came too near  but recovering from one of these spells the clerk noticed the weapon trained upon him  his suspicions were aroused and thenceforth he too lived in fear of his life they watched each other closely after that and faced about in startled fright whenever either passed behind the others back the apprehensiveness became a mania which controlled them even in their sleep through mutual fear they tacitly let the slushlamp burn all night and saw to a plentiful supply of bacongrease before retiring the slightest movement on the part of one was sufficient to arouse the other and many a still watch their gazes countered as they shook beneath their blankets with fingers on the triggerguards  what with the fear of the north the mental strain and the ravages of the disease they lost all semblance of humanity taking on the appearance of wild beasts hunted and desperate their cheeks and noses as an aftermath of the freezing had turned black  their frozen toes had begun to drop away at the first and second joints every movement brought pain but the fire box was insatiable wringing a ransom of torture from their miserable bodies day in day out it demanded its fooda veritable pound of fleshand they dragged themselves into the forest to chop wood on their knees once crawling thus in search of dry sticks unknown to each other they entered a thicket from opposite sides  suddenly without warning two peering deathsheads confronted each other suffering had so transformed them that recognition was impossible they sprang to their feet shrieking with terror and dashed away on their mangled stumps and falling at the cabins door they clawed and scratched like demons till they discovered their mistake  occasionally they lapsed normal and during one of these sane intervals the chief bone of contention the sugar had been divided equally between them they guarded their separate sacks stored up in the cache with jealous eyes for there were but a few cupfuls left and they were totally devoid of faith in each other  but one day cuthfert made a mistake hardly able to move sick with pain with his head swimming and eyes blinded he crept into the cache sugar canister in hand and mistook weatherbees sack for his own  january had been born but a few days when this occurred the sun had some time since passed its lowest southern declination and at meridian now threw flaunting streaks of yellow light upon the northern sky on the day following his mistake with the sugarbag cuthfert found himself feeling better both in body and in spirit as noontime drew near and the day brightened he dragged himself outside to feast on the evanescent glow which was to him an earnest of the suns future intentions weatherbee was also feeling somewhat better and crawled out beside him they propped themselves in the snow beneath the moveless windvane and waited  the stillness of death was about them in other climes when nature falls into such moods there is a subdued air of expectancy a waiting for some small voice to take up the broken strain not so in the north the two men had lived seeming eons in this ghostly peace  they could remember no song of the past they could conjure no song of the future this unearthly calm had always beenthe tranquil silence of eternity  their eyes were fixed upon the north unseen behind their backs behind the towering mountains to the south the sun swept toward the zenith of another sky than theirs sole spectators of the mighty canvas they watched the false dawn slowly grow a faint flame began to glow and smoulder it deepened in intensity ringing the changes of reddishyellow purple and saffron so bright did it become that cuthfert thought the sun must surely be behind ita miracle the sun rising in the north suddenly without warning and without fading the canvas was swept clean there was no color in the sky the light had gone out of the day  they caught their breaths in halfsobs but lo the air was aglint with particles of scintillating frost and there to the north the windvane lay in vague outline of the snow  a shadow a shadow it was exactly midday they jerked their heads hurriedly to the south a golden rim peeped over the mountains snowy shoulder smiled upon them an instant then dipped from sight again  there were tears in their eyes as they sought each other a strange softening came over them they felt irresistibly drawn toward each other the sun was coming back again it would be with them tomorrow and the next day and the next  and it would stay longer every visit and a time would come when it would ride their heaven day and night never once dropping below the skyline there would be no night  the icelocked winter would be broken the winds would blow and the forests answer the land would bathe in the blessed sunshine and life renew  hand in hand they would quit this horrid dream and journey back to the southland they lurched blindly forward and their hands mettheir poor maimed hands swollen and distorted beneath their mittens  but the promise was destined to remain unfulfilled the northland is the northland and men work out their souls by strange rules which other men who have not journeyed into far countries cannot come to understand  an hour later cuthfert put a pan of bread into the oven and fell to speculating on what the surgeons could do with his feet when he got back home did not seem so very far away now weatherbee was rummaging in the cache of a sudden he raised a whirlwind of blasphemy which in turn ceased with startling abruptness the other man had robbed his sugarsack still things might have happened differently had not the two dead men come out from under the stones and hushed the hot words in his throat they led him quite gently from the cache which he forgot to close that consummation was reached that something they had whispered to him in his dreams was about to happen they guided him gently very gently to the woodpile where they put the axe in his hands  then they helped him shove open the cabin door and he felt sure they shut it after himat least he heard it slam and the latch fall sharply into place and he knew they were waiting just without waiting for him to do his task  carter i say carter percy cuthfert was frightened at the look on the clerks face and he made haste to put the table between them  carter weatherbee followed without haste and without enthusiasm there was neither pity nor passion in his face but rather the patient stolid look of one who has certain work to do and goes about it methodically  i say whats the matter  the clerk dodged back cutting off his retreat to the door but never opening his mouth  i say carter i say lets talk theres a good chap the master of arts was thinking rapidly now shaping a skillful flank movement on the bed where his smith  wesson lay keeping his eyes on the madman he rolled backward on the bunk at the same time clutching the pistol  carter the powder flashed full in weatherbees face but he swung his weapon and leaped forward the axe bit deeply at the base of the spine and percy cuthfert felt all consciousness of his lower limbs leave him then the clerk fell heavily upon him clutching him by the throat with feeble fingers the sharp bite of the axe had caused cuthfert to drop the pistol and as his lungs panted for release he fumbled aimlessly for it among the blankets then he remembered he slid a hand up the clerks belt to the sheathknife and they drew very close to each other in that last clinch  percy cuthfert felt his strength leave him the lower portion of his body was useless the inert weight of weatherbee crushed himcrushed him and pinned him there like a bear under a trap the cabin became filled with a familiar odor and he knew the bread to be burning yet what did it matter he would never need it and there were all of six cupfuls of sugar in the cacheif he had foreseen this he would not have been so saving the last several days would the windvane ever move why not had he not seen the sun today he would go and see no it was impossible to move he had not thought the clerk so heavy a man  how quickly the cabin cooled the fire must be out the cold was forcing in  it must be below zero already and the ice creeping up the inside of the door he could not see it but his past experience enabled him to gauge its progress by the cabins temperature the lower hinge must be white ere now would the tale of this ever reach the world how would his friends take it they would read it over their coffee most likely and talk it over at the clubs he could see them very clearly poor old cuthfert they murmured not such a bad sort of a chap after all he smiled at their eulogies and passed on in search of a turkish bath it was the same old crowd upon the streets  strange they did not notice his moosehide moccasins and tattered german socks he would take a cab and after the bath a shave would not be bad no he would eat first  steak and potatoes and green things how fresh it all was and what was that squares of honey streaming liquid amber but why did they bring so much ha ha he could never eat it all  shine why certainly he put his foot on the box the bootblack looked curiously up at him and he remembered his moosehide moccasins and went away hastily  hark the windvane must be surely spinning no a mere singing in his ears  that was alla mere singing the ice must have passed the latch by now more likely the upper hinge was covered between the mosschinked roofpoles little points of frost began to appear how slowly they grew no not so slowly there was a new one and there another twothreefour they were coming too fast to count there were two growing together and there a third had joined them  why there were no more spots they had run together and formed a sheet  well he would have company if gabriel ever broke the silence of the north they would stand together hand in hand before the great white throne and god would judge them god would judge them  then percy cuthfert closed his eyes and dropped off to sleep    to the man on the trail  dump it in but i say kid isnt that going it a little too strong whisky and alcohols bad enough but when it comes to brandy and pepper sauce and dump it in whos making this punch anyway and malemute kid smiled benignantly through the clouds of steam by the time youve been in this country as long as i have my son and lived on rabbit tracks and salmon belly youll learn that christmas comes only once per annum  and a christmas without punch is sinking a hole to bedrock with nary a pay streak  stack up on that fer a high cyard approved big jim belden who had come down from his claim on mazy may to spend christmas and who as everyone knew had been living the two months past on straight moose meat haint fergot the hooch weuns made on the tanana hey yeh well i guess yes boys it would have done your hearts good to see that whole tribe fighting drunkand all because of a glorious ferment of sugar and sour dough that was before your time malemute kid said as he turned to stanley prince a young mining expert who had been in two years no white women in the country then and mason wanted to get married ruths father was chief of the tananas and objected like the rest of the tribe stiff why i used my last pound of sugar finest work in that line i ever did in my life you should have seen the chase down the river and across the portage but the squaw asked louis savoy the tall french canadian becoming interested for he had heard of this wild deed when at forty mile the preceding winter  then malemute kid who was a born raconteur told the unvarnished tale of the northland lochinvar more than one rough adventurer of the north felt his heartstrings draw closer and experienced vague yearnings for the sunnier pastures of the southland where life promised something more than a barren struggle with cold and death  we struck the yukon just behind the first ice run he concluded and the tribe only a quarter of an hour behind but that saved us for the second run broke the jam above and shut them out when they finally got into nuklukyeto the whole post was ready for them  and as to the forgathering ask father roubeau here he performed the ceremony the jesuit took the pipe from his lips but could only express his gratification with patriarchal smiles while protestant and catholic vigorously applauded  by gar ejaculated louis savoy who seemed overcome by the romance of it la petite squaw mon mason brav by gar then as the first tin cups of punch went round bettles the unquenchable sprang to his feet and struck up his favorite drinking song theres henry ward beecher and sundayschool teachers all drink of the sassafras root but you bet all the same if it had its right name its the juice of the forbidden fruit  oh the juice of the forbidden fruit roared out the bacchanalian chorus oh the juice of the forbidden fruit but you bet all the same if it had its right name its the juice of the forbidden fruit  malemute kids frightful concoction did its work the men of the camps and trails unbent in its genial glow and jest and song and tales of past adventure went round the board  aliens from a dozen lands they toasted each and all it was the englishman prince who pledged uncle sam the precocious infant of the new world the yankee bettles who drank to the queen god bless her and together savoy and meyers the german trader clanged their cups to alsace and lorraine  then malemute kid arose cup in hand and glanced at the greasedpaper window where the frost stood full three inches thick a health to the man on trail this night may his grub hold out may his dogs keep their legs may his matches never miss fire crack  crack heard the familiar music of the dog whip the whining howl of the malemutes and the crunch of a sled as it drew up to the cabin conversation languished while they waited the issue  an oldtimer cares for his dogs and then himself whispered malemute kid to prince as they listened to the snapping jaws and the wolfish snarls and yelps of pain which proclaimed to their practiced ears that the stranger was beating back their dogs while he fed his own  then came the expected knock sharp and confident and the stranger entered  dazzled by the light he hesitated a moment at the door giving to all a chance for scrutiny he was a striking personage and a most picturesque one in his arctic dress of wool and fur standing six foot two or three with proportionate breadth of shoulders and depth of chest his smoothshaven face nipped by the cold to a gleaming pink his long lashes and eyebrows white with ice and the ear and neck flaps of his great wolfskin cap loosely raised he seemed of a verity the frost king just stepped in out of the night  clasped outside his mackinaw jacket a beaded belt held two large colts revolvers and a hunting knife while he carried in addition to the inevitable dog whip a smokeless rifle of the largest bore and latest pattern as he came forward for all his step was firm and elastic they could see that fatigue bore heavily upon him  an awkward silence had fallen but his hearty what cheer my lads put them quickly at ease and the next instant malemute kid and he had gripped hands though they had never met each had heard of the other and the recognition was mutual a sweeping introduction and a mug of punch were forced upon him before he could explain his errand  how long since that basket sled with three men and eight dogs passed he asked  an even two days ahead are you after them yes my team run them off under my very nose the cusses ive gained two days on them alreadypick them up on the next run reckon theyll show spunk asked belden in order to keep up the conversation for malemute kid already had the coffeepot on and was busily frying bacon and moose meat  the stranger significantly tapped his revolvers  whend yeh leave dawson twelve oclock last nightas a matter of course  today a murmur of surprise passed round the circle and well it might for it was just midnight and seventyfive miles of rough river trail was not to be sneered at for a twelve hours run  the talk soon became impersonal however harking back to the trails of childhood as the young stranger ate of the rude fare malemute kid attentively studied his face nor was he long in deciding that it was fair honest and open and that he liked it still youthful the lines had been firmly traced by toil and hardship  though genial in conversation and mild when at rest the blue eyes gave promise of the hard steelglitter which comes when called into action especially against odds the heavy jaw and squarecut chin demonstrated rugged pertinacity and indomitability nor though the attributes of the lion were there was there wanting the certain softness the hint of womanliness which bespoke the emotional nature  so thets how me an the ol woman got spliced said belden concluding the exciting tale of his courtship here we be dad sez she an may yeh be damned sez he to her an then to me jim yehyeh git outen them good duds o yourn i want a right peart slice o thet forty acre plowed fore dinner an then he sort o sniffled an kissed her an i was thet happybut he seen me an roars out yeh jim an yeh bet i dusted fer the barn any kids waiting for you back in the states asked the stranger  nope sal died fore any come thets why im here belden abstractedly began to light his pipe which had failed to go out and then brightened up with how bout yerself strangermarried man for reply he opened his watch slipped it from the thong which served for a chain and passed it over belden picked up the slush lamp surveyed the inside of the case critically and swearing admiringly to himself handed it over to louis savoy with numerous by gars he finally surrendered it to prince and they noticed that his hands trembled and his eyes took on a peculiar softness and so it passed from horny hand to horny handthe pasted photograph of a woman the clinging kind that such men fancy with a babe at the breast those who had not yet seen the wonder were keen with curiosity those who had became silent and retrospective they could face the pinch of famine the grip of scurvy or the quick death by field or flood but the pictured semblance of a stranger woman and child made women and children of them all  never have seen the youngster yethes a boy she says and two years old said the stranger as he received the treasure back a lingering moment he gazed upon it then snapped the case and turned away but not quick enough to hide the restrained rush of tears  malemute kid led him to a bunk and bade him turn in  call me at four sharp dont fail me were his last words and a moment later he was breathing in the heaviness of exhausted sleep  by jove hes a plucky chap commented prince three hours sleep after seventyfive miles with the dogs and then the trail again who is he kid jack westondale been in going on three years with nothing but the name of working like a horse and any amount of bad luck to his credit i never knew him but sitka charley told me about him it seems hard that a man with a sweet young wife like his should be putting in his years in this godforsaken hole where every year counts two on the outside the trouble with him is clean grit and stubbornness hes cleaned up twice with a stake but lost it both times here the conversation was broken off by an uproar from bettles for the effect had begun to wear away and soon the bleak years of monotonous grub and deadening toil were being forgotten in rough merriment malemute kid alone seemed unable to lose himself and cast many an anxious look at his watch once he put on his mittens and beaverskin cap and leaving the cabin fell to rummaging about in the cache  nor could he wait the hour designated for he was fifteen minutes ahead of time in rousing his guest the young giant had stiffened badly and brisk rubbing was necessary to bring him to his feet he tottered painfully out of the cabin to find his dogs harnessed and everything ready for the start the company wished him good luck and a short chase while father roubeau hurriedly blessing him led the stampede for the cabin and small wonder for it is not good to face seventyfour degrees below zero with naked ears and hands  malemute kid saw him to the main trail and there gripping his hand heartily gave him advice  youll find a hundred pounds of salmon eggs on the sled he said the dogs will go as far on that as with one hundred and fifty of fish and you cant get dog food at pelly as you probably expected the stranger started and his eyes flashed but he did not interrupt you cant get an ounce of food for dog or man till you reach five fingers and thats a stiff two hundred miles watch out for open water on the thirty mile river and be sure you take the big cutoff above le barge how did you know it surely the news cant be ahead of me already i dont know it and whats more i dont want to know it but you never owned that team youre chasing sitka charley sold it to them last spring but he sized you up to me as square once and i believe him ive seen your face i like it and ive seenwhy damn you hit the high places for salt water and that wife of yours and here the kid unmittened and jerked out his sack  no i dont need it and the tears froze on his cheeks as he convulsively gripped malemute kids hand  then dont spare the dogs cut them out of the traces as fast as they drop buy them and think theyre cheap at ten dollars a pound you can get them at five fingers little salmon and hootalinqua and watch out for wet feet was his parting advice keep atraveling up to twentyfive but if it gets below that build a fire and change your socks  fifteen minutes had barely elapsed when the jingle of bells announced new arrivals the door opened and a mounted policeman of the northwest territory entered followed by two halfbreed dog drivers like westondale they were heavily armed and showed signs of fatigue the halfbreeds had been borne to the trail and bore it easily but the young policeman was badly exhausted still the dogged obstinacy of his race held him to the pace he had set and would hold him till he dropped in his tracks  when did westondale pull out he asked he stopped here didnt he this was supererogatory for the tracks told their own tale too well  malemute kid had caught beldens eye and he scenting the wind replied evasively a right peart while back come my man speak up the policeman admonished  yeh seem to want him right smart hez he ben gittin cantankerous down dawson way  held up harry mcfarlands for forty thousand exchanged it at the pc store for a check on seattle and whos to stop the cashing of it if we dont overtake him when did he pull out  every eye suppressed its excitement for malemute kid had given the cue and the young officer encountered wooden faces on every hand  striding over to prince he put the question to him though it hurt him gazing into the frank earnest face of his fellow countryman he replied inconsequentially on the state of the trail  then he espied father roubeau who could not lie a quarter of an hour ago the priest answered but he had four hours rest for himself and dogs fifteen minutes start and hes fresh my god the poor fellow staggered back half fainting from exhaustion and disappointment murmuring something about the run from dawson in ten hours and the dogs being played out  malemute kid forced a mug of punch upon him then he turned for the door ordering the dog drivers to follow but the warmth and promise of rest were too tempting and they objected strenuously the kid was conversant with their french patois and followed it anxiously  they swore that the dogs were gone up that siwash and babette would have to be shot before the first mile was covered that the rest were almost as bad and that it would be better for all hands to rest up  lend me five dogs he asked turning to malemute kid  but the kid shook his head  ill sign a check on captain constantine for five thousandheres my papersim authorized to draw at my own discretion  again the silent refusal  then ill requisition them in the name of the queen smiling incredulously the kid glanced at his wellstocked arsenal and the englishman realizing his impotency turned for the door but the dog drivers still objecting he whirled upon them fiercely calling them women and curs the swart face of the older halfbreed flushed angrily as he drew himself up and promised in good round terms that he would travel his leader off his legs and would then be delighted to plant him in the snow  the young officerand it required his whole willwalked steadily to the door exhibiting a freshness he did not possess but they all knew and appreciated his proud effort nor could he veil the twinges of agony that shot across his face covered with frost the dogs were curled up in the snow and it was almost impossible to get them to their feet the poor brutes whined under the stinging lash for the dog drivers were angry and cruel nor till babette the leader was cut from the traces could they break out the sled and get under way  a dirty scoundrel and a liar by gar him no good a thief worse than an indian  it was evident that they were angryfirst at the way they had been deceived and second at the outraged ethics of the northland where honesty above all was mans prime jewel  an we gave the cuss a hand after knowin what hed did all eyes turned accusingly upon malemute kid who rose from the corner where he had been making babette comfortable and silently emptied the bowl for a final round of punch  its a cold night boysa bitter cold night was the irrelevant commencement of his defense youve all traveled trail and know what that stands for dont jump a dog when hes down youve only heard one side a whiter man than jack westondale never ate from the same pot nor stretched blanket with you or me  last fall he gave his whole cleanup forty thousand to joe castrell to buy in on dominion today hed be a millionaire but while he stayed behind at circle city taking care of his partner with the scurvy what does castell do goes into mcfarlands jumps the limit and drops the whole sack found him dead in the snow the next day and poor jack laying his plans to go out this winter to his wife and the boy hes never seen youll notice he took exactly what his partner lostforty thousand well hes gone out and what are you going to do about it the kid glanced round the circle of his judges noted the softening of their faces then raised his mug aloft so a health to the man on trail this night may his grub hold out may his dogs keep their legs may his matches never miss fire  god prosper him good luck go with him and confusion to the mounted police cried bettles to the crash of the empty cups    the priestly prerogative  this is the story of a man who did not appreciate his wife also of a woman who did him too great an honor when she gave herself to him incidentally it concerns a jesuit priest who had never been known to lie he was an appurtenance and a very necessary one to the yukon country but the presence of the other two was merely accidental they were specimens of the many strange waifs which ride the breast of a gold rush or come tailing along behind  edwin bentham and grace bentham were waifs they were also tailing along behind for the klondike rush of 97 had long since swept down the great river and subsided into the faminestricken city of dawson when the yukon shut up shop and went to sleep under a threefoot icesheet this peripatetic couple found themselves at the five finger rapids with the city of gold still a journey of many sleeps to the north  many cattle had been butchered at this place in the fall of the year and the offal made a goodly heap the three fellowvoyagers of edwin bentham and wife gazed upon this deposit did a little mental arithmetic caught a certain glimpse of a bonanza and decided to remain and all winter they sold sacks of bones and frozen hides to the famished dogteams it was a modest price they asked a dollar a pound just as it came six months later when the sun came back and the yukon awoke they buckled on their heavy moneybelts and journeyed back to the southland where they yet live and lie mightily about the klondike they never saw  but edwin benthamhe was an indolent fellow and had he not been possessed of a wife would have gladly joined issued in the dogmeat speculation as it was she played upon his vanity told him how great and strong he was how a man such as he certainly was could overcome all obstacles and of a surety obtain the golden fleece so he squared his jaw sold his share in the bones and hides for a sled and one dog and turned his snowshoes to the north needless to state grace benthams snowshoes never allowed his tracks to grow cold nay ere their tribulations had seen three days it was the man who followed in the rear and the woman who broke trail in advance of course if anybody hove in sight the position was instantly reversed thus did his manhood remain virgin to the travelers who passed like ghosts on the silent trail there are such men in this world  how such a man and such a woman came to take each other for better and for worse is unimportant to this narrative these things are familiar to us all and those people who do them or even question them too closely are apt to lose a beautiful faith which is known as eternal fitness  edwin bentham was a boy thrust by mischance into a mans bodya boy who could complacently pluck a butterfly wing from wing or cower in abject terror before a lean nervy fellow not half his size he was a selfish crybaby hidden behind a mans mustache and stature and glossed over with a skindeep veneer of culture and conventionality yes he was a clubman and a society man the sort that grace social functions and utter inanities with a charm and unction which is indescribable the sort that talk big and cry over a toothache the sort that put more hell into a womans life by marrying her than can the most graceless libertine that ever browsed in forbidden pastures we meet these men every day but we rarely know them for what they are second to marrying them the best way to get this knowledge is to eat out of the same pot and crawl under the same blanket with them forwell say a week no greater margin is necessary  to see grace bentham was to see a slender girlish creature to know her was to know a soul which dwarfed your own yet retained all the elements of the eternal feminine this was the woman who urged and encouraged her husband in his northland quest who broke trail for him when no one was looking and cried in secret over her weakling womans body  so journeyed this strangely assorted couple down to old fort selkirk then through fivescore miles of dismal wilderness to stuart river and when the short day left them and the man lay down in the snow and blubbered it was the woman who lashed him to the sled bit her lips with the pain of her aching limbs and helped the dog haul him to malemute kids cabin malemute kid was not at home but meyers the german trader cooked great moosesteaks and shook up a bed of fresh pine boughs lake langham and parker were excited and not unduly so when the cause was taken into account  oh sandy say can you tell a porterhouse from a round come out and lend us a hand anyway this appeal emanated from the cache where langham was vainly struggling with divers quarters of frozen moose  dont you budge from those dishes commanded parker  i say sandy theres a good fellowjust run down to the missouri camp and borrow some cinnamon begged lake  oh oh hurry up why dont but the crash of meat and boxes in the cache abruptly quenched this peremptory summons  come now sandy it wont take a minute to go down to the missouri  you leave him alone interrupted parker how am i to mix the biscuits if the table isnt cleared off  sandy paused in indecision till suddenly the fact that he was langhams man dawned upon him then he apologetically threw down the greasy dishcloth and went to his masters rescue  these promising scions of wealthy progenitors had come to the northland in search of laurels with much money to burn and a man apiece luckily for their souls the other two men were up the white river in search of a mythical quartzledge so sandy had to grin under the responsibility of three healthy masters each of whom was possessed of peculiar cookery ideas twice that morning had a disruption of the whole camp been imminent only averted by immense concessions from one or the other of these knights of the chafingdish but at last their mutual creation a really dainty dinner was completed  then they sat down to a threecornered game of cutthroata proceeding which did away with all casus belli for future hostilities and permitted the victor to depart on a most important mission  this fortune fell to parker who parted his hair in the middle put on his mittens and bearskin cap and stepped over to malemute kids cabin and when he returned it was in the company of grace bentham and malemute kidthe former very sorry her husband could not share with her their hospitality for he had gone up to look at the henderson creek mines and the latter still a trifle stiff from breaking trail down the stuart river  meyers had been asked but had declined being deeply engrossed in an experiment of raising bread from hops  well they could do without the husband but a womanwhy they had not seen one all winter and the presence of this one promised a new era in their lives  they were college men and gentlemen these three young fellows yearning for the fleshpots they had been so long denied probably grace bentham suffered from a similar hunger at least it meant much to her the first bright hour in many weeks of darkness  but that wonderful first course which claimed the versatile lake for its parent had no sooner been served than there came a loud knock at the door  oh ah wont you come in mr bentham said parker who had stepped to see who the newcomer might be  is my wife here gruffly responded that worthy  why yes we left word with mr meyers parker was exerting his most dulcet tones inwardly wondering what the deuce it all meant wont you come in expecting you at any moment we reserved a place and just in time for the first course too come in edwin dear chirped grace bentham from her seat at the table  parker naturally stood aside  i want my wife reiterated bentham hoarsely the intonation savoring disagreeably of ownership  parker gasped was within an ace of driving his fist into the face of his boorish visitor but held himself awkwardly in check everybody rose lake lost his head and caught himself on the verge of saying must you go then began the farrago of leavetaking so nice of you i am awfully sorry by jove how things did brighten really now you  thank you ever so much nice trip to dawson etc etc  in this wise the lamb was helped into her jacket and led to the slaughter then the door slammed and they gazed woefully upon the deserted table  damn langham had suffered disadvantages in his early training and his oaths were weak and monotonous damn he repeated vaguely conscious of the incompleteness and vainly struggling for a more virile term it is a clever woman who can fill out the many weak places in an inefficient man by her own indomitability reenforce his vacillating nature infuse her ambitious soul into his and spur him on to great achievements and it is indeed a very clever and tactful woman who can do all this and do it so subtly that the man receives all the credit and believes in his inmost heart that everything is due to him and him alone  this is what grace bentham proceeded to do arriving in dawson with a few pounds of flour and several letters of introduction she at once applied herself to the task of pushing her big baby to the fore it was she who melted the stony heart and wrung credit from the rude barbarian who presided over the destiny of the p c company yet it was edwin bentham to whom the concession was ostensibly granted it was she who dragged her baby up and down creeks over benches and divides and on a dozen wild stampedes yet everybody remarked what an energetic fellow that bentham was it was she who studied maps and catechised miners and hammered geography and locations into his hollow head till everybody marveled at his broad grasp of the country and knowledge of its conditions of course they said the wife was a brick and only a few wise ones appreciated and pitied the brave little woman  she did the work he got the credit and reward in the northwest territory a married woman cannot stake or record a creek bench or quartz claim so edwin bentham went down to the gold commissioner and filed on bench claim 23 second tier of french hill and when april came they were washing out a thousand dollars a day with many many such days in prospect  at the base of french hill lay eldorado creek and on a creek claim stood the cabin of clyde wharton at present he was not washing out a diurnal thousand dollars but his dumps grew shift by shift and there would come a time when those dumps would pass through his sluiceboxes depositing in the riffles in the course of half a dozen days several hundred thousand dollars he often sat in that cabin smoked his pipe and dreamed beautiful little dreamsdreams in which neither the dumps nor the halfton of dust in the p c companys big safe played a part  and grace bentham as she washed tin dishes in her hillside cabin often glanced down into eldorado creek and dreamednot of dumps nor dust however they met frequently as the trail to the one claim crossed the other and there is much to talk about in the northland spring but never once by the light of an eye nor the slip of a tongue did they speak their hearts  this is as it was at first but one day edwin bentham was brutal all boys are thus besides being a french hill king now he began to think a great deal of himself and to forget all he owed to his wife on this day wharton heard of it and waylaid grace bentham and talked wildly this made her very happy though she would not listen and made him promise to not say such things again her hour had not come  but the sun swept back on its northern journey the black of midnight changed to the steely color of dawn the snow slipped away the water dashed again over the glacial drift and the washup began day and night the yellow clay and scraped bedrock hurried through the swift sluices yielding up its ransom to the strong men from the southland  and in that time of tumult came grace benthams hour  to all of us such hours at some time comethat is to us who are not too phlegmatic  some people are good not from inherent love of virtue but from sheer laziness but those of us who know weak moments may understand  edwin bentham was weighing dust over the bar of the saloon at the forksaltogether too much of his dust went over that pine boardwhen his wife came down the hill and slipped into clyde whartons cabin wharton was not expecting her but that did not alter the case and much subsequent misery and idle waiting might have been avoided had not father roubeau seen this and turned aside from the main creek trail my child hold on father roubeau though im not of your faith i respect you but you cant come in between this woman and me you know what you are doing know were you god almighty ready to fling me into eternal fire id bank my will against yours in this matter wharton had placed grace on a stool and stood belligerently before her  you sit down on that chair and keep quiet he continued addressing the jesuit ill take my innings now you can have yours after  father roubeau bowed courteously and obeyed he was an easygoing man and had learned to bide his time wharton pulled a stool alongside the womans smothering her hand in his  then you do care for me and will take me away her face seemed to reflect the peace of this man against whom she might draw close for shelter  dear dont you remember what i said before of course i but how can youthe washup do you think that worries anyway ill give the job to father roubeau here  i can trust him to safely bank the dust with the company to think of itill never see him again a blessing and to goo clyde i cant i cant there there of course you can just let me plan ityou see as soon as we get a few traps together well start and suppose he comes back ill break every no no no fighting clyde promise me that all right ill just tell the men to throw him off the claim theyve seen how hes treated you and havent much love for him  you mustnt do that you mustnt hurt him what then let him come right in here and take you away before my eyes noo she half whispered stroking his hand softly  then let me run it and dont worry ill see he doesnt get hurt precious lot he cared whether you got hurt or not we wont go back to dawson ill send word down for a couple of the boys to outfit and pole a boat up the yukon well cross the divide and raft down the indian river to meet them then and then her head was on his shoulder  their voices sank to softer cadences each word a caress the jesuit fidgeted nervously  and then she repeated  why well pole up and up and up and portage the white horse rapids and the box canon yes and the sixtymile river then the lakes chilcoot dyea and salt water but dear i cant pole a boat you little goose ill get sitka charley he knows all the good water and best camps and he is the best traveler i ever met if he is an indian all youll have to do is to sit in the middle of the boat and sing songs and play cleopatra and fightno were in luck too early for mosquitoes  and then o my antony and then a steamer san francisco and the world never to come back to this cursed hole again think of it the world and ours to choose from ill sell out why were rich the waldworth syndicate will give me half a million for whats left in the ground and ive got twice as much in the dumps and with the p c company well go to the fair in paris in 1900 well go to jerusalem if you say so  well buy an italian palace and you can

already till death do us part you know  think i once said that toto him and now and now little sweetheart youre not to bother about such things any more  of course i never never will and and for the first time lips trembled against lips  father roubeau had been watching the main trail through the window but could stand the strain no longer  he cleared his throat and turned around  your turn now father whartons face was flushed with the fire of his first embrace  there was an exultant ring to his voice as he abdicated in the others favor he had no doubt as to the result neither had grace for a smile played about her mouth as she faced the priest  my child he began my heart bleeds for you it is a pretty dream but it cannot be  and why father i have said yes you knew not what you did you did not think of the oath you took before your god to that man who is your husband it remains for me to make you realize the sanctity of such a pledge and if i do realize and yet refuse  then god  which god my husband has a god which i care not to worship there must be many such child unsay those words ah you do not mean them i understand i too have had such moments for an instant he was back in his native france and a wistful sadeyed face came as a mist between him and the woman before him  then father has my god forsaken me i am not wicked above women my misery with him has been great why should it be greater why shall i not grasp at happiness i cannot will not go back to him rather is your god forsaken return throw your burden upon him and the darkness shall be lifted o my child no it is useless i have made my bed and so shall i lie i will go on and if god punishes me i shall bear it somehow you do not understand you are not a woman my mother was a woman  but and christ was born of a woman she did not answer a silence fell wharton pulled his mustache impatiently and kept an eye on the trail grace leaned her elbow on the table her face set with resolve the smile had died away father roubeau shifted his ground  you have children  at one time i wishedbut nowno and i am thankful and a mother yes she loves you yes her replies were whispers  and a brotherno matter he is a man but a sister her head drooped a quavering yes younger very much seven years and you have thought well about this matter about them about your mother and your sister she stands on the threshold of her womans life and this wildness of yours may mean much to her could you go before her look upon her fresh young face hold her hand in yours or touch your cheek to hers  to his words her brain formed vivid images till she cried out dont dont and shrank away as do the wolfdogs from the lash  but you must face all this and better it is to do it now in his eyes which she could not see there was a great compassion but his face tense and quivering showed no relenting  she raised her head from the table forced back the tears struggled for control  i shall go away they will never see me and come to forget me i shall be to them as dead andand i will go with clydetoday it seemed final wharton stepped forward but the priest waved him back  you have wished for children a silent yes and prayed for them often and have you thought if you should have children father roubeaus eyes rested for a moment on the man by the window  a quick light shot across her face then the full import dawned upon her she raised her hand appealingly but he went on  can you picture an innocent babe in your arms a boy the world is not so hard upon a girl why your very breast would turn to gall and you could be proud and happy of your boy as you looked on other children o have pity hush a scapegoat  dont dont i will go back she was at his feet  a child to grow up with no thought of evil and one day the world to fling a tender name in his face a child to look back and curse you from whose loins he sprang  o my god my god she groveled on the floor the priest sighed and raised her to her feet  wharton pressed forward but she motioned him away  dont come near me clyde i am going back the tears were coursing pitifully down her face but she made no effort to wipe them away  after all this you cannot i will not let you dont touch me she shivered and drew back  i will you are mine do you hear you are mine then he whirled upon the priest o what a fool i was to ever let you wag your silly tongue thank your god you are not a common man for idbut the priestly prerogative must be exercised eh well you have exercised it now get out of my house or ill forget who and what you are father roubeau bowed took her hand and started for the door but wharton cut them off  grace you said you loved me i did and you do now i do say it again  i do love you clyde i do there you priest he cried you have heard it and with those words on her lips you would send her back to live a lie and a hell with that man  but father roubeau whisked the woman into the inner room and closed the door no words he whispered to wharton as he struck a casual posture on a stool remember for her sake he added  the room echoed to a rough knock at the door the latch raised and edwin bentham stepped in  seen anything of my wife he asked as soon as salutations had been exchanged  two heads nodded negatively  i saw her tracks down from the cabin he continued tentatively and they broke off just opposite here on the main trail his listeners looked bored  and ii thought  she was here thundered wharton  the priest silenced him with a look did you see her tracks leading up to this cabin my son wily father roubeauhe had taken good care to obliterate them as he came up the same path an hour before  i didnt stop to look i his eyes rested suspiciously on the door to the other room then interrogated the priest the latter shook his head but the doubt seemed to linger  father roubeau breathed a swift silent prayer and rose to his feet if you doubt me why he made as though to open the door  a priest could not lie edwin bentham had heard this often and believed it  of course not father he interposed hurriedly i was only wondering where my wife had gone and thought maybei guess shes up at mrs stantons on french gulch nice weather isnt it heard the news flours gone down to forty dollars a hundred and they say the chechaquas are flocking down the river in droves  but i must be going so goodby the door slammed and from the window they watched him take his guest up french gulch a few weeks later just after the june highwater two men shot a canoe into midstream and made fast to a derelict pine this tightened the painter and jerked the frail craft along as would a towboat father roubeau had been directed to leave the upper country and return to his swarthy children at minook the white men had come among them and they were devoting too little time to fishing and too much to a certain deity whose transient habitat was in countless black bottles  malemute kid also had business in the lower country so they journeyed together  but one in all the northland knew the man paul roubeau and that man was malemute kid before him alone did the priest cast off the sacerdotal garb and stand naked and why not these two men knew each other had they not shared the last morsel of fish the last pinch of tobacco the last and inmost thought on the barren stretches of bering sea in the heartbreaking mazes of the great delta on the terrible winter journey from point barrow to the porcupine father roubeau puffed heavily at his trailworn pipe and gazed on the reddisked sun poised somberly on the edge of the northern horizon  malemute kid wound up his watch it was midnight  cheer up old man the kid was evidently gathering up a broken thread  god surely will forgive such a lie let me give you the word of a man who strikes a true note if she have spoken a word remember thy lips are sealed and the brand of the dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed  if there be trouble to herward and a lie of the blackest can clear lie while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear  father roubeau removed his pipe and reflected the man speaks true but my soul is not vexed with that the lie and the penance stand with god butbut  what then your hands are clean not so kid i have thought much and yet the thing remains i knew and made her go back the clear note of a robin rang out from the wooden bank a partridge drummed the call in the distance a moose lunged noisily in the eddy but the twain smoked on in silence    the wisdom of the trail  sitka charley had achieved the impossible other indians might have known as much of the wisdom of the trail as he did but he alone knew the white mans wisdom the honor of the trail and the law but these things had not come to him in a day the aboriginal mind is slow to generalize and many facts repeated often are required to compass an understanding sitka charley from boyhood had been thrown continually with white men and as a man he had elected to cast his fortunes with them expatriating himself once and for all from his own people even then respecting almost venerating their power and pondering over it he had yet to divine its secret essencethe honor and the law and it was only by the cumulative evidence of years that he had finally come to understand being an alien when he did know he knew it better than the white man himself being an indian he had achieved the impossible  and of these things had been bred a certain contempt for his own peoplea contempt which he had made it a custom to conceal but which now burst forth in a polyglot whirlwind of curses upon the heads of kahchucte and gowhee they cringed before him like a brace of snarling wolf dogs too cowardly to spring too wolfish to cover their fangs they were not handsome creatures neither was sitka charley all three were frightfullooking there was no flesh to their faces their cheekbones were massed with hideous scabs which had cracked and frozen alternately under the intense frost while their eyes burned luridly with the light which is born of desperation and hunger men so situated beyond the pale of the honor and the law are not to be trusted sitka charley knew this and this was why he had forced them to abandon their rifles with the rest of the camp outfit ten days before his rifle and captain eppingwells were the only ones that remained  come get a fire started he commanded drawing out the precious matchbox with its attendant strips of dry birchbark  the two indians fell sullenly to the task of gathering dead branches and underwood they were weak and paused often catching themselves in the act of stooping with giddy motions or staggering to the center of operations with their knees shaking like castanets  after each trip they rested for a moment as though sick and deadly weary at times their eyes took on the patient stoicism of dumb suffering and again the ego seemed almost burst forth with its wild cry i i i want to existthe dominant note of the whole living universe  a light breath of air blew from the south nipping the exposed portions of their bodies and driving the frost in needles of fire through fur and flesh to the bones so when the fire had grown lusty and thawed a damp circle in the snow about it sitka charley forced his reluctant comrades to lend a hand in pitching a fly it was a primitive affair merely a blanket stretched parallel with the fire and to windward of it at an angle of perhaps fortyfive degrees this shut out the chill wind and threw the heat backward and down upon those who were to huddle in its shelter then a layer of green spruce boughs were spread that their bodies might not come in contact with the snow when this task was completed kahchucte and gowhee proceeded to take care of their feet their icebound moccasins were sadly worn by much travel and the sharp ice of the river jams had cut them to rags  their siwash socks were similarly conditioned and when these had been thawed and removed the deadwhite tips of the toes in the various stages of mortification told their simple tale of the trail  leaving the two to the drying of their footgear sitka charley turned back over the course he had come he too had a mighty longing to sit by the fire and tend his complaining flesh but the honor and the law forbade he toiled painfully over the frozen field each step a protest every muscle in revolt several times where the open water between the jams had recently crusted he was forced to miserably accelerate his movements as the fragile footing swayed and threatened beneath him in such places death was quick and easy but it was not his desire to endure no more  his deepening anxiety vanished as two indians dragged into view round a bend in the river they staggered and panted like men under heavy burdens yet the packs on their backs were a matter of but a few pounds he questioned them eagerly and their replies seemed to relieve him he hurried on next came two white men supporting between them a woman they also behaved as though drunken and their limbs shook with weakness but the woman leaned lightly upon them choosing to carry herself forward with her own strength at the sight of her a flash of joy cast its fleeting light across sitka charleys face he cherished a very great regard for mrs eppingwell he had seen many white women but this was the first to travel the trail with him when captain eppingwell proposed the hazardous undertaking and made him an offer for his services he had shaken his head gravely for it was an unknown journey through the dismal vastnesses of the northland and he knew it to be of the kind that try to the uttermost the souls of men  but when he learned that the captains wife was to accompany them he had refused flatly to have anything further to do with it had it been a woman of his own race he would have harbored no objections but these women of the southlandno no they were too soft too tender for such enterprises  sitka charley did not know this kind of woman five minutes before he did not even dream of taking charge of the expedition but when she came to him with her wonderful smile and her straight clean english and talked to the point without pleading or persuading he had incontinently yielded had there been a softness and appeal to mercy in the eyes a tremble to the voice a taking advantage of sex he would have stiffened to steel instead her clearsearching eyes and clearringing voice her utter frankness and tacit assumption of equality had robbed him of his reason he felt then that this was a new breed of woman and ere they had been trail mates for many days he knew why the sons of such women mastered the land and the sea and why the sons of his own womankind could not prevail against them tender and soft day after day he watched her muscleweary exhausted indomitable and the words beat in upon him in a perennial refrain tender and soft he knew her feet had been born to easy paths and sunny lands strangers to the moccasined pain of the north unkissed by the chill lips of the frost and he watched and marveled at them twinkling ever through the weary day  she had always a smile and a word of cheer from which not even the meanest packer was excluded as the way grew darker she seemed to stiffen and gather greater strength and when kahchucte and gowhee who had bragged that they knew every landmark of the way as a child did the skin bails of the tepee acknowledged that they knew not where they were it was she who raised a forgiving voice amid the curses of the men she had sung to them that night till they felt the weariness fall from them and were ready to face the future with fresh hope and when the food failed and each scant stint was measured jealously she it was who rebelled against the machinations of her husband and sitka charley and demanded and received a share neither greater nor less than that of the others  sitka charley was proud to know this woman a new richness a greater breadth had come into his life with her presence hitherto he had been his own mentor had turned to right or left at no mans beck he had moulded himself according to his own dictates nourished his manhood regardless of all save his own opinion for the first time he had felt a call from without for the best that was in him just a glance of appreciation from the clearsearching eyes a word of thanks from the clearringing voice just a slight wreathing of the lips in the wonderful smile and he walked with the gods for hours to come it was a new stimulant to his manhood for the first time he thrilled with a conscious pride in his wisdom of the trail and between the twain they ever lifted the sinking hearts of their comrades the faces of the two men and the woman brightened as they saw him for after all he was the staff they leaned upon but sitka charley rigid as was his wont concealing pain and pleasure impartially beneath an iron exterior asked them the welfare of the rest told the distance to the fire and continued on the backtrip  next he met a single indian unburdened limping lips compressed and eyes set with the pain of a foot in which the quick fought a losing battle with the dead all possible care had been taken of him but in the last extremity the weak and unfortunate must perish and sitka charley deemed his days to be few the man could not keep up for long so he gave him rough cheering words after that came two more indians to whom he had allotted the task of helping along joe the third white man of the party they had deserted him sitka charley saw at a glance the lurking spring in their bodies and knew they had at last cast off his mastery so he was not taken unawares when he ordered them back in quest of their abandoned charge and saw the gleam of the hunting knives that they drew from the sheaths a pitiful spectacle three weak men lifting their puny strength in the face of the mighty vastness but the two recoiled under the fierce rifle blows of the one and returned like beaten dogs to the leash two hours later with joe reeling between them and sitka charley bringing up the rear they came to the fire where the remainder of the expedition crouched in the shelter of the fly  a few words my comrades before we sleep sitka charley said after they had devoured their slim rations of unleavened bread he was speaking to the indians in their own tongue having already given the import to the whites a few words my comrades for your own good that ye may yet perchance live i shall give you the law on his own head by the death of him that breaks it we have passed the hills of silence and we now travel the head reaches of the stuart it may be one sleep it may be several it may be many sleeps but in time we shall come among the men of the yukon who have much grub it were well that we look to the law today kahchucte and gowhee whom i commanded to break trail forgot they were men and like frightened children ran away  true they forgot so let us forget but hereafter let them remember if it should happen they do not he touched his rifle carelessly grimly tomorrow they shall carry the flour and see that the white man joe lies not down by the trail the cups of flour are counted should so much as an ounce be wanting at nightfall do ye understand today there were others that forgot moose head and three salmon left the white man joe to lie in the snow let them forget no more with the light of day shall they go forth and break trail ye have heard the law look well lest ye break it sitka charley found it beyond him to keep the line close up from moose head and three salmon who broke trail in advance to kahchucte gowhee and joe it straggled out over a mile each staggered fell or rested as he saw fit  the line of march was a progression through a chain of irregular halts each drew upon the last remnant of his strength and stumbled onward till it was expended but in some miraculous way there was always another last remnant each time a man fell it was with the firm belief that he would rise no more yet he did rise and again and again the flesh yielded the will conquered but each triumph was a tragedy the indian with the frozen foot no longer erect crawled forward on hand and knee he rarely rested for he knew the penalty exacted by the frost  even mrs eppingwells lips were at last set in a stony smile and her eyes seeing saw not often she stopped pressing a mittened hand to her heart gasping and dizzy  joe the white man had passed beyond the stage of suffering he no longer begged to be let alone prayed to die but was soothed and content under the anodyne of delirium kahchucte and gowhee dragged him on roughly venting upon him many a savage glance or blow to them it was the acme of injustice  their hearts were bitter with hate heavy with fear why should they cumber their strength with his weakness to do so meant death not to do soand they remembered the law of sitka charley and the rifle  joe fell with greater frequency as the daylight waned and so hard was he to raise that they dropped farther and farther behind sometimes all three pitched into the snow so weak had the indians become yet on their backs was life and strength and warmth  within the flour sacks were all the potentialities of existence they could not but think of this and it was not strange that which came to pass they had fallen by the side of a great timber jam where a thousand cords of firewood waited the match near by was an air hole through the ice kahchucte looked on the wood and the water as did gowhee then they looked at each other  never a word was spoken gowhee struck a fire kahchucte filled a tin cup with water and heated it joe babbled of things in another land in a tongue they did not understand  they mixed flour with the warm water till it was a thin paste and of this they drank many cups they did not offer any to joe but he did not mind he did not mind anything not even his moccasins which scorched and smoked among the coals  a crystal mist of snow fell about them softly caressingly wrapping them in clinging robes of white and their feet would have yet trod many trails had not destiny brushed the clouds aside and cleared the air nay ten minutes delay would have been salvation  sitka charley looking back saw the pillared smoke of their fire and guessed and he looked ahead at those who were faithful and at mrs eppingwell so my good comrades ye have again forgotten that you were men good very good there will be fewer bellies to feed sitka charley retied the flour as he spoke strapping the pack to the one on his own back he kicked joe till the pain broke through the poor devils bliss and brought him doddering to his feet then he shoved him out upon the trail and started him on his way the two indians attempted to slip off  hold gowhee and thou too kahchucte hath the flour given such strength to thy legs that they may outrun the swiftwinged lead think not to cheat the law be men for the last time and be content that ye die fullstomached  come step up back to the timber shoulder to shoulder come the two men obeyed quietly without fear for it is the future which pressed upon the man not the present  thou gowhee hast a wife and children and a deerskin lodge in the chipewyan what is thy will in the matter give thou her of the goods which are mine by the word of the captainthe blankets the beads the tobacco the box which makes strange sounds after the manner of the white men say that i did die on the trail but say not how and thou kahchucte who hast nor wife nor child mine is a sister the wife of the factor at koshim he beats her and she is not happy give thou her the goods which are mine by the contract and tell her it were well she go back to her own people shouldst thou meet the man and be so minded it were a good deed that he should die he beats her and she is afraid are ye content to die by the law we are then goodbye my good comrades may ye sit by the wellfilled pot in warm lodges ere the day is done as he spoke he raised his rifle and many echoes broke the silence hardly had they died away when other rifles spoke in the distance sitka charley started  there had been more than one shot yet there was but one other rifle in the party  he gave a fleeting glance at the men who lay so quietly smiled viciously at the wisdom of the trail and hurried on to meet the men of the yukon    the wife of a king  once when the northland was very young the social and civic virtues were remarkably alike for their paucity and their simplicity when the burden of domestic duties grew grievous and the fireside mood expanded to a constant protest against its bleak loneliness the adventurers from the southland in lieu of better paid the stipulated prices and took unto themselves native wives it was a foretaste of paradise to the women for it must be confessed that the white rovers gave far better care and treatment of them than did their indian copartners of course the white men themselves were satisfied with such deals as were also the indian men for that matter having sold their daughters and sisters for cotton blankets and obsolete rifles and traded their warm furs for flimsy calico and bad whisky the sons of the soil promptly and cheerfully succumbed to quick consumption and other swift diseases correlated with the blessings of a superior civilization  it was in these days of arcadian simplicity that cal galbraith journeyed through the land and fell sick on the lower river it was a refreshing advent in the lives of the good sisters of the holy cross who gave him shelter and medicine though they little dreamed of the hot elixir infused into his veins by the touch of their soft hands and their gentle ministrations cal galbraith became troubled with strange thoughts which clamored for attention till he laid eyes on the mission girl madeline yet he gave no sign biding his time patiently he strengthened with the coming spring and when the sun rode the heavens in a golden circle and the joy and throb of life was in all the land he gathered his still weak body together and departed  now madeline the mission girl was an orphan her white father had failed to give a baldfaced grizzly the trail one day and had died quickly then her indian mother having no man to fill the winter cache had tried the hazardous experiment of waiting till the salmonrun on fifty pounds of flour and half as many of bacon after that the baby chookra went to live with the good sisters and to be thenceforth known by another name  but madeline still had kinsfolk the nearest being a dissolute uncle who outraged his vitals with inordinate quantities of the white mans whisky he strove daily to walk with the gods and incidentally his feet sought shorter trails to the grave when sober he suffered exquisite torture he had no conscience to this ancient vagabond cal galbraith duly presented himself and they consumed many words and much tobacco in the conversation that followed promises were also made and in the end the old heathen took a few pounds of dried salmon and his birchbark canoe and paddled away to the mission of the holy cross  it is not given the world to know what promises he made and what lies he toldthe sisters never gossip but when he returned upon his swarthy chest there was a brass crucifix and in his canoe his niece madeline that night there was a grand wedding and a potlach so that for two days to follow there was no fishing done by the village but in the morning madeline shook the dust of the lower river from her moccasins and with her husband in a polingboat went to live on the upper river in a place known as the lower country and in the years which followed she was a good wife sharing her husbands hardships and cooking his food and she kept him in straight trails till he learned to save his dust and to work mightily in the end he struck it rich and built a cabin in circle city and his happiness was such that men who came to visit him in his homecircle became restless at the sight of it and envied him greatly  but the northland began to mature and social amenities to make their appearance  hitherto the southland had sent forth its sons but it now belched forth a new exodusthis time of its daughters sisters and wives they were not but they did not fail to put new ideas in the heads of the men and to elevate the tone of things in ways peculiarly their own no more did the squaws gather at the dances go roaring down the center in the good old virginia reels or make merry with jolly dan tucker they fell back on their natural stoicism and uncomplainingly watched the rule of their white sisters from their cabins  then another exodus came over the mountains from the prolific southland  this time it was of women that became mighty in the land their word was law their law was steel they frowned upon the indian wives while the other women became mild and walked humbly there were cowards who became ashamed of their ancient covenants with the daughters of the soil who looked with a new distaste upon their darkskinned children but there were also othersmenwho remained true and proud of their aboriginal vows when it became the fashion to divorce the native wives cal galbraith retained his manhood and in so doing felt the heavy hand of the women who had come last knew least but who ruled the land  one day the upper country which lies far above circle city was pronounced rich dogteams carried the news to salt water golden argosies freighted the lure across the north pacific wires and cables sang with the tidings and the world heard for the first time of the klondike river and the yukon country cal galbraith had lived the years quietly he had been a good husband to madeline and she had blessed him but somehow discontent fell upon him he felt vague yearnings for his own kind for the life he had been shut out froma general sort of desire which men sometimes feel to break out and taste the prime of living besides there drifted down the river wild rumors of the wonderful el dorado glowing descriptions of the city of logs and tents and ludicrous accounts of the chechaquas who had rushed in and were stampeding the whole country  circle city was dead the world had moved on up river and become a new and most marvelous world  cal galbraith grew restless on the edge of things and wished to see with his own eyes  so after the washup he weighed in a couple of hundred pounds of dust on the companys big scales and took a draft for the same on dawson then he put tom dixon in charge of his mines kissed madeline goodby promised to be back before the first mushice ran and took passage on an upriver steamer  madeline waited waited through all the three months of daylight she fed the dogs gave much of her time to young cal watched the short summer fade away and the sun begin its long journey to the south and she prayed much in the manner of the sisters of the holy cross the fall came and with it there was mushice on the yukon and circle city kings returning to the winters work at their mines but no cal galbraith tom dixon received a letter however for his men sledded up her winters supply of dry pine the company received a letter for its dogteams filled her cache with their best provisions and she was told that her credit was limitless  through all the ages man has been held the chief instigator of the woes of woman but in this case the men held their tongues and swore harshly at one of their number who was away while the women failed utterly to emulate them so without needless delay madeline heard strange tales of cal galbraiths doings also of a certain greek dancer who played with men as children did with bubbles now madeline was an indian woman and further she had no woman friend to whom to go for wise counsel she prayed and planned by turns and that night being quick of resolve and action she harnessed the dogs and with young cal securely lashed to the sled stole away  though the yukon still ran free the eddyice was growing and each day saw the river dwindling to a slushy thread save him who has done the like no man may know what she endured in traveling a hundred miles on the rimice nor may they understand the toil and hardship of breaking the two hundred miles of packed ice which remained after the river froze for good but madeline was an indian woman so she did these things and one night there came a knock at malemute kids door thereat he fed a team of starving dogs put a healthy youngster to bed and turned his attention to an exhausted woman he removed her icebound moccasins while he listened to her tale and stuck the point of his knife into her feet that he might see how far they were frozen  despite his tremendous virility malemute kid was possessed of a softer womanly element which could win the confidence of a snarling wolfdog or draw confessions from the most wintry heart nor did he seek them hearts opened to him as spontaneously as flowers to the sun even the priest father roubeau had been known to confess to him while the men and women of the northland were ever knocking at his doora door from which the latchstring hung always out to madeline he could do no wrong make no mistake she had known him from the time she first cast her lot among the people of her fathers race and to her halfbarbaric mind it seemed that in him was centered the wisdom of the ages that between his vision and the future there could be no intervening veil  there were false ideals in the land the social strictures of dawson were not synonymous with those of the previous era and the swift maturity of the northland involved much wrong malemute kid was aware of this and he had cal galbraiths measure accurately  he knew a hasty word was the father of much evil besides he was minded to teach a great lesson and bring shame upon the man so stanley prince the young mining expert was called into the conference the following night as was also lucky jack harrington and his violin that same night bettles who owed a great debt to malemute kid harnessed up cal galbraiths dogs lashed cal galbraith junior to the sled and slipped away in the dark for stuart river   ii  so onetwothree onetwothree now reverse no no start up again jack seethis way prince executed the movement as one should who has led the cotillion  now onetwothree onetwothree reverse ah thats better try it again i say you know you mustnt look at your feet onetwothree onetwothree shorter steps you are not hanging to the geepole just now try it over  there thats the way onetwothree onetwothree round and round went prince and madeline in an interminable waltz the table and stools had been shoved over against the wall to increase the room malemute kid sat on the bunk chin to knees greatly interested jack harrington sat beside him scraping away on his violin and following the dancers  it was a unique situation the undertaking of these three men with the woman  the most pathetic part perhaps was the businesslike way in which they went about it  no athlete was ever trained more rigidly for a coming contest nor wolfdog for the harness than was she but they had good material for madeline unlike most women of her race in her childhood had escaped the carrying of heavy burdens and the toil of the trail besides she was a cleanlimbed willowy creature possessed of much grace which had not hitherto been realized it was this grace which the men strove to bring out and knock into shape  trouble with her she learned to dance all wrong prince remarked to the bunk after having deposited his breathless pupil on the table shes quick at picking up yet i could do better had she never danced a step but say kid i cant understand this prince imitated a peculiar movement of the shoulders and heada weakness madeline suffered from in walking  lucky for her she was raised in the mission malemute kid answered packing you knowthe headstrap other indian women have it bad but she didnt do any packing till after she married and then only at first saw hard lines with that husband of hers they went through the fortymile famine together but can we break it dont know  perhaps long walks with her trainers will make the riffle anyway theyll take it out some wont they madeline the girl nodded assent if malemute kid who knew all things said so why it was so that was all there was about it  she had come over to them anxious to begin again harrington surveyed her in quest of her points much in the same manner men usually do horses it certainly was not disappointing for he asked with sudden interest what did that beggarly uncle of yours get anyway one rifle one blanket twenty bottles of hooch rifle broke she said this last scornfully as though disgusted at how low her maidenvalue had been rated  she spoke fair english with many peculiarities of her husbands speech but there was still perceptible the indian accent the traditional groping after strange gutturals even this her instructors had taken in hand and with no small success too  at the next intermission prince discovered a new predicament  i say kid he said were wrong all wrong she cant learn in moccasins  put her feet into slippers and then onto that waxed floorphew madeline raised a foot and regarded her shapeless housemoccasins dubiously in previous winters both at circle city and fortymile she had danced many a night away with similar footgear and there had been nothing the matter  but nowwell if there was anything wrong it was for malemute kid to know not her  but malemute kid did know and he had a good eye for measures so he put on his cap and mittens and went down the hill to pay mrs eppingwell a call her husband clove eppingwell was prominent in the community as one of the great government officials  the kid had noted her slender little foot one night at the governors ball and as he also knew her to be as sensible as she was pretty it was no task to ask of her a certain small favor  on his return madeline withdrew for a moment to the inner room when she reappeared prince was startled  by jove he gasped whod a thought it the little witch why my sister is an english girl interrupted malemute kid with an english foot this girl comes of a smallfooted race moccasins just broadened her feet healthily while she did not misshape them by running with the dogs in her childhood but this explanation failed utterly to allay princes admiration harringtons commercial instinct was touched and as he looked upon the exquisitely turned foot and ankle there ran through his mind the sordid listone rifle one blanket twenty bottles of hooch madeline was the wife of a king a king whose yellow treasure could buy outright a score of fashions puppets yet in all her life her feet had known no gear save redtanned moosehide at first she had looked in awe at the tiny whitesatin slippers but she had quickly understood the admiration which shone manlike in the eyes of the men her face flushed with pride for the moment she was drunken with her womans loveliness then she murmured with increased scorn and one rifle broke so the training went on every day malemute kid led the girl out on long walks devoted to the correction of her carriage and the shortening of her stride  there was little likelihood of her identity being discovered for cal galbraith and the rest of the oldtimers were like lost children among the many strangers who had rushed into the land besides the frost of the north has a bitter tongue and the tender women of the south to shield their cheeks from its biting caresses were prone to the use of canvas masks with faces obscured and bodies lost in squirrelskin parkas a mother and daughter meeting on trail would pass as strangers  the coaching progressed rapidly at first it had been slow but later a sudden acceleration had manifested itself this began from the moment madeline tried on the whitesatin slippers and in so doing found herself the pride of her renegade father apart from any natural selfesteem she might possess at that instant received its birth hitherto she had deemed herself a woman of an alien breed of inferior stock purchased by her lords favor her husband had seemed to her a god who had lifted her through no essential virtues on her part to his own godlike level but she had never forgotten even when young cal was born that she was not of his people as he had been a god so had his womenkind been goddesses she might have contrasted herself with them but she had never compared  it might have been that familiarity bred contempt however be that as it may she had ultimately come to understand these roving white men and to weigh them  true her mind was dark to deliberate analysis but she yet possessed her womans clarity of vision in such matters on the night of the slippers she had measured the bold open admiration of her three manfriends and for the first time comparison had suggested itself it was only a foot and an ankle butbut comparison could not in the nature of things cease at that point she judged herself by their standards till the divinity of her white sisters was shattered after all they were only women and why should she not exalt herself to their midst in doing these things she learned where she lacked and with the knowledge of her weakness came her strength and so mightily did she strive that her three trainers often marveled late into the night over the eternal mystery of woman  in this way thanksgiving night drew near at irregular intervals bettles sent word down from stuart river regarding the welfare of young cal the time of their return was approaching more than once a casual caller hearing dancemusic and the rhythmic pulse of feet entered only to find harrington scraping away and the other two beating time or arguing noisily over a mooted step madeline was never in evidence having precipitately fled to the inner room  on one of these nights cal galbraith dropped in encouraging news had just come down from stuart river and madeline had surpassed herselfnot in walk alone and carriage and grace but in womanly roguishness they had indulged in sharp repartee and she had defended herself brilliantly and then yielding to the intoxication of the moment and of her own power she had bullied and mastered and wheedled and patronized them with most astonishing success and instinctively involuntarily they had bowed not to her beauty her wisdom her wit but to that indefinable something in woman to which man yields yet cannot name  the room was dizzy with sheer delight as she and prince whirled through the last dance of the evening harrington was throwing in inconceivable flourishes while malemute kid utterly abandoned had seized the broom and was executing mad gyrations on his own account  at this instant the door shook with a heavy raprap and their quick glances noted the lifting of the latch but they had survived similar situations before harrington never broke a note madeline shot through the waiting door to the inner room the broom went hurtling under the bunk and by the time cal galbraith and louis savoy got their heads in malemute kid and prince were in each others arms wildly schottisching down the room  as a rule indian women do not make a practice of fainting on provocation but madeline came as near to it as she ever had in her life for an hour she crouched on the floor listening to the heavy voices of the men rumbling up and down in mimic thunder like familiar chords of childhood melodies every intonation every trick of her husbands voice swept in upon her fluttering her heart and weakening her knees till she lay halffainting against the door it was well she could neither see nor hear when he took his departure  when do you expect to go back to circle city malemute kid asked simply  havent thought much about it he replied dont think till after the ice breaks and madeline  he flushed at the question and there was a quick droop to his eyes malemute kid could have despised him for that had he known men less as it was his gorge rose against the wives and daughters who had come into the land and not satisfied with usurping the place of the native women had put unclean thoughts in the heads of the men and made them ashamed  i guess shes all right the circle city king answered hastily and in an apologetic manner tom dixons got charge of my interests you know and he sees to it that she has everything she wants malemute kid laid hand upon his arm and hushed him suddenly they had stepped without overhead the aurora a gorgeous wanton flaunted miracles of color beneath lay the sleeping town far below a solitary dog gave tongue  the king again began to speak but the kid pressed his hand for silence the sound multiplied dog after dog took up the strain till the fullthroated chorus swayed the night  to him who hears for the first time this weird song is told the first and greatest secret of the northland to him who has heard it often it is the solemn knell of lost endeavor it is the plaint of tortured souls for in it is invested the heritage of the north the suffering of countless generationsthe warning and the requiem to the worlds estrays  cal galbraith shivered slightly as it died away in halfcaught sobs the kid read his thoughts openly and wandered back with him through all the weary days of famine and disease and with him was also the patient madeline sharing his pains and perils never doubting never complaining his minds retina vibrated to a score of pictures stern clearcut and the hand of the past drew back with heavy fingers on his heart it was the psychological moment malemute kid was halftempted to play his reserve card and win the game but the lesson was too mild as yet and he let it pass the next instant they had gripped hands and the kings beaded moccasins were drawing protests from the outraged snow as he crunched down the hill  madeline in collapse was another woman to the mischievous creature of an hour before whose laughter had been so infectious and whose heightened color and flashing eyes had made her teachers for the while forget weak and nerveless she sat in the chair just as she had been dropped there by prince and harrington  malemute kid frowned this would never do when the time of meeting her husband came to hand she must carry things off with highhanded imperiousness it was very necessary she should do it after the manner of white women else the victory would be no victory at all so he talked to her sternly without mincing of words and initiated her into the weaknesses of his own sex till she came to understand what simpletons men were after all and why the word of their women was law  a few days before thanksgiving night malemute kid made another call on mrs eppingwell she promptly overhauled her feminine fripperies paid a protracted visit to the drygoods department of the p c company and returned with the kid to make madelines acquaintance after that came a period such as the cabin had never seen before and what with cutting and fitting and basting and stitching and numerous other wonderful and unknowable things the male conspirators were more often banished the premises than not at such times the opera house opened its double stormdoors to them  so often did they put their heads together and so deeply did they drink to curious toasts that the loungers scented unknown creeks of incalculable richness and it is known that several chechaquas and at least one oldtimer kept their stampeding packs stored behind the bar ready to hit the trail at a moments notice  mrs eppingwell was a woman of capacity so when she turned madeline over to her trainers on thanksgiving night she was so transformed that they were almost afraid of her prince wrapped a hudson bay blanket about her with a mock reverence more real than feigned while malemute kid whose arm she had taken found it a severe trial to resume his wonted mentorship harrington with the list of purchases still running through his head dragged along in the rear nor opened his mouth once all the way down into the town when they came to the back door of the opera house they took the blanket from madelines shoulders and spread it on the snow slipping out of princes moccasins she stepped upon it in new satin slippers the masquerade was at its height she hesitated but they jerked open the door and shoved her in then they ran around to come in by the front entrance   iii  where is freda the oldtimers questioned while the chechaquas were equally energetic in asking who freda was the ballroom buzzed with her name  it was on everybodys lips grizzled sourdough boys daylaborers at the mines but proud of their degree either patronized the sprucelooking tenderfeet and lied eloquentlythe sourdough boys being specially created to toy with truthor gave them savage looks of indignation because of their ignorance perhaps forty kings of the upper and lower countries were on the floor each deeming himself hot on the trail and sturdily backing his judgment with the yellow dust of the realm an assistant was sent to the man at the scales upon whom had fallen the burden of weighing up the sacks while several of the gamblers with the rules of chance at their fingerends made up alluring books on the field and favorites  which was freda time and again the greek dancer was thought to have been discovered but each discovery brought panic to the betting ring and a frantic registering of new wagers by those who wished to hedge malemute kid took an interest in the hunt his advent being hailed uproariously by the revelers who knew him to a man the kid had a good eye for the trick of a step and ear for the lilt of a voice and his private choice was a marvelous creature who scintillated as the aurora borealis but the greek dancer was too subtle for even his penetration the majority of the goldhunters seemed to have centered their verdict on the russian princess who was the most graceful in the room and hence could be no other than freda moloof  during a quadrille a roar of satisfaction went up she was discovered at previous balls in the figure all hands round freda had displayed an inimitable step and variation peculiarly her own as the figure was called the russian princess gave the unique rhythm to limb and body a chorus of itoldyousos shook the squared roofbeams when lo it was noticed that aurora borealis and another masque the spirit of the pole were performing the same trick equally well and when two twin sundogs and a frost queen followed suit a second assistant was dispatched to the aid of the man at the scales  bettles came off trail in the midst of the excitement descending upon them in a hurricane of frost his rimed brows turned to cataracts as he whirled about his mustache still frozen seemed gemmed with diamonds and turned the light in varicolored rays while the flying feet slipped on the chunks of ice which rattled from his moccasins and german socks a northland dance is quite an informal affair the men of the creeks and trails having lost whatever fastidiousness they might have at one time possessed and only in the high official circles are conventions at all observed here caste carried no significance millionaires and paupers dogdrivers and mounted policemen joined hands with ladies in the center and swept around the circle performing most remarkable capers primitive in their pleasure boisterous and rough they displayed no rudeness but rather a crude chivalry more genuine than the most polished courtesy  in his quest for the greek dancer cal galbraith managed to get into the same set with the russian princess toward whom popular suspicion had turned  but by the time he had guided her through one dance he was willing not only to stake his millions that she was not freda but that he had had his arm about her waist before when or where he could not tell but the puzzling sense of familiarity so wrought upon him that he turned his attention to the discovery of her identity malemute kid might have aided him instead of occasionally taking the princess for a few turns and talking earnestly to her in low tones but it was jack harrington who paid the russian princess the most assiduous court once he drew cal galbraith aside and hazarded wild guesses as to who she was and explained to him that he was going in to win that rankled the circle city king for man is not by nature monogamic and he forgot both madeline and freda in the new quest  it was soon noised about that the russian princess was not freda moloof interest deepened here was a fresh enigma they knew freda though they could not find her but here was somebody they had found and did not know even the women could not place her and they knew every good dancer in the camp many took her for one of the official clique indulging in a silly escapade not a few asserted she would disappear before the unmasking others were equally positive that she was the womanreporter of the kansas city star come to write them up at ninety dollars per column and the men at the scales worked busily  at one oclock every couple took to the floor the unmasking began amid laughter and delight like that of carefree children there was no end of ohs and ahs as mask after mask was lifted the scintillating aurora borealis became the brawny negress whose income from washing the communitys clothes ran at about five hundred a month the twin sundogs discovered mustaches on their upper lips and were recognized as brother fractionkings of el dorado in one of the most prominent sets and the slowest in uncovering was cal galbraith with the spirit of the pole opposite him was jack harrington and the russian princess the rest had discovered themselves yet the greek dancer was still missing all eyes were upon the group cal galbraith in response to their cries lifted his partners mask fredas wonderful face and brilliant eyes flashed out upon them a roar went up to be squelched suddenly in the new and absorbing mystery of the russian princess her face was still hidden and jack harrington was struggling with her the dancers tittered on the tiptoes of expectancy he crushed her dainty costume roughly and thenand then the revelers exploded the joke was on them they had danced all night with a tabooed native woman  but those that knew and they were many ceased abruptly and a hush fell upon the room  cal galbraith crossed over with great strides angrily and spoke to madeline in polyglot chinook but she retained her composure apparently oblivious to the fact that she was the cynosure of all eyes and answered him in english she showed neither fright nor anger and malemute kid chuckled at her wellbred equanimity the king felt baffled defeated his common siwash wife had passed beyond him  come he said finally come on home i beg pardon she replied i have agreed to go to supper with mr harrington besides theres no end of dances promised  harrington extended his arm to lead her away he evinced not the slightest disinclination toward showing his back but malemute kid had by this time edged in closer the circle city king was stunned twice his hand dropped to his belt and twice the kid gathered himself to spring but the retreating couple passed through the supperroom door where canned oysters were spread at five dollars the plate  the crowd sighed audibly broke up into couples and followed them freda pouted and went in with cal galbraith but she had a good heart and a sure tongue and she spoiled his oysters for him what she said is of no importance but his face went red and white at intervals and he swore repeatedly and savagely at himself  the supperroom was filled with a pandemonium of voices which ceased suddenly as cal galbraith stepped over to his wifes table since the unmasking considerable weights of dust had been placed as to the outcome everybody watched with breathless interest  harringtons blue eyes were steady but under the overhanging tablecloth a smith  wesson balanced on his knee madeline looked up casually with little interest  maymay i have the next round dance with you the king stuttered  the wife of the king glanced at her card and inclined her head    an odyssey of the north  the sleds were singing their eternal lament to the creaking of the harness and the tinkling bells of the leaders but the men and dogs were tired and made no sound the trail was heavy with newfallen snow and they had come far and the runners burdened with flintlike quarters of frozen moose clung tenaciously to the unpacked surface and held back with a stubbornness almost human  darkness was coming on but there was no camp to pitch that night the snow fell gently through the pulseless air not in flakes but in tiny frost crystals of delicate design it was very warmbarely ten below zeroand the men did not mind meyers and bettles had raised their ear flaps while malemute kid had even taken off his mittens  the dogs had been fagged out early in the after noon but they now began to show new vigor among the more astute there was a certain restlessnessan impatience at the restraint of the traces an indecisive quickness of movement a sniffing of snouts and pricking of ears these became incensed at their more phlegmatic brothers urging them on with numerous sly nips on their hinder quarters those thus chidden also contracted and helped spread the contagion at last the leader of the foremost sled uttered a sharp whine of satisfaction crouching lower in the snow and throwing himself against the collar the rest followed suit  there was an ingathering of back hands a tightening of traces the sleds leaped forward and the men clung to the gee poles violently accelerating the uplift of their feet that they might escape going under the runners the weariness of the day fell from them and they whooped encouragement to the dogs the animals responded with joyous yelps they were swinging through the gathering darkness at a rattling gallop  gee gee the men cried each in turn as their sleds abruptly left the main trail heeling over on single runners like luggers on the wind  then came a hundred yards dash to the lighted parchment window which told its own story of the home cabin the roaring yukon stove and the steaming pots of tea but the home cabin had been invaded threescore huskies chorused defiance and as many furry forms precipitated themselves upon the dogs which drew the first sled the door was flung open and a man clad in the scarlet tunic of the northwest police waded kneedeep among the furious brutes calmly and impartially dispensing soothing justice with the butt end of a dog whip after that the men shook hands and in this wise was malemute kid welcomed to his own cabin by a stranger  stanley prince who should have welcomed him and who was responsible for the yukon stove and hot tea aforementioned was busy with his guests there were a dozen or so of them as nondescript a crowd as ever served the queen in the enforcement of her laws or the delivery of her mails they were of many breeds but their common life had formed of them a certain typea lean and wiry type with trailhardened muscles and sunbrowned faces and untroubled souls which gazed frankly forth cleareyed and steady  they drove the dogs of the queen wrought fear in the hearts of her enemies ate of her meager fare and were happy they had seen life and done deeds and lived romances but they did not know it  and they were very much at home two of them were sprawled upon malemute kids bunk singing chansons which their french forebears sang in the days when first they entered the northwest land and mated with its indian women bettles bunk had suffered a similar invasion and three or four lusty voyageurs worked their toes among its blankets as they listened to the tale of one who had served on the boat brigade with wolseley when he fought his way to khartoum  and when he tired a cowboy told of courts and kings and lords and ladies he had seen when buffalo bill toured the capitals of europe in a corner two halfbreeds ancient comrades in a lost campaign mended harnesses and talked of the days when the northwest flamed with insurrection and louis riel was king  rough jests and rougher jokes went up and down and great hazards by trail and river were spoken of in the light of commonplaces only to be recalled by virtue of some grain of humor or ludicrous happening prince was led away by these uncrowned heroes who had seen history made who regarded the great and the romantic as but the ordinary and the incidental in the routine of life he passed his precious tobacco among them with lavish disregard and rusty chains of reminiscence were loosened and forgotten odysseys resurrected for his especial benefit  when conversation dropped and the travelers filled the last pipes and lashed their tightrolled sleeping furs prince fell back upon his comrade for further information  well you know what the cowboy is malemute kid answered beginning to unlace his moccasins and its not hard to guess the british blood in his bed partner as for the rest theyre all children of the coureurs du bois mingled with god knows how many other bloods the two turning in by the door are the regulation breeds or boisbrules that lad with the worsted breech scarfnotice his eyebrows and the turn of his jawshows a scotchman wept in his mothers smoky tepee and that handsome looking fellow putting the capote under his head is a french halfbreedyou heard him talking he doesnt like the two indians turning in next to him you see when the breeds rose under the riel the fullbloods kept the peace and theyve not lost much love for one another since but i say whats that glumlooking fellow by the stove ill swear he cant talk english he hasnt opened his mouth all night youre wrong he knows english well enough did you follow his eyes when he listened i did but hes neither kith nor kin to the others when they talked their own patois you could see he didnt understand ive been wondering myself what he is lets find out fire a couple of sticks into the stove  malemute kid commanded raising his voice and looking squarely at the man in question  he obeyed at once  had discipline knocked into him somewhere prince commented in a low tone  malemute kid nodded took off his socks and picked his way among recumbent men to the stove there he hung his damp footgear among a score or so of mates  when do you expect to get to dawson he asked tentatively  the man studied him a moment before replying they say seventyfive mile so maybe two days the very slightest accent was perceptible while there was no awkward hesitancy or groping for words  been in the country before no northwest territory yes born there no  well where the devil were you born youre none of these malemute kid swept his hand over the dog drivers even including the two policemen who had turned into princes bunk where did you come from ive seen faces like yours before though i cant remember just where i know you he irrelevantly replied at once turning the drift of malemute kids questions  where ever see me no your partner him priest pastilik long time ago him ask me if i see you malemute kid him give me grub i no stop long you hear him speak bout me oh youre the fellow that traded the otter skins for the dogs the man nodded knocked out his pipe and signified his disinclination for conversation by rolling up in his furs malemute kid blew out the slush lamp and crawled under the blankets with prince  well what is he dont knowturned me off somehow and then shut up like a clam  but hes a fellow to whet your curiosity ive heard of him all the coast wondered about him eight years ago sort of mysterious you know he came down out of the north in the dead of winter many a thousand miles from here skirting bering sea and traveling as though the devil were after him no one ever learned where he came from but he must have come far he was badly travelworn when he got food from the swedish missionary on golovin bay and asked the way south we heard of all this afterward then he abandoned the shore line heading right across norton sound terrible weather snowstorms and high winds but he pulled through where a thousand other men would have died missing st michaels and making the land at pastilik hed lost all but two dogs and was nearly gone with starvation  he was so anxious to go on that father roubeau fitted him out with grub but he couldnt let him have any dogs for he was only waiting my arrival to go on a trip himself mr ulysses knew too much to start on without animals and fretted around for several days he had on his sled a bunch of beautifully cured otter skins sea otters you know worth their weight in gold there was also at pastilik an old shylock of a russian trader who had dogs to kill well they didnt dicker very long but when the strange one headed south again it was in the rear of a spanking dog team mr shylock by the way had the otter skins i saw them and they were magnificent we figured it up and found the dogs brought him at least five hundred apiece and it wasnt as if the strange one didnt know the value of sea otter he was an indian of some sort and what little he talked showed hed been among white men  after the ice passed out of the sea word came up from nunivak island that hed gone in there for grub then he dropped from sight and this is the first heard of him in eight years now where did he come from and what was he doing there and why did he come from there hes indian hes been nobody knows where and hes had discipline which is unusual for an indian another mystery of the north for you to solve prince thanks awfully but ive got too many on hand as it is he replied  malemute kid was already breathing heavily but the young mining engineer gazed straight up through the thick darkness waiting for the strange orgasm which stirred his blood to die away and when he did sleep his brain worked on and for the nonce he too wandered through the white unknown struggled with the dogs on endless trails and saw men live and toil and die like men the next morning hours before daylight the dog drivers and policemen pulled out for dawson but the powers that saw to her majestys interests and ruled the destinies of her lesser creatures gave the mailmen little rest for a week later they appeared at stuart river heavily burdened with letters for salt water  however their dogs had been replaced by fresh ones but then they were dogs  the men had expected some sort of a layover in which to rest up besides this klondike was a new section of the northland and they had wished to see a little something of the golden city where dust flowed like water and dance halls rang with neverending revelry but they dried their socks and smoked their evening pipes with much the same gusto as on their former visit though one or two bold spirits speculated on desertion and the possibility of crossing the unexplored rockies to the east and thence by the mackenzie valley of gaining their old stamping grounds in the chippewyan country  two or three even decided to return to their homes by that route when their terms of service had expired and they began to lay plans forthwith looking forward to the hazardous undertaking in much the same way a citybred man would to a days holiday in the woods  he of the otter skins seemed very restless though he took little interest in the discussion and at last he drew malemute kid to one side and talked for some time in low tones  prince cast curious eyes in their direction and the mystery deepened when they put on caps and mittens and went outside when they returned malemute kid placed his gold scales on the table weighed out the matter of sixty ounces and transferred them to the strange ones sack then the chief of the dog drivers joined the conclave and certain business was transacted with him  the next day the gang went on upriver but he of the otter skins took several pounds of grub and turned his steps back toward dawson  didnt know what to make of it said malemute kid in response to princes queries but the poor beggar wanted to be quit of the service for some reason or otherat least it seemed a most important one to him though he wouldnt let on what you see its just like the army he signed for two years and the only way to get free was to buy himself out he couldnt desert and then stay here and he was just wild to remain in the country  made up his mind when he got to dawson he said but no one knew him hadnt a cent and i was the only one hed spoken two words with so he talked it over with the lieutenantgovernor and made arrangements in case he could get the money from meloan you know said hed pay back in the year and if i wanted would put me onto something rich neverd seen it but he knew it was rich  and talk why when he got me outside he was ready to weep begged and pleaded got down in the snow to me till i hauled him out of it palavered around like a crazy man  swore hes worked to this very end for years and years and couldnt bear to be disappointed now asked him what end but he wouldnt say  said they might keep him on the other half of the trail and he wouldnt get to dawson in two years and then it would be too late never saw a man take on so in my life and when i said id let him have it had to yank him out of the snow again told him to consider it in the light of a grubstake think hed have it no sir swore hed give me all he found make me rich beyond the dreams of avarice and all such stuff now a man who puts his life and time against a grubstake ordinarily finds it hard enough to turn over half of what he finds something behind all this prince just you make a note of it well hear of him if he stays in the country and if he doesnt then my good nature gets a shock and im sixty some odd ounces out the cold weather had come on with the long nights and the sun had begun to play his ancient game of peekaboo along the southern snow line ere aught was heard of malemute kids grubstake and then one bleak morning in early january a heavily laden dog train pulled into his cabin below stuart river he of the otter skins was there and with him walked a man such as the gods have almost forgotten how to fashion men never talked of luck and pluck and fivehundreddollar dirt without bringing in the name of axel gunderson nor could tales of nerve or strength or daring pass up and down the campfire without the summoning of his presence and when the conversation flagged it blazed anew at mention of the woman who shared his fortunes  as has been noted in the making of axel gunderson the gods had remembered their oldtime cunning and cast him after the manner of men who were born when the world was young full seven feet he towered in his picturesque costume which marked a king of eldorado his chest neck and limbs were those of a giant to bear his three hundred pounds of bone and muscle his snowshoes were greater by a generous yard than those of other men roughhewn with rugged brow and massive jaw and unflinching eyes of palest blue his face told the tale of one who knew but the law of might of the yellow of ripe corn silk his frostincrusted hair swept like day across the night and fell far down his coat of bearskin  a vague tradition of the sea seemed to cling about him as he swung down the narrow trail in advance of the dogs and he brought the butt of his dog whip against malemute kids door as a norse sea rover on southern foray might thunder for admittance at the castle gate  prince bared his womanly arms and kneaded sourdough bread casting as he did so many a glance at the three gueststhree guests the like of which might never come under a mans roof in a lifetime the strange one whom malemute kid had surnamed ulysses still fascinated him but his interest chiefly gravitated between axel gunderson and axel gundersons wife she felt the days journey for she had softened in comfortable cabins during the many days since her husband mastered the wealth of frozen pay streaks and she was tired she rested against his great breast like a slender flower against a wall replying lazily to malemute kids goodnatured banter and stirring princes blood strangely with an occasional sweep of her deep dark eyes for prince was a man and healthy and had seen few women in many months and she was older than he and an indian besides but she was different from all native wives he had met she had traveledhad been in his country among others he gathered from the conversation and she knew most of the things the women of his own race knew and much more that it was not in the nature of things for them to know she could make a meal of sundried fish or a bed in the snow yet she teased them with tantalizing details of manycourse dinners and caused strange internal dissensions to arise at the mention of various quondam dishes which they had wellnigh forgotten she knew the ways of the moose the bear and the little blue fox and of the wild amphibians of the northern seas she was skilled in the lore of the woods and the streams and the tale writ by man and bird and beast upon the delicate snow crust was to her an open book yet prince caught the appreciative twinkle in her eye as she read the rules of the camp these rules had been fathered by the unquenchable bettles at a time when his blood ran high and were remarkable for the terse simplicity of their humor  prince always turned them to the wall before the arrival of ladies but who could suspect that this native wifewell it was too late now  this then was the wife of axel gunderson a woman whose name and fame had traveled with her husbands hand in hand through all the northland at table malemute kid baited her with the assurance of an old friend and prince shook off the shyness of first acquaintance and joined in but she held her own in the unequal contest while her husband slower in wit ventured naught but applause and he was very proud of her his every look and action revealed the magnitude of the place she occupied in his life he of the otter skins ate in silence forgotten in the merry battle and long ere the others were done he pushed back from the table and went out among the dogs yet all too soon his fellow travelers drew on their mittens and parkas and followed him  there had been no snow for many days and the sleds slipped along the hardpacked yukon trail as easily as if it had been glare ice ulysses led the first sled with the second came prince and axel gundersons wife while malemute kid and the yellowhaired giant brought up the third  its only a hunch kid he said but i think its straight hes never been there but he tells a good story and shows a map i heard of when i was in the kootenay country years ago id like to have you go along but hes a strange one and swore pointblank to throw it up if anyone was brought in but when i come back youll get first tip and ill stake you next to me and give you a half share in the town site besides no no he cried as the other strove to interrupt im running this and before im done itll need two heads  if its all right why itll be a second cripple creek man do you heara second cripple creek its quartz you know not placer and if we work it right well corral the

reachessurvey a railroad perhapssawmillselectriclight plantdo our own bankingcommercial companysyndicatesay just you hold your hush till i get back the sleds came to a halt where the trail crossed the mouth of stuart river an unbroken sea of frost its wide expanse stretched away into the unknown east  the snowshoes were withdrawn from the lashings of the sleds axel gunderson shook hands and stepped to the fore his great webbed shoes sinking a fair half yard into the feathery surface and packing the snow so the dogs should not wallow his wife fell in behind the last sled betraying long practice in the art of handling the awkward footgear the stillness was broken with cheery farewells the dogs whined and he of the otter skins talked with his whip to a recalcitrant wheeler  an hour later the train had taken on the likeness of a black pencil crawling in a long straight line across a mighty sheet of foolscap   ii  one night many weeks later malemute kid and prince fell to solving chess problems from the torn page of an ancient magazine the kid had just returned from his bonanza properties and was resting up preparatory to a long moose hunt  prince too had been on creek and trail nearly all winter and had grown hungry for a blissful week of cabin life  interpose the black knight and force the king no that wont do see the next move  why advance the pawn two squares bound to take it in transit and with the bishop out of the way but hold on that leaves a hole and no its protected go ahead youll see it works it was very interesting somebody knocked at the door a second time before malemute kid said come in the door swung open something staggered in  prince caught one square look and sprang to his feet the horror in his eyes caused malemute kid to whirl about and he too was startled though he had seen bad things before the thing tottered blindly toward them prince edged away till he reached the nail from which hung his smith  wesson  my god what is it he whispered to malemute kid  dont know looks like a case of freezing and no grub replied the kid sliding away in the opposite direction watch out it may be mad he warned coming back from closing the door  the thing advanced to the table the bright flame of the slush lamp caught its eye it was amused and gave voice to eldritch cackles which betokened mirth  then suddenly hefor it was a manswayed back with a hitch to his skin trousers and began to sing a chantey such as men lift when they swing around the capstan circle and the sea snorts in their ears yankee ship come down de riiber pull my bully boys pull dyeh wantto know de captain ruuns her pull my bully boys pull jonathan jones ob south caholiina pull my bully he broke off abruptly tottered with a wolfish snarl to the meat shelf and before they could intercept was tearing with his teeth at a chunk of raw bacon the struggle was fierce between him and malemute kid but his mad strength left him as suddenly as it had come and he weakly surrendered the spoil between them they got him upon a stool where he sprawled with half his body across the table  a small dose of whiskey strengthened him so that he could dip a spoon into the sugar caddy which malemute kid placed before him after his appetite had been somewhat cloyed prince shuddering as he did so passed him a mug of weak beef tea  the creatures eyes were alight with a somber frenzy which blazed and waned with every mouthful there was very little skin to the face the face for that matter sunken and emaciated bore little likeness to human countenance  frost after frost had bitten deeply each depositing its stratum of scab upon the halfhealed scar that went before this dry hard surface was of a bloodyblack color serrated by grievous cracks wherein the raw red flesh peeped forth his skin garments were dirty and in tatters and the fur of one side was singed and burned away showing where he had lain upon his fire  malemute kid pointed to where the suntanned hide had been cut away strip by stripthe grim signature of famine  whoareyou slowly and distinctly enunciated the kid  the man paid no heed  where do you come from yankee ship come down de riiber was the quavering response  dont doubt the beggar came down the river the kid said shaking him in an endeavor to start a more lucid flow of talk  but the man shrieked at the contact clapping a hand to his side in evident pain he rose slowly to his feet half leaning on the table  she laughed at mesowith the hate in her eye and shewouldnotcome his voice died away and he was sinking back when malemute kid gripped him by the wrist and shouted who who would not come she unga she laughed and struck at me so and so and then yes  and then and then what and then he lay very still in the snow a long time he isstill inthesnow the two men looked at each other helplessly  who is in the snow she unga she looked at me with the hate in her eye and then  yes yes and then she took the knife so and once twiceshe was weak i traveled very slow and there is much gold in that place very much gold where is unga for all malemute kid knew she might be dying a mile away he shook the man savagely repeating again and

ulysses he said quietly tossing the bag of dust on the table guess its all day with axel gunderson and the woman come on lets get him between the blankets hes indian hell pull through and tell a tale besides as they cut his garments from him near his right breast could be seen two unhealed hardlipped knife thrusts   iii  i will talk of the things which were in my own way but you will understand i will begin at the beginning and tell of myself and the woman and after that of the man he of the otter skins drew over to the stove as do men who have been deprived of fire and are afraid the promethean gift may vanish at any moment malemute kid picked up the slush lamp and placed it so its light might fall upon the face of the narrator prince slid his body over the edge of the bunk and joined them  i am naass a chief and the son of a chief born between a sunset and a rising on the dark seas in my fathers oomiak all of a night the men toiled at the paddles and the women cast out the waves which threw in upon us and we fought with the storm the salt spray froze upon my mothers breast till her breath passed with the passing of the tide but ii raised my voice with the wind and the storm and lived  we dwelt in akatan where asked malemute kid  akatan which is in the aleutians akatan beyond chignik beyond kardalak beyond unimak as i say we dwelt in akatan which lies in the midst of the sea on the edge of the world we farmed the salt seas for the fish the seal and the otter and our homes shouldered about one another on the rocky strip between the rim of the forest and the yellow beach where our kayaks lay we were not many and the world was very small there were strange lands to the eastislands like akatan so we thought all the world was islands and did not mind  i was different from my people in the sands of the beach were the crooked timbers and wavewarped planks of a boat such as my people never built and i remember on the point of the island which overlooked the ocean three ways there stood a pine tree which never grew there smooth and straight and tall it is said the two men came to that spot turn about through many days and watched with the passing of the light these two men came from out of the sea in the boat which lay in pieces on the beach and they were white like you and weak as the little children when the seal have gone away and the hunters come home empty i know of these things from the old men and the old women who got them from their fathers and mothers before them these strange white men did not take kindly to our ways at first but they grew strong what of the fish and the oil and fierce and they built them each his own house and took the pick of our women and in time children came thus he was born who was to become the father of my fathers father  as i said i was different from my people for i carried the strong strange blood of this white man who came out of the sea it is said we had other laws in the days before these men but they were fierce and quarrelsome and fought with our men till there were no more left who dared to fight then they made themselves chiefs and took away our old laws and gave us new ones insomuch that the man was the son of his father and not his mother as our way had been they also ruled that the son firstborn should have all things which were his fathers before him and that the brothers and sisters should shift for themselves and they gave us other laws they showed us new ways in the catching of fish and the killing of bear which were thick in the woods and they taught us to lay by bigger stores for the time of famine and these things were good  but when they had become chiefs and there were no more men to face their anger they fought these strange white men each with the other and the one whose blood i carry drove his seal spear the length of an arm through the others body their children took up the fight and their childrens children and there was great hatred between them and black doings even to my time so that in each family but one lived to pass down the blood of them that went before of my blood i was alone of the other mans there was but a girl unga who lived with her mother her father and my father did not come back from the fishing one night but afterward they washed up to the beach on the big tides and they held very close to each other  the people wondered because of the hatred between the houses and the old men shook their heads and said the fight would go on when children were born to her and children to me they told me this as a boy till i came to believe and to look upon unga as a foe who was to be the mother of children which were to fight with mine i thought of these things day by day and when i grew to a stripling i came to ask why this should be so  and they answered we do not know but that in such way your fathers did and i marveled that those which were to come should fight the battles of those that were gone and in it i could see no right but the people said it must be and i was only a stripling  and they said i must hurry that my blood might be the older and grow strong before hers this was easy for i was head man and the people looked up to me because of the deeds and the laws of my fathers and the wealth which was mine any maiden would come to me but i found none to my liking and the old men and the mothers of maidens told me to hurry for even then were the hunters bidding high to the mother of unga and should her children grow strong before mine mine would surely die  nor did i find a maiden till one night coming back from the fishing the sunlight was lying so low and full in the eyes the wind free and the kayacks racing with the white seas of a sudden the kayak of unga came driving past me and she looked upon me so with her black hair flying like a cloud of night and the spray wet on her cheek as i say the sunlight was full in the eyes and i was a stripling but somehow it was all clear and i knew it to be the call of kind to kind  as she whipped ahead she looked back within the space of two strokeslooked as only the woman unga could lookand again i knew it as the call of kind the people shouted as we ripped past the lazy oomiaks and left them far behind but she was quick at the paddle and my heart was like the belly of a sail and i did not gain the wind freshened the sea whitened and leaping like the seals on the windward breech we roared down the golden pathway of the sun naass was crouched half out of his stool in the attitude of one driving a paddle as he ran the race anew somewhere across the stove he beheld the tossing kayak and the flying hair of unga the voice of the wind was in his ears and its salt beat fresh upon his nostrils  but she made the shore and ran up the sand laughing to the house of her mother and a great thought came to me that nighta thought worthy of him that was chief over all the people of akatan so when the moon was up i went down to the house of her mother and looked upon the goods of yashnoosh which were piled by the doorthe goods of yashnoosh a strong hunter who had it in mind to be the father of the children of unga other young men had piled their goods there and taken them away again and each young man had made a pile greater than the one before  and i laughed to the moon and the stars and went to my own house where my wealth was stored and many trips i made till my pile was greater by the fingers of one hand than the pile of yashnoosh there were fish dried in the sun and smoked and forty hides of the hair seal and half as many of the fur and each hide was tied at the mouth and big bellied with oil and ten skins of bear which i killed in the woods when they came out in the spring and there were beads and blankets and scarlet cloths such as i got in trade from the people who lived to the east and who got them in trade from the people who lived still beyond in the east  and i looked upon the pile of yashnoosh and laughed for i was head man in akatan and my wealth was greater than the wealth of all my young men and my fathers had done deeds and given laws and put their names for all time in the mouths of the people  so when the morning came i went down to the beach casting out of the corner of my eye at the house of the mother of unga my offer yet stood untouched  and the women smiled and said sly things one to the other i wondered for never had such a price been offered and that night i added more to the pile and put beside it a kayak of welltanned skins which never yet had swam in the sea but in the day it was yet there open to the laughter of all men the mother of unga was crafty and i grew angry at the shame in which i stood before my people so that night i added till it became a great pile and i hauled up my oomiak which was of the value of twenty kayaks and in the morning there was no pile  then made i preparation for the wedding and the people that lived even to the east came for the food of the feast and the potlatch token unga was older than i by the age of four suns in the way we reckoned the years i was only a stripling but then i was a chief and the son of a chief and it did not matter  but a ship shoved her sails above the floor of the ocean and grew larger with the breath of the wind from her scuppers she ran clear water and the men were in haste and worked hard at the pumps on the bow stood a mighty man watching the depth of the water and giving commands with a voice of thunder his eyes were of the pale blue of the deep waters and his head was maned like that of a sea lion and his hair was yellow like the straw of a southern harvest or the manila rope yarns which sailormen plait  of late years we had seen ships from afar but this was the first to come to the beach of akatan the feast was broken and the women and children fled to the houses while we men strung our bows and waited with spears in hand but when the ships forefoot smelled the beach the strange men took no notice of us being busy with their own work with the falling of the tide they careened the schooner and patched a great hole in her bottom so the women crept back and the feast went on  when the tide rose the sea wanderers kedged the schooner to deep water and then came among us they bore presents and were friendly so i made room for them and out of the largeness of my heart gave them tokens such as i gave all the guests for it was my wedding day and i was head man in akatan and he with the mane of the sea lion was there so tall and strong that one looked to see the earth shake with the fall of his feet he looked much and straight at unga with his arms folded so and stayed till the sun went away and the stars came out then he went down to his ship after that i took unga by the hand and led her to my own house and there was singing and great laughter and the women said sly things after the manner of women at such times but we did not care then the people left us alone and went home  the last noise had not died away when the chief of the sea wanderers came in by the door and he had with him black bottles from which we drank and made merry you see i was only a stripling and had lived all my days on the edge of the world so my blood became as fire and my heart as light as the froth that flies from the surf to the cliff unga sat silent among the skins in the corner her eyes wide for she seemed to fear and he with the mane of the sea lion looked upon her straight and long then his men came in with bundles of goods and he piled before me wealth such as was not in all akatan there were guns both large and small and powder and shot and shell and bright axes and knives of steel and cunning tools and strange things the like of which i had never seen when he showed me by sign that it was all mine i thought him a great man to be so free but he showed me also that unga was to go away with him in his ship  do you understandthat unga was to go away with him in his ship the blood of my fathers flamed hot on the sudden and i made to drive him through with my spear but the spirit of the bottles had stolen the life from my arm and he took me by the neck so and knocked my head against the wall of the house and i was made weak like a newborn child and my legs would no more stand under me  unga screamed and she laid hold of the things of the house with her hands till they fell all about us as he dragged her to the door then he took her in his great arms and when she tore at his yellow hair laughed with a sound like that of the big bull seal in the rut  i crawled to the beach and called upon my people but they were afraid only yashnoosh was a man and they struck him on the head with an oar till he lay with his face in the sand and did not move and they raised the sails to the sound of their songs and the ship went away on the wind  the people said it was good for there would be no more war of the bloods in akatan but i said never a word waiting till the time of the full moon when i put fish and oil in my kayak and went away to the east i saw many islands and many people and i who had lived on the edge saw that the world was very large i talked by signs but they had not seen a schooner nor a man with the mane of a sea lion and they pointed always to the east and i slept in queer places and ate odd things and met strange faces many laughed for they thought me light of head but sometimes old men turned my face to the light and blessed me and the eyes of the young women grew soft as they asked me of the strange ship and unga and the men of the sea  and in this manner through rough seas and great storms i came to unalaska there were two schooners there but neither was the one i sought so i passed on to the east with the world growing ever larger and in the island of unamok there was no word of the ship nor in kadiak nor in atognak and so i came one day to a rocky land where men dug great holes in the mountain and there was a schooner but not my schooner and men loaded upon it the rocks which they dug this i thought childish for all the world was made of rocks but they gave me food and set me to work when the schooner was deep in the water the captain gave me money and told me to go but i asked which way he went and he pointed south i made signs that i would go with him and he laughed at first but then being short of men took me to help work the ship so i came to talk after their manner and to heave on ropes and to reef the stiff sails in sudden squalls and to take my turn at the wheel but it was not strange for the blood of my fathers was the blood of the men of the sea  i had thought it an easy task to find him i sought once i got among his own people and when we raised the land one day and passed between a gateway of the sea to a port i looked for perhaps as many schooners as there were fingers to my hands but the ships lay against the wharves for miles packed like so many little fish and when i went among them to ask for a man with the mane of a sea lion they laughed and answered me in the tongues of many peoples and i found that they hailed from the uttermost parts of the earth  and i went into the city to look upon the face of every man but they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks and i could not count them and the noise smote upon me till i could not hear and my head was dizzy with much movement so i went on and on through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine where the harvests lay rich on the plains and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold and all the while my people of akatan hunted and fished and were happy in the thought that the world was small  but the look in the eyes of unga coming home from the fishing was with me always and i knew i would find her when the time was met she walked down quiet lanes in the dusk of the evening or led me chases across the thick fields wet with the morning dew and there was a promise in her eyes such as only the woman unga could give  so i wandered through a thousand cities some were gentle and gave me food and others laughed and still others cursed but i kept my tongue between my teeth and went strange ways and saw strange sights sometimes i who was a chief and the son of a chief toiled for menmen rough of speech and hard as iron who wrung gold from the sweat and sorrow of their fellow men yet no word did i get of my quest till i came back to the sea like a homing seal to the rookeries  but this was at another port in another country which lay to the north and there i heard dim tales of the yellowhaired sea wanderer and i learned that he was a hunter of seals and that even then he was abroad on the ocean  so i shipped on a seal schooner with the lazy siwashes and followed his trackless trail to the north where the hunt was then warm and we were away weary months and spoke many of the fleet and heard much of the wild doings of him i sought but never once did we raise him above the sea we went north even to the pribilofs and killed the seals in herds on the beach and brought their warm bodies aboard till our scuppers ran grease and blood and no man could stand upon the deck then were we chased by a ship of slow steam which fired upon us with great guns but we put sail till the sea was over our decks and washed them clean and lost ourselves in a fog  it is said at this time while we fled with fear at our hearts that the yellowhaired sea wanderer put in to the pribilofs right to the factory and while the part of his men held the servants of the company the rest loaded ten thousand green skins from the salt houses i say it is said but i believe for in the voyages i made on the coast with never a meeting the northern seas rang with his wildness and daring till the three nations which have lands there sought him with their ships  and i heard of unga for the captains sang loud in her praise and she was always with him she had learned the ways of his people they said and was happy but i knew betterknew that her heart harked back to her own people by the yellow beach of akatan  so after a long time i went back to the port which is by a gateway of the sea and there i learned that he had gone across the girth of the great ocean to hunt for the seal to the east of the warm land which runs south from the russian seas  and i who was become a sailorman shipped with men of his own race and went after him in the hunt of the seal and there were few ships off that new land but we hung on the flank of the seal pack and harried it north through all the spring of the year and when the cows were heavy with pup and crossed the russian line our men grumbled and were afraid for there was much fog and every day men were lost in the boats they would not work so the captain turned the ship back toward the way it came but i knew the yellowhaired sea wanderer was unafraid and would hang by the pack even to the russian isles where few men go so i took a boat in the black of night when the lookout dozed on the focslehead and went alone to the warm long land and i journeyed south to meet the men by yeddo bay who are wild and unafraid and the yoshiwara girls were small and bright like steel and good to look upon but i could not stop for i knew that unga rolled on the tossing floor by the rookeries of the north  the men by yeddo bay had met from the ends of the earth and had neither gods nor homes sailing under the flag of the japanese and with them i went to the rich beaches of copper island where our salt piles became high with skins  and in that silent sea we saw no man till we were ready to come away then one day the fog lifted on the edge of a heavy wind and there jammed down upon us a schooner with close in her wake the cloudy funnels of a russian manofwar we fled away on the beam of the wind with the schooner jamming still closer and plunging ahead three feet to our two and upon her poop was the man with the mane of the sea lion pressing the rails under with the canvas and laughing in his strength of life and unga was therei knew her on the momentbut he sent her below when the cannons began to talk across the sea  as i say with three feet to our two till we saw the rudder lift green at every jumpand i swinging on to the wheel and cursing with my back to the russian shot for we knew he had it in mind to run before us that he might get away while we were caught and they knocked our masts out of us till we dragged into the wind like a wounded gull but he went on over the edge of the sky linehe and unga  what could we the fresh hides spoke for themselves so they took us to a russian port and after that to a lone country where they set us to work in the mines to dig salt and some died andand some did not die naass swept the blanket from his shoulders disclosing the gnarled and twisted flesh marked with the unmistakable striations of the knout prince hastily covered him for it was not nice to look upon  we were there a weary time and sometimes men got away to the south but they always came back so when we who hailed from yeddo bay rose in the night and took the guns from the guards we went to the north and the land was very large with plains soggy with water and great forests and the cold came with much snow on the ground and no man knew the way weary months we journeyed through the endless foresti do not remember now for there was little food and often we lay down to die but at last we came to the cold sea and but three were left to look upon it one had shipped from yeddo as captain and he knew in his head the lay of the great lands and of the place where men may cross from one to the other on the ice and he led usi do not know it was so longtill there were but two when we came to that place we found five of the strange people which live in that country and they had dogs and skins and we were very poor we fought in the snow till they died and the captain died and the dogs and skins were mine then i crossed on the ice which was broken and once i drifted till a gale from the west put me upon the shore and after that golovin bay pastilik and the priest then south south to the warm sunlands where first i wandered  but the sea was no longer fruitful and those who went upon it after the seal went to little profit and great risk the fleets scattered and the captains and the men had no word of those i sought so i turned away from the ocean which never rests and went among the lands where the trees the houses and the mountains sit always in one place and do not move i journeyed far and came to learn many things even to the way of reading and writing from books it was well i should do this for it came upon me that unga must know these things and that someday when the time was metweyou understand when the time was met  so i drifted like those little fish which raise a sail to the wind but cannot steer but my eyes and my ears were open always and i went among men who traveled much for i knew they had but to see those i sought to remember at last there came a man fresh from the mountains with pieces of rock in which the free gold stood to the size of peas and he had heard he had met he knew them they were rich he said and lived in the place where they drew the gold from the ground  it was in a wild country and very far away but in time i came to the camp hidden between the mountains where men worked night and day out of the sight of the sun yet the time was not come i listened to the talk of the people he had gone awaythey had gone awayto england it was said in the matter of bringing men with much money together to form companies i saw the house they had lived in more like a palace such as one sees in the old countries in the nighttime i crept in through a window that i might see in what manner he treated her i went from room to room and in such way thought kings and queens must live it was all so very good and they all said he treated her like a queen and many marveled as to what breed of woman she was for there was other blood in her veins and she was different from the women of akatan and no one knew her for what she was aye she was a queen but i was a chief and the son of a chief and i had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead  but why so many words i was a sailorman and knew the way of the ships on the seas i followed to england and then to other countries sometimes i heard of them by word of mouth sometimes i read of them in the papers yet never once could i come by them for they had much money and traveled fast while i was a poor man then came trouble upon them and their wealth slipped away one day like a curl of smoke the papers were full of it at the time but after that nothing was said and i knew they had gone back where more gold could be got from the ground  they had dropped out of the world being now poor and so i wandered from camp to camp even north to the kootenay country where i picked up the cold scent they had come and gone some said this way and some that and still others that they had gone to the country of the yukon and i went this way and i went that ever journeying from place to place till it seemed i must grow weary of the world which was so large but in the kootenay i traveled a bad trail and a long trail with a breed of the northwest who saw fit to die when the famine pinched he had been to the yukon by an unknown way over the mountains and when he knew his time was near gave me the map and the secret of a place where he swore by his gods there was much gold  after that all the world began to flock into the north i was a poor man i sold myself to be a driver of dogs the rest you know i met him and her in dawson  she did not know me for i was only a stripling and her life had been large so she had no time to remember the one who had paid for her an untold price  so you bought me from my term of service i went back to bring things about in my own way for i had waited long and now that i had my hand upon him was in no hurry  as i say i had it in mind to do my own way for i read back in my life through all i had seen and suffered and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the russian seas as you know i led him into the easthim and ungainto the east where many have gone and few returned i led them to the spot where the bones and the curses of men lie with the gold which they may not have  the way was long and the trail unpacked our dogs were many and ate much nor could our sleds carry till the break of spring we must come back before the river ran free so here and there we cached grub that our sleds might be lightened and there be no chance of famine on the back trip at the mcquestion there were three men and near them we built a cache as also did we at the mayo where was a hunting camp of a dozen pellys which had crossed the divide from the south  after that as we went on into the east we saw no men only the sleeping river the moveless forest and the white silence of the north as i say the way was long and the trail unpacked sometimes in a days toil we made no more than eight miles or ten and at night we slept like dead men and never once did they dream that i was naass head man of akatan the righter of wrongs  we now made smaller caches and in the nighttime it was a small matter to go back on the trail we had broken and change them in such way that one might deem the wolverines the thieves again there be places where there is a fall to the river and the water is unruly and the ice makes above and is eaten away beneath  in such a spot the sled i drove broke through and the dogs and to him and unga it was ill luck but no more and there was much grub on that sled and the dogs the strongest  but he laughed for he was strong of life and gave the dogs that were left little grub till we cut them from the harnesses one by one and fed them to their mates we would go home light he said traveling and eating from cache to cache with neither dogs nor sleds which was true for our grub was very short and the last dog died in the traces the night we came to the gold and the bones and the curses of men  to reach that placeand the map spoke truein the heart of the great mountains we cut ice steps against the wall of a divide one looked for a valley beyond but there was no valley the snow spread away level as the great harvest plains and here and there about us mighty mountains shoved their white heads among the stars and midway on that strange plain which should have been a valley the earth and the snow fell away straight down toward the heart of the world  had we not been sailormen our heads would have swung round with the sight but we stood on the dizzy edge that we might see a way to get down and on one side and one side only the wall had fallen away till it was like the slope of the decks in a topsail breeze i do not know why this thing should be so but it was so it is the mouth of hell he said let us go down and we went down  and on the bottom there was a cabin built by some man of logs which he had cast down from above it was a very old cabin for men had died there alone at different times and on pieces of birch bark which were there we read their last words and their curses  one had died of scurvy anothers partner had robbed him of his last grub and powder and stolen away a third had been mauled by a baldface grizzly a fourth had hunted for game and starvedand so it went and they had been loath to leave the gold and had died by the side of it in one way or another and the worthless gold they had gathered yellowed the floor of the cabin like in a dream  but his soul was steady and his head clear this man i had led thus far we have nothing to eat he said and we will only look upon this gold and see whence it comes and how much there be then we will go away quick before it gets into our eyes and steals away our judgment and in this way we may return in the end with more grub and possess it all so we looked upon the great vein which cut the wall of the pit as a true vein should and we measured it and traced it from above and below and drove the stakes of the claims and blazed the trees in token of our rights then our knees shaking with lack of food and a sickness in our bellies and our hearts chugging close to our mouths we climbed the mighty wall for the last time and turned our faces to the back trip  the last stretch we dragged unga between us and we fell often but in the end we made the cache and lo there was no grub it was well done for he thought it the wolverines and damned them and his gods in one breath but unga was brave and smiled and put her hand in his till i turned away that i might hold myself we will rest by the fire she said till morning and we will gather strength from our moccasins so we cut the tops of our moccasins in strips and boiled them half of the night that we might chew them and swallow them and in the morning we talked of our chance the next cache was five days journey we could not make it we must find game  we will go forth and hunt he said  yes said i we will go forth and hunt and he ruled that unga stay by the fire and save her strength and we went forth he in quest of the moose and i to the cache i had changed but i ate little so they might not see in me much strength and in the night he fell many times as he drew into camp and i too made to suffer great weakness stumbling over my snowshoes as though each step might be my last and we gathered strength from our moccasins  he was a great man his soul lifted his body to the last nor did he cry aloud save for the sake of unga on the second day i followed him that i might not miss the end and he lay down to rest often that night he was near gone but in the morning he swore weakly and went forth again he was like a drunken man and i looked many times for him to give up but his was the strength of the strong and his soul the soul of a giant for he lifted his body through all the weary day and he shot two ptarmigan but would not eat them he needed no fire they meant life but his thought was for unga and he turned toward camp  he no longer walked but crawled on hand and knee through the snow i came to him and read death in his eyes even then it was not too late to eat of the ptarmigan he cast away his rifle and carried the birds in his mouth like a dog i walked by his side upright and he looked at me during the moments he rested and wondered that i was so strong i could see it though he no longer spoke and when his lips moved they moved without sound  as i say he was a great man and my heart spoke for softness but i read back in my life and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the russian seas besides unga was mine and i had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead  and in this manner we came through the white forest with the silence heavy upon us like a damp sea mist and the ghosts of the past were in the air and all about us and i saw the yellow beach of akatan and the kayaks racing home from the fishing and the houses on the rim of the forest and the men who had made themselves chiefs were there the lawgivers whose blood i bore and whose blood i had wedded in unga aye and yashnoosh walked with me the wet sand in his hair and his war spear broken as he fell upon it still in his hand and i knew the time was meet and saw in the eyes of unga the promise  as i say we came thus through the forest till the smell of the camp smoke was in our nostrils and i bent above him and tore the ptarmigan from his teeth  he turned on his side and rested the wonder mounting in his eyes and the hand which was under slipping slow toward the knife at his hip but i took it from him smiling close in his face even then he did not understand so i made to drink from black bottles and to build high upon the snow a pileof goods and to live again the things which had happened on the night of my marriage i spoke no word but he understood yet was he unafraid there was a sneer to his lips and cold anger and he gathered new strength with the knowledge it was not far but the snow was deep and he dragged himself very slow  once he lay so long i turned him over and gazed into his eyes and sometimes he looked forth and sometimes death and when i loosed him he struggled on again in this way we came to the fire unga was at his side on the instant his lips moved without sound then he pointed at me that unga might understand and after that he lay in the snow very still for a long while even now is he there in the snow  i said no word till i had cooked the ptarmigan then i spoke to her in her own tongue which she had not heard in many years she straightened herself so and her eyes were wonderwide and she asked who i was and where i had learned that speech  i am naass i said  you she said you and she crept close that she might look upon me  yes i answered i am naass head man of akatan the last of the blood as you are the last of the blood and she laughed by all the things i have seen and the deeds i have done may i never hear such a laugh again it put the chill to my soul sitting there in the white silence alone with death and this woman who laughed  come i said for i thought she wandered eat of the food and let us be gone it is a far fetch from here to akatan but she shoved her face in his yellow mane and laughed till it seemed the heavens must fall about our ears i had thought she would be overjoyed at the sight of me and eager to go back to the memory of old times but this seemed a strange form to take  come i cried taking her strong by the hand the way is long and dark let us hurry where she asked sitting up and ceasing from her strange mirth  to akatan i answered intent on the light to grow on her face at the thought but it became like his with a sneer to the lips and cold anger  yes she said we will go hand in hand to akatan you and i and we will live in the dirty huts and eat of the fish and oil and bring forth a spawna spawn to be proud of all the days of our life we will forget the world and be happy very happy it is good most good come let us hurry let us go back to akatan and she ran her hand through his yellow hair and smiled in a way which was not good and there was no promise in her eyes  i sat silent and marveled at the strangeness of woman i went back to the night when he dragged her from me and she screamed and tore at his hairat his hair which now she played with and would not leave then i remembered the price and the long years of waiting and i gripped her close and dragged her away as he had done and she held back even as on that night and fought like a shecat for its whelp and when the fire was between us and the man i loosed her and she sat and listened and i told her of all that lay between of all that had happened to me on strange seas of all that i had done in strange lands of my weary quest and the hungry years and the promise which had been mine from the first aye i told all even to what had passed that day between the man and me and in the days yet young and as i spoke i saw the promise grow in her eyes full and large like the break of dawn and i read pity there the tenderness of woman the love the heart and the soul of unga and i was a stripling again for the look was the look of unga as she ran up the beach laughing to the home of her mother the stern unrest was gone and the hunger and the weary waiting  the time was met i felt the call of her breast and it seemed there i must pillow my head and forget she opened her arms to me and i came against her then sudden the hate flamed in her eye her hand was at my hip and once twice she passed the knife  dog she sneered as she flung me into the snow swine and then she laughed till the silence cracked and went back to her dead  as i say once she passed the knife and twice but she was weak with hunger and it was not meant that i should die yet was i minded to stay in that place and to close my eyes in the last long sleep with those whose lives had crossed with mine and led my feet on unknown trails but there lay a debt upon me which would not let me rest  and the way was long the cold bitter and there was little grub the pellys had found no moose and had robbed my cache and so had the three white men but they lay thin and dead in their cabins as i passed after that i do not remember till i came here and found food and firemuch fire as he finished he crouched closely even jealously over the stove for a long while the slushlamp shadows played tragedies upon the wall  but unga cried prince the vision still strong upon him  unga she would not eat of the ptarmigan she lay with her arms about his neck her face deep in his yellow hair i drew the fire close that she might not feel the frost but she crept to the other side and i built a fire there yet it was little good for she would not eat and in this manner they still lie up there in the snow  and you asked malemute kid  i do not know but akatan is small and i have little wish to go back and live on the edge of the world yet is there small use in life i can go to constantine and he will put irons upon me and one day they will tie a piece of rope so and i will sleep good yetno i do not know but kid protested prince this is murder hush commanded malemute kid there be things greater than our wisdom beyond our justice the right and the wrong of this we cannot say and it is not for us to judge naass drew yet closer to the fire there was a great silence and in each mans eyes many pictures came and went    the end
