on this headthe morality of savages     preface to new impression   when this book first appeared 1886 the philological school of interpretation of religion and myth being then still powerful in england was criticised and opposed by the author in science as on the turkish throne of old amurath to amurath succeeds the philological theories of religion and myth have now yielded to anthropological methods the centre of the anthropological position was the ghost theory of mr herbert spencer the animistic theory of mr e r tylor according to whom the propitiation of ancestral and other spirits leads to polytheism and thence to monotheism in the second edition 1901 of this work the author argued that the belief in a relatively supreme being anthropomorphic was as old as and might be even older than animistic religion this theory he exhibited at greater length and with a larger collection of evidence in his making of religion  since 1901 a great deal of fresh testimony as to what mr howitt styles the all father in savage and barbaric religions has accrued as regards this being in africa the reader may consult the volumes of the new series of the journal of the anthropological institute which are full of african evidence not as yet discussed to my knowledge by any writer on the history of religion as late as man for july 1906 no 66 mr parkinson published interesting yoruba legends about oleron the maker and father of men and oro the master of the bull roarer  from australia we have mr howitts account of the all father in his native tribes of southeast australia with the account of the all father of the central australian tribe the kaitish in north central tribes of australia by messrs spencer and gillen 1904 also the euahlayi tribe by mrs langley parker 1906 these masterly books are indispensable to all students of the subject while in messrs spencer and gillens work cited and in their earlier native tribes of central australia we are introduced to savages who offer an elaborate animistic theory and are said to show no traces of the all father belief  the books of messrs spencer and gillen also present much evidence as to a previously unknown form of totemism in which the totem is not hereditary and does not regulate marriage this prevails among the arunta nation and the kaitish tribe in the opinion of mr spencer report australian association for advancement of science 1904 and of mr j g frazer fortnightly review september 1905 this is the earliest surviving form of totemism and mr frazer suggests an animistic origin for the institution i have criticised these views in the secret of the totem 1905 and proposed a different solution of the problem see also primitive and advanced totemism in journal of the anthropological institute july 1906 in the works mentioned will be found references to other sources of information as to these questions which are still sub judice mrs bates who has been studying the hitherto almost unknown tribes of western australia promises a book on their beliefs and institutions and mr n w thomas is engaged on a volume on australian institutions in this place the author can only direct attention to these novel sources and to the promised third edition of mr frazers the golden bough  a l     preface to new edition   the original edition of myth ritual and religion published in 1887 has long been out of print in revising the book i have brought it into line with the ideas expressed in the second part of my making of religion 1898 and have excised certain passages which as the book first appeared were inconsistent with its main thesis in some cases the original passages are retained in notes to show the nature of the development of the authors opinions a fragment or two of controversy has been deleted and chapters xi and xii on the religion of the lowest races have been entirely rewritten on the strength of more recent or earlier information lately acquired the gist of the book as it stands now and as it originally stood is contained in the following lines from the preface of 1887 while the attempt is made to show that the wilder features of myth survive from or were borrowed from or were imitated from the ideas of people in the savage condition of thought the existenceeven among savagesof comparatively pure if inarticulate religious beliefs is insisted on throughout to that opinion i adhere and i trust that it is now expressed with more consistency than in the first edition i have seen reason more and more to doubt the validity of the ghost theory or animistic hypothesis as explanatory of the whole fabric of religion and i present arguments against mr tylors contention that the higher conceptions of savage faith are borrowed from missionaries1 it is very possible however that mr tylor has arguments more powerful than those contained in his paper of 1892 for our information is not yet adequate to a scientific theory of the origin of religion and probably never will be behind the races whom we must regard as nearest the beginning are their unknown ancestors from a dateless past men as human as ourselves but men concerning whose psychical mental and moral condition we can only form conjectures among them religion arose in circumstances of which we are necessarily ignorant thus i only venture on a surmise as to the germ of a faith in a maker if i am not to say creator and judge of men but as to whether the higher religious belief or the lower mythical stories came first we are at least certain that the christian conception of god given pure was presently entangled by the popular fancy of europe in new marchen about the deity the madonna her son and the apostles here beyond possibility of denial pure belief came first fanciful legend was attached after i am inclined to surmise that this has always been the case and in the pages on the legend of zeus i show the processes of degeneration of mythical accretions on a faith in a heavengod in action that the feeling of religious devotion attests high faculties in early man such as are often denied to men who cannot count up to seven and that the same high mental faculties would infallibly lead him as long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed to various strange superstitions and customs was the belief of mr darwin2 that is also my view and i note that the lowest savages are not yet guilty of the very worst practices sacrifice of human beings to a bloodloving god and ordeals by poison and fire to which mr darwin alludes the improvement of our science has freed us from misdeeds which are unknown to the andamanese or the australians thus there was as regards these points in morals degeneracy from savagery as society advanced and i believe that there was also degeneration in religion to say this is not to hint at a theory of supernatural revelation to the earliest men a theory which i must in limine disclaim   1 tylor limits of savage religion journal of the anthropological institute vol xxi  2 descent of man p 68 1871   in vol ii p 19 occurs a reference in a note to mr hartlands criticism of my ideas about australian gods as set forth in the making of religion mr hartland who kindly read the chapters on australian religion in this book does not consider that my note on p 19 meets the point of his argument as to the australians i mean no more than that among endless low myths some of them possess a belief in a maker of everything a primal being still in existence watching conduct punishing breaches of his laws and in some cases rewarding the good in a future life of course these are the germs of a sympathetic religion even if the being thus regarded is mixed up with immoral or humorous contradictory myths my position is not harmed by such myths which occur in all old religions and in the middle ages new myths were attached to the sacred figures of christianity in poetry and popular tales  thus if there is nothing sacred in a religion because wild or wicked fables about the gods also occur there is nothing sacred in almost any religion on earth  mr hartlands point however seems to be that in the making of religion i had selected certain australian beliefs as especially sacred and to be distinguished from others because they are inculcated at the religious mysteries of some tribes his aim then is to discover low wild immoral myths inculcated at the mysteries and thus to destroy my line drawn between religion on one hand and myth or mere folklore on the other thus there is a being named daramulun of whose rites among the coast murring i condensed the account of mr howitt1 from a statement by mr greenway2 mr hartland learned that daramuluns name is said to mean leg on one side or lame he therefore with fine humour speaks of daramulun as a creator with a game leg though when baiame is derived by two excellent linguists mr ridley and mr greenway from kamilaroi baia to make mr hartland is by no means so sure of the sense of the name it happens to be inconvenient to him let the names mean what they may mr hartland finds in an obiter dictum of mr howitt before he was initiated that daramulun is said to have died and that his spirit is now aloft who says so and where we are not informed3 and the question is important   1 j a i xiii pp 440459  2 ibid xxi p 294  3 ibid xiii p 194   for the wiraijuri in their mysteries tell a myth of cannibal conduct of daramuluns and of deceit and failure of knowledge in baiame1 of this i was unaware or neglected it for i explicitly said that i followed mr howitts account where no such matter is mentioned mr howitt in fact described the mysteries of the coast murring while the narrator of the low myths mr matthews described those of a remote tribe the wiraijuri with whom daramulun is not the chief but a subordinate person how mr matthews friends can at once hold that daramulun was destroyed by baiame their chief deity and also that daramuluns voice is heard at their rites i dont know2 nor do i know why mr hartland takes the myth of a tribe where daramulun is the evil spirit who rules the night3 and introduces it as an argument against the belief of a distant tribe where by mr howitts account daramulun is not an evil spirit but the master of all whose abode is above the sky and to whom are attributed powers of omnipotence and omnipresence or at any rate the power to do anything and to go anywhere to his direct ordinances are attributed the social and moral laws of the community4 this is not an evil spirit when mr hartland goes for scandals to a remote tribe of a different creed that he may discredit the creed of the coast murring he might as well attribute to the free kirk the errors of rome but mr hartland does it5 being cunning of fence he may reply that i also spoke loosely of wiraijuri and coast murring as indifferently daramulunites i did and i was wrong and my critic ought not to accept but to expose my error the wiraijuri daramulun who was annihilated yet who is an evil spirit that rules the night is not the murring guardian and founder of recognised ethics   1 j a i xxv p 297  2 ibid may 1895 p 419  3 ibid  4 ibid xiii pp 458 459  5 folklore ix no iv p 299   but in the wiraijuri mysteries the master baiame deceives the women as to the mysteries shocking to us but to deceive the women as to these arcana is to the australian mind in general necessary for the safety of the world moreover we have heard of a lying spirit sent to deceive prophets in a much higher creed finally in a myth of the mystery of the wiraijuri baiame is not omniscient indeed even civilised races cannot keep on the level of these religious conceptions and not to keep on that level ismythology apollo in the hymn to hermes sung on a sacred occasion needs to ask an old vinedresser for intelligence hyperion sees all and hears all but needs to be informed by his daughters of the slaughter of his kine the lord in the book of job has to ask satan whence comest thou now for the sake of dramatic effect now from pure inability to live on the level of his highest thought man mythologises and anthropomorphises in greece or israel as in australia  it does not follow that there is nothing sacred in his religion mr hartland offers me a case in point in mrs langloh parkers australian legendary tales pp 11 94 are myths of low adventures of baiame in her more australian legendary tales pp 8499 is a very poetical and charming aspect of the baiame belief mr hartland says that i will seek to put the first set of stories out of court as a kind of joke with no sacredness about it not i but the noongahburrah tribe themselves make this essential distinction mrs langloh parker says1 the former series with the low baiame myths were all such legends as are told to the black picaninnies among the present are some they would not be allowed to hear touching as they do on sacred things taboo to the young the blacks draw the line which i am said to seek to draw   1 more legendary tales p xv   in yet another case1 grotesque hunting adventures of baiame are told in the mysteries and illustrated by the sacred temporary representations in raised earth i did not know it i merely followed mr howitt but i do not doubt it my reply is that there was something sacred in greek mysteries something purifying ennobling consoling for this lobeck has collected and disparaged the evidence of pindar sophocles cicero and many others while even aristophanes as prof campbell remarks says we only have bright sun and cheerful life who have been initiated and lived piously in regard to strangers and to private citizens2 security and peace of mind in this world and for the next were we know not how borne into the hearts of pindar and sophocles in the mysteries yet if we may at all trust the fathers there were scenes of debauchery as at the mysteries of the fijians nanga there was buffoonery to amuse the boys mr howitt says of some australian rites the story of baubo is only one example and in other mysteries than the eleusinian we know of mummeries in which an absurd tale of zeus is related in connection with an oak log yet surely there was something sacred in the faith of zeus let us judge the australians as we judge greeks the precepts as to speaking the straightforward truth as to unselfishness avoidance of quarrels of wrongs to unprotected women of unnatural vices are certainly communicated in the mysteries of some tribes with in another knowledge of the name and nature of our father munganngaur that a totemistic dance or medicinedance of emu hunting is also displayed3 at certain mysteries of a given tribe and that baiame is spoken of as the hero of this ballet no more deprives the australian moral and religious teaching at the mysteries of sacred value than the stupid indecency whereby baubo made demeter laugh destroys the sacredness of the eleusinia on which pindar sophocles and cicero eloquently dwell if the australian mystae at the most solemn moment of their lives are shown a dull or dirty divine ballet daction what did sophocles see after taking a swim with his pig many things far from edifying yet the sacred element of religious hope and faith was also represented so it is in australia   1 j a i xxiv p 416  2 religion in greek literature p 259 it is to be regretted that the learned professor gives no references the greek mysteries are treated later in this volume  3 see a picture of australia 1829 p 264   these studies ought to be comparative otherwise they are worthless as mr hartland calls daramulun an eternal creator with a game leg who died he may call zeus an eternal father who swallowed his wife lay with his mother and sister made love as a swan and died nay was buried in crete i do not think that mr hartland would call zeus a ghostgod my own phrase or think that he was scoring a point against me if i spoke of the sacred and ethical characteristics of the zeus adored by eumaeus in the odyssey he would not be so humorous about zeus nor fall into an ignoratio elenchi for my point never was that any australian tribe had a pure theistic conception unsoiled and unobliterated by myth and buffoonery my argument was that among their ideas is that of a superhuman being unceasing if i may not say eternal a maker if i may not say a creator a guardian of certain by no means despicable ethics which i never proclaimed as supernormally inspired it is no reply to me to say that in or out of mysteries low fables about that being are told and buffooneries are enacted for though i say that certain high ideas are taught in mysteries i do not think i say that in mysteries no low myths are told  i take this opportunity as the earliest to apologise for an error in my making of religion concerning a passage in the primitive culture of my friend mr e b tylor mr tylor quoted1 a passage from captain john smiths history of virginia as given in pinkerton xiii pp 1339 1632 in this passage no mention occurs of a virginian deity named ahone but okee another and more truculent god is named i observed that if mr tylor had used stracheys historie of travaile 1612 he would have found a slightly varying copy of smiths text of 1632 with ahone as superior to okee i added in a note p 253 there is a description of virginia by w strachey including smiths remarks published in 1612 strachey interwove some of this work with his own ms in the british museum here as presently will be shown i erred in company with stracheys editor of 1849 and with the writer on strachey in the dictionary of national biography what mr tylor quoted from an edition of smith in 1632 had already appeared in 1612 in a book map of virginia with a description of the countrey described on the titlepage as written by captain smith though in my opinion smith may have had a collaborator there is no evidence whatever that strachey had anything to do with this book of 1612 in which there is no mention of ahone mr arber dates stracheys own ms in which ahone occurs as of 161016152 i myself for reasons presently to be alleged date the ms mainly in 16111612 if mr arber and i are right strachey must have had access to smiths ms before it was published in 1612 and we shall see how he used it my point here is that strachey mentioned ahone in ms before smiths book of 1612 was published this could not be gathered from the dedication to bacon prefixed to stracheys ms for that dedication cannot be earlier that 16183 i now ask leave to discuss the evidence for an early prechristian belief in a primal creator held by the indian tribes from plymouth in new england to roanoke island off southern virginia   1 prim cult ii p 342  2 arbers smith p cxxxiii  3 hakluyt society strachey 1849 pp xxi xxii   the god ahone  an insertion by a manifest plagiary into the work of a detected liar is not usually good evidence yet this is all the evidence it may be urged which we have for the existence of a belief in early virginia as to a good creator named ahone the matter stands thus in 16071609 the famed captain john smith endured and achieved in virginia sufferings and adventures in 1608 he sent to the council at home a ms map and description of the colony in 1609 he returned to england october in may 1610 william strachey gent arrived in virginia where he was secretary of state to lord de la warr in 1612 strachey and smith were both in england in that year barnes of oxford published a map of virginia with a description etc written by captain smith according to the titlepage there was annexed a compilation from various sources edited by w s that is not william strachey but dr william symonds in the same year 1612 or in 1611 william strachey wrote his historie of travaile into virginia britannia at least as far as page 124 of the hakluyt edition of 18491   1 for proof see p 24 third line from foot of page where 1612 is indicated again see p 98 line 5 where last year is dated as 1610 about christmas which would put stracheys work at this point as actually of 1611 prior that is to smiths publication again p 124 this last year myself being at the falls of the james river i found in an indian house certain clawes which i brought away and into england   if strachey who went out with lord de la warr as secretary in 1610 returned with him as is likely he sailed for england on 28th march 1611 in that case he was in england in 1611 and the passages cited leave it dubious whether he wrote his book in 1611 1612 or in both years1   1 mr arber dates the ms 16101615 and attributes to strachey laws for virginia 1612   strachey embodies in his work considerable pieces of smiths map of virginia and description written in 1608 and published in 1612 he continually deserts smith however adding more recent information reflections and references to the ancient classics with allusions to his own travels in the levant his glossary is much more extensive than smiths and he inserts a native song of triumph over the english in the original1 now when strachey comes to the religion of the natives2 he gives eighteen pages much of it verbiage to five of smiths3 what smith 1612 says of their chief god i quote setting stracheys version 16111612 beside it   1 strachey pp 7980 he may have got the song from kemps or machumps friendly natives  2 pp 82100  3 arber pp 7479   smith published 1612  but their chiefe god they worship is the diuell him they call oke and serue him more of feare than loue they say they have conference with him and fashion themselues as near to his shape as they can imagine in their temples they have his image euile favouredly carved and then painted and adorned with chaines copper and beades and covered with a skin in such manner as the deformity may well suit with such a god by him is commonly the sepulcher of their kings   strachey written 161112  but their chief god they worship is no other indeed then the divell whome they make presentments of and shadow under the forme of an idoll which they entitle okeus and whome they worship as the romans did their hurtful god vejovis more for feare of harme then for hope of any good they saie they have conference with him and fashion themselves in their disguisments as neere to his shape as they can imagyn in every territory of a weroance is a temple and a priest peradventure two or thrie yet happie doth that weroance accompt himself who can detayne with him a quiyoughquisock of the best grave lucky well instructed in their misteryes and beloved of their god and such a one is noe lesse honoured then was dianaes priest at ephesus for whome they have their more private temples with oratories and chauneells therein according as is the dignity and reverence of the quiyoughquisock which the weroance wilbe at charge to build upon purpose sometyme twenty foote broad and a hundred in length fashioned arbour wyse after their buylding having comonly the dore opening into the east and at the west end a spence or chauncell from the body of the temple with hollow wyndings and pillers whereon stand divers black imagies fashioned to the shoulders with their faces looking down the church and where within their weroances upon a kind of biere of reedes lye buryed and under them apart in a vault low in the ground as a more secrett thing vailed with a matt sitts their okeus an image illfavouredly carved all black dressed with chaynes of perle the presentment and figure of that god say the priests unto the laity and who religiously believe what the priests saie which doth them all the harme they suffer be yt in their bodies or goods within doores or abroad and true yt is many of them are divers tymes especyally offendors shrewdly scratched as they walke alone in the woods yt may well be by the subtyle spirit the malitious enemy to mankind whome therefore to pacefie and worke to doe them good at least no harme the priests tell them they must do these and these sacrifices unto them of these and these things and thus and thus often by which meanes not only their owne children but straungers are sometimes sacrificed unto him whilst the great god the priests tell them who governes all the world and makes the sun to shine creating the moone and stars his companyons great powers and which dwell with him and by whose virtues and influences the under earth is tempered and brings forth her fruiets according to her seasons they calling ahone the good and peaceable god requires no such dutyes nor needes be sacrificed unto for he intendeth all good unto them and will doe noe harme only the displeased okeus looking into all mens accions and examining the same according to the severe scale of justice punisheth them with sicknesse beats them and strikes their ripe corn with blastings stormes and thunder clapps stirrs up warre and makes their women falce unto them such is the misery and thraldome under which sathan hath bound these wretched miscreants   i began by calling strachey a plagiary the reader will now observe that he gives far more than he takes for example his account of the temples is much more full than that of smith and he adds to smiths version the character and being of ahone as what the priests tell them i submit therefore that stracheys additions if valid for temples are not discredited for ahone merely because they are inserted in the framework of smith as far as i understand the matter smiths map of virginia 1612 is an amended copy with additions by smith or another writer of that description which he sent home to the council of virginia in november 16081 to the book of 1612 was added a portion of relations by different hands edited by w s namely dr symonds stracheys editor in 1849 regarded w s as strachey and supposed that strachey was the real author of smiths map of virginia so that in his historie of travaile strachey merely took back his own he did not take back his own he made use of smiths ms not yet published if mr arber and i rightly date stracheys ms at 161015 or 161112 why strachey acted thus it is possible to conjecture as a scholar well acquainted with virginia and as secretary for the colony he would have access to smiths ms of 1608 among the papers of the council before its publication smith professes himself no scholer2 on the other hand strachey likes to show off his latin and greek he has a curious if inaccurate knowledge of esoteric greek and roman religious antiquities and in writing of religion aims at a comparative method strachey however took the trouble to copy bits of smith into his own larger work which he never gave to the printers   1 arber p 444  2 arber p 442   now as to ahone it suits my argument to suppose that stracheys account is no less genuine than his description of the temples illustrated by a picture by john white who had been in virginia in 1589 and the account of the great hare of american mythology1 this view of a virginian creator our chief god who takes upon him this shape of a hare was got says strachey last year 1610 from a brother of the potomac king by a boy named spilman who says that smith sold him to powhattan2 in his own brief narrative spelman or spilman says nothing about the cosmogonic legend of the great hare the story came up when captain argoll was telling powhattans brother the account of creation in genesis 1610   1 strachey p 98100  2 spilmans narrative arber cxcxiv   now stracheys great hare is accepted by mythologists while ahone is regarded with suspicion ahone does not happen to suit anthropological ideas the hare suits them rather better moreover and more important there is abundant corroborative evidence for oke and for the hare michabo who says dr brinton was originally the highest divinity recognised by them powerful and beneficent beyond all others maker of the heavens and the world just like ahone in fact and dr brinton instructs us that michabo originally meant not great hare but the spirit of light1 thus originally the red men adored the spirit of light maker of the heavens and the world strachey claims no more than this for ahone now of course dr brinton may be right but i have already expressed my extreme distrust of the philological processes by which he extracts the great light spirit of light from michabo beyond a doubt in my poor opinion whatever claims michabo may have as an unique creator of earth and heavengod is lighthe owes his mythical aspect as a hare to something other than an unconscious pun in any case according to dr brinton michabo regarded as a creator is equivalent to stracheys ahone this amount of corroboration valeat quantum i may claim from the potomac indians for the belief in ahone on the james river dr brinton is notoriously not a believer in american monotheism2   1 myths of the new world p 178  2 myths of the new world p 53   the opponents of the authenticity of ahone however will certainly argue for oke or oki as a redoubted being or spirit or general name for such personages we have plentiful evidence corroborating that of smith but what evidence as to ahone corroborates that of strachey i must confess that i have no explicit corroborative evidence for ahone but then i have no accessible library of early books on virginia now it is clear that if i found and produced evidence for ahone as late as 1625 i would be met at once with the retort that between 1610 and 1625 christian ideas had contaminated the native beliefs thus if i find ahone or a deity of like attributes after a very early date he is of no use for my purpose nor do i much expect to find him but do we find winslows massachusetts god kiehtan named after 1622 i only ask for information and if we dont does that prevent mr tylor from citing kiehtan with apparent reliance on the evidence1   1 primitive culture ii p 342   again ahone though primal and creative is by stracheys account a sleeping partner he has no sacrifice and no temple or idol is recorded therefore the belief in ahone could only be discovered as a result of inquiry whereas figures of oke or okeus and his services were common and conspicuous1 as to oke i cannot quite understand mr tylors attitude summarising lafitau a late writer of 1724 mr tylor writes the whole class of spirits or demons known to the caribs by the name of cemi in algonkin as manitu in huron as oki lafitau now spells with capital letters and converts them each into a supreme being2 yet in primitive culture ii 342 1891 mr tylor had cited smiths okee with a capital letter as the chief god of the virginians in 1612 how can lafitau be said to have elevated oki into oki and so to have made a god out of a class of spirits or demons in 1724 when mr tylor had already cited smiths okee with a capital letter and as a chief god in 1612 smith rebuked for the same by mr tylor had even identified okee with the devil lafitau certainly did not begin this erroneous view of oki as a chief god among the virginians if i cannot today produce corroboration for a god named ahone i can at least show that from the north of new england to the south of virginia there is early evidence cited by mr tylor for a belief in a primal creative being closely analogous to ahone and this evidence i think distinctly proves that such a being as ahone was within the capacity of the indians in these latitudes mr tylor must have thought in 1891 that the natives were competent to a belief in a supreme deity for he said another famous native american name for the supreme deity is oki3 in the essay of 1892 however oki does not appear to exist as a gods name till 1724 we may now for earlier evidence turn to master thomas heriot that learned mathematician who spoke the indian language and was with the company which abandoned virginia on 18th june 1586 they ranged 130 miles north and 130 miles northwest of roanoke island which brings them into the neighbourhood of smiths and stracheys country heriot writes as to the native creeds they believe that there are many gods which they call mantoac but of different sorts and degrees also that there is one chiefe god that hath beene from all eternitie who as they say when he purposed first to make the world made first other gods of a principall order to be as instruments to be used in the creation and government to follow and after the sunne moone and starres as pettie gods and the instruments of the other order more principall they thinke that all the gods are of humane shape and represent them by anthropomorphic idols an idol or image kewasa the plural is kewasowok is placed in the temples where they worship pray and make many offerings good souls go to be happy with the gods the bad burn in popogusso a great pit where the sun sets the evidence for this theory of a future life as usual is that of men who died and revived again a story found in a score of widely separated regions down to our day when the death revival and revelation occurred to the founder of the arapahoe new religion of the ghost dance the belief works for righteousness the common sort have great care to avoyde torment after death and to enjoy blesse also they have great respect to their governors   1 okees image as early as 1607 was borne into battle against smith who captured the god arber p 393 ahone was not thus en evidence  2 journal of anthrop inst feb 1892 pp 285 286  3 prim cult ii p 342   this belief in a chief god from all eternitie that is of unexplained origin may not be convenient to some speculators but it exactly corroborates stracheys account of ahone as creator with subordinates the evidence is of 1586 twentysix years before strachey and like strachey heriot attributes the whole scheme of belief to the priestes this is the sum of their religion which i learned by having speciall familiaritie with some of their priests1 i see no escape from the conclusion that the virginians believed as heriot says they did except the device of alleging that they promptly borrowed some of heriots ideas and maintained that these ideas had ever been their own heriot certainly did not recognise the identity through conversing with us they were brought into great doubts of their owne religion and no small admiration of ours of which many desired to learne more than we had the meanes for want of utterance in their language to expresse so heriot could not be subtle in the native tongue heriot did what he could to convert them i did my best to make his immortall glory knowne his efforts were chiefly successful by virtue of the savage admiration of our guns mathematical instruments and so forth these sources of an awakened interest in christianity would vanish with the total destruction and discomfiture of the colony unless a few captives later massacred taught our religion to the natives2   1 according to strachey heriot could speak the native language  2 heriots narrative pp 3739 quaritch london 1893   i shall cite another early example of a new england deity akin to ahone with a deputy a friend of sorcerers like okee this account is in smiths general history of new england 16061624 we sent out a colony in 1607 they all returned in the yeere 1608 esteeming the country a cold barren mountainous rocky desart i am apt to believe that they did not plant the fructifying seeds of grace among the natives in 16071608 but the missionary efforts of french traders may of course have been blessed nor can i deny that a yellowhaired man whose corpse was found in 1620 with some objects of iron may have converted the natives to such beliefs as they possessed we are told however that these tenets were of ancestral antiquity i cite e winslow as edited by smith 162324  those where in this plantation new plymouth say kiehtan1 made all the other gods also one man and one woman and with them all mankinde but how they became so dispersed they know not they say that at first there was no king but kiehtan that dwelleth far westerly above the heavens whither all good men go when they die and have plentie of all things the bad go thither also and knock at the door but the door is shut he bids them go wander in endless want and misery for they shall not stay there they never saw kiehtan2 but they hold it a great charge and dutie that one race teach another and to him they make feasts and cry and sing for plenty and victory or anything that is good   1 in 1873 mr tylor regarded dr brintons etymology of kiehtan as  kittanitowit  great living spirit as plausible in his edition of 1891 he omits this etymology personally i entirely distrust the philological theories of the original sense of old divine names as a general rule  2 they never saw kiehtan so about 1854 the common answer of intelligent black fellows on the barwon when asked if they know baiame is this kamil zaia zummi baiame zaia winuzgulda i have not seen baiame i have heard or perceived him if asked who made the sky the earth the animals and man they always answer baiame daramulun according to the same authority in langs queensland was the familiar of sorcerers and appeared as a serpent this answers as i show to hobamock the subordinate power to kiehtan in new england and to okee the familiar of sorcerers in virginia ridley j a i 1872 p 277   they have another power they call hobamock which we conceive the devill and upon him they call to cure their wounds and diseases when they are curable he persuades them he sent them because they have displeased him but if they be mortal then he saith kiehtan sent them which makes them never call on him in their sickness they say this hobamock appears to them sometimes like a man a deer or an eagle but most commonly like a snake not to all but to their powahs to cure diseases and undeses and these are such as conjure in virginia and cause the people to do what they list winslow or rather smith editing winslow here had already said they believe as do the virginians of many divine powers yet of one above all the rest as the southern virginians call their chief god kewassa an error and that we now inhabit oke the massachusetts call their great god kiehtan1   1 arber pp 767 768   here then in heriot 1586 strachey 161112 and winslow 1622 we find fairly harmonious accounts of a polydaemonism with a chief primal creative being above and behind it a being unnamed and ahone and kiehtan  is all this invention or was all this derived from europeans before 1586 and if so from what europeans mr tylor in 1873 wrote after due allowance made for misrendering of savage answers and importation of white mens thoughts it can hardly be judged that a divine being whose characteristics are often so unlike what european intercourse would have suggested and who is heard of by such early explorers among such distant tribes could be a deity of foreign origin now he can hardly be altogether a deity of foreign origin1 i agree with mr tylors earlier statement in my opinion ahoneokeus kiehtanhobamock correspond the first pair to the usually unseen australian baiame a crystal or hypnotic vision of baiame scarcely counts while the second pair okeus and hobamock answer to the australian familiars of sorcerers koin and brewin the american powers being those of peoples on a higher level of culture like tharramulun where baiame is supreme hobamock appears as a snake asclepius   1 prim cult ii 340 1873 1892   for all these reasons i am inclined to accept stracheys ahone as a veritable element in virginian belief without temple or service such a being was not conspicuous like okee and other gods which had idols and sacrifices  as far as i see strachey has no theory to serve by inventing ahone he asks how any races if descended from the people of the first creation should maintain so general and gross a defection from the true knowledge of god he is reduced to suppose that as descendants of ham they inherit the ignorance of true godliness p 45 the children of shem and japheth alone retained until the coming of the messias the only knowledge of the eternal and neverchanging trinity the virginians on the other hand fell heir to the ignorance and fearful and superstitious instinct of nature of ham p 40 ahone therefore is not invented by strachey to bolster up a theory held by strachey of an inherited revelation or of a sensus numinis which could not go wrong unless a proof be given that strachey had a theory or any other purpose to serve by inventing ahone i cannot at present come into the opinion that he gratuitously fabled though he may have unconsciously exaggerated  what were stracheys sources he was for nine months if not more in the colony he had travelled at least 115 miles up the james river he occasionally suggests modifications of smiths map he refers to smiths adventures and his glossary is very much larger than smiths its accuracy i leave to american linguists such a witness despite his admitted use of smiths text if it is really all by smith throughout is not to be despised and he is not despised in america1 strachey it is true had not like smith been captured by indians and either treated with perfect kindness and consideration as smith reported at the time or tied to a tree and threatened with arrows and laid out to have his head knocked in with a stone as he alleged sixteen years later strachey not being captured did not owe his release 1 to the magnanimity of powhattan 2 to his own ingenious lies 3 to the intercession of pocahontas as smith and his friends for him at various dates inconsistently declared smith certainly saw more of the natives at home strachey brought a more studious mind to what he could learn of their customs and ideas and is not a convicted braggart i conjecture that one of stracheys sources was a native named kemps smith had seized kemps and kinsock in 1609 unknown authorities powell and todkill represent these two savages as the most exact villaines in the country2 they were made to labour in fetters then were set at liberty but little desired it3 some souldiers ran away to the liberated kemps who brought them back to smith4 why kemps and his friend are called two of the most exact villains in the country does not appear kemps died of the surveye scurvey probably at jamestown in 161011 he was much made of by lord de la warr could speak a pretty deal of our english and came orderly to church every day to prayers he gave strachey the names of powhattans wives and told him truly or not that pocahontas was married about 1610 to an indian named kocoum5 i offer the guess that kemps and machumps who came and went from pocahontas and recited an indian prayer which strachey neglected to copy out may have been among stracheys authorities i shall of course be told that kemps picked up ahone at church this did not strike strachey as being the fact he had no opinion of the creed in which ahone was a factor the misery and thraldome under which sathan has bound these wretched miscreants according to strachey the priests far from borrowing any part of our faith feare and tremble lest the knowledge of god and of our saviour jesus christ be taught in these parts   1 arber cxvii strachey mentions that before his arrival in virginia pocahontas turned cartwheels naked in jamestown being then under twelve and not yet wearing the apron smith says she was ten in 1608 but does not mention the cartwheels later he found it convenient to put her age at twelve or thirteen in 1608 most american scholars such as mr adams entirely distrust the romantic later narratives of smith  2 the proeeedings etc by w s arber p 151  3 ibid p 155  4 ibid p 157  5 strachey pp 54 55   strachey is therefore for putting down the priests and like smith indeed here borrowing from smith accuses them of sacrificing children to smiths statement that such a rite was worked at quiyoughcohanock strachey adds that sir george percy who was with smith was at and observed a similar mystery at kecoughtan it is plain that the rite was not a sacrifice but a bora or initiation and the parallel of the spartan flogging of boys with the retreat of the boys and their instructors is very close and of course unnoted by classical scholars except mr frazer strachey ends with the critical remark that we shall not know all the certainty of the religion and mysteries till we can capture some of the priests or quiyoughquisocks  students who have access to a good library of americana may do more to elucidate ahone i regard him as in a line with kiehtan and the god spoken of by heriot and do not believe 1 that strachey lied 2 that natives deceived strachey 3 that ahone was borrowed from the god of captain smith     myth ritual and religion    chapter i systems of mythology  definitions of religioncontradictory evidencebelief in

mythologistscriticism by eusebiusmodern mythological systemsmr max mullermannhardt   the word religion may be and has been employed in many different senses and with a perplexing width of significance no attempt to define the word is likely to be quite satisfactory but almost any definition may serve the purpose of an argument if the writer who employs it states his meaning frankly and adheres to it steadily an example of the confusions which may arise from the use of the term religion is familiar to students dr j d lang wrote concerning the native races of australia they have nothing whatever of the character of religion or of religious observances to distinguish them from the beasts that perish yet in the same book dr lang published evidence assigning to the natives belief in turramullun the chief of demons who is the author of disease mischief and wisdom1 the belief in a superhuman author of disease mischief and wisdom is certainly a religious belief not conspicuously held by the beasts yet all religion was denied to the australians by the very author who prints in however erroneous a style an account of part of their creed this writer merely inherited the old missionary habit of speaking about the god of a nonchristian people as a demon or an evil spirit   1 see primitive culture second edition i 419   dr langs negative opinion was contradicted in testimony published by himself an appendix by the rev mr ridley containing evidence of the belief in baiame those who have learned that god is the name by which we speak of the creator say that baiame is god1   1 langs queensland p 445 1861   as a minimum definition of religion mr tylor has suggested the belief in spiritual beings against this it may be urged that while we have no definite certainty that any race of men is destitute of belief in spiritual beings yet certain moral and creative deities of low races do not seem to be envisaged as spiritual at all they are regarded as existences as beings unconditioned by time space or death and nobody appears to have put the purely metaphysical question are these beings spiritual or material1 now if a race were discovered which believed in such beings yet had no faith in spirits that race could not be called irreligious as it would have to be called in mr tylors minimum definition almost certainly no race in this stage of belief in nothing but unconditioned but not expressly spiritual beings is extant yet such a belief may conceivably have existed before men had developed the theory of spirits at all and such a belief in creative and moral unconditioned beings not alleged to be spiritual could not be excluded from a definition of religion2   1 see the making of religion pp 201210  2 the history of the jews nay the history of our own mind proves to demonstration that the thought of god is a far easier thought and a far earlier than that of a spirit father tyrrell s j the month october 1898 as to the jews the question is debated as to our own infancy we are certainly taught about god before we are likely to be capable of the metaphysical notion of spirit but we can scarcely reason from children in christian houses to the infancy of the race   for these reasons we propose merely for the purpose of the present work to define religion as the belief in a primal being a maker undying usually moral without denying that the belief in spiritual beings even if immoral may be styled religious our definition is expressly framed for the purpose of the argument because that argument endeavours to bring into view the essential conflict between religion and myth we intend to show that this conflict between the religious and the mythical conception is present not only where it has been universally recognised in the faiths of the ancient civilised peoples as in greece rome india and egypt but also in the ideas of the lowest known savages  it may of course be argued that the belief in creator is itself a myth however that may be the attitude of awe and of moral obedience in face of such a supposed being is religious in the sense of the christian religion whereas the fabrication of fanciful humorous and wildly irrational fables about that being or others is essentially mythical in the ordinary significance of that word though not absent from popular christianity  now the whole crux and puzzle of mythology is why having attained in whatever way to a belief in an undying guardian master of life did mankind set to work to evolve a chronique scandaleuse about him and why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which we find in all mythologies  in answering or trying to answer these questions we cannot go behind the beliefs of the races now most immersed in savage ignorance about the psychology of races yet more undeveloped we can have no historical knowledge among the lowest known tribes we usually find just as in ancient greece the belief in a deathless father master maker and also the crowd of humorous obscene fanciful myths which are in flagrant contradiction with the religious character of that belief that belief is what we call rational and even elevated the myths on the other hand are what we call irrational and debasing we regard low savages as very irrational and debased characters consequently the nature of their myths does not surprise us their religious conception however of a father or master of life seems out of keeping with the nature of the savage mind as we understand it still there the religious conception actually is and it seems to follow that we do not wholly understand the savage mind or its unknown antecedents in any case there the facts are as shall be demonstrated however the ancestors of australians or andamanese or hurons arrived at their highest religious conception they decidedly possess it1 the development of their mythical conceptions is accounted for by those qualities of their minds which we do understand and shall illustrate at length for the present we can only say that the religious conception uprises from the human intellect in one mood that of earnest contemplation and submission while the mythical ideas uprise from another mood that of playful and erratic fancy these two moods are conspicuous even in christianity the former that of earnest and submissive contemplation declares itself in prayers hymns and the dim religious light of cathedrals the second mood that of playful and erratic fancy is conspicuous in the buffoonery of miracle plays in marchen these burlesque popular tales about our lord and the apostles and in the hideous and grotesque sculptures on sacred edifices the two moods are present and in conflict through the whole religious history of the human race they stand as near each other and as far apart as love and lust   1 the hypothesis that the conception was borrowed from european creeds will be discussed later see too are savage gods borrowed from missionaries nineteenth century january 1899   it will later be shown that even some of the most backward savages make a perhaps halfconscious distinction between their mythology and their religion as to the former they are communicative as to the latter they jealously guard their secret in sacred mysteries it is improbable that reflective black fellows have been morally shocked by the flagrant contradictions between their religious conceptions and their mythical stories of the divine beings but human thought could not come into explicit clearness of consciousness without producing the sense of shock and surprise at these contradictions between the religion and the myth of the same god of this we proceed to give examples  in greece as early as the sixth century b c we are all familiar with xenophanes poem1 complaining that the gods were credited with the worst crimes of mortalsin fact with abominations only known in the orgies of nero and elagabalus we hear pindar refusing to repeat the tale which told him the blessed were cannibals2 in india we read the pious brahmanic attempts to expound decently the myths which made indra the slayer of a brahman the sinner that is of the unpardonable sin in egypt too we study the priestly or philosophic systems by which the clergy strove to strip the burden of absurdity and sacrilege from their own deities from all these efforts of civilised and pious believers to explain away the stories about their own gods we may infer one factthe most important to the student of mythologythe fact that myths were not evolved in times of clear civilised thought it is when greece is just beginning to free her thought from the bondage of too concrete language when she is striving to coin abstract terms that her philosophers and poets first find the myths of greece a stumblingblock   1 ritter and preller hist philos gothae 1869 p 82  2 olympic odes i myerss translation to me it is impossible to call one of the blessed gods a cannibal meet it is for a man that concerning the gods he speak honourably for the reproach is less of thee son of tantalus i will speak contrariwise to them who have gone before me in avoiding the story of the cannibal god however pindar tells a tale even more offensive to our morality   all early attempts at an interpretation of mythology are so many efforts to explain the myths on some principle which shall seem not unreasonable to men living at the time of the explanation therefore the pious remonstrances and the forced constructions of early thinkers like xenophanes of poets like pindar of all ancient homeric scholars and pagan apologists from theagenes of rhegium 525 b c the early homeric commentator to porphyry almost the last of the heathen philosophers are so many proofs that to greece as soon as she had a reflective literature the myths of greece seemed impious and irrational the essays of the native commentators on the veda in the same way are endeavours to put into myths felt to be irrational and impious a meaning which does not offend either piety or reason we may therefore conclude that it was not men in an early stage of philosophic thought as philosophy is now understoodnot men like empedocles and heraclitus nor reasonably devout men like eumaeus the pious swineherd of the odysseywho evolved the blasphemous myths of greece of egypt and of india we must look elsewhere for an explanation we must try to discover some actual and demonstrable and widely prevalent condition of the human mind in which tales that even to remote and rudimentary civilisations appeared irrational and unnatural would seem natural and rational to discover this intellectual condition has been the aim of all mythologists who did not believe that myth is a divine tradition depraved by human weakness or a distorted version of historical events  before going further it is desirable to set forth what our aim is and to what extent we are seeking an interpretation of mythology it is not our purpose to explain every detail of every ancient legend either as a distorted historical fact or as the result of this or that confusion of thought caused by forgetfulness of the meanings of language or in any other way nay we must constantly protest against the excursions of too venturesome ingenuity myth is so ancient so complex so full of elements that it is vain labour to seek a cause for every phenomenon we are chiefly occupied with the quest for an historical condition of the human intellect to which the element in myths regarded by us as irrational shall seem rational enough if we can prove that such a state of mind widely exists among men and has existed that state of mind may be provisionally considered as the fount and origin of the myths which have always perplexed men in a reasonable modern mental condition again if it can be shown that this mental stage was one through which all civilised races have passed the universality of the mythopoeic mental condition will to some extent explain the universal diffusion of the stories  now in all mythologies whether savage or civilised and in all religions where myths intrude there exist two factorsthe factor which we now regard as rational and that which we moderns regard as irrational the former element needs little explanation the latter has demanded explanation ever since human thought became comparatively instructed and abstract  to take an example even in the myths of savages there is much that still seems rational and transparent if savages tell us that some wise being taught them all the simple arts of life the use of fire of the bow and arrow the barbing of hooks and so forth we understand them at once nothing can be more natural than that man should believe in an original inventor of the arts and should tell tales about the imaginary discoverers if the real heroes be forgotten so far all is plain sailing but when the savage goes on to say that he who taught the use of fire or who gave the first marriage laws was a rabbit or a crow or a dog or a beaver or a spider then we are at once face to face with the element in myths which seems to us irrational again among civilised peoples we read of the pure allseeing varuna in the vedas to whom sin is an offence we read of indra the lord of thunder borne in his chariot the giver of victory the giver of wealth to the pious here once more all seems natural and plain the notion of a deity who guides the whirlwind and directs the storm a god of battles a god who blesses righteousness is familiar to us and intelligible but when we read how indra drank himself drunk and committed adulteries with asura women and got himself born from the same womb as a bull and changed himself into a quail or a ram and suffered from the most abject physical terror and so forth then we are among myths no longer readily intelligible here we feel are irrational stories of which the original ideas in their natural sense can hardly have been conceived by men in a pure and rational early civilisation again in the religions of even the lowest races such myths as these are in contradiction with the ethical elements of the faith  if we look at greek religious tradition we observe the coexistence of the rational and the apparently irrational elements the rational myths are those which represent the gods as beautiful and wise beings the artemis of the odyssey taking her pastime in the chase of boars and swift deer while with her the wild woodnymphs disport them and high over them all she rears her brow and is easily to be known where all are fair1 is a perfectly rational mythic representation of a divine being we feel even now that the conception of a queen and goddess chaste and fair the abbess as paul de saintvictor calls her of the woodlands is a beautiful and natural fancy which requires no explanation on the other hand the artemis of arcadia who is confused with the nymph callisto who again is said to have become a shebear and later a star and the brauronian artemis whose maiden ministers danced a beardance2 are goddesses whose legend seems unnatural and needs to be made intelligible or again there is nothing not explicable and natural in the conception of the olympian zeus as represented by the great chryselephantine statue of zeus at olympia or in the homeric conception of zeus as a god who turns everywhere his shining eyes and beholds all things and protects the righteous and deals good or evil fortune to men but the zeus whose grave was shown in crete or the zeus who played demeter an obscene trick by the aid of a ram or the zeus who in the shape of a swan became the father of castor and pollux or the zeus who deceived hera by means of a feigned marriage with an inanimate object or the zeus who was afraid of attes or the zeus who made love to women in the shape of an ant or a cuckoo is a being whose myth is felt to be unnatural and bewildering3 it is this irrational and unnatural element as mr max muller says the silly senseless and savage element that makes mythology the puzzle which men have so long found it for observe greek myth does not represent merely a humorous play of fancy dealing with things religiously sacred as if by way of relief from the strained reverential contemplation of the majesty of zeus many stories of greek mythology are such as could not cross for the first time the mind of a civilised xenophanes or theagenes even in a dream this was the real puzzle   1 odyssey vi 102  2 greek word omitted compare harpokration on this word  3 these are the features in myth which provoke for example the wonder of emericdavid the lizard the wolf the dog the ass the frog and all the other brutes so common on religious monuments everywhere do they not all imply a thought which we must divine he concludes that these animals plants and monsters of myths are so many enigmas and symbols veiling some deep sacred idea allegories of some esoteric religious creed jupiter paris 1832 p lxxvii   we have offered examplessavage indian and greekof that element in mythology which as all civilised races have felt demands explanation  to be still more explicit we may draw up a brief list of the chief problems in the legendary stories attached to the old religions of the worldthe problems which it is our special purpose to notice first we have in the myths of all races the most grotesque conceptions of the character of gods when mythically envisaged beings who in religion leave little to be desired and are spoken of as holy immortal omniscient and kindly are in myth represented as fashioned in the likeness not only of man but of the beasts as subject to death as ignorant and impious  most prechristian religions had their zoomorphic or partially zoomorphic idols gods in the shape of the lower animals or with the heads and necks of the lower animals in the same way all mythologies represent the gods as fond of appearing in animal forms under these disguises they conduct many amours even with the daughters of men and greek houses were proud of their descent from zeus in the shape of an eagle or ant a serpent or a swan while cronus and the vedic tvashtri and poseidon made love as horses and apollo as a dog not less wild are the legends about the births of gods from the thigh or the head or feet or armpits of some parent while tales describing and pictures representing unspeakable divine obscenities were frequent in the mythology and in the temples of greece once more the gods were said to possess and exercise the power of turning men and women into birds beasts fishes trees and stones so that there was scarcely a familiar natural object in the greek world which had not once according to legend been a man or a woman the myths of the origin of the world and man again were in the last degree childish and disgusting the bushmen and australians have perhaps no story of the origin of species quite so barbarous in style as the anecdotes about phanes and prajapati which are preserved in the orphic hymns and in the brahmanas the conduct of the earlier dynasties of classical gods towards each other was as notoriously cruel and loathsome as their behaviour towards mortals was tricksy and capricious the classical gods with all their immortal might are by a mythical contradiction of the religious conception regarded as capable of fear and pain and are led into scrapes as ludicrous as those of brer wolf or brer terrapin in the tales of the negroes of the southern states of america the stars again in mythology are mixed up with beasts planets and men in the same embroglio of fantastic opinion the dead and the living men beasts and gods trees and stars and rivers and sun and moon dance through the region of myths in a burlesque ballet of priapus where everything may be anything where nature has no laws and imagination no limits  such are the irrational characteristics of myths classic or indian european or american african or asiatic australian or maori such is one element we find all the world over among civilised and savage people quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus it is no wonder that pious and reflective men have in so many ages and in so many ways tried to account to themselves for their possession of beliefs closely connected with religion which yet seemed ruinous to religion and morality  the explanations which men have given of their own sacred stories the apologies for their own gods which they have been constrained to offer to themselves were the earliest babblings of a science of mythology that science was in its dim beginnings intended to satisfy a moral need man found that his gods when mythically envisaged were not made in his own moral image at its best but in the image sometimes of the beasts sometimes of his own moral nature at its very worst in the likeness of robbers wizards sorcerers and adulterers now it is impossible here to examine minutely all systems of mythological interpretation every key has been tried in this difficult lock every cause of confusion has been taken up and tested deemed adequate and finally rejected or assigned a subordinate place probably the first attempts to shake off the burden of religious horror at mythical impiety were made by way of silent omission thus most of the foulest myths of early india are absent and presumably were left out in the rigveda the religious sentiment of the hymns already so elevated has discarded most of the tales which offended it but has not succeeded in discarding them all1 just as the poets of the rigveda prefer to avoid the more offensive traditions about indra and tvashtri so homer succeeds in avoiding the more grotesque and puerile tales about his own gods2 the period of actual apology comes later pindar declines as we have seen to accuse a god of cannibalism the satapatha brahmana invents a new story about the slaying of visvarupa not indra but trita says the brahmana apologetically slew the threeheaded son of tvashtri indra assuredly was free from that sin for he is a god says the indian apologist3 yet sins which to us appear far more monstrous than the peccadillo of killing a threeheaded brahman are attributed freely to indra   1 les religions de linde barth p 14 see also postea indian myths  2 the reasons for homers reticence are probably different in different passages perhaps in some cases he had heard a purer version of myth than what reached hesiod perhaps he sometimes purposely like pindar purified a myth usually he must have selected in conformity with the noble humanity and purity of his taste the tales that best conformed to his ideal he makes his deities reluctant to drag out in dispute old scandals of their early unheroic adventures some of which however he gives as the kicking of hephaestus out of heaven and the imprisonment of ares in a vessel of bronze compare professor jebbs homer p 83 whatever the instinct of the great artist has tolerated at least it has purged these things away that is divine amours in bestial form  3 satapatha brahmana oxford 1882 vol i p 47   while poets could but omit a blasphemous tale or sketch an apology in passing it became the business of philosophers and of antiquarian writers deliberately to whitewash the gods of popular religion systematic explanations of the sacred stories whether as preserved in poetry or as told by priests had to be provided india had her etymological and her legendary school of mythology1 thus while the hymn seemed to tell how the maruts were gods born together with the spotted deer the etymological interpreters explained that the word for deer only meant the manycoloured lines of clouds2 in the armoury of apologetics etymology has been the most serviceable weapon it is easy to see that by aid of etymology the most repulsive legend may be compelled to yield a pure or harmless sense and may be explained as an innocent blunder caused by mere verbal misunderstanding brahmans greeks and germans have equally found comfort in this hypothesis in the cratylus of plato socrates speaks of the notion of explaining myths by etymological guesses at the meaning of divine names as a philosophy which came to him all in an instant thus we find socrates shocked by the irreverence which styled zeus the son of cronus who is a proverb for stupidity but on examining philologically the name kronos socrates decides that it must really mean koros not in the sense of a youth but signifying the pure and garnished mind therefore when people first called zeus the son of cronus they meant nothing irreverent but only that zeus is the child of the pure mind or pure reason not only is this etymological system most pious and consolatory but it is as socrates adds of universal application for now i bethink me of a very new and ingenious notion that we may put in and pull out letters at pleasure and alter the accents3   1 rigveda sanhita max muller p 59  2 postea indian divine myths  3 jowetts plato vol i pp 632 670   socrates of course speaks more than half in irony but there is a certain truth in his account of etymological analysis and its dependence on individual tastes and preconceived theory  the ancient classical schools of mythological interpretation though unscientific and unsuccessful are not without interest we find philosophers and grammarians looking just as we ourselves are looking for some condition of the human intellect out of which the absurd element in myths might conceivably have sprung very naturally the philosophers supposed that the human beings in whose brain and speech myths had their origin must have been philosophers like themselvesintelligent educated persons but such persons they argued could never have meant to tell stories about the gods so full of nonsense and blasphemy  therefore the nonsense and blasphemy must originally have had some harmless or even praiseworthy sense what could that sense have been this question each ancient mythologist answered in accordance with his own taste and prejudices and above all and like all other and later speculators in harmony with the general tendency of his own studies if he lived when physical speculation was coming into fashion as in the age of empedocles he thought that the homeric poems must contain a veiled account of physical philosophy this was the opinion of theagenes of rhegium who wrote at a period when a crude physicism was disengaging itself from the earlier religious and mythical cosmogonic systems of greece theagenes was shocked by the homeric description of the battle in which the gods fought as allies of the achaeans and trojans he therefore explained away the affair as a veiled account of the strife of the elements such strife was familiar to readers of the physical speculations of empedocles and of heraclitus who blamed homer for his prayer against strife1   1 is et osir 48   it did not occur to theagenes to ask whether any evidence existed to show that the prehomeric greeks were empedoclean or heraclitean philosophers he readily proved to himself that apollo helios and hephaestus were allegorical representations like what such philosophers would feignof fire that hera was air poseidon water artemis the moon and the rest he disposed of in the same fashion1   1 scholia on iliad xx 67 dindorf 1877 vol iv p 231 this manner of apologetics is as old as theagenes of rhegium homer offers theological doctrine in the guise of physical allegory   metrodorus again turned not only the gods but the homeric heroes into elemental combinations and physical agencies for there is nothing new in the mythological philosophy recently popular which saw the sun and the cloud and the wind in achilles athene and hermes1   1 grote hist of greece ed 1869 i p 404   in the bacchae 291297 euripides puts another of the mythological systems of his own time into the mouth of cadmus the theban king who advances a philological explanation of the story that dionysus was sewn up in the thigh of zeus the most famous of the later theories was that of euhemerus 316 bc in a kind of philosophical romance euhemerus declared that he had sailed to some nomansland panchaea where he found the verity about mythical times engraved on pillars of bronze this truth he published in the sacra historia where he rationalised the fables averring that the gods had been men and that the myths were exaggerated and distorted records of facts see eusebius praep e ii 55 the abbe banier la mythologie expliquee par lhistoire paris 1738 vol ii p 218 attempts the defence of euhemerus whom most of the ancients regarded as an atheist there was an element of truth in his romantic hypothesis1   1 see block euhemere et sa doctrine mons 1876   sometimes the old stories were said to conceal a moral sometimes a physical sometimes a mystical or neoplatonic sort of meaning as every apologist interpreted the legends in his own fashion the interpretations usually disagreed and killed each other just as one modern mythologist sees the wind in aeetes and the dawn in medea while another of the same school believes on equally good evidence that both aeetes and medea are the moon so writers like porphyry 270 a d and plutarch 60 a d made the ancient deities types of their own favourite doctrines whatever these might happen to be  when christianity became powerful the christian writers naturally attacked heathen religion where it was most vulnerable on the side of the myths and of the mysteries which were dramatic representations of the myths pretty gods you worship said the fathers in effect homicides adulterers bulls bears mice ants and what not the heathen apologists for the old religion were thus driven in the early ages of christianity to various methods of explaining away the myths of their discredited religion  the early christian writers very easily and with considerable argumentative power disposed of the apologies for the myths advanced by porphyry and plutarch thus eusebius in the praeparatio evangelica first attacks the egyptian interpretations of their own bestial or semibestial gods he shows that the various interpretations destroy each other and goes on to point out that greek myth is in essence only a veneered and varnished version of the faith of egypt he ridicules with a good deal of humour the old theories which resolved so many mythical heroes into the sun he shows that while one system is contented to regard zeus as mere fire and air another system recognises in him the higher reason while heracles dionysus apollo and asclepius father and child are all indifferently the sun  granting that the mythmakers were only constructing physical allegories why did they wrap them up asks eusebius in what we consider abominable fictions in what state were the people who could not look at the pure processes of nature without being reminded of the most hideous and unnatural offences once more the physical interpreters do not even agree in their physical interpretations all these are equally facile equally plausible and equally incapable of proof again eusebius argues the interpreters take for granted in the makers of the myths an amount of physical knowledge which they certainly did not possess for example if leto were only another name for hera the character of zeus would be cleared as far as his amour with leto is concerned now the ancient believers in the physical phenomena theory of myths made out that hera the wife of zeus was really the same person under another name as leto his mistress for hera is the earth they said at other times that hera was the air and leto is the night but night is only the shadow of the earth and therefore leto is only the shadow of hera it was easy however to prove that this scientific view of night as the shadow of earth was not likely to be known to mythmakers who regarded swift night as an actual person plutarch too had an abstruse theory to explain the legend about the dummy wifea log of oakwood which zeus pretended to marry when at variance with hera1   1 pausanias ix 31   this quarrel he said was merely the confusion and strife of elements zeus was heat hera was cold she had already been explained as earth and air the dummy wife of oakwood was a tree that emerged after a flood and so forth of course there was no evidence that mythopoeic men held plutarchian theories of heat and cold and the conflict of the elements besides as eusebius pointed out hera had already been defined once as an allegory of wedded life and once as the earth and again as the air and it was rather too late to assert that she was also the cold and watery element in the world as for his own explanation of the myths eusebius holds that they descend from a period when men in their lawless barbarism knew no better than to tell such tales ancient folk in the exceeding savagery of their lives made no account of god the universal creator here eusebius is probably wrong but betook them to all manner of abominations for the laws of decent existence were not yet established nor was any settled and peaceful state ordained among men but only a loose and savage fashion of wandering life while as beasts irrational they cared for no more than to fill their bellies being in a manner without god in the world growing a little more civilised men according to eusebius sought after something divine which they found in the heavenly bodies later they fell to worshipping living persons especially medicine men and conjurors and continued to worship them even after their decease so that greek temples are really tombs of the dead1 finally the civilised ancients with a conservative reluctance to abandon their old myths greek text omitted invented for them moral or physical explanations like those of plutarch and others earlier and later2   1 praep e ii 5  2 ibid 619   as eusebius like clemens of alexandria arnobius and the other early christian disputants had no prejudice in favour of hellenic mythology and no sentimental reason for wishing to suppose that the origin of its impurities was pure he found his way almost to the theory of the irrational element in mythology which we propose to offer  even to sketch the history of mythological hypothesis in modern times would require a book to itself it must suffice here to indicate the various lines which speculation as to mythology has pursued  all interpretations of myth have been formed in accordance with the ideas prevalent in the time of the interpreters the early greek physicists thought that mythopoeic men had been physicists aristotle hints that they were like himself political philosophers1 neoplatonists sought in the myths for neoplatonism most christians unlike eusebius either sided with euhemerus or found in myth the inventions of devils or a tarnished and distorted memory of the biblical revelation   1 met xi 819   this was the theory for example of good old jacob bryant who saw everywhere memories of the noachian deluge and proofs of the correctness of old testament ethnology1   1 bryant a new system wherein an attempt is made to divest tradition of fable 1774   much the same attempt to find the biblical truth at the bottom of savage and ancient fable has been recently made by the late m lenormant a catholic scholar1   1 les origines de lhistoire dapres le bible 18801884   in the beginning of the present century germany turned her attention to mythology as usual mens ideas were biassed by the general nature of their opinions in a pious kind of spirit friedrich creuzer sought to find symbols of some pure early and oriental theosophy in the myths and mysteries of greece certainly the greeks of the philosophical period explained their own myths as symbols of higher things but the explanation was an afterthought1 the great lobeck in his aglaophamus 1829 brought back common sense and made it the guide of his vast his unequalled learning in a gentler and more genial spirit c otfried muller laid the foundation of a truly scientific and historical mythology2 neither of these writers had like alfred maury3 much knowledge of the myths and faiths of the lower races but they often seem on the point of anticipating the ethnological method   1 creuzer symbolik und mythologie 2d edit leipzig 183643  2 introduction to a scientific system of mythology english trans london 1844  3 histoire des religions de la grece antique paris 1857   when philological science in our own century came to maturity in philology as of old in physics and later in symbols was sought the key of myths while physical allegory religious and esoteric symbolism verbal confusion historical legend and an original divine tradition perverted in ages of darkness have been the most popular keys in other ages the scientific nineteenth century has had a philological key of its own the methods of kuhn breal max muller and generally the philological method cannot be examined here at full length1 briefly speaking the modern philological method is intended for a scientific application of the old etymological interpretations cadmus in the bacchae of euripides socrates in the cratylus of plato dismiss unpalatable myths as the results of verbal confusion people had originally said something quite sensibleso the hypothesis runsbut when their descendants forgot the meaning of their remarks a new and absurd meaning followed from a series of unconscious puns2 this view was supported in ancient times by purely conjectural and impossible etymologies thus the myth that dionysus was sewn up in the thigh of zeus greek text omitted was explained by euripides as the result of a confusion of words people had originally said that zeus gave a pledge greek text omitted to hera the modern philological school relies for explanations of untoward and other myths on similar confusions thus daphne is said to have been originally not a girl of romance but the dawn sanskirt dahana ahana pursued by the rising sun but as the original aryan sense of dahana or ahana was lost and as daphne came to mean the laurelthe wood which burns easilythe fable arose that the tree had been a girl called daphne3   1 see mythology in encyclop brit and in la mythologie a l paris 1886 where mr max mullers system is criticised see also custom and myth and modern mythology  2 that a considerable number of myths chiefly myths of place names arise from

names in greek german slavonic and other aryan legends the attempt is made to prove that in the common speech of the undivided aryan race many words for splendid or glowing natural phenomena existed and that natural processes were described in a figurative style as the various aryan families separated the sense of the old words and names became dim the nomina developed into numina the names into gods the descriptions of elemental processes into myths as this system has already been criticised by us elsewhere with minute attention a reference to these reviews must suffice in this place briefly it may be stated that the various masters of the schoolkuhn max muller roth schwartz and the restrarely agree where agreement is essential that is in the philological foundations of their building they differ in very many of the etymological analyses of mythical names they also differ in the interpretations they put on the names kuhn almost invariably seeing fire storm cloud or lightning where mr max muller sees the chaste dawn thus mannhardt after having been a disciple is obliged to say that comparative indogermanic mythology has not borne the fruit expected and that the certain gains of the system reduce themselves to the scantiest list of parallels such as dyaus  zeus  tius parjanya  perkunas bhaga  bog varuna  uranos a position much disputed etc mannhardt adds his belief that a number of other equationssuch as sarameya  hermeias saranyus  demeter erinnys kentauros  gandharva and many otherswill not stand criticism and he fears that these ingenious guesses will prove mere jeux desprit rather than actual facts1 many examples of the precarious and contradictory character of the results of philological mythology many instances of dubious etymologies false logic leaps at foregone conclusions and attempts to make what is peculiarly indian in thought into matter of universal application will meet us in the chapters on indian and greek divine legends2 the method in its practical working shows a fundamental lack of the historical sense says mannhardt examples are torn from their contexts he observes historical evolution is neglected passages of the veda themselves totally obscure are dragged forward to account for obscure greek mythical phenomena such are the accusations brought by the regretted mannhardt against the school to which he originally belonged and which was popular and allpowerful even in the maturity of his own more clearsighted genius proofs of the correctness of his criticism will be offered abundantly in the course of this work it will become evident that great as are the acquisitions of philology her least certain discoveries have been too hastily applied in alien matter that is in the region of myth not that philology is wholly without place or part in the investigation of myth when there is agreement among philologists as to the meaning of a divine name in that case a certain amount of light is thrown on the legend of the bearer of the name and on its origin and first home aryan greek semitic or the like but how rare is agreement among philologists   1 baum und feld kultus p xvii kuhns epochmaking book is die

discovering the origin of a myth or the physical explanation of the oldest myths or of accounting for the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised races but these are not the only problems of mythology there is for example the question of the genealogical relations of myths where we have to determine whether the myths of peoples whose speech is of the same family are special modifications of a mythology once common to the race whence these peoples have sprung the philological method alone can answer here but this will seem a very limited province when we find that almost all races however remote and unconnected in speech have practically much the same myths   1 rev de lhist des rel xii 3 260 nov dec 1885    chapter ii new system proposed  chap i recapitulatedproposal

methodobjections to method and answer to thesesee appendix b   the past systems of mythological interpretation have been briefly sketched it has been shown that the practical need for a reconciliation between religion and morality on one side and the myths about the gods on the other produced the hypotheses of theagenes and metrodorus of socrates and euemerus of aristotle and plutarch it has been shown that in each case the reconcilers argued on the basis of their own ideas and of the philosophies of their time the early physicist thought that myth concealed a physical philosophy the early etymologist saw in it a confusion of language the early political speculator supposed that myth was an invention of legislators the literary euhemerus found the secret of myths in the course of an imaginary voyage to a fabled island then came the moment of the christian attacks and pagan philosophers touched with oriental pantheism recognised in myths certain pantheistic symbols and a cryptic revelation of their own neoplatonism when the gods were dead and their altars fallen then antiquaries brought their curiosity to the problem of explaining myth christians recognised in it a depraved version of the jewish sacred writings and found the ark on every mountaintop of greece the critical nineteenth century brought in with otfried muller and lobeck a closer analysis and finally in the sudden rise of comparative philology it chanced that philologists annexed the domain of myths each of these systems had its own amount of truth but each certainly failed to unravel the whole web of tradition and of foolish faith  meantime a new science has come into existence the science which studies man in the sum of all his works and thoughts as evolved through the whole process of his development this science comparative anthropology examines the development of law out of custom the development of weapons from the stick or stone to the latest repeating rifle the development of society from the horde to the nation it is a study which does not despise the most backward nor degraded tribe nor neglect the most civilised and it frequently finds in australians or nootkas the germ of ideas and institutions which greeks or romans brought to perfection or retained little altered from their early rudeness in the midst of civilisation  it is inevitable that this science should also try its hand on mythology our purpose is to employ the anthropological methodthe study of the evolution of ideas from the savage to the barbarous and thence to the civilised stagein the province of myth ritual and religion it has been shown that the light of this method had dawned on eusebius in his polemic with the heathen apologists spencer the head of corpus cambridge 163093 had really no other scheme in his mind in his erudite work on hebrew ritual1 spencer was a student of mans religions generally and he came to the conclusion that hebrew ritual was but an expurgated and so to speak divinely licensed adaptation of heathen customs at large we do but follow his guidance on less perilous ground when we seek for the original forms of classical rite and myth in the parallel usages and legends of the most backward races   1 de legibus hebraeorum ritualibus tubingae 1782   fontenelle in the last century stated with all the clearness of the french intellect the system which is partially worked out in this essaythe system which explains the irrational element in myth as inherited from savagery fontenelles paper sur lorigine des fables is brief sensible and witty and requires little but copious evidence to make it adequate but he merely threw out the idea and left it to be neglected1   1 see appendix a fontenelles origine des fables   among other founders of the anthropological or historical school of mythology de brosses should not be forgotten in his dieux fetiches 1760 he follows the path which eusebius indicatedthe path of spencer and fontenellenow the beaten road of tylor and mlennan and mannhardt  in anthropology in the science of waitz tylor and mlennan in the examination of mans faith in the light of his social legal and historical conditions generally we find with mannhardt some of the keys of myth this science makes it manifest that the different stages through which humanity has passed in its intellectual evolution have still their living representatives among various existing races the study of these lower races is an invaluable instrument for the interpretation of the survivals from earlier stages which we meet in the full civilisation of cultivated peoples but whose origins were in the remotest fetichism and savagery1   1 mannhardt op cit p xxiii   it is by following this road and by the aid of anthropology and of human history that we propose to seek for a demonstrably actual condition of the human intellect whereof the puzzling qualities of myth would be the natural and inevitable fruit in all the earlier theories which we have sketched inquirers took it for granted that the mythmakers were men with philosophic and moral ideas like their ownideas which from some reason of religion or state they expressed in bizarre terms of allegory we shall attempt on the other hand to prove that the human mind has passed through a condition quite unlike that of civilised mena condition in which things seemed natural and rational that now appear unnatural and devoid of reason and in which therefore if myths were evolved they would if they survived into civilisation be such as civilised men find strange and perplexing  our first question will be is there a stage of human society and of the human intellect in which facts that appear to us to be monstrous and irrationalfacts corresponding to the wilder incidents of mythare accepted as ordinary occurrences of everyday life in the region of romantic rather than of mythical invention we know that there is such a state mr lane in his preface to the arabian nights says that the arabs have an advantage over us as storytellers they can introduce such incidents as the change of a man into a horse or of a woman into a dog or the intervention of an afreet without any more scruple than our own novelists feel in describing a duel or the concealment of a will among the arabs the agencies of magic and of spirits are regarded as at least as probable and common as duels and concealments of wills seem to be thought by european novelists it is obvious that we need look no farther for the explanation of the supernatural events in arab romances now let us apply this system to mythology it is admitted that greeks romans aryans of india in the age of the sanskrit commentators and egyptians of the ptolemaic and earlier ages were as much puzzled as we are by the mythical adventures of their gods but is there any known stage of the human intellect in which similar adventures and the metamorphoses of men into animals trees stars and all else that puzzles us in the civilised mythologies are regarded as possible incidents of daily human life our answer is that everything in the civilised mythologies which we regard as irrational seems only part of the accepted and natural order of things to contemporary savages and in the past seemed equally rational and natural to savages concerning whom we have historical information1 our theory is therefore that the savage and senseless element in mythology is for the most part a legacy from the fancy of ancestors of the civilised races who were once in an intellectual state not higher but probably lower than that of australians bushmen red indians the lower races of south america and other worse than barbaric peoples as the ancestors of the greeks aryans of india egyptians and others advanced in civilisation their religious thought was shocked and surprised by myths originally dating from the period of savagery and natural in that period though even then often in contradiction to morals and religion which were preserved down to the time of pausanias by local priesthoods or which were stereotyped in the ancient poems of hesiod and homer or in the brahmanas and vedas of india or were retained in the popular religion of egypt this theory recommended itself to lobeck we may believe that ancient and early tribes framed gods like unto themselves in action and in experience and that the allegorical softening down of myths is the explanation added later by descendants who had attained to purer ideas of divinity yet dared not reject the religion of their ancestors2 the senseless element in the myths would by this theory be for the most part a survival and the age and condition of human thought whence it survived would be one in which our most ordinary ideas about the nature of things and the limits of possibility did not yet exist when all things were conceived of in quite other fashion the age that is of savagery   1 we have been asked to define a savage he cannot be defined in an epigram but by way of choice of a type  1 in material equipment the perfect savage is he who employs tools of stone and wood not of metal who is nomadic rather than settled who is acquainted if at all only with the rudest forms of the arts of potting weaving firemaking etc and who derives more of his food from the chase and from wild roots and plants than from any kind of agriculture or from the flesh of domesticated animals  2 in psychology the savage is he who extending unconsciously to the universe his own implicit consciousness of personality regards all natural objects as animated and intelligent beings and drawing no hard and fast line between himself and the things in the world is readily persuaded that men may be metamorphosed into plants beasts and stars that winds and clouds sun and dawn are persons with human passions and parts and that the lower animals especially may be creatures more powerful than himself and in a sense divine and creative  3 in religion the savage is he who while often in certain moods conscious of a far higher moral faith believes also in ancestral ghosts or spirits of woods and wells that were never ancestral prays frequently by dint of magic and sometimes adores inanimate objects or even appeals to the beasts as supernatural protectors  4 in society the savage is he who as a rule bases his laws on the welldefined lines of totemismthat is claims descent from or other close relation to natural objects and derives from the sacredness of those objects the sanction of his marriage prohibitions and bloodfeuds while he makes skill in magic a claim to distinguished rank  such for our purpose is the savage and we propose to explain the more senseless factors in civilised mythology as survivals of these ideas and customs preserved by conservatism and local tradition or less probably borrowed from races which were or had been savage  2 aglaoph i 153 had lobeck gone a step farther and examined the mental condition of veteres et priscae gentes this book would have been superfluous nor did he know that the purer ideas were also existing among certain low savages   it is universally admitted that survivals of this kind do account for many anomalies in our institutions in law politics society even in dress and manners if isolated fragments of earlier ages abide in these it is still more probable that other fragments will survive in anything so closely connected as is mythology with the conservative religious sentiment and tradition our object then is to prove that the silly savage and irrational element in the myths of civilised peoples is as a rule either a survival from the period of savagery or has been borrowed from savage neighbours by a cultivated people or lastly is an imitation by later poets of old savage data1 for example to explain the constellations as metamorphosed men animals or other objects of terrestrial life is the habit of savages2a natural habit among people who regard all things as on one level of personal life and intelligence when the stars among civilised greeks or aryans of india are also popularly regarded as transformed and transfigured men animals and the like this belief may be either a survival from the age when the ancestors of greeks and indians were in the intellectual condition of the australian murri or the starname and starmyth may have been borrowed from savages or from cultivated peoples once savage or apt to copy savages or as in the case of the coma berenices a poet of a late age may have invented a new artificial myth on the old lines of savage fancy   1 we may be asked why do savages entertain the irrational ideas which survive in myth one might as well ask why they eat each other or use stones instead of metal their intellectual powers are not fully developed and hasty analogy from their own unreasoned consciousness is their chief guide myth in mr darwins phrase is one of the miserable and indirect consequences of our highest faculties descent of man p 69  2 see custom and myth starmyths   this method of interpreting a certain element in mythology is we must repeat no new thing though to judge from the protests of several mythologists it is new to many inquirers we have seen that eusebius threw out proposals in this direction that spencer de brosses and fontenelle unconsciously followed him and we have quoted from lobeck a statement of a similar opinion the whole matter has been stated as clearly as possible by mr b b tylor  savages have been for untold ages and still are living in the mythmaking stage of the human mind it was through sheer ignorance and neglect of this direct knowledge how and by what manner of men myths are really made that their simple philosophy has come to be buried under masses of commentators rubbish1 mr tylor goes on thus and his words contain the gist of our argument the general thesis maintained is that myth arose in the savage condition prevalent in remote ages among the whole human race that it remains comparatively unchanged among the rude modern tribes who have departed least from these primitive conditions while higher and later civilisations partly by retaining its actual principles and partly by carrying on its inherited results in the form of ancestral tradition continued it not merely in toleration but in honour2 elsewhere mr tylor points out that by this method of interpretation we may study myths in various stages of evolution from the rude guess of the savage at an explanation of natural phenomena through the systems of the higher barbarisms or lower civilisations as in ancient mexico and the sacerdotage of india till myth reaches its most human form in greece yet even in greek myth the beast is not wholly cast out and hellas by no means let the ape and tiger die that mr tylor does not exclude the aryan race from his general theory is plain enough3 what is the aryan conception of the thundergod but a poetic elaboration of thoughts inherited from the savage stage through which the primitive aryans had passed4   1 primitive culture 2nd edit i p 283  2 op cit p 275  3 primitive culture 2nd edit ii 265  4 pretty much the same view seems to be taken by mr max muller nineteenth century january 1882 when he calls tsui goab whom the hottentots believe to be a defunct conjuror a hottentot indra or zeus   the advantages of our hypothesis if its legitimacy be admitted are obvious in the first place we have to deal with an actual demonstrable condition of the human intellect the existence of the savage state in all its various degrees and of the common intellectual habits and conditions which are shared by the backward peoples and again the survival of many of these in civilisation are indubitable facts we are not obliged to fall back upon some fanciful and unsupported theory of what primitive man did and said and thought nay more we escape all the fallacies connected with the terms primitive man we are not compelled as will be shown later1 to prove that the first men of all were like modern savages nor that savages represent primitive man it may be that the lowest extant savages are the nearest of existing peoples to the type of the first human beings but on this point it is unnecessary for us to dogmatise if we can show that whether men began their career as savages or not they have at least passed through the savage status or have borrowed the ideas of races in the savage status that is all we need we escape from all the snares of theories incapable of historical proof about the really primeval and original condition of the human family   1 appendix b   once more our theory naturally attaches itself to the general system of evolution we are enabled to examine mythology as a thing of gradual development and of slow and manifold modifications corresponding in some degree to the various changes in the general progress of society thus we shall watch the barbaric conditions of thought which produce barbaric myths while these in their turn are retained or perhaps purified or perhaps explained away by more advanced civilisations further we shall be able to detect the survival of the savage ideas with least modification and the persistence of the savage myths with least change among the classes of a civilised population which have shared least in the general advance these classes are first the rustic peoples dwelling far from cities and schools on heaths or by the sea second the conservative local priesthoods who retain the more crude and ancient myths of the local gods and heroes after these have been modified or rejected by the purer sense of philosophers and national poets thus much of ancient myth is a woven warp and woof of three threads the savage donnee the civilised and poetic modification of the savage donnee the version of the original fable which survives in popular tales and in the sacred chapters of local priesthoods a critical study of these three stages in myth is in accordance with the recognised practice of science indeed the whole system is only an application to this particular province mythology of the method by which the development either of organisms or of human institutions is traced as the anomalies and apparently useless and accidental features in the human or in other animal organisms may be explained as stunted or rudimentary survivals of organs useful in a previous stage of life so the anomalous and irrational myths of civilised races may be explained as survivals of stories which in an earlier state of thought and knowledge seemed natural enough the persistence of the myths is accounted for by the wellknown conservatism of the religious sentimenta conservatism noticed even by eusebius in later days when they became ashamed of the religious beliefs of their ancestors they invented private and respectful interpretations each to suit himself for no one dared to shake the ancestral beliefs as they honoured at a very high rate the sacredness and antiquity of old associations and of the teaching they had received in childhood1   1 praep e ii 6 19   thus the method which we propose to employ is in harmony both with modern scientific procedure and with the views of a clearsighted father of the church consequently no system could well be less heretical and unorthodox  the last advantage of our hypothesis which need here be mentioned is that it helps to explain the diffusion no less than the origin of the wild and crazy element in myth we seek for the origin of the savage factor of myth in one aspect of the intellectual condition of savages we say in one aspect expressly to guard against the suggestion that the savage intellect has no aspect but this and no saner ideas than those of myth the diffusion of stories practically identical in every quarter of the globe may be provisionally regarded as the result of the prevalence in every quarter at one time or another of similar mental habits and ideas this explanation must not be pressed too hard nor too far if we find all over the world a belief that men can change themselves and their neighbours into beasts that belief will account for the appearance of metamorphosis in myth if we find a belief that inanimate objects are really much on a level with man the opinion will account for incidents of myth such as that in which the wooden figurehead of the argo speaks with a human voice again a widespread belief in the separability of the soul or the life from the body will account for the incident in nursery tales and myths of the giant who had no heart in his body but kept his heart and life elsewhere an ancient identity of mental status and the working of similar mental forces at the attempt to explain the same phenomena will account without any theory of borrowing or transmission of myth or of original unity of race for the worldwide diffusion of many mythical conceptions  but this theory of the original similarity of the savage mind everywhere and in all races will scarcely account for the worldwide distribution of long and intricate mythical plots of consecutive series of adroitly interwoven situations in presence of these long romances found among so many widely severed peoples conjecture is at present almost idle we do not know in many instances whether such stories were independently developed or carried from a common centre or borrowed by one race from another and so handed on round the world  this chapter may conclude with an example of a tale whose diffusion may be explained in divers ways though its origin seems undoubtedly savage if we turn to the algonkins a stock of red indians we come on a popular tradition which really does give pause to the mythologist could this story he asks himself have been separately invented in widely different places or could the iroquois have borrowed from the australian blacks or the andaman islanders it is a common thing in most mythologies to find everything of value to manfire sun waterin the keeping of some hostile power the fire or the sun or the water is then stolen or in other ways rescued from the enemy and restored to humanity the huron story as far as water is concerned is told by father paul le jeune a jesuit missionary who lived among the hurons about 1636 the myth begins with the usual opposition between two brothers the cain and abel of savage legend one of the brothers named ioskeha slew the other and became the father of mankind as known to the red indians and the guardian of the iroquois the earth was at first arid and sterile but ioskeha destroyed the gigantic frog which had swallowed all the waters and guided the torrents into smooth streams and lakes1   1 relations de la nouvelle france 1636 p 103 paris cramoisy 1637   now where outside of north america do we find this frog who swallowed all the water we find him in australia  the aborigines of lake tyers remarks mr brough smyth say that at one time there was no water anywhere on the face of the earth all the waters were contained in the body of a huge frog and men and women could get none of them a council was held and it was agreed that the frog should be made to laugh when the waters would run out of his mouth and there would be plenty in all parts  to make a long story short all the animals played the jester before the gigantic solemn frog who sat as grave as louis xv i do not like buffoons who dont make me laugh said that majestical monarch at last the eel danced on the tip of his tail and the gravity of the prodigious batrachian gave way he laughed till he literally split his sides and the imprisoned waters came with a rush indeed many persons were drowned though this is not the only australian version of the deluge  the andaman islanders dwell at a very considerable distance from australia and from the iroquois and in the present condition of the natives of australia and andaman neither could possibly visit the other the frog in the andaman version is called a toad and he came to swallow the waters in the following way one day a woodpecker was eating honey high up in the boughs of a tree far below the toad was a witness of the feast and asked for some honey well come up here and you shall have some said the woodpecker but how am i to climb take hold of that creeper and i will draw you up said the woodpecker but all the while he was bent on a practical joke so the toad got into a bucket he happened to possess and fastened the bucket to the creeper now pull then the woodpecker raised the toad slowly to the level of the bough where the honey was and presently let him down with a run not only disappointing the poor toad but shaking him severely the toad went away in a rage and looked about him for revenge a happy thought occurred to him and he drank up all the water of the rivers and lakes birds and beasts were perishing woodpeckers among them of thirst the toad overjoyed at his success wished to add insult to the injury and very thoughtlessly began to dance in an irritating manner at his foes but then the stolen waters gushed out of his mouth in full volume and the drought soon ended one of the most curious points in this myth is the origin of the quarrel between the woodpecker and the toad the same beginningthe tale of an insult put on an animal by hauling up and letting him down with a runoccurs in an african marchen1   1 brough smyth aborigines of victoria i 429 430 brinton american hero myths i 55 cf also relations de la nouvelle france 1636 1640 1671 sagard hist du canada 1636 p 451 journal anthrop inst 1881   now this strangely diffused story of the slaying of the frog which had swallowed all the water seems to be a savage myth of which the more heroic conflict of indra with vrittra the dragon which had swallowed all the waters is an epic and sublimer version1 the heavenly water which vrittra withholds from the world is usually the prize of the contest   1 ludwig der rigveda iii p 337 see postea divine myths of india   the serpent of vedic myth is perhaps rather the robberguardian than the swallower of the waters but indra is still like the iroquois ioskeha he who wounds the full one1 this example of the wide distribution of a myth shows how the question of diffusion though connected with is yet distinct from that of origin the advantage of our method will prove to be that it discovers an historical and demonstrable state of mind as the origin of the wild element in myth again the wide prevalence in the earliest times of this mental condition will to a certain extent explain the distribution of myth room must be left of course for processes of borrowing and transmission but how andamanese australians and hurons could borrow from each other is an unsolved problem   1 gubernatis zoological myth ii 395 note 2 when indra kills the serpent he opens the torrent of the waters p 393 see also aitareya brahmana translated by haug ii 483   finally our hypothesis is not involved in dubious theories of race to us myths appear to be affected in their origins much less by the race than by the stage of culture attained by the people who cherish them a fight for the waters between a monstrous dragon like vrittra and a heroic god like indra is a nobler affair than a quarrel for the waters between a woodpecker and a toad but the improvement and transfiguration so to speak of a myth at bottom the same is due to the superior culture not to the peculiar race of the vedic poets except so far as culture itself depends on race how far the purer culture was attained to by the original superiority of the aryan over the andaman breed it is not necessary for our purpose to inquire thus on the whole we may claim for our system a certain demonstrable character which helps to simplify the problems of mythology and to remove them from the realm of fanciful guesses and conflicting etymological conjectures into that of sober science that these pretensions are not unacknowledged even by mythologists trained in other schools is proved by the remarks of dr tiele1   1 rev de lhist des rel le mythe de cronos january 1886 dr tiele is not it must be noted a thorough adherent of our theory see modern mythology the question of allies   dr tiele writes if i were obliged to choose between this method the system here advocated and that of comparative philology it is the former that i would adopt without the slightest hesitation this method alone enables us to explain the fact which has so often provoked amazement that people so refined as the greeks or so rude but morally pure as the germans managed to attribute to their gods all manner of cowardly cruel and disorderly conduct this method alone explains the why and wherefore of all those strange metamorphoses of gods into beasts and plants and even stones which scandalised philosophers and which the witty ovid played on for the diversion of his contemporaries in short this method teaches us to recognise in all those strange stories the survivals of a barbaric age long passed away but enduring to later times in the form of religious traditions of all traditions the most persistent finally this method alone enables us to explain the origin of myths because it endeavours to study them in their rudest and most primitive shape thus allowing their true significance to be much more clearly apparent than it can be in the myths so often touched retouched augmented and humanised which are current among races arrived at a certain degree of culture  the method is to this extent applauded by a most competent authority and it has been warmly accepted by a distinguished french school of students represented by m gaidoz but it is obvious that the method rests on a double hypothesis first that satisfactory evidence as to the mental conditions of the lower and backward races is obtainable second that the civilised races however they began either passed through the savage state of thought and practice or borrowed very freely from people in that condition these hypotheses have been attacked by opponents the trustworthiness of our evidence especially has been assailed by way of facilitating the course of the exposition and of lessening the disturbing element of controversy a reply to the objections and a defence of the evidence has been relegated to an appendix1 meanwhile we go on to examine the peculiar characteristics of the mental condition of savages and of peoples in the lower and upper barbarisms   1 appendix b    chapter iii the mental condition of savagesconfusion with naturetotemism   the mental condition of savages the basis of the irrational element in mythcharacteristics of that condition 1 confusion of all things in an equality of presumed animation and intelligence 2 belief in sorcery 3 spiritualism

relationsexamples of confusion between men plants beasts and other natural objectsreports of travellersevidence from institution of totemismdefinition of totemismtotemism in australia africa america the oceanic islands india north asiaconclusions totemism being found so widely distributed is a proof of the existence of that savage mental condition in which no line is drawn between men and the other things in the world this confusion is one of the characteristics of myth in all races   we set out to discover a stage of human intellectual development which would necessarily produce the essential elements of myth we think we have found that stage in the condition of savagery we now proceed to array the evidence for the mental processes of savages we intend to demonstrate the existence in practical savage life of the ideas which most surprise us when we find them in civilised sacred legends  for the purposes of this inquiry it is enough to select a few special peculiarities of savage thought  1 first we have that nebulous and confused frame of mind to which all things animate or inanimate human animal vegetable or inorganic seem on the same level of life passion and reason the savage at all events when mythmaking draws no hard and fast line between himself and the things in the world he regards himself as literally akin to animals and plants and heavenly bodies he attributes sex and procreative powers even to stones and rocks and he assigns human speech and human feelings to sun and moon and stars and wind no less than to beasts birds and fishes1   1 so fasst auch das alterthum ihren unterschied von den menschen ganz anders als die spatere zeitgrimm quoted by liebrecht zur volkskunde p 17   2 the second point to note in savage opinion is the belief in magic and sorcery the world and all the things in it being vaguely conceived of as sensible and rational obey the commands of certain members of the tribe chiefs jugglers conjurors or what you will rocks open at their order rivers dry up animals are their servants and hold converse with them these magicians cause or heal diseases and can command even the weather bringing rain or thunder or sunshine at their will1 there are few supernatural attributes of cloudcompelling zeus or of apollo that are not freely assigned to the tribal conjuror by virtue doubtless of the community of nature between man and the things in the world the conjuror like zeus or indra can assume at will the shape of any animal or can metamorphose his neighbours or enemies into animal forms   1 see roth in northwest central queensland aborigines chapter xii 1897   3 another peculiarity of savage belief naturally connects itself with that which has just been described the savage has very strong ideas about the persistent existence of the souls of the dead they retain much of their old nature but are often more malignant after death than they had been during life they are frequently at the beck and call of the conjuror whom they aid with their advice and with their magical power by virtue of the close connection already spoken of between man and the animals the souls of the dead are not rarely supposed to migrate into the bodies of beasts or to revert to the condition of that species of creatures with which each tribe supposes itself to be related by ties of kinship or friendship with the usual inconsistency of mythical belief the souls of the dead are spoken of at other times as if they inhabited a spiritual world sometimes a paradise of flowers sometimes a gloomy place which mortal men may visit but whence no one can escape who has tasted of the food of the ghosts  4 in connection with spirits a farreaching savage philosophy prevails it is not unusual to assign a ghost to all objects animate or inanimate and the spirit or strength of a man is frequently regarded as something separable capable of being located in an external object or something with a definite locality in the body a mans strength and spirit may reside in his kidney fat in his heart in a lock of his hair or may even be stored by him in some separate receptacle very frequently a man is held capable of detaching his soul from his body and letting it roam about on his business sometimes in the form of a bird or other animal  5 many minor savage beliefs might be named such as the common faith in friendly or protecting animals and the notion that natural deaths as we call them are always unnatural that death is always caused by some hostile spirit or conjuror from this opinion comes the myth that man is naturally not subject to death that death was somehow introduced into the world by a mistake or misdeed is a corollary see myths of the origin of death in modern mythology  6 one more mental peculiarity of the savage mind remains to be considered in this brief summary the savage like the civilised man is curious the first faint impulses of the scientific spirit are at work in his brain he is anxious to give himself an account of the world in which he finds himself but he is not more curious than he is on occasion credulous his intellect is eager to ask questions as is the habit of children but his intellect is also lazy and he is content with the first answer that comes to hand ils sarretent aux premieres notions quils en ont says pere hierome lalemant1 nothing says schoolcraft is too capacious sic for indian belief2 the replies to his questions he receives from tradition or when a new problem arises evolves an answer for himself in the shape of stories just as socrates in the platonic dialogues recalls or invents a myth in the despair of reason so the savage has a story for answer to almost every question that he can ask himself these stories are in a sense scientific because they attempt a solution of the riddles of the world they are in a sense religious because there is usually a supernatural power a deus ex machina of some sort to cut the knot of the problem such stories then are the science and to a certain extent the religious tradition of savages3   1 relations de la nouvelle france 1648 p 70  2 algic researches i 41  3 the indians algonkins conveyed instructionmoral mechanical and religiousthrough traditionary fictions and talesschoolcraft algic researches i 12   now these tales are necessarily cast in the mould of the savage ideas of which a sketch has been given the changes of the heavenly bodies the processes of day and night the existence of the stars the invention of the arts the origin of the world as far as known to the savage of the tribe of the various animals and plants the origin of death itself the origin of the perplexing traditional tribal customs are all accounted for in stories at the same time an actual divine maker is sometimes postulated the stories again are fashioned in accordance with the beliefs already named the belief in human connection with and kinship with beasts and plants the belief in magic the belief in the perpetual possibility of metamorphosis or shape shifting the belief in the permanence and power of the ghosts of the dead the belief in the personal and animated character of all the things in the world and so forth  no more need be said to explain the wild and as it seems to us moderns the irrational character of savage myth it is a jungle of foolish fancies a walpurgis nacht of gods and beasts and men and stars and ghosts all moving madly on a level of common personality and animation and all changing shapes at random as partners are changed in some fantastic witches revel such is savage mythology and how could it be otherwise when we consider the elements of thought and belief out of which it is mainly composed we shall see that part of the mythology of the greeks or the aryans of india is but a similar walpurgis nacht in which an incestuous or amorous god may become a beast and the object of his pursuit once a woman may also become a beast and then shift shapes to a tree or a bird or a star but in the civilised races the genius of the people tends to suppress exclude and refine away the wild element which however is never wholly eliminated the erinyes soon stop the mouth of the horse of achilles when he begins like the horse in grimms goose girl to hold a sustained conversation1 but the ancient cruel and grotesque savage element nearly overcome by homer and greatly reduced by the vedic poets breaks out again in hesiod in temple legends and brahmanic glosses and finally proves so strong that it can only be subdued by christianity or rather by that break between the educated classes and the traditional past of religion which has resulted from christianity even so myth lingers in the folklore of the nonprogressive classes of europe and as in roumania invades religion   1 iliad xix 418   we have now to demonstrate the existence in the savage intellect of the various ideas and habits which we have described and out of which mythology springs first we have to show that a nebulous and confused state of mind to which all things animate or inanimate human animal vegetable or inorganic seem on the same level of life passion and reason does really exist1 the existence of this condition of the intellect will be demonstrated first on the evidence of the statements of civilised observers next on the evidence of the savage institutions in which it is embodied   1 creuzer and guigniaut vol i p 111   the opinion of mr tylor is naturally of great value as it is formed on as wide an acquaintance with the views of the lower races as any inquirers can hope to possess mr tylor observes we have to inform ourselves of the savage mans idea which is very different from the civilised mans of the nature of the lower animals the sense of an absolute psychical distinction between man and beast so prevalent in the civilised world is hardly to be found among the lower races1 the universal attribution of souls to all thingsthe theory known as animismis another proof that the savage draws no hard and fast line between man and the other things in the world the notion of the italian countrypeople that cruelty to an animal does not matter because it is not a christian has no parallel in the philosophy of the savage to whom all objects seem to have souls just as men have mr im thurn found the absence of any sense of a difference between man and nature a characteristic of his native companions in guiana the very phrase men and other animals or even as it is often expressed men and animals based as it is on the superiority which civilised man feels over other animals expresses a dichotomy which is in no way recognised by the indian it is therefore most important to realise how comparatively small really is the difference between men in a state of savagery and other animals and how completely even such difference as exists escapes the notice of savage men it is not therefore too much to say that according to the view of the indians other animals differ from men only in bodily form and in their various degrees of strength in spirit they do not differ at all2 the indians notion of the life of plants and stones is on the same level of unreason as we moderns reckon reason he believes in the spirits of rocks and stones undeterred by the absence of motion in these objects not only many rocks but also many waterfalls streams and indeed material objects of every sort are supposed each to consist of a body and a spirit as does man3 it is not our business to ask here how men came by the belief in universal animation that belief is gradually withdrawn distinctions are gradually introduced as civilisation and knowledge advance it is enough for us if the failure to draw a hard and fast line between man and beasts stones and plants be practically universal among savages and if it gradually disappears before the fuller knowledge of civilisation the report which mr im thurn brings from the indians of guiana is confirmed by what schoolcraft says of the algonkin races of the northern part of the continent the belief of the narrators and listeners in every wild and improbable thing told helps wonderfully in the original stories in joining all parts together the indian believes that the whole visible and invisible creation is animated to make the matter worse these tribes believe that animals of the lowest as well as highest class in the chain of creation are alike endowed with reasoning powers and faculties as a natural conclusion they endow birds beasts and all other animals with souls4 as an example of the ease with which the savage recognises consciousness and voluntary motion even in stones may be cited kohls account of the beliefs of the objibeways5 nearly every indian has discovered he says an object in which he places special confidence and to which he sacrifices more zealously than to the great spirit the hope of otamigan a companion of the traveller was a rock which once advanced to meet him swayed bowed and went back again another indian revered a canadian larch because he once heard a very remarkable rustling in its branches it thus appears that while the savage has a general kind of sense that inanimate things are animated he is a good deal impressed by their conduct when he thinks that they actually display their animation in the same way a devout modern spiritualist probably regards with more reverence a table which he has seen dancing and heard rapping than a table at which he has only dined another general statement of failure to draw the line between men and the irrational creation is found in the old jesuit missionary le jeunes relations de la nouvelle france6 les sauvages se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et les autres animaux mais aussi que toutes les autres choses sont animees again ils tiennent les poissons raisonnables comme aussi les cerfs in the solomon islands mr romilly sailed with an old chief who used violent language to the waves when they threatened to dash over the boat and old takkis exhortations were successful7 waitz8 discovers the same attitude towards the animals among the negroes man in their opinion is by no means a separate sort of person on the summit of nature and high above the beasts these he rather regards as dark and enigmatic beings whose life is full of mystery and which he therefore considers now as his inferiors now as his superiors a collection of evidence as to the savage failure to discriminate between human and nonhuman animate and inanimate has been brought together by sir john lubbock9   1 primitive culture i 167169  2 among the indians of guiana 1883 p 350  3 op cit 355  4 schoolcraft algic researches i 41  5 kohl wanderings round lake superior pp 58

bushmen will be found in chap v postea   to a race accustomed like ourselves to arrange and classify to people familiar from childhood and its games with vegetable animal and mineral a condition of mind in which no such distinctions are drawn any more than they are drawn in greek or brahmanic myths must naturally seem like what mr max muller calls temporary insanity the imagination of the savage has been defined by mr tylor as midway between the conditions of a healthy prosaic modern citizen and of a raving fanatic or of a patient in a feverward if any relics of such imagination survive in civilised mythology they will very closely resemble the productions of a once universal temporary insanity let it be granted then that to the lower tribes of man sun and stars trees and rivers winds and clouds become personal animate creatures leading lives conformed to human or animal analogies and performing their special functions in the universe with the aid of limbs like beasts or of artificial instruments like men or that what mens eyes behold is but the instrument to be used or the material to be shaped while behind it there stands some prodigious but yet halfhuman creature who grasps it with his hands or blows it with his breath the basis on which such ideas as these are built is not to be narrowed down to poetic fancy and transformed metaphor they rest upon a broad philosophy of nature early and crude indeed but thoughtful consistent and quite really and seriously meant1   1 primtive culture i 285   for the sake of illustration some minor examples must next be given of this confusion between man and other things in the world which will presently be illustrated by the testimony of a powerful and long diffused set of institutions  the christian quiches of guatemala believe that each of them has a beast as his friend and protector just as in the highlands the dog is the friend of the maclaines when the finns in their epic poem the kalewala have killed a bear they implore the animal to forgive them oh otso chant the singers be not angry that we come near thee the bear the honeyfooted bear was born in lands between sun and moon and he died not by mens hands but of his own will1 the red men of north america2 have a tradition showing how it is that the bear does not die but like herodotus with the sacred stories of the egyptian priests mr schoolcraft cannot induce himself to write it out3 it is a most curious fact that the natives of australia tell a similar tale of their native bear he did not die when attacked by men4 in parts of australia it is a great offence to skin the native bear just as on a part of the west coast of ireland where seals are superstitiously regarded the people cannot be bribed to skin them in new caledonia when a child tries to kill a lizard the men warn him to beware of killing his own ancestor5 the zulus spare to destroy a certain species of serpents believed to be the spirits of kinsmen as the great snake which appeared when aeneas did sacrifice was held to be the ghost of anchises mexican women6 believed that children born during an eclipse turn into mice in australia the natives believe that the wild dog has the power of speech whoever listens to him is petrified and a certain spot is shown where the wild dog spoke and turned the men into stone7 and the blacks run for their lives as soon as the dog begins to speak what it said was bones   1 kalewala in la finlande leouzon le duc 1845 vol ii p 100 cf also the introduction  2 schoolcraft v 420  3 see similar ceremonies propitiatory of the bear in

volkskunde p 17 et seq  7 brough smyth aborigines of victoria i 497   these are minor examples of a form of opinion which is so strong that it is actually the chief constituent in savage society that society whether in ashantee or australia in north america or south africa or north asia or india or among the wilder tribes of ancient peru is based on an institution generally called totemism this very extraordinary institution whatever its origin cannot have arisen except among men capable of conceiving kinship and all human relationships as existing between themselves and all animate and inanimate things it is the rule and not the exception that savage societies are founded upon this belief the political and social conduct of the backward races is regulated in such matters as bloodfeud and marriage by theories of the actual kindred and connection by descent or by old friendship which men have in common with beasts plants the sun and moon the stars and even the wind and the rain now in whatever way this belief in such relations to beasts and plants may have arisen it undoubtedly testifies to a condition of mind in which no hard and fast line was drawn between man and animate and inanimate nature the discovery of the wide distribution of the social arrangements based on this belief is entirely due to mr j f mlennan the author of primitive marriage mr mlennans essays the worship of plants and animals totems and totemism were published in the fortnightly review 186971 any follower in the footsteps of mr mlennan has it in his power to add a little evidence to that originally set forth and perhaps to sift the somewhat uncritical authorities adduced1   1 see also mr frazers totemism and golden bough with chapter on totemism in modern mythology   the name totemism or totamism was first applied at the end of the last century by long1 to the red indian custom which acknowledges human kinship with animals this institution had already been recognised among the iroquois by lafitau2 and by other observers as to the word totem mr max muller3 quotes an opinion that the interpreters missionaries government inspectors and others who apply the name totem to the indian family mark must have been ignorant of the indian languages for there is in them no such word as totem the right word it appears is otem but as totemism has the advantage of possessing the ground we prefer to say totemism rather than otemism the facts are the same whatever name we give them as mr muller says himself4 every warrior has his crest which is called his totem5 and he goes on to describe a totem of an indian who died about 1793 we may now return to the consideration of otemism or totemism we approach it rather as a fact in the science of mythology than as a stage in the evolution of the modern family system for us totemism is interesting because it proves the existence of that savage mental attitude which assumes kindred and alliance between man and the things in the world as will afterwards be seen totemism has also left its mark on the mythologies of the civilised races we shall examine the institution first as it is found in australia because the australian form of totemism shows in the highest known degree the savage habit of confusing in a community of kinship men stars plants beasts the heavenly bodies and the forces of nature when this has once been elucidated a shorter notice of other totemistic races will serve our purpose   1 voyages and travels 1791  2 moeurs des sauvages 1724 p 461  3 academy december 15 1883  4 selected essays 1881 ii 376  5 compare mr max mullers contributions to the science of mythology   the society of the murri or black fellows of australia is divided into local tribes each of which possesses or used to possess and hunt over a considerable tract of country these local tribes are united by contiguity and by common local interests but not necessarily by blood kinship for example the port mackay tribe the mount gambier tribe the ballarat tribe all take their names from their district in the same way we might speak of the people of strathclyde or of northumbria in early english history now all these local tribes contain an indefinite number of stocks of kindred of men believing themselves to be related by the ties of blood and common descent that descent the groups agree in tracing not from some real or idealised human parent but from some animal plant or other natural object as the kangaroo the emu the iguana the pelican and so forth persons of the pelican stock in the north of queensland regard themselves as relations of people of the same stock in the most southern parts of australia the creature from which each tribe claims descent is called of the same flesh while persons of another stock are fresh flesh a native may not marry a woman of his own flesh it is only a woman of fresh or strange flesh he may marry a man may not eat an animal of his own flesh he may only eat strange flesh only under great stress of need will an australian eat the animal which is the fleshandblood cousin and protector of his stock1 these rules of marriage and blood however do not apply among the arunta of central australia whose totems if totems they should be called have been developed on very different lines2 clearer evidence of the confusion between man and beast of the claiming of kin between man and beast could hardly be   1 dawson aborigines pp 26 27 howitt and fison kamilaroi and kurnai p 169  2 spencer and gillen native tribes of central australia   but the australian philosophy of the intercommunion of nature goes still farther than this besides the local divisions and the kindred stocks which trace their descent from animals there exist among many australian tribes divisions of a kind still unexplained for example every man of the mount gambier local tribe is by birth either a kumite or a kroki this classification applies to the whole of the sensible universe thus smoke and honeysuckle trees belong to the division kumite and are akin to the fishhawk stock of men on the other hand the kangaroo summer autumn the wind and the shevak tree belong to the division kroki and are akin to the black cockatoo stock of men any human member of the kroki division has thus for his brothers the sun the wind the kangaroo and the rest while any man of the kumite division and the crow surname is the brother of the rain the thunder and the winter this extraordinary belief is not a mere idle fancyit influences conduct a man does not kill or use as food any of the animals of the same subdivision kroki or kumite with himself excepting when hunger compels and then they express sorrow for having to eat their wingong friends or tumanang their flesh when using the last word they touch their breasts to indicate the close relationship meaning almost a portion of themselves to illustrate one day one of the blacks killed a crow three or four days afterwards a boortwa a man of the crow surname and stock named larry died he had been ailing for some days but the killing of his wingong totem hastened his death1 commenting on this statement mr fison observes the south australian savage looks upon the universe as the great tribe to one of whose divisions he himself belongs and all things animate and inanimate which belong to his class are parts of the body corporate whereof he himself is part this account of the australian beliefs and customs is borne out to a certain extent by the evidence of sir george grey2 and of the late mr gideon scott lang3 these two writers take no account of the singular dichotomous divisions as of kumite and kroki but they draw attention to the groups of kindred which derive their surnames from animals plants and the like the origin of these family names says sir george grey is attributed by the natives to different causes one origin frequently assigned by the natives is that they were derived from some vegetable or animal being very common in the district which the family inhabited we have seen from the evidence of messrs fison and howitt that a more common native explanation is based on kinship with the vegetable or plant which bestows the family surname sir george gray mentions that the families use their plant or animal as a crest or kobong totem and he adds that natives never willingly kill animals of their kobong holding that some one of that species is their nearest friend the consequences of eating forbidden animals vary considerably sometimes the boylyas that is ghosts avenge the crime thus when sir george grey ate some mussels which after all are not the crest of the greys a storm followed and one of his black fellow improvised this stave        oh wherefore did he eat the mussels      now the boylyas storms and thunders make      oh wherefore would he eat the mussels   1 kamilaroi and kurnai p 169  2 travels ii 225  3 lang lecture on natives of australia p 10   there are two points in the arrangements of these stocks of kindred named from plants and animals which we shall find to possess a high importance no member of any such kindred may marry a woman of the same name and descended from the same object1 thus no man of the emu stock may marry an emu woman no blacksnake may marry a blacksnake woman and so forth this point is very strongly put by mr dawson who has had much experience of the blacks so strictly are the laws of marriage carried out that should any sign of courtship or affection be observed between those of one flesh the brothers or male relatives of the woman beat her severely if the incestuous pair though not in the least related according to our ideas run away together they are halfkilled and if the woman dies in consequence of her punishment her partner in iniquity is beaten again no eric or bloodfine of any kind is paid for her death which carries no bloodfeud her punishment is legal2 this account fully corroborates that of sir george grey3   1 taplin the nerrinyeri p 2 every tribe regarded by them as a family has its ngaitge or tutelary genius or tribal symbol in the shape of some bird beast fish reptile insect or substance between individuals of the same tribe no marriage can take place among the narrinyeri kindred is reckoned p 10 on the fathers side see also p 46 ngaitge  samoan aitu no man or woman will kill their ngaitge except with precautions for food  2 op cit p 28  3 ibid ii 220   our conclusion is that the belief in one flesh a kinship shared with the animals must be a thoroughly binding idea as the notion is sanctioned by capital punishment  another important feature in australian totemism strengthens our position the idea of the animal kinship must be an ancient one in the race because the family surname emu bandicoot or what not and the crest kobong or protecting and kindred animal are inherited through the mothers side in the majority of stocks this custom therefore belongs to that early period of human society in which the woman is the permanent and recognised factor in the family while male parentage is uncertain1 one other feature of australian totemism must be mentioned before we leave the subject there is some evidence that in certain tribes the wingong or totem of each man is indicated by a tattooed representation of it upon his flesh the natives are very licentious but men would shrink from an amour with a woman who neither belonged to their own district nor spoke their language but who in spite of that was of their totem to avoid mistakes it seems that some tribes mark the totem on the flesh with incised lines2 the natives frequently design figures of some kind on the trees growing near the graves of deceased warriors some observers have fancied that in these designs they recognised the totem of the dead men but on this subject evidence is by no means clear we shall see that this primitive sort of heraldry this carving or painting of hereditary blazons is common among the red men of america3   1 cf bachofen das mutterrecht mlennan primitive marriage passim encycl brit s v family  2 fison op cit p 66  3 among other recent sources see howitt in organisation of australian tribes transactions of royal society of victoria 1889 and spencer and gillen natives of central australia in central australia there is a marked difference in the form of totemism   though a large amount of evidence might be added to that already put forward we may now sum up the inferences to be drawn from the study of totemism in australia it has been shown 1 that the natives think themselves actually akin to animals plants the sun and the wind and things in general 2 that those ideas influence their conduct and even regulate their social arrangements because 3 men and women of the kinship of the same animal or plant may not intermarry while men are obliged to defend and in case of murder to avenge persons of the stock of the family or plant from which they themselves derive their family name thus on the evidence of institutions it is plain that the australians are or before the influence of the europeans became prevalent were in a state of mind which draws no hard and fast line between man and the things in the world if therefore we find that in australian myth men gods beasts and things all shift shapes incessantly and figure in a coroboree dance of confusion there will be nothing to astonish us in the discovery the myths of men in the australian intellectual condition of men who hold long conversations with the little native bear and ask him for oracles will naturally and inevitably be grotesque and confused1   1 brough smyth i 447 on ms authority of w thomas   it is a far cry from australia to the west coast of africa and it is scarcely to be supposed that the australians have borrowed ideas and institutions from ashantee or that the people of ashantee have derived their conceptions of the universe from the murri of australia we find however on the west african coast just as we do in australia that there exist large local divisions of the natives these divisions are spoken of by mr bowditch who visited the country on a mission in 1817 as nations and they are much more populous and powerful as the people are more civilised than the local tribes of australia yet just as among the local tribes of australia the nations of the west african coast are divided into stocks of kindred each stock having its representatives in each nation thus an ashantee or a fantee may belong to the same stock of kindred as a member of the assin or akini nation when an ashantee of the annona stock of kindred meets a warsaw man of the same stock they salute and acknowledge each other as brothers in the same way a ballarat man of the kangaroo stock in australia recognises a relative in a mount gambier man who is also a kangaroo now with one exception all the names of the twelve stocks of west african kindreds or at least all of them which mr bowditch could get the native interpreters to translate are derived from animals plants and other natural objects just as in australia1 thus quonna is a buffalo abrootoo is a cornstalk abbradi a plantain other names are in english the parrot the wild cat red earth panther and dog thus all the natives of this part of africa are parrots dogs buffaloes panthers and so forth just as the australians are emus iguanas black cockatoos kangaroos and the rest it is remarkable that there is an incra stock or clan of ants in ashantee just as there was a race of myrmidons believed to be descended from or otherwise connected with ants in ancient greece though bowditchs account of these west african family divisions is brief the arrangement tallies closely with that of australia it is no great stretch of imagination to infer that the african tribes do or once did believe themselves to be of the kindred of the animals whose names they bear2 it is more or less confirmatory of this hypothesis that no family is permitted to use as food the animal from which it derives its name we have seen that a similar rule prevails as far as hunger and scarcity of victuals permit it to be obeyed among the natives of australia the intchwa stock in ashantee and fantee is particularly unlucky because its members may not eat the dog much relished by native epicures and therefore a serious privation equally to be pitied were the ancient egyptians who if they belonged to the district of the sheep might not eat mutton which their neighbours the lycopolitae devoured at pleasure these restrictions appear to be connected with the almost universal dislike of cannibals to eat persons of their own kindred except as a pious duty this law of the game in cannibalism has not yet been thoroughly examined though we often hear of wars waged expressly for the purpose of securing food human meat while some south american tribes actually bred from captive women by way of securing constant supplies of permitted flesh3 when we find stocks then which derive their names from animals and decline to eat these animals we may at least suspect that they once claimed kinship with the namegiving beasts the refusal to eat them raises a presumption of such faith old bosman4 had noticed the same practices one eats no mutton another no goats flesh another no beef swines flesh wild fowl cocks with white feathers and they say their ancestors did so from the beginning of the world   1 the evidence of native interpreters may be viewed with suspicion it is improbable however that in 1817 the interpreters were acquainted with the totemistic theory of mythologists and deliberately mistranslated the names of the stocks so as to make them harmonise with indian australian and red indian totem kindreds this indeed is an example where the criterion of recurrence or coincidence seems to be valuable bowditchs mission to ashantee 1873 p 181  2 this view however does not prevail among the totemistic tribes of british columbia for example  3 cieza de leon hakluyt society p 50 this amazing tale is supported by the statement that kinship went by the female side p 49 the father was thus not of the kin of his child by the alien woman cieza was with validillo in 1538  4 in pinkerton xvi 400   while in the case of the ashantee tribes we can only infer the existence of a belief in kinship with the animals from the presence of the other features of fully developed totemism especially from the refusal to eat the namegiving animal we have direct evidence for the opinion in another part of africa among the bechuanas1 casalis who passed twentythree years as a missionary in south africa thus describes the institution while the united communities usually bear the name of their chief or of the district which they inhabit local tribes as in australia each stock tribu derives its title from an animal or a vegetable all the bechuanas are subdivided thus into bakuenas crocodilemen batlapis men of the fish banarer of the buffalo banukus porcupines bamoraras wild vines and so forth the bakuenas call the crocodile their father sing about him in their feasts swear by him and mark the ears of their cattle with an incision which resembles the open jaws of the creature this custom of marking the cattle with the crest as it were of the stock takes among some races the shape of deforming themselves so as the more to resemble the animal from which they claim descent the chief of the family which holds the chief rank in the stock is called the great man of the crocodile precisely in the same way the duchess of sutherland is styled in gaelic the great lady of the cat though totemism is probably not the origin of this title   1 e casalis les bassoutos 1859   casalis proceeds no one would dare to eat the flesh or wear the skin of the animal whose name he bears if the animal be dangerousthe lion for examplepeople only kill him after offering every apology and asking his pardon purification must follow such a sacrifice casalis was much struck with the resemblance between these practices and the similar customs of north american races livingstones account1 on the whole corroborates that of casalis though he says the batau tribe of the lion no longer exists they use the word bina to dance in reference to the custom of thus naming themselves so that when you wish to ascertain what tribe they belong to you say what do you dance it would seem as if this had been part of the worship of old the mythological and religious knowledge of the bushmen is still imparted in dances and when a man is ignorant of some myth he will say i do not dance that dance meaning that he does not belong to the guild which preserves that particular sacred chapter2   1 missionary travels 1857 p 13  2 orpen cape monthly magazine 1872   casalis noticed the similarity between south african and red indian opinion about kinship with vegetables and beasts the difficulty in treating the red indian belief is chiefly found in the abundance of the evidence perhaps the first person who ever used the word totemism or as he spells it totamism was as we said mr long an interpreter among the chippeways who published his voyages in 1791 long was not wholly ignorant of the languages as it was his business to speak them and he was an adopted indian the ceremony of adoption was painful beginning with a feast of dogs flesh followed by a turkish bath and a prolonged process of tattooing1 according to long2 the totam they conceive assumes the form of some beast or other and therefore they never kill hurt or eat the animal whose form they think this totam bears one man was filled with religious apprehensions and gave himself up to the gloomy belief of bunyan and cowper that he had committed the unpardonable sin because he dreamed he had killed his totem a bear3 this is only one example like the refusal of the osages to kill the beavers with which they count cousins4 that the red mans belief is an actual creed and does influence his conduct   1 long pp 4649  2 ibid p 86  3 ibid p 87  4 schoolcraft i 319   as in australia the belief in common kin with beasts is most clearly proved by the construction of red indian society the totemistic stage of thought and manners prevails thus charlevoix says1 plusieurs nations ont chacune trois familles ou tribus principales aussi anciennes a ce quil paroit que leur origine chaque tribu porte le nom dun animal et la nation entiere a aussi le sien dont elle prend le nom et dont la figure est sa marque ou se lon veut ses armoiries on ne signe point autrement les traites quen traceant ces figures among the animal totems charlevoix notices porcupine bear wolf and turtle the armoiries the totemistic heraldry of the peoples of virginia greatly interested a heraldic ancestor of gibbon the historian2 who settled in the colony according to schoolcraft3 the totem or family badge of a dead warrior is drawn in a reverse position on his gravepost in the same way the leopards of england are drawn reversed on the shield of an english king opposite the mention of his death in old monkish chronicles as a general rule4 persons bearing the same totem in america cannot intermarry the union must be between various totems moreover as in the case of the australians the descent of the chief is in the female line we thus find among the red men precisely the same totemistic regulations as among the aborigines of australia like the australians the red men never perhaps we should read hardly ever eat their totems totemists in short spare the beasts that are their own kith and kin to avoid multiplying details which all corroborate each other it may suffice to refer to schoolcraft for totemism among the iowas5 and the pueblos6 for the iroquois to lafitau a missionary of the early part of the eighteenth century lafitau was perhaps the first writer who ever explained certain features in greek and other ancient myths and practices as survivals from totemism the chimera a composite creature lion goat and serpent might represent lafitau thought a league of three totem tribes just as wolf bear and turtle represented the iroquois league   1 histoire de la francenouvelle iii 266  2 introductio ad latinam blasoniam by john gibbon blue mantle london 1682 the dancers were painted some party per pale gul and sab some party per

martyred pere rasles again writing in 17231 says that one stock of the outaonaks claims descent from a hare the great hare was a man of prodigious size while another stock derive their lineage from the carp and a third descends from a bear yet they do not scruple after certain expiatory rites to eat bears flesh other north american examples are the kutchin who have always possessed the system of totems2   1 kips jesuits in america i 33  2 dalls alaska pp 196198   it is to be noticed as a peculiarity of red indian totemism which we have not observed though it may exist in africa that certain stocks claim relations with the sun thus pere le petit writing from new orleans in 1730 mentions the sun or great chief of the natchez indians1 the totem of the privileged class among the natchez was the sun and in all myths the sun is regarded as a living being who can have children who may be beaten who bleeds when cut and is simply on the same footing as men and everything else in the world precisely similar evidence comes from south america in this case our best authority is almost beyond suspicion he knew the native languages well being himself a halfcaste he was learned in the european learning of his time and as a son of the incas he had access to all surviving peruvian stores of knowledge and could collect without difficulty the testimonies of his countrymen it will be seen2 that don garcilasso de la vega could estimate evidence and ridiculed the rough methods and fallacious guesses of spanish inquirers garcilasso de la vega was born about 1540 being the son of an inca princess and of a spanish conqueror his book commentarias reales3 was expressly intended to rectify the errors of such spanish writers as acosta in his account of peruvian religion garcilasso distinguishes between the beliefs of the tribes previous to the rise of the inca empire and the sunworship of the incas but it is plain from garcilassos own account and from other evidence that under the incas the older faiths and fetichisms survived in subordination to sunworship just as pagan superstitions survived in custom and folklore after the official recognition of christianity sunworship in peru and the belief in a supreme creator there seem even like catholicism in mexico china and elsewhere to have made a kind of compromise with the lower beliefs and to have been content to allow a certain amount of bowing down in the temples of the elder faiths according then to garcilassos account of peruvian totemism an indian was not looked upon as honourable unless he was descended from a fountain river4 or lake or even from the sea or from a wild animal such as a bear lion tiger eagle or the bird they call cuntur condor or some other bird of prey 5 a certain amount of worship was connected with this belief in kinship with beasts and natural objects men offered up to their totems what they usually saw them eat6 on the seacoasts they worshipped sardines skates dogfish and for want of larger gods crabs there was not an animal how vile and filthy soever that they did not worship as a god including lizards toads and frogs garcilasso who says they ate the fish they worshipped gives his own theory of the origin of totemism in the beginning men had only sought for badges whereby to discriminate one human stock from another the one desired to have a god different from the other they only thought of making one different from another when the inca emperors began to civilise the totemistic stocks they pointed out that their own father the sun possessed splendour and beauty as contrasted with the ugliness and filth of the frogs and other vermin they looked upon as gods7 garcilasso of course does not use the north american word totem or ote or otem for the family badge which represented the family ancestors he calls these things as a general rule pacarissa the sun was the pacarissa of the incas as it was of the chief of the natchez the pacarissa of other stocks was the lion bear frog or what not garcilasso accounts for the belief accorded to the incas when they claimed actual descent from the sun by observing8 that there were tribes among their subjects who professed similar fabulous descents though they did not comprehend how to select ancestors so well as the incas but adored animals and other low and earthly objects as to the fact of the peruvian worship of beasts if more evidence is wanted it is given among others by cieza de leon9 who contrasts the adoration of the roman gods with that offered in peru to brutes in the important temple of pachacamac the spiritual deity of peru they worshipped a shefox or vixen and an emerald the devil also appeared to them and spoke in the form of a tiger very fierce other examples of totemism in south america may be studied in the tribes on the amazon10 mr wallace found the pineapple stock the mosquitoes woodpeckers herons and other totem kindreds a curious example of similar ideas is discovered among the bonis of guiana these people were originally west coast africans imported as slaves who have won their freedom with the sword while they retain a rough belief in gadou god and didibi the devil they are divided into totem stocks with animal names the red ape turtle and cayman are among the chief totems11   1 kip ii 288  2 appendix b  3 see translation in hakluyt

objects which underlies institutions in australia west and south africa north and south america we may glance at similar notions among the nonaryan races of india in daltons ethnology of bengal1 he tells us that the garo clans are divided into maharis or motherhoods children belong to the mahari of the mother just as in general they derive their stock name and totem from the mothers side in australia and among the north american indians no man may marry as among the red indians and australians a woman belonging to his own stock motherhood or mahari so far the maharis of bengal exactly correspond to the totem kindred but do the maharis also take their names from plants and animals and so forth we know that the killis similar communities among the bengal hos and mundos do this2 the mundaris like the oraons adopt as their tribal distinction the name of some animal and the flesh of that animal is tabooed to them as food for example the eel the tortoise this is exactly the state of things in ashanti dalton mentions also3 a princely family in nagpur which claims descent from a great hooded snake among the oraons he found4 tribes which might not eat young mice considered a dainty or tortoises and a stock which might not eat the oil of the tree which was their totem nor even sit in its shade the family or tribal names within which they may not marry are usually those of animals or plants and when this is the case the flesh of some part of the animal or the fruit of the tree is tabooed to the tribe called after it   1 dalton p 63  2 ibid p 189  3 ibid p 166  4 ibid p 254   an excellent sketch of totemism in india is given by mr h h risley of the bengal civil service1   1 the asiatic quarterly no 3 essay on primitive marriage in bengal   at the bottom of the social system as understood by the average hindu stands a large body of nonaryan castes and tribes each of which is broken up into a number of what may be called totemistic exogamous septs each sept bears the name of an animal a tree a plant or of some material object natural or artificial which the members of that sept are prohibited from killing eating cutting burning carrying using etc1   1 here we may note that the origin of exogamy itself is merely part of a strict totemistic prohibition a man may not use an object within the totem kin nor a woman of the kin compare the greek idiom greek text omitted   mr risley finds that both kolarians as the sonthals and dravidians as the oraons are in this state of totemism like the hos and mundas it is most instructive to learn that as one of these tribes rises in the social scale it sloughs off its totem and abandoning the common name derived from bird beast or plant adopts that of an eponymous ancestor a tendency in this direction has been observed by messrs fison and howitt even in australia the mahilis koras and kurmis who profess to be members of the hindu community still retain the totemistic organisation with names derived from birds beasts and plants even the jagannathi kumhars of orissa taking rank immediately below the writercaste have the totems tiger snake weasel cow frog sparrow and tortoise the subcastes of the khatlya kumhars explain away their totemnames as names of certain saints who being present at dakshas horsesacrifice transformed themselves into animals to escape the wrath of siva like the gods of egypt when they fled in bestial form from the wrath of set  among the nonaryan tribes the marriage law has the totemistic sanction no man may marry a woman of his totem kin when the totemname is changed for an eponym the nonaryan rising in the social scale is practically in the same position as the brahmans divided into exogamous sections gotras the members of which profess to be descended from the mythical rishi or inspired saint whose name the gotra bears there is thus nothing to bar the conjecture that the exogamous gotras of the whole brahmans were once a form of totemkindred which like aspiring nonaryan stocks at the present day dropped the totemname and renamed the septs from some eponymous hero medicineman or rishi  constant repetition of the same set of facts becomes irksome and yet is made necessary by the legitimate demand for trustworthy and abundant evidence as the reader must already have reflected this living mythical belief in the common confused equality of men gods plants beasts rivers and what not which still regulates savage society1 is one of the most prominent features in mythology porphyry remarked and exactly described it among the egyptianscommon and akin to men and gods they believed the beasts to be2 the belief in such equality is alien to modern civilisation we have shown that it is common and fundamental in savagery for instance in the pacific we might quote turner3 and for melanesia codrington4 while for new zealand we have taylor5 for the jakuts along the banks of the lena in northern asia we have the evidence of strahlenberg who writes each tribe of these people look upon some particular creature as sacred eg a swan goose raven etc and such is not eaten by that tribe though the others may eat it6 as the majority of our witnesses were quite unaware that the facts they described were common among races of whom many of them had never even heard their evidence may surely be accepted as valid especially as the beliefs testified to express themselves in marriage laws in the bloodfeud in abstinence from food on pillars over graves in rude heraldry and in other obvious and palpable shapes if we have not made out by the evidence of institutions that a confused credulity concerning the equality and kinship of man and the objects in nature is actually a ruling belief among savages and even higher races from the lena to the amazon from the gold coast to queensland we may despair of ever convincing an opponent the survival of the same beliefs and institutions among civilised races aryan and others will later be demonstrated7 if we find that the mythology of civilised races here agrees with the actual practical belief of savages and if we also find that civilised races retain survivals of the institutions in which the belief is expressed by savages then we may surely infer that the activity of beasts in the myths of greece springs from the same sources as the similar activity of beasts in the myths of iroquois or kaffirs that is to say part of the irrational element in greek myth will be shown to be derived whether by inheritance or borrowing from an ascertained condition of savage fancy   1 see some very curious and disgusting examples of this confusion in liebrechts zur volkskunde pp 395 396 heilbronn 1879  2 de abst ii 26  3 nineteen years in polynesia p 238 and samoa by the same author complete totemism is not

second feature in the savage intellectual condition which we promised to investigate was the belief in magic and sorcery the world and all the things in it being conceived of vaguely as sensible and rational are supposed to obey the commands of certain members of each tribe such as chiefs jugglers or conjurors these conjurors like zeus or indra can affect the weather work miracles assume what shapes animal vegetable or inorganic they please and can metamorphose other persons into similar shapes it has already been shown that savage man has regarded all things as persons much on a level with himself it has now to be shown what kind of person he conceives himself to be he does not look on men as civilised races regard them that is as beings with strict limitations on the other hand he thinks of certain members of his tribe as exempt from most of the limitations and capable of working every miracle that tradition has ever attributed to prophets or gods nor are such miraculous powers such practical omnipotence supposed by savages to be at all rare among themselves though highly valued miraculous attainments are not believed to be unusual this must be kept steadily in mind when mythmaking man regards the sky or sun or wind as a person he does not mean merely a person with the limitations recognised by modern races he means a person with the miraculous powers of the medicineman the sky sun wind or other elemental personage can converse with the dead and can turn himself and his neighbours into animals stones and trees  to understand these functions and their exercise it is necessary to examine what may be called savage science savage metaphysics and the savage theory of the state of the dead the medicinemans supernatural claims are rooted in the general savage view of the world of what is possible and of what if anything is impossible the savage even more than the civilised man may be described as a creature moving about in worlds not realised he feels no less than civilised man the need of making the world intelligible and he is active in his search for causes and effects there is much speculation in these eyes that he doth glare withal this is a statement which has been denied by some persons who have lived with savages thus mr bates in his naturalist on the amazon1 writes their want of curiosity is extreme vicente an indian companion did not know the cause of thunder and lightning i asked him who made the sun the stars the trees he didnt know and had never heard the subject mentioned in his tribe but mr bates admits that even vicente had a theory of the configuration of the world the necessity of a theory of the earth and water had been felt and a theory had been suggested again mr bates says about a certain brazilian tribe their sluggish minds seem unable to conceive or feel the want of a theory of the soul and he thinks the cause of this indolence is the lack of a written language or a leisured class now savages as a rule are all in the leisured class all sportsmen mr herbert spencer too has expressed scepticism about the curiosity attributed to savages the point is important because in our view the medicinemans powers are rooted in the savage theory of things and if the savage is too sluggish to invent or half consciously evolve a theory of things our hypothesis is baseless again we expect to find in savage myths the answer given by savages to their own questions but this view is impossible if savages do not ask themselves and never have asked themselves any questions at all about the world on this topic mr spencer writes along with absence of surprise there naturally goes absence of intelligent curiosity2 yet mr spencer admits that according to some witnesses the dyaks have an insatiable curiosity the samoans are usually very inquisitive and the tahitians are remarkably curious and inquisitive nothing is more common than to find travellers complaining that savages in their ardently inquiring curiosity will not leave the european for a moment to his own undisturbed devices mr spencers savages who showed no curiosity displayed this impassiveness when europeans were trying to make them exhibit signs of surprise impassivity is a point of honour with many uncivilised races and we cannot infer that a savage has no curiosity because he does not excite himself over a mirror or when his european visitors try to swagger with their mechanical appliances mr herbert spencer founds on the statements of mr bates already quoted a notion that the savage lacking ability to think and the accompanying desire to know is without tendency to speculate he backs mr batess experience with mungo parks failure to draw the negroes about the causes of day and night they had never indulged a conjecture nor formed an hypothesis on the matter yet park avers that the belief in one god is entire and universal among them this he pronounces without the smallest shadow of doubt as to primitive man according to mr spencer the need for explanations about surrounding appearances does not occur to him we have disclaimed all knowledge about primitive man but it is easy to show that mr spencer grounds his belief in the lack of speculation among savages on a frail foundation of evidence   1 vol ii p 162  2 sociology p 98   mr spencer has admitted speculation or at least curiosity among new caledonians new guinea people dyaks samoans and tahitians even where he denies its existence as among the amazon tribes mentioned by mr bates we happen to be able to show that mr bates was misinformed another traveller the american geologist professor hartt of cornell university lived long among the tribes of the amazon but professor hartt did not like mr bates find them at all destitute of theories of thingstheories expressed in myths and testifying to the intellectual activity and curiosity which demands an answer to its questions professor hartt when he first became acquainted with the indians of the amazon knew that they were well supplied with myths and he set to work to collect them but he found that neither by coaxing nor by offers of money could he persuade an indian to relate a myth only by accident while wearily paddling up the paranamirim of the ituki did he hear the steersman telling stories to the oarsmen to keep them awake professor hartt furtively noted down the tale and he found that by setting the ball rolling and narrating a story himself he could make the natives throw off reserve and add to his stock of tales after one has obtained his first myth and has learned to recite it accurately and spiritedly the rest is easy the tales published by professor hartt are chiefly animal stories like those current in africa and among the red indians and hartt even believed that many of the legends had been imported by negroes but as the majority of the negro myths like those of the australians give a reason why for the existence of some phenomenon or other the argument against early mans curiosity and vivacity of intellect is rather injured even if the amazonian myths were imported from africa mr spencer based his disbelief in the intellectual curiosity of the amazonian tribes and of negroes on the reports of mr bates and of mungo park but it turns out that both negroes and amazonians have stories which do satisfy an unscientific curiosity and it is even held that the negroes lent the amazonians these very stories1 the kamschadals according to steller give themselves a reason why for everything according to their own lively fancy and do not leave the smallest matter uncriticised2 as far then as mr spencers objections apply to existing savages we may consider them overweighed by the evidence and we may believe in a naive savage curiosity about the world and desire for explanations of the causes of things mr tylors opinion corroborates our own mans craving to know the causes at work in each event he witnesses the reasons why each state of things he surveys is such as it is and no other is no product of high civilisation but a characteristic of his race down to its lowest stages among rude savages it is already an intellectual appetite whose satisfaction claims many of the moments not engrossed by war or sport food or sleep even in the botocudo or the australian scientific speculation has its germ in actual experience3 it will be shown later that the food of the savage intellectual appetite is offered and consumed in the shape of explanatory myths   1 see amazonian tortoisemyth pp 5 37 40 and compare mr harriss preface to nights with uncle remus  2 steller p 267 cf farrers primitive manners p 274  3 primitive culture i 369   but we must now observe that the actual experience properly so called of the savage is so limited and so coloured by misconception and superstition that his knowledge of the world varies very much from the conceptions of civilised races he seeks an explanation a theory of things based on his experience but his knowledge of physical causes and of natural laws is exceedingly scanty and he is driven to fall back upon what we may call metaphysical or in many cases supernatural explanations the narrower the range of mans knowledge of physical causes the wider is the field which he has to fill up with hypothetical causes of a metaphysical or supernatural character these supernatural causes themselves the savage believes to be matters of experience it is to his mind a matter of experience that all nature is personal and animated that men may change shapes with beasts that incantations and supernatural beings can cause sunshine and storm  a good example of this is given in charlevoixs work on french canada1 charlevoix was a jesuit father and missionary among the hurons and other tribes of north america he thus describes the philosophy of the red men the hurons attribute the most ordinary effects to supernatural causes2 in the same page the good father himself attributes the welcome arrival of rainy weather and the cure of certain savage patients to the prayers of pere brebeuf and to the exhibition of the sacraments charlevoix had considerably extended the field in which natural effects are known to be produced by natural causes he was much more scientifically minded than his savage flock and was quite aware that an ordinary clock with a pendulum cannot bring bad luck to a whole tribe and that a weathercock is not a magical machine for securing unpleasant weather the hurons however knowing less of natural causes and nothing of modern machinery were as convinced that his clock was ruining the luck of the tribe and his weathercock spoiling the weather as father charlevoix could be of the truth of his own inferences one or two other anecdotes in the good fathers history and letters help to explain the difference between the philosophies of wild and of christian men the pere brebeuf was once summoned at the instigation of a huron wizard or medicineman before a council of the tribe his judges told the father that nothing had gone right since he appeared among them to this brebeuf replied by drawing the attention of the savages to the absurdity of their principles he admitted3 the premise that nothing had turned out well in the tribe since his arrival but the reason said he plainly is that god is angry with your hardness of heart no sooner had the good father thus demonstrated the absurdity of savage principles of reasoning than the malignant huron wizard fell down dead at his feet this event naturally added to the confusion of the savages   1 histoire de la francenouvelle  2 vol i p 191  3 vol i p 192   coincidences of this sort have a great effect on savage minds catlin the friend of the mandan tribe mentions a chief who consolidated his power by aid of a little arsenic bought from the whites the chief used to prophesy the sudden death of his opponents which always occurred at the time indicated the natural results of the administration of arsenic were attributed by the barbarous people to supernatural powers in the possession of the chief1 thus the philosophy of savages seeks causas cognoscere rerum like the philosophy of civilised men but it flies hastily to a hypothesis of supernatural causes which are only guessed at and are incapable of demonstration this frame of mind prevails still in civilised countries as the bishop of nantes showed when in 1846 he attributed the floods of the loire to the excesses of the press and the general disregard of sunday that supernatural causes exist and may operate it is not at all our intention to deny but the habit of looking everywhere for such causes and of assuming their interference at will is the main characteristic of savage speculation the peculiarity of the savage is that he thinks human agents can work supernaturally whereas even the bishop reserved his supernatural explanations for the deity on this belief in mans power to affect events beyond the limits of natural possibility is based the whole theory of magic the whole power of sorcerers that theory again finds incessant expression in myth and therefore deserves our attention   1 catlin letters ii 117   the theory requires for its existence an almost boundless credulity this credulity appears to europeans to prevail in full force among savages bosman is amazed by the african belief that a spider created the world moffat is astonished at the south african notion that the sea was accidentally created by a girl charlevoix says les sauvages sont dune facilite a croire ce quon leur dit que les plus facheuse experiences nont jamais pu guerir1 but it is a curious fact that while savages are as a rule so credulous they often laugh at the religious doctrines taught them by missionaries elsewhere they recognise certain essential doctrines as familiar forms of old dr moffat remarks to speak of the creation the fall and the resurrection seemed more fabulous extravagant and ludicrous to them than their own vain stories of lions and hyaenas again the gospel appeared too preposterous for the most foolish to believe2 while the zulus declared that they used to accept their own myths without inquiry3 it was a zulu who suggested to bishop colenso his doubts about the historical character of the noachian deluge hearne4 knew a red man matorabhee who though a perfect bigot with regard to the arts and tricks of the jugglers could yet by no means be impressed with a belief of any part of our religion lieutenant haggard rn tells the writer that during an eclipse at lamoo he ridiculed the native notion of driving away a beast which devours the moon and explained the real cause of the phenomenon but his native friend protested that he could not be expected to believe such a story yet other savages aver an old agreement with the belief in a moral creator   1 vol ii p 378  2 missionary labours p 245  3 callaway religion of amazulus i 35  4 journey among the indians 1795 p 350   we have already seen sufficient examples of credulity in savage doctrines about the equal relations of men and beasts stars clouds and plants the same readiness of belief which would be surprising in a christian child has been found to regulate the rudimentary political organisations of grey barbarians add to this credulity a philosophy which takes resemblance or contiguity in space or nearness in time as a sufficient reason for predicating the relations of cause and effect and we have the basis of savage physical science yet the metaphysical theories of savages as expressed in maori polynesian and zuni hymns often amaze us by their wealth of abstract ideas coincidence elsewhere stands for cause  post hoc ergo propter hoc is the motto of the savage philosophy of causation the untutored reasoner speculates on the principles of the egyptian clergy as described by herodotus1 the egyptians have discovered more omens and prodigies than any other men for when aught prodigious occurs they keep good watch and write down what follows and then if anything like the prodigy be repeated they expect the same events to follow as before this way of looking at things is the very essence of superstition   1 ii p 82   savages as a rule are not even so scientific as the egyptians when an untoward event occurs they look for its cause among all the less familiar circumstances of the last few days and select the determining cause very much at random thus the arrival of the french missionaries among the hurons was coincident with certain unfortunate events therefore it was argued that the advent of the missionaries was the cause of the misfortune when the bechuanas suffered from drought they attributed the lack of rain to the arrival of dr moffat and especially to his beard his church bell and a bag of salt in his possession here there was not even the pretence of analogy between cause and effect some savages might have argued it is quite in their style that as salt causes thirst a bag of salt causes drought but no such case could be made out against dr moffats bell and beard to give an example from the beliefs of english peasants when a cottage was buried by a little avalanche in 1772 the accident was attributed to the carelessness of the cottagers who had allowed a light to be taken out of their dwelling in christmastide1 we see the same confusion between antecedence and consequence in time on one side and cause and effect on the other when the red indians aver that birds actually bring winds and storms or fair weather they take literally the sense of the rhodian swallowsong        the swallow hath come      bringing fair hours      bringing fair seasons      on black back and white breast2   1 shropshire folklore by miss burne iii 401  2 brinton myths of new world p 107   again in the pacific the people of one island always attribute hurricanes to the machinations of the people of the nearest island to windward the wind comes from them therefore as their medicinemen can notoriously influence the weather they must have sent the wind this unneighbourly act is a casus belli and through the whole of a group of islands the banner of war like the flag of freedom in byron flies against the wind the chief principle then of savage science is that antecedence and consequence in time are the same as effect and cause1 again savage science holds that like affects like that you can injure a man for example by injuring his effigy on these principles the savage explains the world to himself and on these principles he tries to subdue to himself the world now the putting of these principles into practice is simply the exercise of art magic an art to which nothing seems impossible the belief that his shamans or medicinemen practise this art is universal among savages it seriously affects their conduct and is reflected in their myths   1 see account of zuni metaphysics in chapter on american divine myths   the one general rule which governs all magical reasoning is that casual connection in thought is equivalent to causative connection in fact like suggests like to human thought by association of ideas wherefore like influences like or produces analogous effects in practice any object once in a mans possession especially his hair or his nails is supposed to be capable of being used against him by a sorcerer the part suggests the whole a lock of a mans hair was part of the man to destroy the hair is to destroy its former owner again whatever event follows another in time suggests it and may have been caused by it accompanying these ideas is the belief that nature is peopled by invisible spiritual powers over which magicians and sorcerers possess influence the magic of the lower races chiefly turns on these two beliefs first man having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact proceeded erroneously to invert their action and to conclude that association in thought must involve similar connection in reality he thus attempted to discover to foretell and to cause events by means of processes which we now see to have only an ideal significance1 secondly man endeavoured to make disembodied spirits of the dead or any other spirits obedient to his will savage philosophy presumes that the beliefs are correct and that their practical application is successful examples of the first of the two chief magical ideas are as common in unscientific modern times or among unscientific modern people as in the savage world   1 primitive culture i 14   the physicians of the age of charles ii were wont to give their patients mummy powder that is pulverised mummy they argued that the mummy had lasted for a very long time and that the patients ought to do so likewise pliny imagined that diamonds must be found in company with gold because these are the most perfect substances in the world and like should draw to like aurum potabile or drinkable gold was a favourite medical nostrum of the middle ages because gold being perfect should produce perfect health among savages the belief that like is caused by like is exemplified in very many practices the new caledonians when they wish their yam plots to be fertile bury in them with mystic ceremonies certain stones which are naturally shaped like yams the melanesians have reduced this kind of magic to a system among them certain stones have a magical efficacy which is determined in each case by the shape of the stone a stone in the shape of a pig of a breadfruit of a yam was a most valuable find no garden was planted without the stones which were to increase the crop1 stones with a rude resemblance to beasts bring the zuni luck in the chase   1 rev r h codrington journ anth inst february 1881   the spiritual theory in some places is mixed up with the like to like theory and the magical stones are found where the spirits have been heard twittering and whistling a large stone lying with a number of small ones under it like a sow among her sucklings was good for a childless woman1 it is the savage belief that stones reproduce their species a belief consonant with the general theory of universal animation and personality the ancient belief that diamonds gendered diamonds is a survival from these ideas a stone with little disks upon it was good to bring in money any fanciful interpretation of a mark was enough to give a character to the stone and its associated vui or spirit in melanesia in scotland stones shaped like various parts of the human body are expected to cure the diseases with which these members may be afflicted these stones were called by the names of the limbs which they represented as eyestone headstone the patient washed the affected part of the body and rubbed it well with the stone corresponding2   1 codrington journ anth soc x iii 276  2 gregor folklore of northeast counties p 40   to return from european peasantmagic to that of savages we find that when the bushmen want wet weather they light fires believing that the black smoke clouds will attract black rain clouds while the zulus sacrifice black cattle to attract black clouds of rain1 though this magic has its origin in savage ignorance it survives into civilisation thus the sacrifices of the vedic age were imitations of the natural phenomena which the priests desired to produce2 cetait un moyen de faire tombre la pluie en realisant par les representations terrestres des eaux du nuage et de leclair les conditions dans lesquelles celuici determine dans le ciel lepanchement de cellesla a good example of magical science is afforded by the medical practice of the dacotahs of north america3 when any one is ill an image of his disease a boil or what not is carved in wood this little image is then placed in a bowl of water and shot at with a gun the image of the disease being destroyed the disease itself is expected to disappear compare the magic of the philistines who made golden images of the sores which plagued them and stowed them away in the ark4 the custom of making a wax statuette of an enemy and piercing it with pins or melting it before the fire so that the detested person might waste as his semblance melted was common in mediaeval europe was known to plato and is practised by negroes some australians take some of the hair of an enemy mix it with grease and the feathers of the eagle and burn it in the fire this is bar or black magic the boarding under the chair of a magistrate in barbadoes was lifted not long ago and the ground beneath was found covered with wax images of litigants stuck full of pins   1 callaway i 92  2 bergaigne religion vedique i 126138 i vii viii  3 schoolcraft iv 491  4 1 samuel vi 4 5   the warmagic of the dacotahs works in a similar manner before a party starts on the wartrail the chief with various ceremonies takes his club and stands before his tent an old witch bowls hoops at him each hoop represents an enemy and for each he strikes a foeman is expected to fall a bowl of sweetened water is also set out to entice the spirits of the enemy1 the warmagic of the aryans in india does not differ much in character from that of the dacotahs if any one wishes his army to be victorious he should go beyond the battleline cut a stalk of grass at the top and end and throw it against the hostile army with the words prasahe kas trapasyatio prasaha who sees thee if one who has such knowledge cuts a stalk of grass and throws the parts at the hostile army it becomes split and dissolved just as a daughterinlaw becomes abashed and faints when seeing her fatherinlawan allusion apparently to the widespread tabu which makes fathersinlaw daughtersinlaw sonsinlaw and mothersinlaw avoid each other2   1 schoolcraft iv 496  2 aitareya brahmana iii 22   the huntdances of the red indians and australians are arranged like their warmagic effigies of the bears deer or kangaroos are made or some of the hunters imitate the motions of these animals the rest of the dancers pretend to spear them and it is hoped that this will ensure success among the real bears and kangaroos  here is a singular piece of magic in which europeans and australian blacks agree boris godunoff made his servants swear never to injure him by casting spells with the dust on which his feet or his carriage wheels had left traces1 mr howitt finds the same magic among the kurnai2 seeing a tatungolung very lame i asked him what was the matter he said some fellow has put bottle in my foot i found he was probably suffering from acute rheumatism he explained that some enemy must have found his foottrack and have buried in it a piece of broken bottle the magic influence he believed caused it to enter his foot on another occasion a native told mr howitt that he had seen black fellows putting poison in his foottracks bosman mentions a similar practice among the people of guinea in scottish folklore a screw nail is fixed into the footprint of the person who is to be injured   1 rambauds history of russia english trans i 351  2 kamilaroi and kurnai p 250   just as these magical efforts to influence like by like work their way into vedic and other religions so they are introduced into the religion of the savage his prayers are addresses to some sort of superior being but the efficacy of the prayer is often eked out by a little magic unless indeed we prefer to suppose that the words of the supplication are interpreted by gesturespeech sproat writes set words and gestures are used according to the thing desired for instance in praying for salmon the native rubs the backs of his hands looks upwards and mutters the words many salmon many salmon if he wishes for deer he carefully rubs both eyes or if it is geese he rubs the back of his shoulder uttering always in a singsong way the accustomed formula all these practices in praying no doubt have a meaning we may see a steady hand is needed in throwing the salmonspear and clear eyesight in finding deer in the forest1   1 savage life p 208   in addition to these forms of symbolical magic which might be multiplied to any extent we find among savages the belief in the power of songs of incantation this is a feature of magic which specially deserves our attention in myths and still more in marchen or household tales we shall constantly find that the most miraculous effects are caused when the hero pronounces a few lines of rhyme in rome as we have all read in the latin delectus it was thought that incantations could draw down the moon in the odyssey the kinsfolk of odysseus sing a song of healing over the wound which was dealt him by the boars tusk jeanne darc wounded at orleans refused a similar remedy sophocles speaks of the folly of muttering incantations over wounds that need the surgeons knife the song that salved wounds occurs in the kalewala the epic poem of the finns in many of grimms marchen miracles are wrought by the repetition of snatches of rhyme this belief is derived from the savage state of fancy according to kohl1 every sorrowful or joyful emotion that opens the indians mouth is at once wrapped up in the garb of a wabanonagamowin chanson magicale if you ask one of them to sing you a simple innocent hymn in praise of nature a spring or jovial hunting stave he never gives you anything but a form of incantation with which he says you will be able to call to you all the birds from the sky and all the foxes and wolves from their caves and burrows2 the giants daughter in the scotch marchen nicht nought nothing is thus enabled to call to her aid all the birds of the sky in the same way if you ask an indian for a lovesong he will say that a philtre is really much more efficacious the savage in short is extremely practical his arts music and drawing exist not pour lart but for a definite purpose as methods of getting something that the artist wants the young lover whom kohl knew like the lover of bombyca in theocritus believed in having an image of himself and an image of the beloved into the heart of the female image he thrust magic powders and he said that this was common lovers adding songs partly elegiac partly malicious and almost criminal forms of incantation3   1 page 395  2 cf comparettis traditional poetry of the finns  3 kitchi gami pp 395 397   among the indoaryans the masaminik or incantations of the red man are known as mantras1 these are usually texts from the veda and are chanted over the sick and in other circumstances where magic is believed to be efficacious among the new zealanders the incantations are called karakias and are employed in actual life there is a special karakia to raise the wind in maori myths the hero is very handy with his karakia rocks split before him as before girls who use incantations in kaffir and bushman tales he assumes the shape of any animal at will or flies in the air all by virtue of the karakia or incantation2   1 muir sanskrit texts v 441 incantations from the atharva veda  2 taylors new zealand theals kaffir folklore southafrican folklore journal passim shortlands traditions of the new zealanders pp 130135   without multiplying examples in the savage belief that miracles can be wrought by virtue of physical correspondances by like acting on like by the part affecting the whole and so forth we may go on to the magical results produced by the aid of spirits these may be either spirits of the dead or spiritual essences that never animated mortal men savage magic or science rests partly on the belief that the world is peopled by a choir invisible or rather by a choir only occasionally visible to certain gifted people sorcerers and diviners an enormous amount of evidence to prove the existence of these tenets has been collected by mr tylor and is accessible to all in the chapters on animism in his primitive culture it is not our business here to account for the universality of the belief in spirits mr tylor following lucretius and homer derives the belief from the reasonings of early men on the phenomena of dreams fainting shadows visions caused by narcotics hallucinations and other facts which suggest the hypothesis of a separable life apart from the bodily organism it would scarcely be fair not to add that the kind of facts investigated by the psychical societysuch facts as the appearance of men at the moment of death in places remote from the scene of their decease with such real or delusive experiences as the noises and visions in haunted housesare familiar to savages without discussing these obscure matters it may be said that they influence the thoughts even of some scientifically trained and civilised men it is natural therefore that they should strongly sway the credulous imagination of backward races in which they originate or confirm the belief that life can exist and manifest itself after the death of the body1   1 see the authors making of religion 1898   some examples of savage ghoststories precisely analogous to the facts of the psychical societys investigations may be adduced the first is curious because it offers among the kanekas an example of a belief current in breton folklore the story is vouched for by mr j j atkinson late of noumea new caledonia mr atkinson we have reason to believe was unacquainted with the breton parallel to him one day a kaneka of his acquaintance paid a visit and seemed loth to go away he took leave returned and took leave again till mr atkinson asked him the reason of his behaviour he then explained that he was about to die and would never see his english friend again as he seemed in perfect health mr atkinson rallied him on his hypochondria but the poor fellow replied that his fate was sealed he had lately met in the wood one whom he took for the kaneka girl of his heart but he became aware too late that she was no mortal woman but a woodspirit in the guise of the beloved the result would be his death within three days and as a matter of fact he died this is the groundwork of the old breton ballad of le sieur nan who dies after his intrigue with the forest spectre1 a tale more like a common modern ghoststory is vouched for by mr c j du ve in australia in the year 1860 a maneroo black fellow died in the service of mr du ve the day before he died having been ill some time he said that in the night his father his fathers friend and a female spirit he could not recognise had come to him and said that he would die next day and that they would wait for him mr du ye adds that though previously the christian belief had been explained to this man it had entirely faded and that he had gone back to the belief of his childhood mr fison who prints this tale in his kamilaroi and kurnai2 adds i could give many similar instances which have come within my own knowledge among the fijians and strange to say the dying man in all these cases kept his appointment with the ghosts to the very day   1 it may of course be conjectured that the french introduced this belief into new caledonia  2 page 247   in the cruise of the beagle is a parallel anecdote of a fuegian jimmy button and his fathers ghost  without entering into a discussion of ghosts it is plain that the kind of evidence whatever its value may be which convinces many educated europeans of the existence of veridical apparitions has also played its part in the philosophy of uncivilised races on this belief in apparitions then is based the power of the savage sorcerers and necromants of the men who converse with the dead and are aided by disembodied spirits these men have greatly influenced the beginnings of mythology among certain australian tribes the necromants are called birraark1 the kurnai tell me says mr howitt that a birraark was supposed to be initiated by the mrarts ghosts when they met him wandering in the bush it was from the ghosts that he obtained replies to questions concerning events passing at a distance or yet to happen which might be of interest or moment to his tribe mr howitt prints an account of a spiritual seance in the bush2 the fires were let go down the birraark uttered a cry cooee at intervals at length a distant reply was heard and shortly afterwards the sound as of persons jumping on the ground in succession a voice was then heard in the gloom asking in a strange intonation what is wanted questions were put by the birraark and replies given at the termination of the seance the spiritvoice said we are going finally the birraark was found in the top of an almost inaccessible tree apparently asleep3 there was one birraark at least to every clan the kurnai gave the name of brewin a powerful evil spirit to a birraark who was once carried away for several days by the mrarts or spirits4 it is a belief with the australians as according to bosman it was with the people of the gold coast that a very powerful wizard lives far inland and the negroes held that to this warlock the spirits of the dead went to be judged according to the merit of their actions in life here we have a doctrine answering to the greek belief in the wizard minos aeacus and rhadamanthus and to the egyptian idea of osiris as judge of the departed5 the pretensions of the sorcerer to converse with the dead are attested by mr brough smyth6 a sorcerer lying on his stomach spoke to the deceased and the other sitting by his side received the precious messages which the dead man told as a natural result of these beliefs the australian necromant has great power in the tribe mr howitt mentions a case in which a group of kindred ceasing to use their old totemistic surname called themselves the children of a famous dead birraark who thus became an eponymous hero like ion among the ionians7 among the scotch highlanders the position and practice of the seer were very like those of the birraark a person says scott8 was wrapped up in the skin of a newly slain bullock and deposited beside a waterfall or at the bottom of a precipice or in some other strange wild and unusual situation where the scenery around him suggested nothing but objects of horror in this situation he revolved in his mind the question proposed and whatever was impressed on him by his exalted imagination passed for the inspiration of the disembodied spirits who haunt these desolate recesses a number of examples are given in martins description of the western islands9 in the century magazine july 1882 is a very full report of thlinkeet medicinemen and metamorphoses   1 kamilaroi and kurnai p 253  2 page 254  3 in the jesuit relations 1637 p 51 we read that the red indian sorcerer or jossakeed was credited with power to vanish suddenly away out of sight of the men standing around him of him as of homeric gods it might be said who has power to see him come or go against his will  4 here in the first edition occurred the following passage the conception of brewin is about as near as the kurnai get to the idea of a god their conferring of his name on a powerful sorcerer is therefore a point of importance and interest mr howitts later knowledge demonstrates an error here  5 bosman in pinkerton xvi p 401  6 aborigines of australia i 197  7 in victoria after dark the wizard goes up to the clouds and brings down a good spirit dawkins p 57 for eponymous medicinemen see kamilaroi and kurnai p 231  8 lady of the lake note 1 to canto iv  9 p 112   the sorcerer among the zulus is apparently of a naturally hysterical and nervous constitution he hears the spirits who speak by whistlings speaking to him1 whistling is also the language of the ghosts in new caledonia where mr atkinson informs us that he has occasionally put an ablebodied kaneka to ignominious flight by whistling softly in the dusk the ghosts in homer make a similar sound and even as bats flit gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous cavern even so the souls gibbered as they fared together odyssey xxiv 5 the familiar spirits make him that zulu sorcerer acquainted with what is about to happen and then he divines for the people as the birraarks learn songs and dancemusic from the mrarts so the zulu inyanga or diviners learn magical couplets from the itongo or spirits2   1 callaway religious system of the amazules p 265  2 on all this see possession in the making of religion   the evidence of institutions confirms the reports about savage belief in magic the political power of the diviners is very great as may be observed from the fact that a hereditary chief needs their consecration to make him a chief de jure1 in fact the qualities of the diviner are those which give his sacred authority to the chief when he has obtained from the diviners all their medicines and information as to the mode of using the isitundu a magical vessel it is said that he often orders them to be killed now the chief is so far a medicineman that he is lord of the air the heaven is the chiefs say the zulus and when he calls out his men though the heaven is clear it becomes clouded by the great wind that arises other zulus explain this as the mere hyperbole of adulation the word of the chief gives confidence to his troops they say we are going the chief has already seen all that will happen in his vessel such then are chiefs they use a vessel for divination2 the makers of rain are known in zululand as heavenherds or skyherds who herd the heaven that it may not break out and do its will on the property of the people these men are in fact greek text omitted cloudgatherers like the homeric zeus the lord of the heavens their name of herds of the heavens has a vedic sound the herd that herds the lightning say the zulus does the same as the herder of the cattle he does as he does by whistling he says tshuiii depart and go yonder do not come here here let it be observed that the zulus conceive of the thunderclouds and lightning as actual creatures capable of being herded like sheep there is no metaphor or allegory about the matter3 and no forgetfulness of the original meaning of words the cloudherd is just like the cowherd except that not every man but only sorcerers and they who have eaten the lightningbird a bird shot near the place where lightning has struck the earth

among the red indians no metaphor seems to be intended when it is said that it is always birds who make the wind except that of the east the dacotahs once killed a thunderbird4 behind little crows

callaway p 119   the political and social powers which come into the hands of the sorcerers are manifest even in the case of the australians tribes and individuals can attempt few enterprises without the aid of the man who listens to the ghosts only he can foretell the future and in the case of the natural death of a member of the tribe can direct the vengeance of the survivors against the hostile magician who has committed a murder by bar or magic among the zulus we have seen that sorcery gives the sanction to the power of the chief the winds and weather are at the command of bosmans great fetisher inland from the gold coast1 the king of loango according to the abbe proyart has credit to make rain fall on earth similar beliefs with like political results will be found to follow from the superstition of magic among the red indians of north america the difficulty of writing about sorcerers among the red indians is caused by the abundance of the evidence charlevoix and the other early jesuit missionaries found that the jongleurs as charlevoix calls the jossakeeds or medicinemen were their chief opponents as among the scotch highlanders the australians and the zulus the red indian jongleur is visited by the spirits he covers a hut with the skin of the animal which he commonly wears retires thither and there converses with the bodiless beings2 the good missionary like mr moffat in africa was convinced that the exercises of the jossakeeds were verily supernatural ces seducteurs ont un veritable commerce avec le pere du mensonge3 this was denied by earlier and wiser jesuit missionaries their political power was naturally great in time of war ils avancent et retardent les marches comme il leur plait in our own century it was a medicineman ten squa ta way who by his magical processes and superstitious rites stirred up a formidable war against the united states4 according to mr pond5 the native name of the dacotah medicinemen wakan signifies men supernaturally gifted medicinemen are believed to be wakanised by mystic intercourse with supernatural beings the business of the wakanised man is to discern future events to lead and direct parties on the wartrail to raise the storm or calm the tempest to converse with the lightning or thunder as with familiar friends6 the wakanised man like the australian birraark and the zulu diviner dictates chants and prayers in battle every dacotah warrior looks to the wakan man as almost his only resource belief in wakan men is mr pond says universal among the dacotahs except where christianity has undermined it their influence is deeply felt by every individual of the tribe and controls all their affairs the wakan mans functions are absorbed by the general or warchief of the tribe and in schoolcraft iv 495 captain eastman prints copies of native scrolls showing the warchief at work as a wizard the warchief who leads the party to war is always one of these medicinemen in another passage the medicinemen are described as having a voice in the sale of land it must be observed that the jossakeed or medicineman pure and simple exercises a power which is not in itself hereditary chieftainship when associated with inheritance of property is hereditary and when the chief as among the zulus absorbs supernatural power then the same man becomes diviner and chief and is a person of great and sacred influence the liveliest account of the performances of the maori tohunga or sorcerer is to be found in old new zealand7 by the pakeha maori an english gentleman who had lived with the natives like one of themselves the tohunga says this author8 presided over all those services and customs which had something approaching to a religious character they also pretended to power by means of certain familiar spirits to foretell future events and even in some cases to control them the spirit entered into them and on being questioned gave a response in a sort of half whistling halfarticulate voice supposed to be the proper language of spirits in new south wales mrs langlot parker has witnessed a similar exhibition the spirits told the truth in this case the pakeha maori was present in a darkened villagehall when the spirit of a young man a great friend of his own was called up by a tohunga suddenly without the slightest warning a voice came out of the darkness the voice all through it is to be remembered was not the voice of the tohunga but a strange melancholy sound like the sound of a wind blowing into a hollow vessel it is well with me my place is a good place the spirit gave an answer to a question which proved to be correct and then farewell cried the spirit from deep beneath the ground farewell again from high in air farewell once more came moaning through the distant darkness of the night as chiefs in new zealand no less than tohungas can exercise the mystical and magical power of tabu that is of imparting to any object or person an inviolable character and can prevent or remit the mysterious punishment for infringement of tabu it appears probable that in new zealand as well as among the zulus and red indians chiefs have a tendency to absorb the sacred character and powers of the tohungas this is natural enough for a tohunga if he plays his cards well is sure to acquire property and hereditary wealth which in combination with magical influence are the necessary qualifications for the office of the chieftain   1 pinkerton xvi 401  2 charlevoix i 105 see savage spiritualism in cock lane and common sense  3 ibid iii 362  4 catlin ii 17  5 in

on the development of mythology property and rank seem to have been essential to each other in the making of social rank and where one is absent among contemporary savages there we do not find the other as an example of this we might take the case of two peoples who like the homeric ethiopians are the outermost of men and dwell far apart at the ends of the world the eskimos and the fuegians at the extreme north and south of the american continent agree in having little or no private property and no chiefs yet magic is providing a kind of basis of rank the bleak plains of ice and rock are like attica the mother of men without master or lord among the housemates of the smaller settlements there is no headman and in the larger gatherings dr rink says that still less than among the housemates was any one belonging to such a place to be considered a chief the songs and stories of the eskimo contain the praises of men who have risen up and killed any usurper who tried to be a ruler over his placemates no one could possibly establish any authority on the basis of property because superfluous property implements etc rarely existed if there are three boats in one household one of the boats is borrowed by the community and reverts to the general fund if we look at the account of the fuegians described in admiral fitzroys cruise we find a similar absence of rank produced by similar causes the perfect equality among the individuals composing the tribes must for a long time retard their civilisation at present even a piece of cloth is torn in shreds and distributed and no one individual becomes richer than another on the other hand it is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is property of some sort by which he might manifest and still increase his authority in the same book however we get a glimpse of one means by which authority can be exercised the doctorwizard of each party has much influence over his companions among the eskimos this element in the growth of authority also exists a class of wizards called angakut have power to cause fine weather and by the gift of secondsight and magical practices can detect crimes so that they necessarily become a kind of civil magistrates these angekkok or angakut have familiar spirits called torngak a word connected with the name of their chief spiritual being torngarsak the torngak is commonly the ghost of a deceased parent of the sorcerer these men says egede are held in great honour and esteem among this stupid and ignorant nation insomuch that nobody dare ever refuse the strictest obedience when they command him in the name of torngarsak the importance and actual existence of belief in magic has thus been attested by the evidence of institutions even among australians fuegians and eskimos  it is now necessary to pass from examples of tribes who have superstitious respect for certain individuals but who have no property and no chiefs to peoples who exhibit the phenomenon of superstitious reverence attached to wealthy rulers or to judges to take the example of ireland as described in the senchus mor we learn that the chiefs just like the angakut of the eskimos had power to make fair or foul weather in the literal sense of the words1 in africa in the same way as bosman the old traveller says as to what difference there is between one negro and another the richest man is the most honoured yet the most honoured man has the same magical power as the poor angakuts of the eskimos   1 early history of institutions p 195   in the solomon islands says dr codrington there is nothing to prevent a common man from becoming a chief if he can show that he has the mana supernatural power for it1   1 journ anth inst x iii 287 300 309   though it is anticipating a later stage of this inquiry we must here observe that the sacredness and even the magical virtues of barbarous chiefs seem to have descended to the early leaders of european races the children of odin and of zeus were sacred kings the homeric chiefs like those of the zulus and the red men and of the early irish and swedes exercised an influence over the physical universe homer1 speaks of a blameless king one that fears the gods and reigns among many men and mighty and the black earth bears wheat and barley and the sheep bring forth and fail not and the sea gives store of fish and all out of his good sovereignty   1 od xix 109   the attributes usually assigned by barbarous peoples to their medicinemen have not yet been exhausted we have found that they can foresee and declare the future that they control the weather and the sensible world that they can converse with visit and employ about their own business the souls of the dead it would be easy to show at even greater length that the medicineman has everywhere the power of metamorphosis he can assume the shapes of all beasts birds fishes insects and inorganic matters and he can subdue other people to the same enchantment this belief obviously rests on the lack of recognised distinction between man and the rest of the world which we have so frequently insisted on as a characteristic of savage and barbarous thought examples of accredited metamorphosis are so common everywhere and so well known that it would be waste of space to give a long account of them in primitive culture1 a cloud of witnesses to the belief in human tigers hyaenas leopards and wolves is collected2 mr lane3 found metamorphosis by wizards as accredited a working belief at cairo as it is among abipones eskimo or the people of ashangoland in various parts of scotland there is a tale of a witch who was shot at when in the guise of a hare in this shape she was wounded and the same wound was found on her when she resumed her human appearance lafitau early in the last century found precisely the same tale except that the wizards took the form of birds not of hares among the red indians the birds were wounded by the magical arrows of an old medicineman shonnoh koui eretsi and these bolts were found in the bodies of the human culprits in japan as we learn from several stories in mr mitfords tales of old japan people chiefly metamorphose themselves into foxes and badgers the sorcerers of honduras4 possess the power of transforming men into wild beasts and were much feared accordingly among the cakchiquels a cultivated people of guatemala the very name of the clergy haleb was derived from their power of assuming animal shapes which they took on as easily as the homeric gods5 regnard the french dramatist who travelled among the lapps at the end of the seventeenth century 1681 says they believe witches can turn men into cats and again under the figures of swans crows falcons and geese they call up tempests and destroy ships6 among the bushmen sorcerers assume the forms of beasts and jackals7 dobrizhoffer 171791 a missionary in paraguay found that sorcerers arrogate to themselves the power of transforming themselves into tigers8 he was present when the abipones believed that a conversion of this sort was actually taking place alas cried the people his whole body is beginning to be covered with tigerspots his nails are growing near loanda livingstone found that a chief may metamorphose himself into a lion kill any one he choses and then resume his proper form9 among the barotse and balonda while persons are still alive they may enter into lions and alligators10 among the mayas of central america sorcerers could transform themselves into dogs pigs and other animals their glance was death to a victim11 the thlinkeets think that their shamans can metamorphose themselves into animals at pleasure and a very old raven was pointed out to mr c e s wood as an incarnation of the soul of a shaman12 sir a c lyall finds a similar belief in flourishing existence in india the european superstition of the werewolf is too well known to need description perhaps the most curious legend is that told by giraldus cambrensis about a man and his wife metamorphosed into wolves by an abbot they retained human speech made exemplary professions of christian faith and sent for priests when they found their last hours approaching in an old norman ballad a girl is transformed into a white doe and hunted and slain by her brothers hounds the aboriginal peoples of india retain similar convictions among the hos13 an old sorcerer called pusa was known to turn himself habitually into a tiger and to eat his neighbours goats and even their wives examples of the power of sorcerers to turn as with the gorgons head their enemies into stone are peculiarly common in america14 hearne found that the indians believed they descended from a dog who could turn himself into a handsome young man15   1 vol

by the lower people to medicinemen the medicineman has all miracles at his command he rules the sky he flies into the air he becomes visible or invisible at will he can take or confer any form at pleasure and resume his human shape he can control spirits can converse with the dead and can descend to their abodes  when we begin to examine the gods of mythology savage or civilised as distinct from deities contemplated in devotion as moral and creative guardians of ethics we shall find that with the general though not invariable addition of immortality they possess the very same accomplishments as the medicineman peay tohunga jossakeed birraark or whatever name for sorcerer we may choose among the greeks zeus mythically envisaged enjoys in heaven all the attributes of the medicineman among the iroquois as pere le jeune the old jesuit missionary observed1 the medicineman enjoys on earth all the attributes of zeus briefly the miraculous and supernatural endowments of the gods of myth whether these gods be zoomorphic or anthropomorphic are exactly the magical properties with which the medicineman is credited by his tribe it does not at all follow as euemerus and mr herbert spencer might argue that the god was once a real living medicineman but mythmaking man confers on the deities of myth the magical powers which he claims for himself   1 relations 1636 p 114

treesmyths of stones and of metamorphosis into stones greek australian and americanthe whole natural philosophy of savages expressed in myths and survives in folklore and classical poetry and legends of metamorphosis   the intellectual condition of savages which has been presented and established by the evidence both of observers and of institutions may now be studied in savage myths these myths indeed would of themselves demonstrate that the ideas which the lower races entertain about the world correspond with our statement if any one were to ask himself from what mental conditions do the following savage stories arise he would naturally answer that the minds which conceived the tales were curious indolent credulous of magic and witchcraft capable of drawing no line between things and persons capable of crediting all things with human passions and resolutions but as myths analogous to those of savages when found among civilised peoples have been ascribed to a psychological condition produced by a disease of language acting after civilisation had made considerable advances we cannot take the savage myths as proof of what savages think believe and practice in the course of daily life to do so would be perhaps to argue in a circle we must therefore study the myths of the undeveloped races in themselves  these myths form a composite whole so complex and so nebulous that it is hard indeed to array them in classes and categories for example if we look at myths concerning the origin of various phenomena we find that some introduce the action of gods or extranatural beings while others rest on a rude theory of capricious evolution others again invoke the aid of the magic of mortals and most regard the great natural forces the heavenly bodies and the animals as so many personal characters capable of voluntarily modifying themselves or of being modified by the most trivial accidents some sort of arrangement however must be attempted only the student is to understand that the lines are never drawn with definite fixity that any category may glide into any other category of myth  we shall begin by considering some nature mythsmyths that is to say which explain the facts of the visible universe these range from tales about heaven day night the sun and the stars to tales accounting for the red breast of the ousel the habits of the quail the spots and stripes of wild beasts the formation of rocks and stones the foliage of trees the shapes of plants in a sense these myths are the science of savages in a sense they are their sacred history in a sense they are their fiction and romance beginning with the sun we find as mr tylor says that in early philosophy throughout the world the sun and moon are alive and as it were human in their nature1 the mass of these solar myths is so enormous that only a few examples can be given chosen almost at random out of the heap the sun is regarded as a personal being capable not only of being affected by charms and incantations but of being trapped and beaten of appearing on earth of taking a wife of the daughters of men garcilasso de la vega has a story of an inca prince a speculative thinker who was puzzled by the sunworship of his ancestors if the sun be thus allpowerful the inca inquired why is he plainly subject to laws why does he go his daily round instead of wandering at large up and down the fields of heaven the prince concluded that there was a will superior to the suns will and he raised a temple to the unknown power now the phenomena which put the inca on the path of monotheistic religion a path already traditional according to garcilasso have also struck the fancy of savages why they ask does the sun run his course like a tamed beast a reply suited to a mind which holds that all things are personal is given in myths some one caught and tamed the sun by physical force or by art magic   1 primitive culture i 288   in australia the myth says that there was a time when the sun did not set it was at all times day and the blacks grew weary norralie considered and decided that the sun should disappear at intervals he addressed the sun in an incantation couched like the finnish kalewala in the metre of longfellows hiawatha and the incantation is thus interpreted sun sun burn your wood burn your internal substance and go down the sun therefore now burns out his fuel in a day and goes below for fresh firewood1   1 brough smyth aborigines of victoria i 430   in new zealand the taming of the sun is attributed to the great hero maui the prometheus of the maoris he set snares to catch the sun but in vain for the suns rays bit them through according to another account while norralie wished to hasten the suns setting maui wanted to delay it for the sun used to speed through the heavens at a racing pace maui therefore snared the sun and beat him so unmercifully that he has been lame ever since and travels slowly giving longer days the sun when beaten cried out and revealed his second great name tauramistera1 it will be remembered that indra in his abject terror when he fled after the slaying of vrittra also revealed his mystic name in north america the same story of the trapping and laming of the sun is told and attributed to a hero named tchakabetch in samoa the sun had a child by a samoan woman he trapped the sun with a rope made of a vine and extorted presents another samoan lassoed the sun and made him promise to move more slowly2 these samoan and australian fancies are nearly as dignified as the tale in the aitareya brahmana the gods afraid that the sun would fall out of heaven pulled him up and tied him with five ropes these ropes are recognised as verses in the ritual but probably the ritual is later than the ropes in mexico we find that the sun himself like the stars in most myths was once a human or prehuman devotee nanahuatzin who leapt into a fire to propitiate the gods3 translated to heaven as the sun nanahuatzin burned so very fiercely that he threatened to reduce the world to a cinder arrows were therefore shot at him and this punishment had as happy an effect as the beatings administered by maui and tchakabetch among the bushmen of south africa the sun was once a man from whose armpit a limited amount of light was radiated round his hut some children threw him up into the sky and there he stuck and there he shines4 in the homeric hymn to helios as mr max muller observes the poet looks on helios as a half god almost a hero who had once lived on earth which is precisely the view of the bushmen5 among the aztecs the sun is said to have been attacked by a hunter and grievously wounded by his arrows6 the gallinomeros in central california seem at least to know that the sun is material and impersonal they say that when all was dark in the beginning the animals were constantly jostling each other after a painful encounter the hawk and the coyote collected two balls of inflammable substance the hawk indra was occasionally a hawk flew up with them into heaven and lighted them with sparks from a flint there they gave light as sun and moon this is an exception to the general rule that the heavenly bodies are regarded as persons the melanesian tale of the bringing of night is a curious contrast to the mexican maori australian and american indian stories which we have quoted in melanesia as in australia the days were long indeed endless and people grew tired but instead of sending the sun down below by an incantation when night would follow in course of nature the melanesian hero went to night conceived of as a person and begged his assistance night qong received qat the hero kindly darkened his eyes gave him sleep and in twelve hours or so crept up from the horizon and sent the sun crawling to the west7 in the same spirit paracelsus is said to have attributed night not to the absence of the sun but to the apparition of certain stars which radiate darkness it is extraordinary that a myth like the melanesian should occur in brazil there was endless day till some one married a girl whose father the great serpent was the owner of night the father sent night bottled up in a gourd the gourd was not to be uncorked till the messengers reached the bride but they in their curiosity opened the gourd and let night out prematurely8   1 taylor new zealand p 131  2 turner samoa p

been reported deal mainly with the sun as a person who shines and at fixed intervals disappears his relations with the moon are much more complicated and are the subject of endless stories all explaining in a romantic fashion why the moon waxes and wanes whence come her spots why she is eclipsed all starting from the premise that sun and moon are persons with human parts and passions sometimes the moon is a man sometimes a woman and the sex of the sun varies according to the fancy of the narrators different tribes of the same race as among the australians have different views of the sex of moon and sun among the aborigines of victoria the moon like the sun among the bushmen was a black fellow before he went up into the sky after an unusually savage career he was killed with a stone hatchet by the wives of the eagle and now he shines in the heavens1 another myth explanatory of the moons phases was found by mr meyer in 1846 among the natives of encounter bay according to them the moon is a woman and a bad woman to boot she lives a life of dissipation among men which makes her consumptive and she wastes away till they drive her from their company while she is in retreat she lives on nourishing roots becomes quite plump resumes her gay career and again wastes away the same tribe strangely enough think that the sun also is a woman every night she descends among the dead who stand in double lines to greet her and let her pass she has a lover among the dead who has presented her with a red kangaroo skin and in this she appears at her rising such is the view of rosyfingered dawn entertained by the blacks of encounter bay in south america among the muyscas of bogota the moon huythaca is the malevolent wife of the child of the sun she was a woman before her husband banished her to the fields of space2 the moon is a man among the khasias of the himalaya and he was guilty of the unpardonable offence of admiring his motherinlaw as a general rule the motherinlaw is not even to be spoken to by the savage soninlaw the lady threw ashes in his face to discourage his passion hence the moons spots the waning of the moon suggested the most beautiful and best known of savage myths that in which the moon sends a beast to tell mortals that though they die like her like her they shall be born again3 because the spots in the moon were thought to resemble a hare they were accounted for in mexico by the hypothesis that a god smote the moon in the face with a rabbit4 in zululand and thibet by a fancied translation of a good or bad hare to the moon   1 brough smyth aborigines of victoria i 432  2 tylor primitive culture i 353  3 bleek reynard in south africa pp 6974  4 sahagun viii 2   the eskimos have a peculiar myth to account for the moons spots sun and moon were human brother and sister in the darkness the moon once attempted the virtue of the sun she smeared his face over with ashes that she might detect him when a light was brought she did discover who her assailant had been fled to the sky and became the sun the moon still pursues her and his face is still blackened with the marks of ashes1 gervaise2 says that in macassar the moon was held to be with child by the sun and that when he pursued her and wished to beat her she was delivered of the earth they are now reconciled about the alternate appearance of sun and moon a beautifully complete and adequate tale is told by the piute indians of california no more adequate and scientific explanation could possibly be offered granting the hypothesis that sun and moon are human persons and savage persons the myth is printed as it was taken down by mr de quille from the lips of tooroop eenah desert father a chief of the piutes and published in a san francisco newspaper   1 crantzs history of greenland i 212  2 royaume de macacar 1688   the sun is the father and ruler of the heavens he is the big chief the moon is his wife and the stars are their children the sun eats his children whenever he can catch them they flee before him and are all the time afraid when he is passing through the heavens when he their father appears in the morning you see all the stars his children fly out of sightgo away back into the blue of the aboveand they do not wake to be seen again until he their father is about going to his bed  down deep under the grounddeep deep under all the groundis a great hole at night when he has passed over the world looked down on everything and finished his work he the sun goes into his hole and he crawls and creeps along it till he comes to his bed in the middle part of the earth so then he the sun sleeps there in his bed all night  this hole is so little and he the sun is so big that he cannot turn round in it and so he must when he has had all his sleep pass on through and in the morning we see him come out in the east when he the sun has so come out he begins to hunt up through the sky to catch and eat any that he can of the stars his children for if he does not so catch and eat he cannot live he the sun is not all seen the shape of him is like a snake or a lizard it is not his head that we can see but his belly filled up with the stars that times and times he has swallowed  the moon is the mother of the heavens and is the wife of the sun she the moon goes into the same hole as her husband to sleep her naps but always she has great fear of the sun her husband and when he comes through the hole to the nobee tent deep in the ground to sleep she gets out and comes away if he be cross  she the moon has great love for her children the stars and is happy to travel among them in the above and they her children feel safe and sing and dance as she passes along but the mother she cannot help that some of her children must be swallowed by the father every month it is ordered that way by the pahah great spirit who lives above the place of all  every month that father the sun does swallow some of the stars his children and then that mother the moon feels sorrow she must mourn so she must put the black on her face for to mourn the dead you see the piute women put black on their faces when a child is gone but the dark will wear away from the face of that mother the moon a little and a little every day and after a time again we see all bright the face of her but soon more of her children are gone and again she must put on her face the pitch and the black  here all the phenomena are accounted for and the explanation is as advanced as the egyptian doctrine of the hole under the earth where the sun goes when he passes from our view and still the great spirit is over all religion comes athwart myth  mr tylor quotes1 a nature myth about sun moon and stars which remarkably corresponds to the speculation of the piutes the mintira of the malayan peninsula say that both sun and moon are women the stars are the moons children once the sun had as many they each agreed like the women of jerusalem in the famine to eat their own children but the sun swallowed her whole family while the moon concealed hers when the sun saw this she was exceedingly angry and pursued the moon to kill her occasionally she gets a bite out of the moon and that is an eclipse the hos of northeast india tell the same tale but say that the sun cleft the moon in twain for her treachery and that she continues to be cut in two and grow again every month with these sun and moon legends sometimes coexists the religious belief in a creator of these and of all things   1 primitive culture i 356   in harmony with the general hypothesis that all objects in nature are personal and human or bestial in real shape and in passion and habits are the myths which account for eclipses these have so frequently been published and commented on1 that a long statement would be tedious and superfluous to the savage mind and even to the chinese and the peasants of some european countries the need of an explanation is satisfied by the myth that an evil beast is devouring the sun or the moon the people even try by firing off guns shrieking and clashing cymbals to frighten the beast wolf pig dragon or what not from his prey what the hungry monster in the sky is doing when he is not biting the sun or moon we are not informed probably he herds with the big bird whose wings among the dacotahs of america and the zulus of africa make thunder or he may associate with the dragons serpents cows and other aerial cattle which supply the rain and show themselves in the waterspout chinese greenland hindoo finnish lithunian and moorish examples of the myth about the moondevouring beasts are vouched for by grimm2 a mongolian legend has it that the gods wished to punish the maleficent arakho for his misdeeds but arakho hid so cleverly that their limited omnipotence could not find him the sun when asked to turn spy gave an evasive answer the moon told the truth arakho was punished and ever since he chases sun and moon when he nearly catches either of them there is an eclipse and the people try to drive him off by making a hideous uproar with musical and other instruments3 captain beeckman in 1704 was in borneo when the

are or have been persons in the hervey isles these two luminaries are thought to have been made out of the body of a child cut in twain by his parents the blood escaped from the half which is the moon hence her pallor1 this tale is an exception to the general rule but reminds us of the many myths which represent the things in the world as having been made out of a mutilated man like the vedic purusha it is hardly necessary except by way of record to point out that the greek myths of sun and moon like the myths of savages start from the conception of the solar and lunar bodies as persons with parts and passions human loves and human sorrows as in the mongolian myth of arakho the sun sees all and hears all and less honourable than the mongolian sun he plays the spy for hephaestus on

affection by the simple rustic gift of a fleece1 the australian dawn with her present of a red kangaroo skin was not more lightly won than the chaste selene her affection for endymion is well known and her cold white glance shines through the crevices of his mountain grave hewn in a rocky wall like the tombs of phrygia2 she is the sister of the sun in hesiod the daughter by his sister of hyperion in the homeric hymns to helios   1 virgil georgics iii 391  2 preller griech myth i 163   in greece the aspects of sun and moon take the most ideal human forms and show themselves in the most gracious myths but after all these retain in their anthropomorphism the marks of the earliest fancy the fancy of eskimos and australians it seems to be commonly thought that the existence of solar myths is denied by anthropologists this is a vulgar error there is an enormous mass of solar myths but they are not caused by a disease of language andall myths are not solar  there is no occasion to dwell long on myths of the same character in which the stars are accounted for as transformed human adventurers it has often been shown that this opinion is practically of worldwide distribution1 we find it in australia persia greece among the bushmen in north and south america among the eskimos in ancient egypt in new zealand in ancient indiabriefly wherever we look the sanskrit forms of these myths have been said to arise from confusion as to the meaning of words but is it credible that in all languages however different the same kind of unconscious puns should have led to the same mistaken beliefs as the savage barbarous and greek starmyths such as that of callisto first changed into a bear and then into a constellation are familiar to most readers a few examples of sanskrit starstories are offered here from the satapatha brahmana2 fires are not according to the brahmana ritual to be lighted under the stars called krittikas the pleiades the reason is that the stars were the wives of the bears riksha for the group known in brahmanic times as the rishis sages were originally called the rikshas bears but the wives of the bears were excluded from the society of their husbands for the bears rise in the north and their wives in the east therefore the worshipper should not set up his fires under the pleiades lest he should thereby be separated from the company of his wife the brahmanas3 also tell us that prajapati had an unholy passion for his daughter who was in the form of a doe the gods made rudra fire an arrow at prajapati to punish him he was wounded and leaped into the sky where he became one constellation and his daughter another and the arrow a third group of stars in general according to the brahmanas the stars are the lights of virtuous men who go to the heavenly world4   1 custom and myth starmyths primitive culture i 288 291 j g muller amerikanischen urreligionen pp 52 53  2 sacred books of the east i 283286  3 aitareya bramana iii 33  4 satapatha brahmana vi 5 4 8 for greek examples hesiod ovid and the catasterismoi attributed to eratosthenes are useful authorities probably many of the tales in eratosthenes are late fictions consciously moulded on traditional data   passing from savage myths explanatory of the nature of celestial bodies to myths accounting for the formation and colour and habits of beasts birds and fishes we find ourselves as an old jesuit missionary says in the midst of a barbarous version of ovids metamorphoses it has been shown that the possibility of interchange of form between man and beast is part of the working belief of everyday existence among the lower peoples they regard all things as on one level or to use an old political phrase they level up everything to equality with the human status thus mr im thurn a very good observer found that to the indians of guiana all objects animate or inaminate seem exactly of the same nature except that they differ by the accident of bodily form clearly to grasp this entirely natural conception of primitive man the civilised student must make a great effort to forget for a time all that science has taught him of the differences between the objects which fill the world1 to the ear of the savage animals certainly seem to talk as far as the indians of guiana are concerned i do not believe that they distinguish such beings as sun and moon or such other natural phenomena as winds and storms from men and other animals from plants and other inanimate objects or from any other objects whatsoever bancroft says about north american myths beasts and birds and fishes fetch and carry talk and act in a way that leaves even aesops heroes quite in the shade2   1 journ anthrop inst xi 366369 a very large and rich collection of testimonies as

 the savage tendency is to see in inanimate things animals and in animals disguised men m reville quotes in his religions des peuples noncivilises i 64 the story of some negroes who the first time they were shown a cornemuse took the instrument for a beast the two holes for its eyes the highlander who looted a watch at prestonpans and observing shes teed sold it cheap when it ran down was in the same psychological condition a queer bit of savage science is displayed on a black stone tobaccopipe from the pacific coast1 the savage artist has carved the pipe in the likeness of a steamer as a steamer is conceived by him unable to account for the motive power he imagines the paddle to be linked round the tongue of a coiled serpent fastened to the tail of the vessel and so he represents it on the black stone pipe nay a savages belief that beasts are on his own level is so literal that he actually makes bloodcovenants with the lower animals as he does with men mingling his gore with theirs or smearing both together on a stone2 while to bury dead animals with sacred rites is as usual among the bedouins and malagasies today as in ancient egypt or attica in the same way the ainos of japan who regard the bear as a kinsman sacrifice a bear once a year but to propitiate the animal and his connections they appoint him a mother an aino girl who looks after his comforts and behaves in a way as maternal as possible the bear is now a kinsman greek text omitted and cannot avenge himself within the kin this at least seems to be the humour of it in lagardes reliquiae juris ecclesiastici antiquissimae a similar syrian covenant of kinship with insects is described about 700 a d when a syrian garden was infested by caterpillars the maidens were assembled and one caterpillar was caught then one of the virgins was made its mother and the creature was buried with due lamentations the mother was then brought to the spot where the pests were her companions bewailed her and the caterpillars perished like their chosen kinsman but without extorting revenge3 revenge was out of their reach they had been brought within the kin of their foes and there were no erinnyes avengers of kindred blood to help them people in this condition of belief naturally tell hundreds of tales in which men stones trees beasts shift shapes and in which the modifications of animal forms are caused by accident or by human agency or by magic or by metamorphosis such tales survive in our modern folklore to make our meaning clear we may give the european nurserymyth of the origin of the donkeys long ears and among other illustrations the australian myth of the origin of the black and white plumage of the pelican mr ralston has published the russian version of the myth of the donkeys ears the spanish form which is identical with the russian is given by fernan caballero in la gaviota   1 magazine of art january 1883  2 malagasy folktales folklore journal october 1883  3 we are indebted to professor robertson smith for this example and to miss birds journal pp 90 97 for the aino parallel   listen do you know why your ears are so big the story is told to a stupid little boy with big ears when father adam found himself in paradise with the animals he gave each its name those of thy species my child he named donkeys one day not long after he called the beasts together and asked each to tell him its name they all answered right except the animals of thy sort and they had forgotten their name then father adam was very angry and taking that forgetful donkey by the ears he pulled them out screaming you are called donkey and the donkeys ears have been long ever since this to a child is a credible explanation so perhaps is another survival of this form of sciencethe scotch explanation of the black marks on the haddock they were impressed by st peters finger and thumb when he took the piece of money for caesars tax out of the fishs mouth  turning from folklore to savage beliefs we learn that from one end of africa to another the honeybird schneter is said to be an old woman whose son was lost and who pursued him till she was turned into a bird which still shrieks his name schneter schneter1 in the same way the manners of most of the birds known to the greeks were accounted for by the myth that they had been men and women zeus for example turned ceyx and halcyon into seafowls because they were too proud in their married happiness2 to these myths of the origin of various animals we shall return but we must not forget the black and white australian pelican why is the pelican particoloured3 for this reason after the flood the origin of which is variously explained by the murri the pelican who had been a black fellow made a canoe and went about like a kind of noah trying to save the drowning in the course of his benevolent mission he fell in love with a woman but she and her friends played him a trick and escaped from him the pelican at once prepared to go on the warpath the first thing to do was to daub himself white as is the custom of the blacks before a battle they think the white pipeclay strikes terror and inspires respect among the enemy but when the pelican was only half pipeclayed another pelican came past and not knowing what such a queer black and white thing was struck the first pelican with his beak and killed him before that pelicans were all black now they are black and white that is the reason4   1 barth iii 358  2 apollodorus i 7 13 12  3 sahagun viii 2 accounts for colours of eagle and tiger a number of races explain the habits and marks of animals as the result of a curse or blessing of a god or hero the hottentots the huarochiri of peru the new zealanders shortland traditions p 57 are among the peoples which use this myth  4 brough symth aborigines of australia i 477 478   that is the reason therewith native philosopy is satisfied and does not examine in mr darwins laborious manner the slow evolution of the colour of the pelicans plumage the mythological stories about animals are rather difficult to treat because they are so much mixed up with the topic of totemism here we only examine myths which account by means of a legend for certain peculiarities in the habits cries or colours and shapes of animals the ojibbeways told kohl they had a story for every creature accounting for its ways and appearance among the greeks as among australians and bushmen we find that nearly every notable bird or beast had its tradition the nightingale and the swallow have a story of the most savage description a story reported by apollodorus though homer1 refers to another and as usual to a gentler and more refined form of the myth here is the version of apollodorus pandion an early king of athens married zeuxippe his mothers sister by whom he had two daughters procne and philomela and two sons erechtheus and butes a war broke out with labdas about some debatable land and erechtheus invited the alliance of tereus of thrace the son of ares having brought the war with the aid of tereus to a happy end he gave him his daughter procne to wife by procne tereus had a son itys and thereafter fell in love with philomela whom he seduced pretending that procne was dead whereas he had really concealed her somewhere in his lands thereon he married philomela and cut out her tongue but she wove into a robe characters that told the whole story and by means of these acquainted procne with her sufferings thereon procne found her sister and slew itys her own son whose body she cooked and served up to tereus in a banquet thereafter procne and her sister fled together and tereus seized an axe and followed after them they were overtaken at daulia in phocis and prayed to the gods that they might be turned into birds so procne became the nightingale and philomela the swallow while tereus was changed into a hoopoe2 pausanias has a different legend procne and philomela died of excessive grief   1 odyssey xix 523  2 a red indian nightingalemyth is alluded to by j g muller amerik urrel p 175 some one was turned into a nightingale by the sun and still wails for a lost lover   these ancient men and women metamorphosed into birds were honoured as ancestors by the athenians1 thus the unceasing musical wail of the nightingale and the shrill cry of the swallow were explained by a greek story the birds were lamenting their old human sorrow as the honeybird in africa still repeats the name of her lost son   1 pausanias i v pausanias thinks such things no longer occur   why does the redrobin live near the dwellings of men a bold and friendly bird the chippeway indians say he was once a young brave whose father set him a task too cruel for his strength and made him starve too long when he reached mans estate he turned into a robin and said to his father i shall always be the friend of man and keep near their dwellings i could not gratify your pride as a warrior but i will cheer you by my songs1 the converse of this legend is the greek myth of the hawk why is the hawk so hated by birds hierax was a benevolent person who succoured a race hated by poseidon the god therefore changed him into a hawk and made him as much detested by birds and as fatal to them as he had been beloved by and gentle to men2 the hervey islanders explain the peculiarities of several fishes by the share they took in the adventures of ina who stamped for example on the sole and so flattened him for ever3 in greece the dolphins were according to the homeric hymn to dionysus metamorphosed pirates who had insulted the god but because the dolphin found the hidden seagoddess whom poseidon loved the dolphin too was raised by the grateful seagod to the stars4 the vulture and the heron according to boeo said to have been a priestess in delphi and the author of a greek treatise on the traditions about birds were once a man named aigupios vulture and his mother boulis they sinned inadvertently like oedipus and jocasta wherefore boulis becoming aware of the guilt was about to put out the eyes of her son and slay herself then they were changed boulis into the heron which tears out and feeds on the eyes of snakes birds and fishes and aigupios into the vulture which bears his name this story of which the more repulsive details are suppressed is much less pleasing and more savage than the hervey islanders myth of the origin of pigs maaru was an old blind man who lived with his son kationgia there came a year of famine and kationgia had great difficulty in finding food for himself and his father he gave the blind old man puddings of banana roots and fishes while he lived himself on seaslugs and shellfish like the people of terra del fuego but blind old maaru suspected his son of giving him the worst share and keeping what was best for himself at last he discovered that kationgia was really being starved he felt his body and found that he was a mere living skeleton the two wept together and the father made a feast of some cocoanuts and breadfruit which he had reserved against the last extremity when all was finished he said he had eaten his last meal and was about to die he ordered his son to cover him with leaves and grass and return to the spot in four days if worms were crawling about he was to throw leaves and grass over them and come back four days later kationgia did as he was instructed and on his second visit to the grave found the whole mass of leaves in commotion a brood of pigs black white and speckled had sprung up from the soil famine was a thing of the past and kationgia became a great chief in the island5   1 schoolcraft ii 229 230  1 boeo quoted by antoninus liberalis  3 gill south sea myths pp 8895  4 artemidorus in his

daughter behaved rudely to our lord and was changed into the bird that looks not on the sun the greeks had a similar legend of feminine impiety by which they mythically explained the origin of the owl the bat and the eagleowl minyas of orchomenos had three daughters leucippe arsippe and alcathoe most industrious women who declined to join the wild mysteries of dionysus the god took the shape of a maiden and tried to win them to his worship they refused and he assumed the form of a bull a lion and a leopard as easily as the chiefs of the abipones become tigers or as the chiefs among the african barotse and balonda metamorphose themselves into lions and alligators1 the daughters of minyas in alarm drew lots to determine which of them should sacrifice a victim to the god leucippe drew the lot and offered up her own son they then rushed to join the sacred rites of dionysus when hermes transformed them into the bat the owl and the eagleowl and these three hide from the light of the sun2   1 livingstone missionary travels pp 615 642  2 nicander quoted by antoninus liberalis   a few examples of bushman and australian myths explanatory of the colours and habits of animals will probably suffice to establish the resemblance between savage and hellenic legends of this character the bushman myth about the origin of the eland a large antelope is not printed in full by dr bleek but he observes that it gives an account of the reasons for the colours of the gemsbok hartebeest eland quagga and springbok1 speculative bushmen seem to have been puzzled to account for the wildness of the eland it would be much more convenient if the eland were tame and could be easily captured they explain its wildness by saying that the eland was spoiled before cagn the creator or rather maker of most things had quite finished it cagns relations came and hunted the first eland too soon after which all other elands grew wild cagn then said go and hunt them and try to kill one that is now your work for it was you who spoilt them2 the bushmen have another myth explanatory of the white patches on the breasts of crows in their country some men tarried long at their hunting and their wives sent out crows in search of their husbands round each crows neck was hung a piece of fat to serve as food on the journey hence the crows have white patches on breast and neck   1 brief account of bushmen folklore p 7  2 cape monthly magazine july 1874   in australia the origins of nearly all animals appear to be explained in myths of which a fair collection is printed in mr brough symths aborigines of victoria1 still better examples occur in mrs langloh parkers australian legends why is the crane so thin once he was a man named karween the second man fashioned out of clay by pundjel a singular creative being whose chequered career is traced elsewhere in our chapter on savage myths of the origin of the world and of man karween and pundjel had a quarrel about the wives of the former whom pundjel was inclined to admire the crafty karween gave a dance jugargiull corobboree at which the creator pundjel was disporting himself gaily like the great panjandrum when karween pinned him with a spear pundjel threw another which took karween in the kneejoint so that he could not walk but soon pined away and became a mere skeleton thereupon pundjel made karween a crane and that is why the crane has such attenuated legs the kortume munkari and waingilhe now birds were once men the two latter behaved unkindly to their friend kortume who shot them out of his hut in a storm of rain singing at the same time an incantation the three then turned into birds and when the kortume sings it is a token that rain may be expected   1 vol i p 426 et seq   let us now compare with these australian myths of the origin of certain species of birds the greek story of the origin of frogs as told by menecrates and nicander1 the frogs were herdsmen metamorphosed by leto the mother of apollo but by way of showing how closely akin are the fancies of greeks and australian black fellows we shall tell the legend without the proper names which gave it a fictitious dignity   1 antoninus liberalis xxxv   the origin of frogs  a woman bore two children and sought for a waterspring wherein to bathe them she found a well but herdsmen drove her away from it that their cattle might drink then some wolves met her and led her to a river of which she drank and in its waters she bathed her children then she went back to the well where the herdsmen were now bathing and she turned them all into frogs she struck their backs and shoulders with a rough stone and drove them into the waters and ever since that day frogs live in marshes and beside rivers  a volume might be filled with such examples of the kindred fancies of greeks and savages enough has probably been said to illustrate our point which is that greek myths of this character were inherited from the period of savagery when ideas of metamorphosis and of the kinship of men and beasts were real practical beliefs events conceived to be common in real life were introduced into myths and these myths were savage science and were intended to account for the origin of species but when once this train of imagination has been fired it burns on both in literature and in the legends of the peasantry every one who writes a christmas tale for children now employs the machinery of metamorphosis and in european folklore as fontenelle remarked stories persist which are precisely similar in kind to the minor myths of savages  reasoning in this wise the mundas of bengal thus account for peculiarities of certain animals sing bonga the chief god cast certain people out of heaven they fell to earth found iron ore and began smelting it the black smoke displeased sing bonga who sent two king crows and an owl to bid people cease to pollute the atmosphere but the iron smelters spoiled these birds tails and blackened the previously white crow scorched its beak red and flattened its head sing bonga burned man and turned woman into hills and waterspouts1   1 dalton pp 186 187   examples of this class of myth in indoaryan literature are not hard to find why is dawn red why are donkeys slow why have mules no young ones mules have no foals because they were severely burned when agni fire drove them in a chariot race dawn is red not because as in australia she wears a red kangaroo cloak but because she competed in this race with red cows for her coursers donkeys are slow because they never recovered from their exertions in the same race when the asvins called on their asses and landed themselves the winners1 and cows are accommodated with horns for a reason no less probable and satisfactory2   1 aitareya brahmana ii 272 iv 9  2 iv 17   though in the legends of the less developed peoples men and women are more frequently metamorphosed into birds and beasts than into stones and plants yet such changes of form are by no means unknown to the northeast of western point there lies a range of hills inhabited according to the natives of victoria by a creature whose body is made of stone and weapons make no wound in so sturdy a constitution the blacks refuse to visit the range haunted by the mythic stone beast some black fellows were once camped at the lakes near shaving point they were cooking their fish when a native dog came up they did not give him anything to eat he became cross and said you black fellows have lots of fish but you give me none so he changed them all into a big rock this is quite true for the big rock is there to this day and i have seen it with my own eyes1 another native toolabar says that the women of the fishing party cried out yacka torn very good a dog replied yacka torn and they were all changed into rocks this very man toolabar once heard a dog begin to talk whereupon he and his father fled had they waited they would have become stones we should

example of metamorphosis three stones among the aricaras were a girl her lover and her dog who fled from home because the course of true love did not run smooth and who were petrified certain stones near chinook point were seagiants who swallowed a man his brother by aid of fire dried up the bay and released the man still alive from the body of the giant then the giants were turned into rocks1 the rising sun in popol vuh if the evidence of popol vuh the quichua sacred book is to be accepted changed into stone the lion serpent and tiger gods the standing rock on the upper missouri is adored by the indians and decorated with coloured ribbons and skins of animals this stone was a woman who like niobe became literally petrified with grief when her husband took a second wife another stonewoman in a cave on the banks of the kickapoo was wont to kill people who came near her and is even now approached with great respect the oneidas and dacotahs claim descent from stones to which they ascribe animation2 montesinos speaks of a sacred stone which was removed from a mountain by one of the incas a parrot flew out of it and lodged in another stone which the natives still worship3 the breton myth about one of the great stone circles the stones were peasants who danced on a sunday is a wellknown example of this kind of myth surviving in folklore there is a kind of stone actaeon4 near little muniton creek resembling the bust of a man whose head is decorated with the horns of a stag5 a crowd of myths of metamorphosis into stone will be found among the iroquois legends in report of bureau of ethnology 188081 if men may become stones on the other hand in samoa as in the greek myth of deucalion stones may become men6 gods too especially when these gods happen to be cuttlefish

the greeks retained this with all the other vagaries of early fancy every one remembers the use which perseus made of the gorgons head and the stones on the coast of seriphus which like the stones near western point in victoria had once been men the enemies of the hero also he slew the gorgon sings pindar and bare home her head with serpent tresses decked to the island folk a stony death observe pindars explanatory remark i ween there is no marvel impossible if gods have wrought thereto in the same pious spirit a turk in an isle of the levant once told mr newton a story of how a man hunted a stag and the stag spoke to him the stag spoke said mr newton yes by allahs will replied the turk like pindar he was repeating an incident quite natural to the minds of australians or bushmen or samoans or red men but like the religious pindar he felt that the affair was rather marvellous and accounted for it by the exercise of omnipotent power1 the greek example of niobe and her children may best be quoted in mr bridges translation from the iliad        and somewhere now among lone mountain rocks      on sipylus where couch the nymphs at night      who dance all day by achelous stream      the once proud mother lies herself a rook      and in cold breast broods oer the goddess wrong                          prometheus the firebringer2   in the iliad it is added that cronion made the people into stones the attitude of the later greek mind towards these myths may be observed in a fragment of philemon the comic poet never by the gods have i believed nor will believe that niobe the stone was once a woman nay by reason of her calamities she became speechless and so from her silence was called a stone3   1 pindar pyth x myerss translation  2 xxiv 611  3 the scholiast on iliad xxiv 6 7   there is another famous petrification in the iliad when the prodigy of the snake and the sparrows had appeared to the assembled achaeans at aulis zeus displayed a great marvel and changed into a stone the serpent which swallowed the young of the sparrow changes into stone though less common than changes into fishes birds and beasts were thus obviously not too strange for the credulity of greek mythology which could also believe that a stone became the mother of agdestis by zeus  as to interchange of shape between men and women and plants our information so far as the lower races are concerned is less copious it has already been shown that the totems of many stocks in all parts of the world are plants and this belief in connection with a plant by itself demonstrates that the confused belief in all things being on one level has thus introduced vegetables into the dominion of myth as far as possessing souls is concerned mr tylor has proved that plants are as well equipped as men or beasts or minerals1 in india the doctrine of transmigration widely and clearly recognises the idea of trees or smaller plants being animated by human souls in the wellknown ancient egyptian story of the two brothers2 the life of the younger is practically merged in that of the acacia tree where he has hidden his heart and when he becomes a bull and is sacrificed his spiritual part passes into a pair of persea trees the yarucaris of bolivia say that a girl once bewailed in the forest her loverless estate she happened to notice a beautiful tree which she adorned with ornaments as well as she might the tree assumed the shape of a handsome young man        she did not find him so remiss      but lightly issuing through      he did repay her kiss for kiss      with usury thereto3   j g muller who quotes this tale from andree says it has many analogies with the tales of metamorphosis of human beings into trees among the ancients as reported by ovid the worship of plants and trees is a wellknown feature in religion and probably implies at least in many cases a recognition of personality in samoa metamorphosis into vegetables is not uncommon for example the king of fiji was a cannibal and very naturally the people were melting away under him the brothers toa and pale wishing to escape the royal oven adopted various changes of shape they knew that straight timber was being sought for to make a canoe for the king so pale when he assumed a vegetable form became a crooked stick overgrown with creepers but toa preferred standing erect as a handsome straight tree poor toa was therefore cut down by the kings shipwrights though thanks to his brothers magic wiles they did not make a canoe out of him after all4 in samoa the trees are so far human that they not only go to war with each other but actually embark in canoes to seek out distant enemies5 the ottawa indians account for the origin of maize by a myth in which a wizard fought with and conquered a little man who had a little crown of feathers from his ashes arose the maize with its crown of leaves and heavy ears of corn6   1 primitive culture i 145 examples of society islanders dyaks karens buddhists  2

transformation scenes in which the persons shift shapes with the alacrity of medicinemen ina used to bathe in a pool where an eel became quite familiar with her at last the fish took courage and made his declaration he was tuna the chief of all eels be mine he cried and ina was his for some mystical reason he was obliged to leave her but like the white cat in the fairy tale he requested her to cut off his eels head and bury it regretfully but firmly did ina comply with his request and from the buried eels head sprang two cocoa trees one from each half of the brain of tuna as a proof of this be it remarked that when the nut is husked we always find on it the two eyes and mouth of the lover of ina1 all over the world from ancient egypt to the wigwams of the algonkins plants and other matters are said to have sprung from a dismembered god or hero while men are said to have sprung from plants2 we may therefore perhaps look on it as a proved point that the general savage habit of levelling up prevails even in their view of the vegetable world and has left traces as we have seen in their myths   1 gill myths and songs p 79  2 myths of the beginning of things   turning now to the mythology of greece we see that the same rule holds good metamorphosis into plants and flowers is extremely common the instances of daphne myrrha hyacinth narcissus and the sisters of phaethon at once occur to the memory  most of those myths in which everything in nature becomes personal and human while all persons may become anything in nature we explain then as survivals or imitations of tales conceived when men were in the savage intellectual condition in that stage as we demonstrated no line is drawn between things animate and inanimate dumb or articulate speaking organic or inorganic personal or impersonal such a mental stage again is reflected in the naturemyths many of which are merely aetiologicalassign a cause that is for phenomena and satisfy an indolent and credulous curiosity  we may be asked again but how did this intellectual condition come to exist to answer that is no part of our business for us it is enough to trace myth or a certain element in myth to a demonstrable and actual stage of thought but this stage which is constantly found to survive in the minds of children is thus explained or described by hume in his essay on natural religion there is an universal tendency in mankind to conceive all beings like themselves and to transfer to every object those qualities of which they are intimately conscious1 now they believe themselves to be conscious of magical and supernatural powers which they do not of course possess these powers of effecting metamorphosis of shapeshifting of flying of becoming invisible at will of conversing with the dead of miraculously healing the sick savages pass on to their gods as will be shown in a later chapter and the gods of myth survive and retain the miraculous gifts after their worshippers become more reasonable have quite forgotten that they themselves once claimed similar endowments so far then it has been shown that savage fancy wherever studied is wild that savage curiosity is keen that savage credulity is practically boundless these considerations explain the existence of savage myths of sun stars beasts plants and stones similar myths fill greek legend and the sanskrit brahmanes we conclude that in greek and sanskrit the myths are relics whether borrowed or inherited of the savage mental status   1 see appendix b    chapter vi nonaryan myths of the origin of the world and of man

islanders maoris aztecs peruvianssimilarity of ideas pervading all those peoples in various conditions of society and culture   the difficulties of classification which beset the study of mythology have already been described nowhere are they more perplexing than when we try to classify what may be styled cosmogonic myths the very word cosmogonic implies the preexistence of the idea of a cosmos an orderly universe and this was exactly the last idea that could enter the mind of the mythmakers there is no such thing as orderliness in their mythical conceptions and no such thing as an universe the natural question who made the world or how did the things in the world come to be is the question which is answered by cosmogonic myths but it is answered piecemeal to a christian child the reply is given god made all things we have known this reply discussed by some little girls of six a scotch ministers daughters and naturally metaphysical one of whom solved all difficulties by the impromptu myth god first made a little place to stand on and then he made the rest but savages and the mythmakers whose stories survive into the civilised religions could adhere firmly to no such account as this here occurs in the first edition of this book the following passage they savages have not and had not the conception of god as we understand what we mean by the word they have and had at most only the smallchange of the idea godhere the belief in a moral being who watches conduct here again the hypothesis of a prehuman race of magnified nonnatural medicinemen or of extranatural beings with human and magical attributes but often wearing the fur and fins and feathers of the lower animals mingled with these faiths whether earlier later or coeval in origin with these are the dread and love of ancestral ghosts often transmuting themselves into worship of an imaginary and ideal first parent of the tribe who once more is often a beast or a bird here is nothing like the notion of an omnipotent invisible spiritual being the creator of our religion here is only la monnaie of the conception  it ought to have occurred to the author that he was here traversing the main theory of his own book which is that religion is one thing myth quite another thing that many low races of savages entertain in hours of religious thought an elevated conception of a moral and undying maker of things and master of life a father in heaven has already been stated and knowledge of the facts has been considerably increased since this work first appeared 1887 but the mythical conceptions described in the last paragraph coexist with the religious conception in the faiths of very low savages such as the australians and andamanese just as the same contradictory coexistence is notorious in ancient greece india egypt and anahuac in a sense certain low savages have the conception of god as we understand what we mean by the word but that sense when savages come to spinning fables about origins is apt to be overlaid and perplexed by the frivolity of their mythical fancy  with such shifting grotesque and inadequate fables the cosmogonic myths of the world are necessarily bewildered and perplexed we have already seen in the chapter on nature myths that many things sun moon the stars that have another birth and various animals and plants are accounted for on the hypothesis that they are later than the appearance of manthat they originally were men to the european mind it seems natural to rank myths of the gods before myths of the making or the evolution of the world because our religion like that of the more philosophic greeks makes the deity the fount of all existences causa causans what unmoved moves the beginning and the end but the mythmakers deserting any such ideas they may possess find it necessary like the child of whom we spoke to postulate a place for the divine energy to work from and that place is the earth or the heavens then again heaven and earth are themselves often regarded in the usual mythical way as animated as persons with parts and passions and finally among advancing races as gods into this medley of incongruous and inconsistent conceptions we must introduce what order we may always remembering that the order is not native to the subject but is brought in for the purpose of study  the origin of the world and of man is naturally a problem which has excited the curiosity of the least developed minds every savage race has its own myths on this subject most of them bearing the marks of the childish and crude imagination whose character we have investigated and all varying in amount of what may be called philosophical thought  all the cosmogonic myths as distinct from religious belief in a creator waver between the theory of construction or rather of reconstruction and the theory of evolution very rudely conceived the earth as a rule is mythically averred to have grown out of some original matter perhaps an animal perhaps an egg which floated on the waters perhaps a handful of mud from below the waters but this conception does not exclude the idea that many of the things in the world minerals plants and what not are fragments of the frame of a semisupernatural and gigantic being human or bestial belonging to a race which preceded the advent of man1 such were the titans demigods nurrumbunguttias in australia various members of this race are found active in myths of the creation or rather the construction of man and of the world among the lowest races it is to be noted that mythical animals of supernatural power often take the place of beings like the finnish wainamoinen the greek prometheus the zulu unkulunkulu the red indian manabozho himself usually a great hare   1 macrobius saturnal i xx   the ages before the development or creation of man are filled up in the myths with the loves and wars of supernatural people the appearance of man is explained in three or four contradictory ways each of which is represented in the various myths of most mythologies often man is fashioned out of clay or stone or other materials by a maker of all things sometimes halfhuman or bestial but also halfdivine sometimes the first man rises out of the earth and is himself confused with the creator a theory perhaps illustrated by the zulu myth of unkulunkulu the old old one sometimes man arrives ready made with most of the animals from his former home in a hole in the ground and he furnishes the world for himself with stars sun moon and everything else he needs again there are many myths which declare that man was evolved out of one or other of the lower animals this myth is usually employed by tribesmen to explain the origin of their own peculiar stock of kindred once more man is taken to be the fruit of some tree or plant or not to have emerged readymade but to have grown out of the ground like a plant or a tree in some countries as among the bechuanas the boeotians and the peruvians the spot where men first came out on earth is known to be some neighbouring marsh or cave lastly man is occasionally represented as having been framed out of a piece of the body of the creator or made by some demiurgic potter out of clay all these legends are told by savages with no sense of their inconsistency there is no single orthodoxy on the matter and we shall see that all these theories coexist pellmell among the mythological traditions of civilised races in almost every mythology too the whole theory of the origin of man is crossed by the tradition of a deluge or some other great destruction followed by revival or reconstruction of the species a tale by no means necessarily of biblical origin  in examining savage myths of the origin of man and of the world we shall begin by considering those current among the most backward peoples where no hereditary or endowed priesthood has elaborated and improved the popular beliefs the natives of australia furnish us with myths of a purely popular type the property not of professional priests and poets but of all the old men and fullgrown warriors of the country here as everywhere else the student must be on his guard against accepting myths which are disguised forms of missionary teaching1   1 taplin the narrinyeri he must also beware of supposing that the australians believe in a creator in our sense because the narrinyeri for example say that nurundere made everything nurundere is but an idealised wizard and hunter with a rival of his species this occurs in the first edition but making all things is one idea wizardry is another   in southern australia we learn that the boonoorong an australian coast tribe ascribe the creation of things to a being named bunjel or pundjel he figures as the chief of an earlier supernatural class of existence with human relationships thus he has a wife whose face he has never seen brothers a son and so on now this name bunjel means eaglehawk and the eaglehawk is a totem among certain stocks thus when we hear that eaglehawk is the maker of men and things we are reminded of the bushman creator cagn who now receives prayers of considerable beauty and pathos but who is in some theories identified with kaggen the mantis insect a creative grasshopper and the chief figure in bushman mythology1 bunjel or pundjel also figures in australian belief neither as the creator nor as the eaglehawk but as an old man who lives at the sources of the yarra river where he possesses great multitudes of cattle2 the term bunjel is also used much like our mr to denote the older men of the kurnai and briakolung some of whom have magical powers one of them krawra or west wind can cause the wind to blow so violently as to prevent the natives from climbing trees this man has semidivine attributes from these facts it appears that this australian creator in myth partakes of the character of the totem or worshipful beast and of that of the wizard or medicineman he carried a large knife and when he made the earth he went up and down slicing it into creeks and valleys the aborigines of the northern parts of victoria seem to believe in pundjel in what may perhaps be his most primitive mythical shape that of an eagle3 this eagle and a crow created everything and separated the murray blacks into their two main divisions which derive their names from the crow and the eagle the melbourne blacks seem to make pundjel more anthropomorphic men are his greek text omitted figures kneaded of clay as aristophanes says in the birds pundjel made two clay images of men and danced round them he made their hairone had straight one curly hairof bark he danced round them he lay on them and breathed his breath into their mouths noses and navels and danced round them then they arose fullgrown young men some blacks seeing a brickmaker at work on a bridge over the yarra exclaimed like em that pundjel make em koolin but other blacks prefer to believe that as pindar puts the phrygian legend the sun saw men growing like trees   1 bleek brief account of bushman mythology p 6 cape monthly magazine july 1874 pp 113 kamilaroi and

then entered into a young woman though he was the first man and was born1 the encounter bay people have another myth which might have been attributed by dean swift to the yahoos so foul an origin does it allot to mankind   1 meyer aborigines of encounter bay see later gods of the lowest races   australian myths of creation are by no means exclusive of a hypothesis of evolution thus the dieyrie whose notions mr gason has recorded hold a very mixed view they aver that the good spirit mooramoora made a number of small black lizards liked them and promised them dominion he divided their feet into toes and fingers gave them noses and lips and set them upright down they fell and mooramoora cut off their tails then they walked erect and were men1 the conclusion of the adventures of one australian creator is melancholy he has ceased to dwell among mortals whom he watches and inspires the jay possessed many bags full of wind he opened them and pundjel was carried up by the blast into the heavens but this event did not occur before pundjel had taught men and women the essential arts of life he had shown the former how to spear kangaroos he still exists and inspires poets from the cosmogonic myths of australia the character of some of which is in contradiction with the higher religious belief of the people to be later described we may turn without reaching a race of much higher civilisation to the dwellers in the andaman islands and their opinions about the origin of things   1 gasons dieyries ap native tribes of south australia p 20   the andaman islands in the bay of bengal are remote from any shores and are protected from foreign influences by dangerous coral reefs and by the reputed ferocity and cannibalism of the natives these are negritos and are commonly spoken of as most abject savages they are not however without distinctions of rank they are clean modest moral after marriage and most strict in the observance of prohibited degrees unlike the australians they use bows and arrows but are said to be incapable of striking a light and at all events find the process so difficult that like the australians and the farmer in the odyssey1 they are compelled to hoard the seeds of fire their mythology contains explanations of the origin of men and animals and of their own customs and language   1 odyssey v 490   the andamanese long spoken of as godless owe much to mr man an english official who has made a most careful study of their beliefs1 so extraordinary is the contradiction between the relative purity and morality of the religion and the savagery of the myths of the andamanese that in the first edition of this work i insisted that the spiritual god of the faith must have been borrowed from the same quarter as the stone house in which he is mythically said to live but later and wider study and fresh information from various quarters have convinced me that the relative purity of andamanese religion with its ethical sanction of conduct may well be and probably is a natural unborrowed development it is easy for myth to borrow the notion of a stone house from our recent settlement at port blair but it would not be easy for religion to borrow many new ideas from an alien creed in a very few years while the noted ferocity of the islanders towards strangers and the inaccessibility of their abode makes earlier borrowing on a large scale at least highly improbable the andamanese god puluga is like fire but invisible unborn and immortal knowing and punishing or rewarding mens deeds even the thoughts of their hearts but when once mythical fancy plays round him and stories are told about him he is credited with a wife who is an eel or a shrimp just as zeus made love as an ant or a cuckoo puluga was the maker of men no particular myth as to how he made them is given they tried to kill him after the deluge of which a grotesque myth is told but he replied that he was as hard as wood his legend is in the usual mythical contradiction with the higher elements in his religion   1 journ anthrop soc vol xii p 157 et seq   leaving the andaman islanders but still studying races in the lowest degree of civilisation we come to the bushmen of south africa this very curious and interesting people far inferior in material equipment to the hottentots is sometimes regarded as a branch of that race1 the hottentots call themselves khoikhoi the bushmen they style sa the poor sa lead the life of pariahs and are hated and chased by all other natives of south africa they are hunters and diggers for roots while the hottentots perhaps their kinsmen are cattlebreeders2 being so illnourished the bushmen are very small but sturdy they dwell in or rather wander through countries which have been touched by some ancient civilisation as is proved by the mysterious mines and roads of mashonaland it is singular that the bushmen possess a tradition according to which they could once make stone things that flew over rivers they have remarkable artistic powers and their drawings of men and animals on the walls of caves are often not inferior to the designs on early greek vases3   1 see divine myths of the lower races  2 hahu tsuni goam p 4 see other accounts in waitz anthropologie ii 328  3 custom and myth where illustrations of bushman art are given pp 290295   thus we must regard the bushmen as possibly degenerated from a higher status though there is nothing except perhaps the tradition about bridgemaking to show that it was more exalted than that of their more prosperous neighbours the hottentots the myths of the bushmen however are almost on the lowest known level a very good and authentic example of bushman cosmogonic myth was given to mr orpen chief magistrate of st johns territory by qing king nqushas huntsman qing had never seen a white man but in fighting till he became acquainted with mr orpen1 the chief force in bushmen myth is by dr bleek identified with the mantis a sort of large grasshopper though he seems at least as chimerical a beast as the aryan creative boar the mighty big hare of the algonkins the large spider who made the world in the opinion of the gold coast people or the eagle of the australians yet the insect if insect he be like the others has achieved moral qualities and is addressed in prayer in his religious aspect he is nothing less than a grasshopper he is called cagn cagn made all things and we pray to him said qing coti is the wife of cagn qing did not know where they came from perhaps with the men who brought the sun the fact is qing did not dance that dance that is was not one of the bushmen initiated into the more esoteric mysteries of cagn till we too are initiated we can know very little of cagn in his religious aspect among the bushmen as among the greeks there is no religious mystery without dancing qing was not very consistent he said cagn gave orders and caused all things to appear and to be made sun moon stars wind mountains animals and this of course is a lofty theory of creation elsewhere myth avers that cagn did not so much create as manufacture the objects in nature in his early day the snakes were also men cagn struck snakes with his staff and turned them into men as zeus in the aeginetan myth did with ants he also turned offending men into baboons in bushman myth little as we really know of it we see the usual opposition of fable and faith a kind creator in religion is apparently a magician in myth   1 cape monthly magazine july 1874   neighbours of the bushmen but more fortunate in their wealth of sheep and cattle are the ovaherero the myths of the ovaherero a tribe dwelling in a part of hereraland which had not yet been under the influence of civilisation and christianity have been studied by the rev h reiderbecke missionary at otyozondyupa the ovaherero he says have a kind of tree ygdrasil a tree out of which men are born and this plays a great part in their myth of creation the tree which still exists though at a great age is called the omumborombonga tree out of it came in the beginning the first man and woman oxen stepped forth from it too but baboons as caliban says of the stars came otherwise and sheep and goats sprang from a flat rock black people are so coloured according to the ovaherero because when the first parents emerged from the tree and slew an ox the ancestress of the blacks appropriated the black liver of the victim the ovakuru meyuru or old ones in heaven once let the skies down with a run but drew them up again as the gods of the satapatha brahmana drew the sun when most of mankind had been drowned1 the remnant pacified the old ones as odysseus did the spirits of the dead by the sacrifice of a black ewe a practice still used to appease ghosts by the ovaherero the neighbouring omnambo ascribe the creation of man to kalunga who came out of the earth and made the first three sheep2   1 an example of a deluge myth in africa where m lenormant found none  2 south african folklore journal ii pt v p 95   among the namaquas an african people on the same level of nomadic culture as the ovaherero a divine or heroic early being called heitsi eibib had a good deal to do with the origin of things if he did not exactly make the animals he impressed on them their characters and their habits like those of the serpent in genesis are said to have been conferred by a curse the curse of heitsi eibib a precisely similar notion was found by avila among the indians of huarochiri whose divine culturehero imposed by a curse or a blessing their character and habits on the beasts1 the lion used to live in a nest up a tree till heitsi eibib cursed him and bade him walk on the ground he also cursed the hare and the hare ran away and is still running2 the name of the first man is given as eichaknanabiseb with a multitude of clicks and he is said to have met all the animals on a flat rock and played a game with them for copper beads

their relative degrees of culture are physically somewhat contemptible we reach their northern neighbours the zulus they are among the finest and certainly among the least religious of the undeveloped peoples their faith is mainly in magic and ghosts but there are traces of a fading and loftier belief  the social and political condition of the zulu is well understood they are a pastoral but not a nomadic people possessing large kraals or towns they practise agriculture and they had till quite recently a centralised government and a large army somewhat on the german system they appear to have no regular class of priests and supernatural power is owned by the chiefs and the king and by diviners and sorcerers who conduct the sacrifices their myths are the more interesting because whether from their natural scepticism which confuted bishop colenso in his orthodox days or from acquaintance with european ideas they have begun to doubt the truth of their own traditions1 the zulu theory of the origin of man and of the world commences with the feats of unkulunkulu the old old one who in some legends was the first man and broke off in the beginning like manabozho among the indians of north america and like wainamoinen among the finns unkulunkulu imparted to men a knowledge of the arts of marriage and so forth his exploits in this direction however must be considered in another part of this work men in general came out of a bed of reeds2 but there is much confusion about this bed of reeds named uthlanga the younger people ask where the bed of reeds was the old men do not know and neither did their fathers know but they stick to it that that bed of reeds still exists educated zulus appear somewhat inclined to take the expression in an allegorical sense and to understand the reeds either as a kind of protoplasm or as a creator who was mortal he exists no longer as my grandfather no longer exists he too no longer exists he died chiefs who wish to claim high descent trace their pedigree to uthlanga as the homeric kings traced theirs to zeus the myths given by dr callaway are very contradictory   1 these legends have been carefully collected and published by bishop callaway trubner  co 1868  2 callaway p 9   in addition to the legend that men came out of a bed of reeds other and perhaps even more puerile stories are current some men say that they were belched up by a cow others that unkulunkulu split them out of a stone1 which recalls the legend of pyrrha and deucalion the myth about the cow is still applied to great chiefs he was not born he was belched up by a cow the myth of the stone origin corresponds to the homeric saying about men born from the stone or the oak of the old tale2   1 without anticipating a later chapter the resemblances of these to greek myths as arrayed by m bouche leclercq de origine generis humani is very striking  2 odyssey xix 103   in addition to the theory of the natal bed of reeds the zulus like the navajoes of new mexico and the bushmen believe in the subterranean origin of man there was a succession of emigrations from below of different tribes of men each having its own unkulunkulu all accounts agree that unkulunkulu is not worshipped and he does not seem to be identified with the lord who plays in heavena kind of fading zeuswhen there is thunder unkulunkulu is not worshipped though ancestral spirits are worshipped because he lived so long ago that no one can now trace his pedigree to the being who is at once the first man and the creator his honourgiving name is lost in the lapse of years and the family rites have become obsolete1   1 see zulu religion in the making of religion pp 225229 where it is argued that ghost worship has superseded a higher faith of which traces are discernible   the native races of the north american continent concerning whose civilisation more will be said in the account of their divine myths occupy every stage of culture from the truly bestial condition in which some of the digger indians at present exist living on insects and unacquainted even with the use of the bow to the civilisation which the spaniards destroyed among the aztecs  the original facts about religion in america are much disputed and will be more appropriately treated later it is now very usual for anthropologists to say like mr dorman no approach to monotheismn had been made before the discovery of america by europeans and the great spirit mentioned in these their books is an introduction by christianity1 this view will not bear examination says mr tylor and we shall later demonstrate the accuracy of his remark2 but at present we are concerned not with what indian religion had to say about her gods but with what indian myth had to tell about the beginnings of things   1 origin of primitive superstitions p 15  2 primitive culture 1873 ii p 340   the hurons for example to choose a people in a state of middle barbarism start in myth from the usual conception of a powerful nonnatural race of men dwelling in the heavens whence they descended and colonised not to say constructed the earth in the relation de la nouvelle france written by pere paul le jeune of the company of jesus in 1636 there is a very full account of huron opinion which with some changes of names exists among the other branches of the algonkin family of indians  they recognise as the founder of their kindred a woman named ataentsic who like hephaestus in the iliad was banished from the sky in the upper world there are woods and plains as on earth ataentsic fell down a hole when she was hunting a bear or she cut down a heaventree and fell with the fall of this huron ygdrasil or she was seduced by an adventurer from the under world and was tossed out of heaven for her fault however it chanced she dropped on the back of the turtle in the midst of the waters he consulted the other aquatic animals and one of them generally said to have been the muskrat fished1 up some soil and fashioned the earth2 here ataentsic gave birth to twins ioskeha and tawiscara these represent the usual dualism of myth they answer to osiris and set to ormuzd and ahriman and were bitter enemies according to one form of the myth the woman of the sky had twins and what occurred may be quoted from dr brinton even before birth one of them betrayed his restless and evil nature by refusing to be born in the usual manner but insisting on breaking through his parents side or armpit he did so but it cost his mother her life her body was buried and from it sprang the various vegetable productions pumpkins maize beans and so forth3   1 relations 1633 in this myth one messon the great hare is the beginner of our race he married a daughter of the muskrat  2 here we first meet in this

according to another version of the origin of things the maker of them was one michabous or michabo the great hare his birthplace was shown at an island called michilimakinak like the birthplace of apollo at delos the great hare made the earth and as will afterwards appear was the inventor of the arts of life on the whole the iroquois and algonkin myths agree in finding the origin of life in an upper world beyond the sky the earth was either fished up as by brahma when he dived in the shape of a boar by some beast which descended to the bottom of the waters or grew out of the tortoise on whose back ataentsic fell the first dwellers in the world were either beasts like manabozho or michabo the great hare or the primeval wolves of the uinkarets1 or the creative muskrat or were more anthropomorphic heroes such as ioskeha and tawiscara as for the things in the world some were made some evolved some are transformed parts of an early nonnatural man or animal there is a tendency to

have the following myth of the origin of species in this legend it will be noticed a species of evolution takes the place of a theory of creation the story was told to mr adam johnston who drew the narrator by communicating to a chief the biblical narrative of the creation1 the chief said it was a strange story and one that he had never heard when he lived at the mission of st john under the care of a padre according to this chief he ruled over the potoyante tribe or coyotes the first indians were coyotes when one of their number died his body became full of little animals or spirits they took various shapes as of deer antelopes and so forth but as some exhibited a tendency to fly off to the moon the potoyantes now usually bury the bodies of their dead to prevent the extinction of species then the indians began to assume the shape of man but it was a slow transformation at first they walked on all fours then they would begin to develop an isolated human feature one finger one toe one eye like the ascidian our first parent in the view of modern science then they doubled their organs got into the habit of sitting up and wore away their tails which they unaffectedly regret as they consider the tail quite an ornament ideas of the immortality of the soul are said to be confined to the old women of the tribe and in short according to this version the digger indians occupy the modern scientific position   1 schoolcraft vol v   the winnebagoes who communicated their myths to mr fletcher1 are suspected of having been influenced by the biblical narrative they say that the great spirit woke up as from a dream and found himself sitting in a chair as he was all alone he took a piece of his body and a piece of earth and made a man he next made a woman steadied the earth by placing beasts beneath it at the corners and created plants and animals other men he made out of bears he created the white man to make tools for the poor indiansa very pleasing example of a teleological hypothesis and of the doctrine of final causes as understood by the winnebagoes the chaldean myth of the making of man is recalled by the legend that the great spirit cut out a piece of himself for the purpose the chaldean wisdom coincides too with the philosophical acumen of the potoyante or coyote tribe of digger indians though the chaldean theory is only connected with that of the red men by its savagery we may briefly state it in this place   1 ibid iv 228   according to berosus as reported by alexander polyhistor the universe was originally as before manabozhos time water and mud herein all manner of mixed monsters with human heads goats horns four legs and tails bred confusedly in place of the iroquois ataentsic a woman called omoroca presided over the mud and the menagerie she too like ataentsic is sometimes recognised as the moon affairs being in this state belmaruduk arrived and cut omoroca in two chokanipok destroyed ataentsic and out of omoroca bel made the world and the things in it we have already seen that in savage myth many things are fashioned out of a dead member of the extranatural race lastly bel cut his own head off and with the blood the gods mixed clay and made men the chaldeans inherited very savage fancies1   1 cf syncellus p 29 euseb chronic armen ed mai p 10 lenormant origines de lhistoire i 506   one ought perhaps to apologise to the chaldeans for inserting their myths among the fables of the least cultivated peoples but it will scarcely be maintained that the oriental myths differ in character from the digger indian and iroquois explanations of the origin of things the ahts of vancouver island whom mr sproat knew intimately and of whose ideas he gives a cautious account for he was well aware of the limits of his knowledge tell a story of the usual character1 they believe in a member of the extranatural race named quawteaht of whom we shall hear more in his heroic character as a demiurge he is undoubtedly represented as the general framer i do not say creator of all things though some special things are excepted he made the earth and water the trees and rocks and all the animals some say that quawteaht made the sun and moon but the majority of the indians believe that he had nothing to do with their formation and that they are deities superior to himself though now distant and less active he gave names to everything among the rest to all the indian houses which then existed although inhabited only by birds and animals quawteaht went away before the apparent change of the birds and beasts into indians which took place in the following manner  the birds and beasts of old had the spirits of the indians dwelling in them and occupied the various coast villages as the ahts do at present one day a canoe manned by two indians from an unknown country approached the shore as they coasted along at each house at which they landed the deer bear elk and other brute inhabitants fled to the mountains and the geese and other birds flew to the woods and rivers but in this flight the indians who had hitherto been contained in the bodies of the various creatures were left behind and from that time they took possession of the deserted dwellings and assumed the condition in which we now see them   1 sproat scenes and studies of savage life pp 210 211   crossing the northern continent of america to the west we are in the domains of various animal cultureheroes ancestors and teachers of the human race and the makers to some extent of the things in the world as the eastern tribes have their great hare so the western tribes have their wolf hero and progenitor or their coyote or their raven or their dog it is possible and even certain in some cases that the animal which was the dominant totem of a race became heir to any cosmogonic legends that were floating about  the country of the papagos on the eastern side of the gulf of california is the southern boundary of the province of the coyote or prairie wolf the realm of his influence as a kind of prometheus or even as a demiurge extends very far northwards in the myth related by con quien the chief of the central papagos1 the coyote acts the part of the fish in the sanskrit legend of the flood while montezuma undertakes the role of manu this montezuma was formed like the adams of so many races out of potters clay in the hands of the great spirit in all this legend it seems plain enough that the name of montezuma is imported from mexico and has been arbitrarily given to the hero of the papagos according to mr powers whose manuscript notes mr bancroft quotes iii 87 all the natives of california believe that their first ancestors were created directly from the earth of their present dwellingplaces and in very many cases these ancestors were coyotes   1 davidson indian affairs report 1865 p 131 bancroft iii 75   the pimas a race who live near the papagos on the eastern coast of the gulf of california say that the earth was made by a being named earthprophet at first it appeared like a spiders web reminding one of the west african legend that a great spider created the world man was made by the earthprophet out of clay kneaded with sweat a mysterious eagle and a deluge play a great part in the later mythical adventures of war and the world as known to the pimas1   1 communicated to mr bancroft by mr stout of the pima agency   in oregon the coyote appears as a somewhat tentative demiurge and the men of his creation like the beings first formed by prajapati in the sanskrit myth needed to be reviewed corrected and considerably augmented the chinooks of oregon believe in the usual race of magnified nonnatural men who preceded humanity  these semidivine people were called ulhaipa by the chinooks and sehuiab by the lummies but the coyote was the maker of men as the first of natures journeymen he made men rather badly with closed eyes and motionless feet a kind being named ikanam touched up the coyotes crude essays with a sharp stone opening the eyes of men and giving their hands and feet the powers of movement he also acted as a culturehero introducing the first arts 1   1 fraucheres narrative 258 gibbs chinook vocabulary parkers exploring tour i 139 bancroft iii 96   moving up the west pacific coast we reach british columbia where the coyote is not supposed to have been so active as our old friend the muskrat in the great work of the creation according to the tacullies nothing existed in the beginning but water and a muskrat as the animal sought his food at the bottom of the water his mouth was frequently filled with mud this he spat out and so gradually formed by alluvial deposit an island this island was small at first like earth in the sanskrit myth in the satapatha brahmana but gradually increased in bulk the tacullies have no new light to throw on the origin of man1   1 bancroft iii 98 harmons journey pp 302 303   the thlinkeets who are neighbours of the tacullies on the north incline to give crow or raven the chief role in the task of creation just as some australians allot the same part to the eaglehawk and the yakuts to a hawk a crow and a tealduck we shall hear much of yehl later as one of the mythical heroes of the introduction of civilisation north of the thlinkeets a bird and a dog take the creative duties the aleuts and koniagas being descended from a dog among the more northern tinnehs the dog who was the progenitor of the race had the power of assuming the shape of a handsome young man he supplied the protoplasm of the tinnehs as purusha did that of the aryan world out of his own body a giant tore him to pieces as the gods tore purusha and out of the fragments thrown into the rivers came fish the fragments tossed into the air took life as birds and so forth1 this recalls the australian myth of the origin of fish and the ananzi stories of the origin of whips2   1 hearne pp 342 343 bancroft iii 106  2 see divine myths of lower races m cosquin in contes de lorraine vol i p 58 gives the ananzi story   between the cosmogonic myths of the barbarous or savage american tribes and those of the great cultivated american peoples aztecs peruvians and quiches place should be found for the legends of certain races in the south pacific of these the most important are the maoris or natives of new zealand the mangaians and the samoans beyond the usual and worldwide correspondences of myth the divine tales of the various south sea isles display resemblances so many and essential that they must be supposed to spring from a common and probably not very distant centre as it is practically impossible to separate maori myths of the making of things from maori myths of the gods and their origin we must pass over here the metaphysical hymns and stories of the original divine beings rangi and papa heaven and earth and of their cruel but necessary divorce by their children who then became the usual titanic race which constructs and airs the world for the reception of man1 among these beings more fully described in our chapter on the gods of the lower races is tiki with his wife marikoriko twilight tane male is another of the primordial race children of earth and heaven and between him and tiki lies the credit of having made or begotten humanity tane adorned the body of his father heaven rangi by sticking stars all over it as disks of pearlshells are stuck all over images he was the parent of trees and birds but some trees are original and divine beings the first woman was not born but formed out of the sun and the echo a pretty myth man was made by tiki who took red clay and kneaded it with his own blood or with the red water of swamps the habits of animals some of which are gods while others are descended from gods follow from their conduct at the moment when heaven and earth were violently divorced new zealand itself or at least one of the isles was a huge fish caught by maui of whom more hereafter just as pundjel in australia cut out the gullies and vales with his knife so the mountains and dells of new zealand were produced by the knives of mauis brothers when they crimped his big fish2 quite apart from those childish ideas are the astonishing metaphysical hymns about the first stirrings of light in darkness of becoming and being which remind us of hegel and heraclitus or of the most purely speculative ideas in the rigveda3 scarcely less metaphysical are the myths of mangaia of which mr gill4 gives an elaborate account   1 see divine myths of lower races  2 taylor new zealand pp 115121 bastian heilige sage der polynesier pp 3650 shortland traditions of new zealanders  3 see chapter on divine myths of the lower races and on indian cosmogonic myths  4 myths and songs from the south pacific pp 122   the mangaian ideas of the world are complex and of an early scientific sort the universe is like the hollow of a vast cocoanut shell divided into many imaginary circles like those of mediaeval speculation there is a demon at the stem as it were of the cocoanut and where the edges of the imaginary shell nearly meet dwells a woman demon whose name means the very beginning in this system we observe efforts at metaphysics and physical speculation but it is very characteristic of rude thought that such extremely abstract conceptions as the very beginning are represented as possessing life and human form the woman at the bottom of the shell was anxious for progeny and therefore plucked a bit out of her own right side as eve was made out of the rib of adam this piece of flesh became vatea the father of gods and men vatea like oannes in the chaldean legend was half man half fish the very beginning begat other children in the same manner and some of these became departmental gods of ocean noonday and so forth curiously enough the mangaians seem to be sticklers for primogeniture vatea as the firstborn son originally had his domain next above that of his mother but she was pained by the thought that his younger brothers each took a higher place than his so she pushed his land up and it is now next below the solid crust on which mortals live in mangaia vatea married a woman from one of the under worlds named papa and their children had the regular human form one child was born either from papas head like athene from the head of zeus or from her armpit like dionysus from the thigh of zeus another child may be said in the language of dogbreeders to have thrown back for he wears the form of a white or black lizard in the mangaian system the sky is a solid vault of blue stone in the beginning of things the sky like ouranos in greece and rangi in new zealand pressed hard on earth and the god ru was obliged to thrust the two asunder or rather he was engaged in this task when maui tossed both ru and the sky so high up that they never came down again ru is now the atlas of mangaia the skysupporting ru1 his lower limbs fell to earth and became pumicestone in these mangaian myths we discern resemblances to new zealand fictions as is natural and the tearing of the body of the very beginning has numerous counterparts in european american and indian fable but on the whole the mangaian myths are more remarkable for their semiscientific philosophy than for their coincidences with the fancies of other early peoples   1 gill p 59   the samoans like the maoris and greeks hold that heaven at first fell down and lay upon earth1 the arrowroot and another plant pushed up heaven and the heavenpushing place is still known and pointed out others say the god tiitii pushed up heaven and his feet made holes six feet deep in the rocks during this exertion the other samoan myths chiefly explain the origin of fire and the causes of the characteristic forms and habits of animals and plants the samoans too possess a semimythical metaphysical cosmogony starting from nothing but rapidly becoming the history of rocks clouds hills dew and various animals who intermarried and to whom the royal family of samoa trace their origin through twentythree generations so personal are samoan abstract conceptions that space had a longlegged stool on to which a head fell and grew into a companion for space yet another myth says that the god tangaloa existed in space and made heaven and earth and sent down his daughter a snipe man he made out of the musselfish so confused are the doctrines of the samoans2   1 turners samoa p 198  2 turners samoa pp 19   perhaps the cosmogonic myths of the less cultivated races have now been stated in sufficient number as an example of the ideas which prevailed in an american race of higher culture we may take the quiche legend as given in the popol vuh a postchristian collection of the sacred myths of the nation written down after the spanish conquest and published in french by the abbe brasseur de bourbourg1   1 see popol vuh in mr max mullers chips from a german workshop with a discussion of its authenticity in his annals of the cakchiquels a nation bordering on the quiches dr brinton expresses his belief in the genuine character of the text compare bancroft iii p 45 the ancient and original popol vuh the native book in native characters disappeared during the spanish conquest   the quiches like their neighbours the cakchiquels were a highly civilised race possessing wellbuilt towns roads and the arts of life and were great agriculturists maize the staple of food among these advanced americans was almost as great a god as soma among the indoaryans the quiches were acquainted with a kind of picturewriting and possessed records in which myth glided into history the popol vuh or book of the people gives itself out as a postcolumbian copy of these traditions and may doubtless contain european ideas as we see in the commentarias reales of the halfblood inca garcilasso de la vega the conquered people were anxious to prove that their beliefs were by no means so irrational and so devilish as to spanish critics they appeared according to the popol vuh there was in the beginning nothing but water and the feathered serpent one of their chief divine beings but there also existed somehow they that gave life their names mean shooter of blowpipe at coyote at opossum and so forth they said earth and there was earth and plants growing thereon animals followed and the givers of life said speak our names but the animals could only cluck and croak then said the givers inasmuch as ye cannot praise us ye shall be killed and eaten they then made men out of clay these men were weak and watery and by water they were destroyed next they made men of wood and women of the pith of trees these puppets married and gave in marriage and peopled earth with wooden mannikins this unsatisfactory race was destroyed by a rain of resin and by the wild beasts the survivors developed into apes next came a period occupied by the wildest feats of the magnified nonnatural race and of animals the record is like the description of a supernatural pantomimethe nightmare of a god the titans upset hills are turned into stone and behave like heitsi eibib in the namaqua myths  last of all men were made of yellow and white maize and these gave more satisfaction but their sight was contracted these however survived and became the parents of the present stock of humanity  here we have the conceptions of creation and of evolution combined men are made but only the fittest survive the rest are either destroyed or permitted to develop into lower species a similar mixture of the same ideas will be found in one of the brahmanas among the aryans of india it is to be observed that the quiche myths as recorded in popol vuh contain not only traces of belief in a creative word and power but many hymns of a lofty and beautifully devotional character  hail o creator o former thou that hearest and understandest us abandon us not forsake us not o god thou that art in heaven and on the earth o heart of heaven o heart of earth give us descendants and posterity as long as the light endures  this is an example of the prayers of the men made out of maize made especially that they might call on the name of the god or gods whether we are to attribute this and similar passages to christian influence for popol vuh as we have it is but an attempt to collect the fragments of the lost book that remained in mens minds after the conquest or whether the purer portions of the myth be due to untaught native reflection and piety it is not possible to determine it is improbable that the ideas of a hostile race would be introduced into religious hymns by their victims here as elsewhere in the sacred legends of civilised peoples various strata of mythical and religious thought coexist  no american people reached such a pitch of civilisation as the aztecs of anahuac whose capital was the city of mexico it is needless here to repeat the story of their grandeur and their fall obscure as their history previous to the spanish invasion may be it is certain that they possessed a highly organised society fortified towns established colleges or priesthoods magnificent temples an elaborate calendar great wealth in the precious metals the art of picturewriting in considerable perfection and a despotic central government the higher classes in a society like this could not but develop speculative systems and it is alleged that shortly before the reign of montezuma attempts had been made to introduce a pure monotheistic religion but the ritual of the aztecs remained an example of the utmost barbarity never was a more cruel faith not even in carthage nowhere did temples reek with such pools of human blood nowhere else not in dahomey and ashanti were human sacrifice cannibalism and torture so essential to the cult that secured the favour of the gods in these dark fanesreeking with gore peopled by monstrous shapes of idols birdheaded or beastheaded and adorned with the hideous carvings in which we still see the priest under the mask of some less ravenous forest beast tormenting the victimin these abominable temples the castilian conquerors might well believe that they saw the dwellings of devils  yet mexican religion had its moral and beautiful aspect and the gods or certain of the gods required from their worshippers not only bloody hands but clean hearts  to the gods we return later the myths of the origin of things may be studied without a knowledge of the whole aztec pantheon our authorities though numerous lack complete originality and are occasionally confused we have first the aztec monuments and hieroglyphic scrolls for the most part undeciphered these merely attest the hideous and cruel character of the deities next we have the reports of early missionaries like sahagun and mendieta of conquerors like bernal diaz and of noble halfbreeds such as ixtlilxochitl1   1 bancrofts native races of pacific coast of north america vol iii contains an account of the sources and with sahagun and acosta is mainly followed here see also j g muller ur amerik rel p 507 see chapter on the divine myths of mexico   there are two elements in mexican as in quiche and indoaryan and maori and even andaman cosmogonic myth we find the purer religion and the really philosophic speculation concurrent with such crude and childish stories as usually satisfy the intellectual demands of ahts cahrocs and bushmen but of the purer and more speculative opinions we know little many of the noble learned and priestly classes of aztecs perished at the conquest the survivors were more or less converted to catholicism and in their writings probably put the best face possible on the native religion like the spanish clergy their instructors they were inclined to explain away their national gods by a system of euhemerism by taking it for granted that the gods and cultureheroes had originally been ordinary men worshipped after their decease this is almost invariably the view adopted by sahagun side by side with the confessions as it were of the clergy and cultivated classes coexisted the popular beliefs the myths of the people partaking of the nature of folklore but not rejected by the priesthood  both strata of belief are represented in the surviving cosmogonic myths of the aztecs probably we may reckon in the first or learned and speculative class of tales the account of a series of constructions and reconstructions of the world this idea is not peculiar to the higher mythologies the notion of a deluge and recreation or renewal of things is almost universal and even among the untutored australians there are memories of a flood and of an age of ruinous winds but the theory of definite epochs calculated in accordance with the mexican calendar of epochs in which things were made and remade answers closely to the indoaryan conception of successive kalpas and can only have been developed after the method of reckoning time had been carried to some perfection when heaven and earth were fashioned they had already been four times created and destroyed say the fragments of what is called the chimalpopoca manuscript probably this theory of a series of kalpas is only one of the devices by which the human mind has tried to cheat itself into the belief that it can conceive a beginning of things the earth stands on an elephant the elephant on a tortoise and it is going too far to ask what the tortoise stands on in the same way the worlds beginning seems to become more intelligible or less puzzling when it is thrown back into a series of beginnings and endings this method also was in harmony with those vague ideas of evolution and of the survival of the fittest which we have detected in myth the various tentative human races of the popol vuh degenerated or were destroyed because they did not fulfil the purposes for which they were made in brahmanic myth we shall see that type after type was condemned and perished because it was inadequate or inadequately equippedbecause it did not harmonise with its environment1 for these series of experimental creations and inefficient evolutions vast spaces of time were required according to the aztec and indoaryan philosophies it is not impossible that actual floods and great convulsions of nature may have been remembered in tradition and may have lent colour and form to these somewhat philosophic myths of origins from such sources probably comes the mexican hypothesis of a waterage ending in a deluge an earthage ending in an earthquake a windage ending in hurricanes and the present dispensation to be destroyed by fire   1 as an example of a dim evolutionary idea note the myths of the various ages as reported by mendieta according to which there were five earlier ages or suns of bad quality so that the contemporary human beings were unable to live on the fruits of the earth   the less philosophic and more popular aztec legend of the commencement of the world is mainly remarkable for the importance given in it to objects of stone for some reason stones play a much greater part in american than in other mythologies an emerald was worshipped in the temple of pachacamac who was according to garcilasso the supreme and spiritual deity of the incas the creation legend of the cakchiquels of guatemala1 makes much of a mysterious primeval and animated obsidian stone in the iroquois myths2 stones are the leading characters nor did aztec myth escape this influence   1 brinton annals of the cakchiquels  2 erminie smith bureau of ethnol report ii   there was a god in heaven named citlalatonac and a goddess citlalicue when we speak of heaven we must probably think of some such world of ordinary terrestrial nature above the sky as that from which ataentsic fell in the huron story the goddess gave birth to a flintknife and flung the flint down to earth this abnormal birth partly answers to that of the youngest of the adityas the rejected abortion in the veda and to the similar birth and rejection of maui in new zealand from the fallen flintknife sprang our old friends the magnified nonnatural beings with human characteristics the gods to the number of 1600 the gods sent up the hawk who in india and australia generally comes to the front on these occasions and asked their mother or rather grandmother to help them to make men to be their servants citlalicue rather jeered at her unconsidered offspring she advised them to go to the lord of the homes of the departed mictlanteuctli and borrow a bone or some ashes of the dead who are with him we must never ask for consistency from myths this statement implies that men had already been in existence though they were not yet created perhaps they had perished in one of the four great destructions with difficulty and danger the gods stole a bone from hades placed it in a bowl and smeared it with their own blood as in chaldea and elsewhere finally a boy and a girl were born out of the bowl from this pair sprang men and certain of the gods jumping into a furnace became sun and moon to the sun they then in aztec fashion sacrificed themselves and there one might think was an end of them but they afterwards appeared in wondrous fashions to their worshippers and ordained the ritual of religion according to another legend man and woman as in african myths struggled out of a hole in the ground1   1 authorities ixtlil kingsborough ix pp 205 206 sahagun hist gen i 3 vii 2 j g muller p 510 where muller compares the delphic conception of ages of the world bancroft iii pp 60 65   the myths of the peoples under the empire of the incas in peru are extremely interesting because almost all mythical formations are found existing together while we have historical evidence as to the order and manner of their development the peru of the incas covered the modern state of the same name and included ecuador with parts of chili and bolivia m reville calculates that the empire was about 2500 miles in length four times as long as france and that its breadth was from 250 to 500 miles the country contained three different climatic regions and was peopled by races of many different degrees of culture all more or less subject to the dominion of the children of the sun the three regions were the dry strip along the coast the fertile and cultivated land about the spurs of the cordilleras and the inland mountain regions inhabited by the wildest races near cuzco the inca capital was the lake of titicaca the mediterranean as it were of peru for on the shores of this inland sea was developed the chief civilisation of the new world  as to the institutions myths and religion of the empire we have copious if contradictory information there are the narratives of the spanish conquerors especially of pizarros chaplain valverde an ignorant bigoted fanatic then we have somewhat later travellers and missionaries of whom cieza de leon his book was published thirty years after the conquest in 1553 is one of the most trustworthy the royal commentaries of garcilasso de la vega son of an inca lady and a spanish conqueror have often already been quoted the critical spirit and sound sense of garcilasso are in remarkable contrast to the stupid orthodoxy of the spaniards but some allowance must be made for his fervent peruvian patriotism he had heard the inca traditions repeated in boyhood and very early in life collected all the information which his mother and maternal uncle had to give him or which could be extracted from the quipus the records of knotted cord and from the commemorative pictures of his ancestors garcilasso had access moreover to the torn papers of blas valera an early spanish missionary of unusual sense and acuteness christoval de moluna is also an excellent authority and much may be learned from the volume of rites and laws of the yncas1   1 a more complete list of authorities including the garrulous acosta is published by m reville in his hibbert lectures pp 136 137 garcilasso cieza de leon christoval de moluna acosta and the rites and laws have all been translated by mr clements markham and are published with the editors learned and ingenious notes in the collection of the hakluyt society care must be taken to discriminate between what is reported about the indians of the various provinces who were in very different grades of culture and what is told about the incas themselves   the political and religious condition of the peruvian empire is very clearly conceived and stated by garcilasso without making due allowance for that mysterious earlier civilisation older than the incas whose cyclopean buildings are the wonder of travellers garcilasso attributes the introduction of civilisation to his own ancestors allowing for what is confessedly mythical in his narrative it must be admitted that he has a firm grasp of what the actual history must have been he recognises a period of savagery before the incas a condition of the rudest barbarism which still existed on the fringes and mountain recesses of the empire the religion of that period was mere magic and totemism from all manner of natural objects but chiefly from beasts and birds the various savage stocks of peru claimed descent and they revered and offered sacrifice to their totemic ancestors1 garcilasso adds what is almost incredible that the indians tamely permitted themselves to be eaten by their totems when these were carnivorous animals they did this with the less reluctance as they were cannibals and accustomed to breed children for the purposes of the cuisine from captive women taken in war2 among the huacas or idols totems fetishes and other adorable objects of the indians worshipped before and retained after the introduction of the inca suntotem and solar cult garcilasso names trees hills rocks caves fountains emeralds pieces of jasper tigers lions bears foxes monkeys condors owls lizards toads frogs sheep maize the sea for want of larger gods crabs and bats the bat was also the totem of the zotzil the chief family of the cakchiquels of guatemala and the most high god of the cakchiquels was worshipped in the shape of a bat we are reminded of religion as it exists in samoa the explanation of blas valera was that in each totem pacarissa the indians adored the devil   1 com real vol i chap ix x xi pp 4753  2 cieza de leon xii xv xix xxi xxiii xxvi xxviii xxxii cieza is speaking of people in the valley of cauca in new granada   athwart this early religion of totems and fetishes came in garcilassos narrative the purer religion of the incas with what he regards as a philosophic development of a belief in a supreme being according to him the inca sunworship was really a totemism of a loftier character the incas knew how to choose gods better than the indians garcilassos theory is that the earlier totems were selected chiefly as distinguishing marks by the various stocks though of course this does not explain why the animals or other objects of each family were worshipped or were regarded as ancestors and the bloodconnections of the men who adored them the incas disdaining crabs lizards bats and even serpents and lions chose the sun then just like the other totemic tribes they feigned to be of the blood and lineage of the sun  this fable is in brief the inca myth of the origin of civilisation and of man or at least of their breed of men as m reville well remarks it is obvious that the inca claim is an adaptation of the local myth of lake titicaca the inland sea of peru according to that myth the children of the sun the ancestors of the incas came out of the earth as in greek and african legends at lake titicaca or reached its shores after wandering from the hole or cave whence they first emerged the myth as adapted by the incas takes for granted the previous existence of mankind and in some of its forms the inca period is preceded by the deluge  of the peruvian myth concerning the origin of things the following account is given by a spanish priest christoval de moluna in a report to the bishop of cuzco in 15701 the story was collected from the lips of ancient peruvians and old native priests who again drew their information in part from the painted records reserved in the temple of the sun near cuzco the legend begins with a deluge myth a cataclysm ended a period of human existence all mankind perished except a man and woman who floated in a box to a distance of several hundred miles from cuzco there the creator commanded them to settle and there like pundjel in australia he made clay images of men of all races attired in their national dress and then animated them they were all fashioned and painted as correct models and were provided with their national songs and with seedcorn they then were put into the earth and emerged all over the world at the proper places some as in africa and greece coming out of fountains some out of trees some out of caves for this reason they made huacas worshipful objects or fetishes of the trees caves and fountains some of the earliest men were changed into stones others into falcons condors and other creatures which we know were totems in peru probably this myth of metamorphosis was invented to account for the reverence paid to totems or pacarissas as the peruvians called them in tiahuanaco where the creation or rather manufacture of men took place the creator turned many sinners into stones the sun was made in the shape of a man and as he soared into heaven he called out in a friendly fashion to manco ccapac the ideal first inca look upon me as thy father and worship me as thy father in these fables the creator is called pachyachachi teacher of the world according to christoval the creator and his sons were eternal and unchangeable among the canaris men descend from the survivor of the deluge and a beautiful bird with the face of a woman a siren in fact but known better to ornithologists as a macaw the chief cause says the good christoval of these fables was ignorance of god   1 rites and laws of the yncas p 4 hakluyt society 1873   the story as told by cieza de leon runs thus1 a white man of great stature in fact a magnified nonnatural man came into the world and gave life to beasts and human beings his name was ticiviracocha and he was called the father of the sun2 there are likenesses of him in the temple and he was regarded as a moral teacher it was owing apparently to this benevolent being that four mysterious brothers and sisters emerged from a cavechildren of the sun fathers of the incas teachers of savage men their own conduct however was not exemplary and they shut up in a hole in the earth the brother of whom they were jealous this incident is even more common in the marchen or household tales than in the regular tribal or national myths of the world3 the buried brother emerged again with wings and without doubt he must have been some devil says honest cieza de leon this brother was manco ccapac the heroic ancestor of the incas and he turned his jealous brethren into stones the whole tale is in the spirit illustrated by the wilder romances of the popol vuh   1 second part of the chronicles of peru p 5  2 see making of religion pp 265270 name and god are much disputed  3 the story of joseph and the marchen of jean de lours are wellknown examples   garcilasso gives three forms of this myth according to the old inca his maternal uncle it was the sun which sent down two of his children giving them a golden staff which would sink into the ground at the place where they were to rest from wandering it sank at lake titicaca about the current myths garcilasso says generally that they were more like dreams than straightforward stories but as he adds the greeks and romans also invented fables worthy to be laughed at and in greater number than the indians the stories of one age of heathenism may be compared with those of the other and in many points they will be found to agree this critical position of garcilassos will be proved correct when we reach the myths of greeks and indoaryans the myth as narrated northeast of cuzco speaks of the four brothers and four sisters who came out of caves and the caves in inca times were panelled with gold and silver  athwart all these lower myths survivals from the savage stage comes what garcilasso regards as the philosophical inca belief in pachacamac this deity to garcilassos mind was purely spiritual he had no image and dwelt in no temple in fact he is that very god whom the spanish missionaries proclaimed this view though the fact has been doubted was very probably held by the amautas or philosophical class in peru1 cieza de leon says the name of this devil pachacamac means creator of the world garcilasso urges that pachacamac was the animus mundi that he did not make the world as pundjel and other savage demiurges made it but that he was to the universe what the soul is to the body   1 com real vol i p 106   here we find ourselves if among myths at all among the myths of metaphysicsrational myths that is myths corresponding to our present stage of thought and therefore intelligible to us pachacamac made the sun and lightning and thunder and of these the sun was worshipped by the incas garcilasso denies that the moon was worshipped the reflections of the sceptical or monotheistic inca who declared that the sun far from being a free agent seems like a thing held to its task are reported by garcilasso and appear to prove that solar worship was giving way in the minds of educated peruvians a hundred years before the arrival of pizarro and valverde with his missal1   1 garcilasso viii 8 quoting blas valera   from this summary it appears that the higher peruvian religion had wrested to its service and to the dynastic purposes of the incas a native myth of the familiar class in which men come ready made out of holes in the ground but in peru we do not find nearly such abundance of other savage origin myths as will be proved to exist in the legends of greeks and indoaryans the reason probably is that peru left no native literature the missionaries disdained stories of devils and garcilassos common sense and patriotism were alike revolted by the incidents of stories more like dreams than truthful records he therefore was silent about them in greece and india on the other hand the native religious literature preserved myths of the making of man out of clay of his birth from trees and stones of the fashioning of things out of the fragments of mutilated gods and titans of the cosmic egg of the rending and wounding of a personal heaven and a personal earth of the fishing up from the waters of a tiny earth which grew greater of the development of men out of beasts with a dozen other such notions as are familiar to contemporary bushmen australians digger indians and cahrocs but in greece and india these ideas coexist with myths and religious beliefs as purely spiritual and metaphysical as the belief in the pachacamac of garcilasso

of india it is necessary to have a clear notion of the nature of the evidence from which we derive our knowledge of the subject that evidence is found in a large and incongruous mass of literary documents the heritage of the indian people in this mass are extremely ancient texts the rigveda and the atharvaveda expository comments of a date so much later that the original meaning of the older documents was sometimes lost the brahmanas and poems and legendary collections of a period later still a period when the whole character of religious thought had sensibly altered in this literature there is indeed a certain continuity the names of several gods of the earliest time are preserved in the legends of the latest but the influences of many centuries of change of contending philosophies of periods of national growth and advance and of national decadence and decay have been at work on the mythology of india here we have myths that were perhaps originally popular tales and are probably old here again we have later legends that certainly were conceived in the narrow minds of a pedantic and ceremonious priesthood it is not possible of course to analyse in this place all the myths of all the periods we must be content to point out some which seem to be typical examples of the working of the human intellect in its earlier or its later childhood in its distant hours of barbaric beginnings or in the senility of its sacerdotage  the documents which contain indian mythology may be divided broadly speaking into four classes first and most ancient in date of composition are the collections of hymns known as the vedas next and as far as date of collection goes far less ancient are the expository texts called the brahmanas later still come other manuals of devotion and of sacred learning called sutras and upanishads and last are the epic poems itihasas and the books of legends called puranas we are chiefly concerned here with the vedas and brahmanas a gulf of time a period of social and literary change separates the brahmanas from the vedas but the epics and puranas differ perhaps even still more from the brahmanas on account of vast religious changes which brought new gods into the indian olympus or elevated to the highest place old gods formerly of low degree from the composition of the first vedic hymn to the compilation of the latest purana religious and mythopoeic fancy was never at rest  various motives induced various poets to assign on various occasions the highest powers to this or the other god the most antique legends were probably omitted or softened by some early vedic bard rishi of noble genius or again impure myths were brought from the obscurity of oral circulation and foisted into literature by some poet less divinely inspired old deities were halfforgotten and forgotten deities were resuscitated sages shook off superstitious bonds priests forged new fetters on ancient patterns for themselves and their flocks philosophy explained away the more degrading myths myths as degrading were suggested to dark and servile hearts by unscientific etymologies over the whole mass of ancient mythology the new mythology of a debased brahmanic ritualism grew like some luxurious and baneful parasite it is enough for our purpose if we can show that even in the purest and most antique mythology of india the element of traditional savagery survived and played its part and that the irrational legends of the vedas and brahmanas can often be explained as relics of savage philosophy or faith or as novelties planned on the ancient savage model whether borrowed or native to the race  the oldest documents of indian mythology are the vedas usually reckoned as four in number the oldest again of the four is the sanhita collection of the rigveda it is a purely lyrical assortment of the songs which the hindus brought with them from their ancient homes on the banks of the indus in the manuscripts the hymns are classified according to the families of poets to whom they are ascribed though composed on the banks of the indus by sacred bards the hymns were compiled and arranged in india proper at what date the oldest hymns of which this collection is made up were first chanted it is impossible to say with even approximate certainty opinions differ or have differed between 2400 bc and 1400 bc as the period when the earliest sacred lyrics of the veda may first have been listened by gods and men in addition to the rigveda we have the sanhita of the samaveda an anthology taken from the riksamhita comprising those of its verses which were intended to be chanted at the ceremonies of the soma sacrifice1 it is conjectured that the hymns of the samaveda were borrowed from the rigveda before the latter had been edited and stereotyped into its present form next comes the yajurveda which contains the formulas for the entire sacrificial ceremonial and indeed forms its proper foundations the other vedas being devoted to the soma sacrifice2 the yajurveda has two divisions known as the black and the white yajur which have common matter but differ in arrangement the black yajurveda is also called the taittirya and it is described as a motley undigested jumble of different pieces3 last comes atharvaveda not always regarded as a veda properly speaking it derives its name from an old semimythical priestly family the atharvans and is full of magical formulae imprecations folklore and spells there are good reasons for thinking this late as a collection however early may be the magical ideas expressed in its contents4   1 weber history of indian literature eng transl p 63  2 ibid p 86  3 ibid p 87 the name taittirya is derived from a partridge or from a rishi named partridge in sanskrit there is a story that the pupils of a sage were turned into partridges to pick up sacred texts  4 barth les religions de linde p 6 thinks that the existence of such a collection as the atharvaveda is implied perhaps in a text of the rigveda x 90 9   between the vedas or at all events between the oldest of the vedas and the compilation of the brahmanas these canonised explanations of a canonised text1 it is probable that some centuries and many social changes intervened2   1 whitney oriental and linguistic studies first series p 4  2 max muller biographical essays p 20 the prose portions presuppose the hymns and to judge from the utter inability of the authors of the brahmanas to understand the antiquated language of the hymns these brahmanas must be ascribed to a much later period than that which gave birth to the hymns   if we would criticise the documents for indian mythology in a scientific manner it is now necessary that we should try to discover as far as possible the social and religious condition of the people among whom the vedas took shape were they in any sense primitive or were they civilised was their religion in its obscure beginnings or was it already a special and peculiar development the fruit of many ages of thought now it is an unfortunate thing that scholars have constantly and as it were involuntarily drifted into the error of regarding the vedas as if they were primitive as if they exhibited to us the germs and genesis of religion and mythology as if they contained the simple though strange utterances of primitive thought1 thus mr whitney declares in his oriental and linguistic studies that the vedas exhibit to us the very earliest germs of the hindu culture mr max muller avers that no country can be compared to india as offering opportunities for a real study of the genesis and growth of religion2 yet the same scholar observes that even the earliest specimens of vedic poetry belong to the modern history of the race and that the early period of the historical growth of religion had passed away before the rishis bards could have worshipped their devas or bright beings with sacred hymns and invocations though this is manifestly true the sacred hymns and invocations of the rishis are constantly used as testimony bearing on the beginning of the historical growth of religion nay more these remains of the modern history of the race are supposed to exhibit mythology in the process of making as if the race had possessed no mythology before it reached a comparatively modern period the vedic age in the same spirit dr muir the learned editor of sanskrit texts speaks in one place as if the vedic hymns illustrated the natural workings of the human mind in the period of its infancy3 a brief examination of the social and political and religious condition of man as described by the poets of the vedas will prove that his infancy had long been left behind him when the first vedic hymns were chanted   1 ibid rigveda sanhita p vii  2 hibbert lectures p 131  3 nothing can prove more absolutely and more briefly the late character of vedic faith than the fact that the faith had already to be defended against the attacks of sceptics the impious denied the existence of indra because he was invisible rigveda ii 12 5 viii 89 3 v 30 12 vi 27 3 bergaigne ii 167 es gibt keinen indra so hat der eine und der ander gesagt ludwigs version   as barth observes the very ideas which permeate the veda the idea of the mystic efficacy of sacrifice of brahma prove that the poems are profoundly sacerdotal and this should have given pause to the writers who have persisted in representing the hymns as the work of primitive shepherds praising their gods as they feed their flocks1 in the vedic age the ranks of society are already at least as clearly defined as in homeric greece we men says a poet of the rigveda2 have all our different imaginations and designs the carpenter seeks something that is broken the doctor a patient the priest some one who will offer libations the artisan continually seeks after a man with plenty of gold i am a poet my father is a doctor and my mother is a grinder of corn chariots and the art of the chariotbuilder are as frequently spoken of as in the iliad spears swords axes and coats of mail were in common use the art of boatbuilding or of shipbuilding was well known kine and horses sheep and dogs had long been domesticated the bow was a favourite weapon and warriors fought in chariots like the homeric greeks and the egyptians weaving was commonly practised the people probably lived as a rule in village settlements but cities or fortified places were by no means unknown3 as for political society kings are frequently mentioned in the hymns and it was regarded as eminently beneficial for a king to entertain a family priest on whom he was expected to confer thousands of kine lovely slaves and lumps of gold in the family polygamy existed probably as the exception there is reason to suppose that the brotherinlaw was permitted if not expected to raise up seed to his dead brother as among the hebrews4 as to literature the very structure of the hymns proves that it was elaborate and consciously artistic m barth writes it would be a great mistake to speak of the primitive naivete of the vedic poetry and religion5 both the poetry and the religion on the other hand display in the highest degree the mark of the sacerdotal spirit the myths though originally derived from natureworship in an infinite majority of cases only reflect natural phenomena through a veil of ritualistic corruptions6 the rigid division of castes is seldom recognised in the rigveda we seem to see caste in the making7 the rishis and priests of the princely families were on their way to becoming the allpowerful brahmans the kings and princes were on their way to becoming the caste of kshatriyas or warriors the mass of the people was soon to sink into the caste of vaisyas and broken men nonaryan aborigines and others were possibly developing into the caste of sudras thus the spirit of division and of ceremonialism had still some of its conquests to achieve but the extraordinary attention given and the immense importance assigned to the details of sacrifice and the supernatural efficacy constantly attributed to a sort of magical asceticism tapas austere fervour prove that the worst and most foolish elements of later indian society and thought were in the vedic age already in powerful existence   1 les religions de linde p 27  2 ix 112  3 ludwig rigveda iii 203 the burgs were fortified with wooden palisades capable of being destroyed by fire cities may be too magnificent a word for what perhaps were more like pahs but compare kaegi the rigveda note 42 engl transl kaegis book translated by dr arrowsmith boston us 1886 is probably the best short manual of the subject  4 deut xxv 5 matt xxii 24  5 revue de lhistoire des religions i 245  6 ludwig iii 262  7 on this subject see muir i 192 with the remarks of haug from all we know the real origin of caste seems to go back to a time anterior to the composition of the vedic hymns though its development into a regular system with insurmountable barriers can be referred only to the later period of the vedic times roth approaches the subject from the word brahm that is prayer with a mystical efficacy as his startingpoint from brahm prayer came brahma he who pronounces the prayers and performs the rite this celebrant developed into a priest whom to entertain brought blessings on kings this domestic chaplaincy conferring peculiar and even supernatural benefits became hereditary in families and these united by common interests exalted themselves into the brahman caste but in the vedic age gifts of prayer and poetry alone marked out the purohitas or men put forward to mediate between gods and mortals compare ludwig iii 221   thus it is selfevident that the society in which the vedic poets lived was so far from being primitive that it was even superior to the higher barbarisms such as that of the scythians of herodotus and germans of tacitus and might be regarded as safely arrived at the threshold of civilisation society possessed kings though they may have been kings of small communities like those who warred with joshua or fought under the walls of thebes or troy poets were better paid than they seem to have been at the courts of homer or are at the present time for the tribal festivals special priests were appointed who distinguished themselves by their comprehensive knowledge of the requisite rites and by their learning and amongst whom a sort of rivalry is gradually developed according as one tribe or another is supposed to have more or less prospered by its sacrifices1 in the family marriage is sacred and traces of polyandry and of the levirate surviving as late as the epic poems were regarded as things that need to be explained away perhaps the most barbaric feature in vedic society the most singular relic of a distant past is the survival even in a modified and symbolic form of human sacrifice2   1 weber p 37  2 wilson rigveda i p 5963 muir i ii wilson rigveda i p xxiv ii 8 ii 90 aitareya brahmana haugs version vol ii pp 462 469   as to the religious condition of the vedic aryans we must steadily remember that in the vedas we have the views of the rishis only that is of sacred poets on their way to becoming a sacred caste necessarily they no more represent the popular creeds than the psalmists and prophets with their lofty monotheistic morality represent the popular creeds of israel the faith of the rishis as will be shown later like that of the psalmists has a noble moral aspect yet certain elements of this higher creed are already found in the faiths of the lowest savages the rishis probably did not actually invent them consciousness of sin of imperfection in the sight of divine beings has been developed as it has even in australia and is often confessed but on the whole the religion of the rishis is practicalit might almost be said is magical they desire temporal blessings rain sunshine long life power wealth in flocks and herds the whole purpose of the sacrifices which occupy so much of their time and thought is to obtain these good things the sacrifice and the sacrificer come between gods and men on the mans side is faith munificence a compelling force of prayer and of intentness of will the sacrifice invigorates the gods to do the will of the sacrificer it is supposed to be mystically celebrated in heaven as well as on earththe gods are always sacrificing often as when rain is wanted the sacrifice imitates the end which it is desirable to gain1 in all these matters a minute ritual is already observed the mystic word brahma in the sense of hymn or prayer of a compelling and magical efficacy has already come into use the brahma answers almost to the maori karakia or incantation and charm this brahma of visvamitra protects the tribe of bharata atri with the fourth prayer discovered the sun concealed by unholy darkness2 the complicated ritual in which prayer and sacrifice were supposed to exert a constraining influence on the supernatural powers already existed haug thinks in the time of the chief rishis or hymnists of the rigveda3   1 compare the prayers of savages in j a farrers primitive manners and ludwig iii 262296 and see bergaigne la religion vedique vol i p 121  2 see texts in muir i 242  3 preface to translation of aitareya brahmana p 36   in many respects the nature of the idea of the divine as entertained by the rishis of the rigveda is still matter for discussion in the chapter on vedic gods such particulars as can be ascertained will be given roughly speaking the religion is mainly though not wholly a cult of departmental gods originally in certain cases forces of nature but endowed with moral earnestness as to fetishism in the vedas the opinions of the learned are divided m bergaigne1 looks on the whole ritual as practically an organised fetishism employed to influence gods of a far higher and purer character mr max muller remarks that stones bones shells herbs and all the other socalled fetishes are simply absent in the old hymns though they appear in more modern hymns particularly those of the atharvaveda when artificial objects are mentioned and celebrated in the rigveda they are only such as might be praised even by wordsworth or tennysonchariots bows quivers axes drums sacrificial vessels and similar objects they never assume any individual character they are simply mentioned as useful or precious it may be as sacred2   1 la religion vedique vol i p 123 le culte est assimilable dans une certaine mesure aux incantations aux pratiques magiques  2 hibbert lectures p 198   when the existence of fetish herbs is denied by mr max muller he does not of course forget soma that divine juice it is also to be noted that in modern india as mr max muller himself observes sir alfred lyall finds that the husbandman prays to his plough and the fisher to his net these objects being at present fetishes in opposition to mr max muller barth avers that the same kind of fetishism which flourishes today flourishes in the rigveda mountains rivers springs trees herbs are invoked as so many powers the beasts which live with manthe horse the cow the dog the bird and the animals which imperil his existencereceive a cult of praise and prayer among the instruments of ritual some objects are more than things consecratedthey are divinities and the warchariot the weapons of defence and offence the plough are the objects not only of benedictions but of prayers1 these absolute contradictions on matters of fact add of course to the difficulty of understanding the early indoaryan religion one authority says that the vedic people were fetishworshippers another authority denies it   1 barth les religions de linde p 7 with the vedic texts   were the rishis ancestorworshippers barth has no doubt whatever that they were in the pitris or fathers he recognises ancestral spirits now companions of the gods and gods themselves at their head appear the earliest celebrants of the sacrifice atharvan the angiras the kavis the pitris par excellence equals of the greatest gods spirits who by dint of sacrifice drew forth the world from chaos gave birth to the sun and lighted the starscosmical feats which as we have seen are sometimes attributed by the lower races to their idealised mythic ancestors the old old ones of australians and ovahereroes  a few examples of invocations of the ancestral spirits may not be out of place1 may the fathers protect me in my invocation of the gods here is a curious case especially when we remember how the wolf in the north american myth scattered the stars like spangles over the sky the fathers have adorned the sky with stars2   1 rigveda vi 524  2 ibid x 68 xi  mr whitney oriental and linguistic studies first series p 59 gives examples of the ceremony of feeding the aryan ghosts the fathers are supposed to assemble upon due invocation about the altar of him who would pay them homage to seat themselves upon the straw or matting spread for each of the guests invited and to partake of the offerings set before them the food seems chiefly to consist of rice sesame and honey   important as is the element of ancestorworship in the evolution of religion mr max muller in his hibbert lectures merely remarks that thoughts and feelings about the dead supplied some of the earliest and most important elements of religion but how these earliest elements affect his system does not appear on a general view then the religion of the vedic poets contained a vast number of elements in solutionelements such as meet us in every quarter of the globe the belief in ancestral ghosts the adoration of fetishes the devotion to a moral ideal contemplated in the persons of various deities some of whom at least have been and partly remain personal natural forces are all mingled and all are drifting towards a kind of pantheism in which while everything is divine and gods are reckoned by millions the worshipper has glimpses of one single divine essence the ritual as we have seen is more or less magical in character the general elements of the beliefs are found in various proportions everywhere the pantheistic mysticism is almost peculiar to india it is perhaps needless to repeat that a faith so very composite and already so strongly differentiated cannot possibly be primitive and that the beliefs and practices of a race so highly organised in society and so well equipped in material civilisation as the vedic aryans cannot possibly be near the beginning far from expecting to find in the veda the primitive myths of the aryans we must remember that myth had already when these hymns were sung become obnoxious to the religious sentiment thus writes barth the authors of the hymns have expurgated or at least left in the shade a vast number of legends older than their time such for example as the identity of soma with the moon as the account of the divine families of the parricide of indra and a long list might be made of the reticences of the veda it would be difficult to extract from the hymns a chapter on the loves of the gods the goddesses are veiled the adventures of the gods are scarcely touched on in passing we must allow for the moral delicacy of the singers and for their dislike of speaking too precisely about the gods sometimes it seems as if their chief object was to avoid plain speaking but often there is nothing save jargon and indolence of mind in this voluntary obscurity for already in the veda the indian intellect is deeply smitten with its inveterate malady of affecting mystery the more the more it has nothing to conceal the mania for scattering symbols which symbolise no reality and for sporting with riddles which it is not worth while to divine1 barth however also recognises amidst these confusions the inquietude of a heart deeply stirred which seeks truth and redemption in prayer such is the natural judgment of the clear french intellect on the wilfully obscure tormented and evasive intellect of india   1 les religions de linde p 21   it would be interesting were it possible to illuminate the criticism of vedic religion by ascertaining which hymns in the rigveda are the most ancient and which are later could we do this we might draw inferences as to the comparative antiquity of the religious ideas in the poems but no such discrimination of relative antiquity seems to be within the reach of critics m bergaigne thinks it impossible at present to determine the relative age of the hymns by any philological test the ideas expressed are not more easily arrayed in order of date we might think that the poems which contain most ceremonial allusions were the latest but mr max muller says that even the earliest hymns have sentiments worthy of the most advanced ceremonialists1   1 history of sanskrit literature p 556   the first and oldest source of our knowledge of indoaryan myths is the rigveda whose nature and character have been described the second source is the atharvaveda with the brahmanas the peculiarity of the atharva is its collection of magical incantations spells and fragments of folklore these are often doubtless of the highest antiquity sorcery and the arts of medicinemen are earlier in the course of evolution than priesthood we meet them everywhere among races who have not developed the institution of an order of priests serving national gods as a collection the atharvaveda is later than the rigveda but we need not therefore conclude that the ideas of the atharva are a later development of the more primitive ideas of the rigveda magic is quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus the ideas of the atharvaveda are everywhere the peculiar notions of the rigveda are the special property of an advanced and highly differentiated people even in the present collected shape m barth thinks that many hymns of the atharva are not much later than those of the rigveda mr whitney admitting the lateness of the atharva as a collection says this would not necessarily imply that the main body of the atharva hymns were not already in existence when the compilation of the rigveda took place1 the atharva refers to some poets of the rig as certain hymnists in the rig also do as earlier men if in the rig as weber says there breathes a lively natural feeling a warm love of nature while in the atharva on the contrary there predominates an anxious apprehension of evil spirits and their magical powers it by no means follows that this apprehension is of later origin than the lively feeling for nature rather the reverse there appears to be no doubt2 that the style and language of the atharva are later than those of the rig roth who recognises the change in language and style yet considers the atharva part of the old literature3 he concludes that the atharva contains many pieces which both by their style and ideas are shown to be contemporary with the older hymns of the rigveda in religion according to muir4 the atharva shows progress in the direction of monotheism in its celebration of brahman but it also introduces serpentworship   1 journal of the american oriental society iv 253  2 muir ii 446  3 ibid ii 448  4 ibid ii 451   as to the atharva then we are free to suppose if we like that the dark magic the evil spirits the incantations are old parts of indian as of all other popular beliefs though they come later into literature than the poetry about ushas and the morality of varuna the same remarks apply to our third source of information the brahmanas these are indubitably comments on the sacred texts very much more modern in form than the texts themselves but it does not follow and this is most important for our purpose that the myths in the brahmanas are all later than the vedic myths or corruptions of the veda muir remarks1 the rigveda though the oldest collection does not necessarily contain everything that is of the greatest age in indian thought or tradition we know for example that certain legends bearing the impress of the highest antiquity such as that of the deluge appear first in the brahmanas we are especially interested in this criticism because most of the myths which we profess to explain as survivals of savagery are narrated in the brahmanas if these are necessarily late corruptions of vedic ideas because the collection of the brahmanas is far more modern than that of the veda our argument is instantly disproved but if ideas of an earlier stratum of thought than the vedic stratum may appear in a later collection as ideas of an earlier stratum of thought than the homeric appear in poetry and prose far later than homer then our contention is legitimate it will be shown in effect that a number of myths of the brahmanas correspond in character and incident with the myths of savages such as cahrocs and ahts our explanation is that these tales partly survived in the minds perhaps of conservative local priesthoods from the savage stage of thought or were borrowed from aborigines in that stage or were moulded in more recent times on surviving examples of that wild early fancy   1 muir iv 450   in the age of the brahmanas the people have spread southwards from the basin of the indus to that of the ganges the old sacred texts have begun to be scarcely comprehensible the priesthood has become much more strictly defined and more rigorously constituted absurd as it may seem the vedic metres like the gayatri have been personified and appear as active heroines of stories presumably older than this personification the asuras have descended from the rank of gods to that of the heavenly opposition to indras government they are now a kind of fiends and the brahmanas are occupied with long stories about the war in heaven itself a very ancient conception varuna becomes cruel on occasion and hostile prajapati becomes the great mythical hero and inherits the wildest myths of the savage heroic beasts and birds  the priests are now brahmans a hereditary divine caste who possess all the vast and puerile knowledge of ritual and sacrificial minutiae as life in the opera is a series of songs so life in the brahmanas is a sequence of sacrifices sacrifice makes the sun rise and set and the rivers run this way or that  the study of indian myth is obstructed as has been shown by the difficulty of determining the relative dates of the various legends but there are a myriad of other obstacles to the study of indian mythology a poet of the vedas says the chanters of hymns go about enveloped in mist and unsatisfied with idle talk1 the ancient hymns are still enveloped in mist owing to the difficulty of their language and the variety of modern renderings and interpretations the heretics of vedic religion the opponents of the orthodox commentators in ages comparatively recent used to complain that the vedas were simply nonsense and their authors knaves and buffoons there are moments when the modern student of vedic myths is inclined to echo this petulant complaint for example it is difficult enough to find in the rigveda anything like a categoric account of the gods and a description of their personal appearance but in rigveda viii 29 1 we read of one god a youth brown now hostile now friendly a golden lustre invests him who is this youth soma as the moon according to the commentators m langlois thinks the sun is meant dr aufrecht thinks the troop of maruts spirits of the storm to whom he remarks the epithet darkbrown tawny is as applicable as it is to their master rudra this is rather confusing and a mythological inquirer would like to know for certain whether he is reading about the sun or soma the moon or the winds   1 rigveda x 82 7 but compare bergaigne op cit iii 72 enveloppes de nuees et de murmures   to take another example we open mr max mullers translation of the rigveda at random say at page 49 in the second verse of the hymn to the maruts mr muller translates they who were born together selfluminous with the spotted deer the clouds the spears the daggers the glittering ornaments i hear their whips almost close by as they crack them in their hands they gain splendour on their way now wilson translates this passage who borne by spotted deer were born selfluminous with weapons warcries and decorations i hear the cracking of their whips in their hands wonderfully inspiring courage in the fight benfey has who with stags and spears and with thunder and lightning selfluminous were born hard by rings the crack of their whip as it sounds in their hands bright fare they down in storm langlois translates just born are they selfluminous mark ye their arms their decorations their car drawn by deer hear ye their clamour listen tis the noise of the whip they hold in their hands the sound that stirs up courage in the battle this is an ordinary example of the diversities of vedic translation it is sufficiently puzzling nor is the matter made more transparent by the variety of opinion as to the meaning of the deer along with which the maruts are said by some of the translators to have been born this is just the sort of passage on which a controversy affecting the whole nature of vedic mythological ideas might be raised according to a text in the yajur veda gods and men and beasts and other matters were created from various portions of the frame of a divine being named prajapati1 the god agni brahmans and the goat were born from the mouth of prajapati from his breast and arms came the god indra sometimes spoken of as a ram the sheep and of men the rajanya cows and gods called visvadevas were born together from his middle are we to understand the words they who were born together with the spotted deer to refer to a myth of this kinda myth representing the maruts and deer as having been born at the same birth as agni came with the goat and indra with the sheep this is just the point on which the indian commentators were divided2 sayana the old commentator says the legendary school takes them for deer with white spots the etymological school for the manycoloured lines of clouds the modern legendary or anthropological and etymological or philological students of mythology are often as much at variance in their attempts to interpret the traditions of india   1 muir sanskrit texts 2nd edit i 16  2 max muller rigveda sanhita trans vol i p 59   another famous and almost comic example of the difficulty of vedic interpretation is well known in rigveda x 16 4 there is a funeral hymn agni the firegod is supplicated either to roast a goat or to warm the soul of the dead and convey it to paradise whether the soul is to be thus comforted or the goat is to be grilled is a question that has mightily puzzled vedic doctors1 professor muller and m langlois are all for the immortal soul the goat has advocates or had advocates in aufrecht ludwig and roth more important difficulties of interpretation are illustrated by the attitude of m bergaigne in la religion vedique and his controversy with the great german lexicographers the study of mythology at one time made the vedas its startingpoint but perhaps it would be wise to begin from something more intelligible something less perplexed by difficulties of language and diversities of interpretation   1 muir v 217   in attempting to criticise the various aryan myths we shall be guided on the whole by the character of the myths themselves pure and elevated conceptions we shall be inclined to assign to a pure and elevated condition of thought though such conceptions do recognisably occur in the lowest known religious strata and we shall make no difficulty about believing that rishis and singers capable of noble conceptions existed in an age very remote in time in a society which had many of the features of a lofty and simple civilisation but we shall not therefore assume that the hymns of these rishis are in any sense primitive or throw much light on the infancy of the human mind or on the origin of religious and heroic myths impure childish and barbaric conceptions on the other hand we shall be inclined to attribute to an impure childish and barbaric condition of thought and we shall again make no difficulty about believing that ideas originally conceived when that stage of thought was general have been retained and handed down to a far later period this view of the possible or rather probable antiquity of many of the myths preserved in the brahmanas is strengthened if it needed strengthening by the opinion of dr weber1 we must indeed assume generally with regard to many of those legends in the brahmanas of the rigveda that they had already gained a rounded independent shape in tradition before they were incorporated into the brahmanas and of this we have frequent evidence in the distinctly archaic character of their language compared with that of the rest of the text   1 history of indian literature english trans p 47   we have now briefly stated the nature and probable relative antiquity of the evidence which is at the disposal of vedic mythologists the chief lesson we would enforce is the necessity of suspending the judgment when the vedas are represented as examples of primitive and comparatively pure and simple natural religion they are not primitive they are highly differentiated highly complex extremely enigmatic expressions of fairly advanced and very peculiar religious thought they are not morally so very pure as has been maintained and their purity such as it is seems the result of conscious reticence and wary selection rather than of primeval innocence yet the bards or editors have by no means wholly excluded very ancient myths of a thoroughly savage character these will be chiefly exposed in the chapter on indoaryan myths of the beginnings of things which follows    chapter viii indian myths of the origin

in discussing the savage myths of the origin of the world and of man we observed that they were as inconsistent as they were fanciful among the fancies embodied in the myths was noted the theory that the world or various parts of it had been formed out of the body of some huge nonnatural being a god or giant or a member of some ancient mysterious race we also noted the myths of the original union of heaven and earth and their violent separation as displayed in the tales of greeks and maoris to which may be added the acagchemem nation in california1 another feature of savage cosmogonies illustrated especially in some early slavonic myths in australian legends and in the faith of the american races was the creation of the world or the recovery of a drowned world by animals as the raven the dove and the coyote the hatching of all things out of an egg was another rude conception chiefly noted among the finns the indian form occurs in the satapatha brahmana2 the preservation of the human race in the deluge or the creation of the race after the deluge was yet another detail of savage mythology and for many of these fancies we seemed to find a satisfactory origin in the exceedingly credulous and confused state of savage philosophy and savage imagination   1 bancroft v 162  2 sacred books of the east i 216   the question now to be asked is do the traditions of the aryans of india supply us with myths so closely resembling the myths of nootkas maoris and australians that we may provisionally explain them as stories originally due to the invention of savages this question may be answered in the affirmative the vedas the epics and the puranas contain a large store of various cosmogonic traditions as inconsistent as the parallel myths of savages we have an aryan ilmarinen tvashtri who like the finnish smith forged the iron vault of hollow heaven and the ball of earth1 again the earth is said to have sprung as in some mangaian fables from a being called uttanapad2 again brahmanaspati blew the gods forth like a blacksmith and the gods had a hand in the making of things in contrast with these childish pieces of anthropomorphism we have the famous and sublime speculations of an oftenquoted hymn3 it is thus that the poet dreams of the days before being and nonbeing began   1 muir v 354  2 rigveda x 72 4  3 ibid x 126   there was then neither nonentity nor entity there was no atmosphere nor sky above what enveloped all was it water the profound abyss death was not then nor immortality there was no distinction of day or night that one breathed calmly selfsupported then was nothing different from it or above it in the beginning darkness existed enveloped in darkness all this was undistinguishable water that one which lay void and wrapped in nothingness was developed by the power of fervour desire first arose in it which was the primal germ of mind and which sages searching with their intellect have discovered to be the bond which connects entity with nonentity the ray or cord which stretched across these worlds was it below or was it above there were there impregnating powers and mighty forces a selfsupporting principle beneath and energy aloft who knows who here can declare whence has sprung whence this creation the gods are subsequent to the development of this universe who then knows whence it arose from what this creation arose and whether any one made it or not he who in the highest heaven is its ruler he verily knows or even he does not know1   1 muir sanskrit texts 2nd edit v 357   here there is a vedic hymn of the origin of things from a book it is true supposed to be late which is almost if not absolutely free from mythological ideas the selfsupporting principle beneath and energy aloft may refer as dr muir suggests to the father heaven above and the mother earth beneath the bond between entity and nonentity is sought in a favourite idea of the indian philosophers that of tapas or fervour the other speculations remind us though they are much more restrained and temperate in character of the metaphysical chants of the new zealand priests of the zunis of popol vuh and so on these belong to very early culture  what is the relative age of this hymn if it could be proved to be the oldest in the veda it would demonstrate no more than this that in time exceedingly remote the aryans of india possessed a philosopher perhaps a school of philosophers who applied the minds to abstract speculations on the origin of things it could not prove that mythological speculations had not preceded the attempts of a purer philosophy but the date cannot be ascertained mr max muller cannot go farther than the suggestion that the hymn is an expression of the perennis quaedam philosophia of leibnitz we are also warned that a hymn is not necessarily modern because it is philosophical1 certainly that is true the zunis maoris and mangaians exhibit amazing powers of abstract thought we are not concerned to show that this hymn is late but it seems almost superfluous to remark that ideas like those which it contains can scarcely be accepted as expressing mans earliest theory of the origin of all things we turn from such ideas to those which the aryans of india have in common with black men and red men with faroff finns and scandinavians chaldaeans haidahs cherokees murri and maori mangaians and egyptians   1 history of sanskrit literature p 568   the next vedic account of creation which we propose to consider is as remote as possible in character from the sublime philosophic poem in the purusha sukta the ninetieth hymn of the tenth book of the rigveda sanhita we have a description of the creation of all things out of the severed limbs of a magnified nonnatural man purusha this conception is of course that which occurs in the norse myths of the rent body of ymir borrs sons took the body of the giant ymir and of his flesh formed the earth of his blood seas and waters of his bones mountains of his teeth rocks and stones of his hair all manner of plants of his skull the firmament of his brains the clouds and so forth in chaldean story bel cuts in twain the magnified nonnatural woman omorca and converts the halves of her body into heaven and earth among the iroquois in north america chokanipok was the giant whose limbs bones and blood furnished the raw material of many natural objects while in mangaia portions of ru in egypt of set and osiris in greece of dionysus zagreus were used in creating various things such as stones plants and metals the same ideas precisely are found in the ninetieth hymn of the tenth book of the rigveda yet it is a singular thing that in all the discussions as to the antiquity and significance of this hymn which have come under our notice there has not been one single reference made to parallel legends among aryan or nonaryan peoples in accordance with the general principles which guide us in this work we are inclined to regard any ideas which are at once rude in character and widely distributed both among civilised and uncivilised races as extremely old whatever may be the age of the literary form in which they are presented but the current of learned opinions as to the date of the purusha sukta the vedic hymn about the sacrifice of purusha and the creation of the world out of fragments of his body runs in the opposite direction the hymn is not regarded as very ancient by most sanskrit scholars we shall now quote the hymn which contains the data on which any theory as to its age must be founded1   1 rigveda x 90 muir sanskrit texts 2nd edit i 9   purusha has a thousand heads a thousand eyes a thousand feet on every side enveloping the earth he overpassed it by a space of ten fingers purusha himself is this whole universe whatever is and whatever shall be when the gods performed a sacrifice with purusha as the oblation the spring was its butter the summer its fuel and the autumn its accompanying offering this victim purusha born in the beginning they immolated on the sacrificial grass with him the gods the sadhyas and the rishis sacrificed from that universal sacrifice were provided curds and butter it formed those aerial creatures and animals both wild and tame from that universal sacrifice sprang the ric and saman verses the metres and yajush from it sprang horses and all animals with two rows of teeth kine sprang from it from it goats and sheep when the gods divided purusha into how many parts did they cut him up what was his mouth what arms had he what two objects are said to have been his thighs and feet the brahman was his mouth the rajanya was made his arms the being called the vaisya he was his thighs the sudra sprang from his feet the moon sprang from his soul mahas the sun from his eye indra and agni from his mouth and yaiyu from his breath from his navel arose the air from his head the sky from his feet the earth from his ear the four quarters in this manner the gods formed the world when the gods performing sacrifice bound purusha as a victim there were seven sticks stuck up for it around the fire and thrice seven pieces of fuel were made with sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice these were the earliest rites these great powers have sought the sky where are the former sadhyas gods  the myth here stated is plain enough in its essential facts the gods performed a sacrifice with a gigantic anthropomorphic being purusha  man as the victim sacrifice is not found as a rule in the religious of the most backward races of all it is relatively an innovation as shall be shown later his head like the head of ymir formed the sky his eye the sun animals sprang from his body the four castes are connected with and it appears to be implied that they sprang from his mouth arms thighs and feet it is obvious that this last part of the myth is subsequent to the formation of castes this is one of the chief arguments for the late date of the hymn as castes are not distinctly recognised elsewhere in the rigveda mr max muller1 believes the hymn to be modern both in its character and in its diction and this opinion he supports by philological arguments dr muir2 says that the hymn has every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas dr haug on the other hand3 in a paper read in 1871 admits that the present form of the hymn is not older than the greater part of the hymns of the tenth book and than those of the atharva veda but he adds the ideas which the hymn contains are certainly of a primeval antiquity in fact the hymn is found in the yajurveda among the formulas connected with human sacrifices which were formerly practised in india we have expressly declined to speak about primeval antiquity as we have scarcely any evidence as to the myths and mental condition for example even of palaeolithic man but we may so far agree with dr haug as to affirm that the fundamental idea of the purusha sukta namely the creation of the world or portions of the world out of the fragments of a fabulous anthropomorphic being is common to chaldeans iroquois egyptians greeks tinnehs mangaians and aryan indians this is presumptive proof of the antiquity of the ideas which dr muir and mr max muller think relatively modern the savage and brutal character of the invention needs no demonstration among very low savages for example the tinnehs of british north america not a man not a god but a dog is torn up and the fragments are made into animals4 on the paloure river a beaver suffers in the manner of purusha we may for these reasons regard the chief idea of the myth as extremely ancientinfinitely more ancient than the diction of the hymn   1 ancient sanskrit literature 570  2 sanskrit texts 2nd edit i 12  3 sanskrit text 2nd edit ii 463  4 hearnes journey pp 342343   as to the mention of the castes supposed to be a comparatively modern institution that is not an essential part of the legend when the idea of creation out of a living being was once received it was easy to extend the conception to any institution of which the origin was forgotten the teutonic race had a myth which explained the origin of the classes eorl ceorl and thrall earl churl and slave a south american people to explain the different ranks in society hit on the very myth of plato the legend of golden silver and copper races from which the ranks of society have descended the vedic poet in our opinion merely extended to the institution of caste a myth which had already explained the origin of the sun the firmament animals and so forth on the usual lines of savage thought the purusha sukta is the type of many other indian myths of creation of which the following1 one is extremely noteworthy prajapati desired to propagate he formed the trivrit stoma from his mouth after it were produced the deity agni the metre gayatri of men the brahman of beasts the goat from his breast and from his arms he formed the panchadasa stoma after it were created the god indra the trishtubh metre of men the rajanya of beasts the sheep hence they are vigorous because they were created from vigour from his middle he formed the saptadasa stoma after it were created the gods called the yisvadevas the jagati metre of men the vaisya of beasts kine hence they are to be eaten because they were created from the receptacle of food the form in which we receive this myth is obviously later than the institution of caste and the technical names for metres yet surely any statement that kine are to be eaten must be older than the universal prohibition to eat that sacred animal the cow possibly we might argue that when this theory of creation was first promulgated goats and sheep were forbidden food2   1 taittirya sanhita or yajurveda vii i 14 muir 2nd edit i 15  2 mr mlennan has drawn some singular inferences from this passage connecting as it does certain gods and certain classes of men with certain animals in a manner somewhat suggestive of totemism fornightly review february 1870   turning from the vedas to the brahmanas we find a curiously savage myth of the origin of species1 according to this passage of the brahmana this universe was formerly soul only in the form of purusha he caused himself to fall asunder into two parts thence arose a husband and a wife he cohabited with her from them men were born she reflected how does he after having produced me from himself cohabit with me ah let me disappear she became a cow and the other a bull and he cohabited with her from them kine were produced after a series of similar metamorphoses of the female into all animal shapes and a similar series of pursuits by the male in appropriate form in this manner pairs of all sorts of creatures down to ants were created this myth is a parallel to the various greek legends about the amours in bestial form of zeus nemesis cronus demeter and other gods and goddesses in the brahmanas this myth is an explanation of the origin of species and such an explanation as could scarcely have occurred to a civilised mind in other myths in the brahmanas prajapati creates men from his body or rather the fluid of his body becomes a tortoise the tortoise becomes a man purusha with similar examples of speculation2   1 satapatha brahmana xiv 4 2 muir 2nd edit i 25  2 similar tales are found among the khonds   among all these brahmana myths of the part taken by prajapati in the creation or evoking of things the question arises who was prajapati his role is that of the great hare in american myth he is a kind of demiurge and his name means the master of things created like the australian biamban master and the american title of the chief manitou master of life1 dr muir remarks that as the vedic mind advances from mere divine beings who reside and operate in fire agni dwell and shine in the sun surya or in the atmosphere indra towards a conception of deity the farther step would be taken of speaking of the deity under such new names as visvakarman and prajapati these are appellatives which do not designate any limited functions connected with any single department of nature but the more general and abstract notions of divine power operating in the production and government of the universe now the interesting point is that round this new and abstract name gravitate the most savage and crudest myths exactly the myths we meet among hottentots and nootkas for example among the hottentots it is heitsi eibib among the huarochiri indians it is uiracocha who confers by curse or blessing on the animals their proper attributes and characteristics2 in the satapatha brahmana it is prajapati who takes this part that falls to rude cultureheroes of hottentots and huarochiris3 how prajapati made experiments in a kind of stateaided evolution so to speak or evolution superintended and assisted from above will presently be set forth   1 bergaigne iii 40  2 avila fables of the yncas p 127  3 english translation ii 361   in the puranas creation is a process renewed after each kalpa or vast mundane period brahma awakes from his slumber and finds the world a waste of water then just as in the american myths of the coyote and the slavonic myths of the devil and the doves a boar or a fish or a tortoise fishes up the world out of the waters that boar fish tortoise or what not is brahma or vishnu this savage conception of the beginnings of creation in the act of a tortoise fish or boar is not first found in the puranas as mr muir points out but is indicated in the black yajur veda and in the satapatha brahmana1 in the satapatha brahmana xiv 1 2 11 we discover the idea so common in savage mythsfor example in that of the navajoesthat the earth was at first very small a mere patch and grew bigger after the animal fished it up formerly this earth was only so large of the size of a span a boar called emusha raised her up here the boar makes no pretence of being the incarnation of a god but is a mere boar sans phrase like the creative coyote of the papogas and chinooks or the muskrat of the tacullies this is a good example of the development of myths savages begin as we saw by mythically regarding various animals spiders grasshoppers ravens eagles cockatoos as the creators or recoverers of the world as civilisation advances those animals still perform their beneficent functions but are looked on as gods in disguise in time the animals are often dropped altogether though they hold their place with great tenacity in the cosmogonic traditions of the aryans in india when we find the satapatha brahmana alleging2 that all creatures are descended from a tortoise we seem to be among the rude indians of the pacific coast but when the tortoise is identified with aditya and when adityas prove to be solar deities sons of aditi and when aditi is recognised by mr muller as the dawn we see that the aryan mind has not been idle but has added a good deal to the savage idea of the descent of men and beasts from a tortoise3   1 muir 2nd edit vol i p 52  2 muir 2nd edit vol i p 54  3 see ternaux compans nouvelles annales des voyages lxxxvi p 5 for mexican traditions mexican and australian hurricane worlds end bancroft v 64   another feature of savage myths of creation we found to be the introduction of a crude theory of evolution we saw that among the potoyante tribe of the digger indians and among certain australian tribes men and beasts were supposed to have been slowly evolved and improved out of the forms first of reptiles and then of quadrupeds in the mythologies of the more civilised south american races the idea of the survival of the fittest was otherwise expressed the gods made several attempts at creation and each set of created beings proving in one way or other unsuited to its environment was permitted to die out or degenerated into apes and was succeeded by a set better adapted for survival1 in much the same way the satapatha brahmana2 represents mammals as the last result of a series of creative experiments prajapati created living beings which perished for want of food birds and serpents perished thus prajapati reflected how is it that my creatures perish after having been formed he perceived this they perish from want of food in his own presence he caused milk to be supplied to breasts he created living beings which resorting to the breasts were thus preserved these are the creatures which did not perish   1 this myth is found in popol vuh a chinook myth of the same sort bancroft v 95  2 ii 5 11 muir 2nd edit i 70   the common myth which derives the world from a great eggthe myth perhaps most familiar in its finnish shapeis found in the satapatha brahmana1 in the beginning this universe was waters nothing but waters the waters desired how can we be reproduced so saying they toiled they performed austerity while they were performing austerity a golden egg came into existence it then became a year from it in a year a man came into existence who was prajapati he conceived progeny in himself with his mouth he created the gods according to another text2 prajapati took the form of a tortoise the tortoise is the same as aditya3   1 xi 1 6 1 muir journal of royal asiatic society 1863  2 satapatha brahmana vii 4 3 5  3 aitareya brahmana iii 34 11 219 a very discreditable origin of species   it is now time to examine the aryan shape of the widely spread myth about the marriage of heaven and earth and the fortunes of their children we have already seen that in new zealand heaven and earth were regarded as real persons of bodily parts and passions united in a secular embrace we shall apply the same explanation to the greek myth of gaea and of the mutilation of cronus in india dyaus heaven answers to the greek uranus and the maori rangi while prithivi earth is the greek gaea the maori papa in the veda heaven and earth are constantly styled parents1 but this we might regard as a mere metaphorical expression still common in poetry a passage of the aitareya brahmana however retains the old conception in which there was nothing metaphorical at all2 these two worlds heaven and earth were once joined subsequently they were separated according to one account by indra who thus plays the part of cronus and of tane mahuta heaven and earth says dr muir are regarded as the parents not only of men but of the gods also as appears from the various texts where they are designated by the epithet devapatre having gods for their children by men in an early stage of thought this myth was accepted along with others in which heaven and earth were regarded as objects created by one of their own children as by indra3 who stretched them out like a hide who like atlas sustains and upholds them4 or again tvashtri the divine smith wrought them by his craft or once more heaven and earth sprung from the head and feet of purusha in short if any one wished to give an example of that recklessness of orthodoxy or consistency which is the mark of early myth he could find no better example than the indian legends of the origin of things perhaps there is not one of the myths current among the lower races which has not its counterpart in the indian brahmanas it has been enough for us to give a selection of examples   1 muir v 22  2 iv 27 haug ii 308  3 rigveda viii 6 5  4 ibid iii 32 8    chapter ix greek myths of the origin of the world and man  the greeks practically civilised when we first meet them in homertheir mythology however is full of repulsive featuresthe hypothesis that many of these are savage survivalsare there other examples of such survival in greek life and institutionsgreek opinion was constant that the race had been savageillustrations of savage survival from greek law of homicide from magic religion human sacrifice religious art traces of totemism and from the mysteriesconclusion that savage survival may also be expected in greek myths   the greeks when we first make their acquaintance in the homeric poems were a cultivated people dwelling under the government of royal families in small city states this social condition they must have attained by 1000 bc and probably much earlier they had already a long settled past behind them and had no recollection of any national migration from the cradle of the aryan race on the other hand many tribes thought themselves earthborn from the soil of the place where they were settled the maori traditions prove that memories of a national migration may persist for several hundred years among men ignorant of writing greek legend among a far more civilised race only spoke of occasional foreign settlers from sidon lydia or egypt the homeric greeks were well acquainted with almost all the arts of life though it is not absolutely certain that they could write and certainly they were not addicted to reading in war they fought from chariots like the egyptians and assyrians they were bold seafarers being accustomed to harry the shores even of egypt and they had large commercial dealings with the people of tyre and sidon in the matter of religion they were comparatively free and unrestrained their deities though in myth capricious in character might be regarded in many ways as making for righteousness they protected the stranger and the suppliant they sanctioned the oath they frowned on the use of poisoned arrows marriage and domestic life were guarded by their goodwill they dispensed good and evil fortune to be accepted with humility and resignation among mortals  the patriarchal head of each family performed the sacrifices for his household the king for the state the ruler of mycenae agamemnon for the whole achaean host encamped before the walls of troy at the same time prophets like calchas possessed considerable influence due partly to an hereditary gift of secondsight as in the case of theoclymenus1 partly to acquired professional skill in observing omens partly to the direct inspiration of the gods the oracle at delphi or as it is called by homer pytho was already famous and religion recognised in various degrees all the gods familiar to the later cult of hellas in a people so advanced so much in contact with foreign races and foreign ideas and so wonderfully gifted by nature with keen intellect and perfect taste it is natural to expect if anywhere a mythology almost free from repulsive elements and almost purged of all that we regard as survivals from the condition of savagery but while greek mythology is richer far than any other in beautiful legend and is thronged with lovely and majestic forms of gods and goddesses nymphs and oreads ideally fair none the less a very large proportion of its legends is practically on a level with the myths of maoris thlinkeets cahrocs and bushmen   1 odyssey xx 354   this is the part of greek mythology which has at all times excited most curiosity and has been made the subject of many systems of interpretation the greeks themselves from almost the earliest historical ages were deeply concerned either to veil or explain away the blasphemous horrors of their own sacred chapters poetic traditions and temple legends we endeavour to account for these as relics of an age of barbarism lying very far behind the time of homeran age when the ancestors of the greeks either borrowed or more probably developed for themselves the kind of myths by which savage peoples endeavour to explain the nature and origin of the world and all phenomena  the correctness of this explanation resting as it does on the belief that the greeks were at one time in the savage status might be demonstrated from the fact that not only myths but greek life in general and especially greek ritual teemed with surviving examples of institutions and of manners which are found everywhere among the most backward and barbarous races it is not as if only the myths of greece retained this rudeness or as if the greeks supposed themselves to have been always civilised the whole of greek life yields relics of savagery when the surface is excavated ever so slightly moreover that the greeks as soon as they came to reflect on these matters at all believed themselves to have emerged from a condition of savagery is undeniable the poets are entirely at one on this subject with moschion a writer of the school of euripides the time hath been yea it hath been he says when men lived like the beasts dwelling in mountain caves and clefts unvisited of the sun then they broke not the soil with ploughs nor by aid of iron but the weaker man was slain to make the supper of the stronger and so on1 this view of the savage origin of mankind was also held by aristotle2 it is probable that the first men whether they were produced by the earth earthborn or survived from some deluge were on a level of ignorance and darkness3 this opinion consciously held and stated by philosophers and poets reveals itself also in the universal popular greek traditions that men were originally ignorant of fire agriculture metallurgy and all the other arts and conveniences of life till they were instructed by ideal cultureheroes like prometheus members of a race divine or half divine a still more curious athenian tradition preserved by varro maintained not only that marriage was originally unknown but that as among australians and some red indians the family name descended through the mother and kinship was reckoned on the female side before the time of cecrops4   1 moschion cf preller ausgewahlte aufsatze p 206  2 politics ii 821 plato laws 667680  3 compare horace satires i 3 99 lucretius v 923  4 suidas sv prometheus augustine de civitate dei xviii 9   while greek opinion both popular and philosophical admitted or rather asserted that savagery lay in the background of the historical prospect greek institutions retained a thousand birthmarks of savagery it is manifest and undeniable that the greek criminal law as far as it effected murder sprang directly from the old savage bloodfeud1 the athenian law was a civilised modification of the savage rule that the kindred of a slain man take up his bloodfeud where homicide was committed within the circle of blood relationship as by orestes greek religion provided the erinnyes to punish an offence which had as it were no human avenger the precautions taken by murderers to lay the ghost of the slain man were much like those in favour among the australians the greek cut off the extremities of his victim the tips of the hands and feet and disposed them neatly beneath the armpits of the slain man2 in the same spirit and for the same purpose the australian black cuts off the thumbs of his dead enemy that the ghost too may be mutilated and prevented from throwing at him with a ghostly spear we learn also from apollonius rhodius and his scholiast that greek murderers used thrice to suck in and spit out the gore of their victims perhaps with some idea of thereby partaking of their blood and so by becoming members of their kin putting it beyond the power of the ghosts to avenge themselves similar ideas inspire the worldwide savage custom of making an artificial blood brotherhood by mingling the blood of the contracting parties as to the ceremonies of cleansing from bloodguiltiness among the greeks we may conjecture that these too had their primitive side for orestes in the eumenides maintains that he has been purified of his mothers slaughter by sufficient blood of swine but this point will be illustrated presently when we touch on the mysteries   1 duncker history of greece engl transl vol ii p 129  2 see armpitting in ancient greece in the american journal of philology october 1885 where a discussion of the familiar texts in aeschylus and apollonius rhodius will be found   ritual and myth as might be expected retained vast masses of savage rites and superstitious habits and customs to be in all things too superstitious too full of deisidaimonia was even in st pauls time the characteristic of the athenians now superstition or deisidaimonia is defined by theophrastus1 as cowardice in regard to the supernatural greek text omitted this cowardice has in all ages and countries secured the permanence of ritual and religious traditions men have always argued like one of the persons in m renans play le pretre de nemi that lordre du monde depend de lordre des rites quon observe the familiar endurable sequence of the seasons of spring and seedsowing and harvest depend upon the due performance of immemorial religious acts in the mystic deposits says dinarchus lies the safety of the city2 what the mystic deposits were nobody knows for certain but they must have been of very archaic sanctity and occur among the arunta and the pawnees   1 characters  2 ap hermann lehrbuch p 41 aglaophamus 965   ritual is preserved because it preserves luck not only among the romans and the brahmans with their endless minute ritual actions but among such lower races as the kanekas of new caledonia the efficacy of religious functions is destroyed by the slightest accidental infraction of established rules1 the same timid conservatism presides over myth and in each locality the mysteryplays with their accompanying narratives preserved inviolate the early forms of legend myth and ritual do not admit of being argued about cetait le rite etabli ce netait pas plus absurde quautre chose says the conservative in m renans piece defending the mode of appointment of        the priest who slew the slayer      and shall himself be slain   1 thus the watchers of the dead in new caledonia are fed by the sorcerer with a mess at the end of a very long spoon and should the food miss the mouth all the ceremonies have to be repeated this detail is from mr j j atkinson   now if the rites and myths preserved by the timorousness of this same cowardice towards the supernatural were originally evolved in the stage of savagery savage they would remain as it is impious and dangerous to reform them till the religion which they serve perishes with them these relics in greek ritual and faith are very commonly explained as due to oriental influences as things borrowed from the dark and bloody superstitions of asia but this attempt to save the native greek character for blitheness and humanity must not be pushed too far1 it must be remembered that the cruder and wilder sacrifices and legends of greece were strictly local that they were attached to these ancient temples old altars barbarous xoana or wooden idols and rough fetish stones in which pausanias found the most ancient relics of hellenic theology this is a proof of their antiquity and a presumption in favour of their freedom from foreign influence most of these things were survivals from that dimly remembered prehistoric age in which the greeks not yet gathered into city states lived in villages or kraals or pueblos as we should translate greek text omitted if we were speaking of african or american tribes in that stage the early greeks must have lacked both the civic and the national or panhellenic sentiment their political unit was the clan which again answered in part to the totem kindred of america or africa or australia2 in this stagnant condition they could not have made acquaintance with the many creeds of semitic and other alien peoples on the shores of the levant3 it was later when greece had developed the city life of the heroic age that her adventurous sons came into close contact with egypt and phoenicia   1 claus de antiq form dianae 6716  2 as c o muller judiciously remarks the scenes of ninetenths of the greek myths are laid in particular districts of greece and they speak of the primeval inhabitants of the lineage and adventures of native heroes they manifest an accurate acquaintance with individual localities which at a time when greece was neither explored by antiquaries nor did geographical handbooks exist could be possessed only by the inhabitants of these localities muller gives as examples myths of bears more or less divine scientific mythology pp 14 15  3 compare claus de dianae antiquissima natura p 3   in the colonising time still laterperhaps from 900 bc downwardsthe greeks settled on sites whence they had expelled sidonians or sicanians very naturally continued with modifications the worship of such gods as they found already in possession like the romans the greeks easily recognised their own deities in the analogous members of foreign polytheistic systems thus we can allow for alien elements in such gods and goddesses as zeus asterios as aphrodite of cyprus or eryx or the manybreasted ephesian artemis whose monstrous form had its exact analogue among the aztecs in that manybreasted goddess of the maguey plant whence beer was made to discern and disengage the borrowed factors in the hellenic olympus by analysis of divine names is a task to which comparative philology may lawfully devote herself but we cannot so readily explain by presumed borrowing from without the rude xoana of the ancient local temples the wild myths of the local legends the sacra which were the exclusive property of oldworld families butadae or eumolpidae these are clearly survivals from a stage of greek culture earlier than the city state earlier than the heroic age of the roving greek vikings and far earlier than the greek colonies they belong to that conservative and immobile period when the tribe or clan settled in its scattered kraals lived a life of agriculture hunting and cattlebreeding engaged in no larger or more adventurous wars than border feuds about women or cattle such wars were on a humbler scale than even nestors old fights with the epeians such adventures did not bring the tribe into contact with alien religions if sidonian merchantmen chanced to establish a factory near a tribe in this condition their religion was not likely to make many proselytes  these reasons for believing that most of the wilder element in greek ritual and myth was native may be briefly recapitulated as they are often overlooked the more strange and savage features meet us in local tales and practices often in remote upland temples and chapels there they had survived from the society of the village status before villages were gathered into cities before greeks had taken to a roving life or made much acquaintance with distant and maritime peoples  for these historical reasons it may be assumed that the local religious antiquities of greece especially in upland districts like arcadia and elis are as old and as purely national as free from foreign influences as any greek institutions can be in these rites and myths of true folklore and volksleben developed before hellas won its way to the pure hellenic stage before egypt and phoenicia were familiar should be found that common rude element which greeks share with the other races of the world and which was to some extent purged away by the genius of homer and pindar pii vates et phaebo digna locuti  in proof of this local conservatism some passages collected by k f hermann in his lehrbuch der griechischen antiquitaten1 may be cited thus isocrates writes2 this was all their care neither to destroy any of the ancestral rites nor to add aught beyond what was ordained clemens alexandrinus reports that certain thessalians worshipped storks in accordance with use and wont3 plato lays down the very law of least change which has been described whether the legislator is establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one in respect of gods and temples if he be a man of sense he will make no change in anything which the oracle of delphi or dodona or ammon has sanctioned in whatever manner in this very passage plato4 speaks of rites derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus as falling within the later period of the greek wanderjahre on the high religious value of things antique porphyry wrote in a late age and when the new religion of christ was victorious comparing the new sacred images with the old we see that the old are more simply fashioned yet are held divine but the new admired for their elaborate execution have less persuasion of divinitya remark anticipated by pausanias the statues daedalus wrought are quainter to the outward view yet there shows forth in them somewhat supernatural5 so athenaeus6 reports of a visitor to the shrine of leto in delos that he expected the ancient statue of the mother of apollo to be something remarkable but unlike the pious porphyry burst out laughing when he found it a shapeless wooden idol these idols were dressed out fed and adorned as if they had life7 it is natural that myths dating from an age when greek gods resembled polynesian idols should be as rude as polynesian myths the tenacity of local myth is demonstrated by pausanias who declares that even in the highly civilised attica the demes retained legends different from those of the central citythe legends probably which were current before the villages were synoecised into athens8   1 zweiter theil 1858  2 areop 30  3 clem alex oxford 1715 i 34  4 laws v 738  5 de abst ii 18 paus ii 4 5  6 xiv 2  7 hermann op cit p 94 note 10  8 pausanias i 14 6   it appears then that greek ritual necessarily preserves matter of the highest antiquity and that the oldest rites and myths will probably be found not in the panhellenic temples like that in olympia not in the national poets like homer and sophocles but in the local fanes of early tribal gods and in the local mysteries and the myths which came late if they came at all into literary circulation this opinion is strengthened and illustrated by that invaluable guidebook of the artistic and religious pilgrim written in the second century after our era by pausanias if we follow him we shall find that many of the ceremonies stories and idols which he regarded as oldest are analogous to the idols and myths of the contemporary backward races let us then for the sake of illustrating the local and savage survivals in greek religion accompany pausanias in his tour through hellas  in christian countries especially in modern times the contents of one church are very like the furniture of another church the functions in one resemble those in all though on the continent some shrines still retain relics and customs of the period when local saints had their peculiar rites but it was a very different thing in greece the pilgrim who arrived at a temple never could guess what oddity or horror in the way of statues sacrifices or stories might be prepared for his edification in the first place there were human sacrifices these are not familiar to low savages if known to them at all probably they were first offered to barbaric royal ghosts and thence transferred to gods in the town of salamis in cyprus about the date of hadrian the devout might have found the priest slaying a human victim to zeusan interesting custom instituted according to lactantius by teucer and continued till the age of the roman empire1   1 euseb praep ev iv 17

36 mentions the messenians to zeus the taurians to artemis the folk of pella to peleus and chiron the cretans to zeus the lesbians to dionysus geusius de victimis humanis 1699 may be consulted   at alos in achaia phthiotis the stranger might have seen an extraordinary spectacle though we admit that the odds would have been highly against his chance of witnessing the following events as the stranger approaches the townhall he observes an elderly and most respectable citizen strolling in the same direction the citizen is so lost in thought that apparently he does not notice where he is going behind him comes a crowd of excited but silent people who watch him with intense interest the citizen reaches the steps of the townhall while the excitement of his friends behind increases visibly without thinking the elderly person enters the building with a wild and unaryan howl the other people of alos are down on him pinion him wreathe him with flowery garlands and lead him to the temple of zeus laphystius or the glutton where he is solemnly sacrificed on the altar this was the custom of the good greeks of alos whenever a descendant of the house of athamas entered the prytaneion of course the family were very careful as a rule to keep at a safe distance from the forbidden place what a sacrifice for greeks as the author of the minos1 says in that dialogue which is incorrectly attributed to plato he cannot get out except to be sacrificed says herodotus speaking of the unlucky descendant of athamas the custom appears to have existed as late as the time of the scholiast on apollonius rhodius2   1 315 c plato laws vi 782 c  2 argonautica vii 197   even in the second century when pausanias visited arcadia he found what seem to have been human sacrifices to zeus the passage is so very strange and romantic that we quote a part of it1 the lycaean hill hath other marvels to show and chiefly this thereon there is a grove of zeus lycaeus wherein may men in nowise enter but if any transgresses the law and goes within he must die within the space of one year this tale moreover they tell namely that whatsoever man or beast cometh within the grove casts no shadow and the hunter pursues not the deer into that wood but waiting till the beast comes forth again sees that it has left its shadow behind and on the highest crest of the whole mountain there is a mound of heapedup earth the altar of zeus lycaeus and the more part of peloponnesus can be seen from that place and before the altar stand two pillars facing the rising sun and thereon golden eagles of yet more ancient workmanship and on this altar they sacrifice to zeus in a manner that may not be spoken and little liking had i to make much search into this matter but let it be as it is and as it hath been from the beginning the words as it hath been from the beginning are ominous and significant for the traditional myths of arcadia tell of the human sacrifices of lycaon and of men who tasting the meat of a mixed sacrifice put human flesh between their lips unawares2 this aspect of greek religion then is almost on a level with the mysterious cannibal horrors of voodoo as practised by the secret societies of negroes in hayti but concerning these things as pausanias might say it is little pleasure to inquire   1 pausanias viii 2  2 plato rep viii 565 d this rite occurs in some african coronation ceremonies   even where men were not sacrificed to the gods the tourist among the temples would learn that these bloody rites had once been customary and ceremonies existed by way of commutation this is precisely what we find in vedic religion in which the empty form of sacrificing a man was gone through and the origin of the world was traced to the fragments of a god sacrificed by gods1 in sparta was an altar of artemis orthia and a wooden image of great rudeness and antiquityso rude indeed that pausanias though accustomed to greek fetishstones thought it must be of barbaric origin the story was that certain people of different towns when sacrificing at the altar were seized with frenzy and slew each other the oracle commanded that the altar should be sprinkled with human blood men were therefore chosen by lot to be sacrificed till lycurgus commuted the offering and sprinkled the altar with the blood of boys who were flogged before the goddess the priestess holds the statue of the goddess during the flogging and if any of the boys are but lightly scourged the image becomes too heavy for her to bear   1 the purusha sukhta in rigveda x 90   the ionians near anthea had a temple of artemis triclaria and to her it had been customary to sacrifice yearly a youth and maiden of transcendent beauty in pausaniass time the human sacrifice was commuted he himself beheld the strange spectacle of living beasts and birds being driven into the fire to artemis laphria a calydonian goddess and he had seen bears rush back among the ministrants but there was no record that any one had ever been hurt by these wild beasts1 the bear was a beast closely connected with artemis and there is some reason to suppose that the goddess had herself been a shebear or succeeded to the cult of a shebear in the morning of time2   1 paus vii 18 19  2 see artemis postea   it may be believed that where symbolic human sacrifices are offered that is where some other victim is slain or a dummy of a man is destroyed and where legend maintains that the sacrifice was once human there men and women were originally the victims greek ritual and greek myth were full of such tales and such commutations1 in rome as is well known effigies of men called argives were sacrificed2 as an example of a beastvictim given in commutation pausanias mentions3 the case of the folk of potniae who were compelled once a year to offer to dionysus a boy in the bloom of youth but the sacrifice was commuted for a goat   1 see hermann alterthumer ii 159161 for abundant examples  2 plutarch quest rom 32  3 ix 8 1   these commutations are familiar all over the world even in mexico where human sacrifices and ritual cannibalism were daily events quetzalcoatl was credited with commuting human sacrifices for blood drawn from the bodies of the religious in this one matter even the most conservative creeds and the faiths most opposed to change sometimes say with tartuffe        le ciel defend de vrai certains contentements      mais on trouve avec lui des accommodements   though the fact has been denied doubtless without reflection the fact remains that the greeks offered human sacrifices now what does this imply must it be taken as a survival from barbarism as one of the proofs that the greeks had passed through the barbaric status  the answer is less obvious than might be supposed sacrifice has two origins first there are honorific sacrifices in which the ghost or god or divine beast if a divine beast be worshipped is offered the food he is believed to prefer this does not occur among the lowest savages to carnivorous totems garcilasso says the indians of peru offered themselves the feeding of sacred mice in the temples of apollo smintheus is well known secondly there are expiatory or piacular sacrifices in which the worshipper as it were fines himself in a child an ox or something else that he treasures the latter kind of sacrifice most common in cases of crime done or suspected within the circle of kindred is not necessarily barbaric except in its cruelty an example is the attic thargelia in which two human scapegoats annually bore the sins of the congregation and were flogged driven to the sea with figs tied round their necks and burned1   1 compare the marseilles human sacrifice petron 141 and for the thargelia tsetzes chiliads v 736 hellad in photius p 1590 f and harpoc s v   the institution of human sacrifice then whether the offering be regarded as food or as a gift to the god of what is dearest to man as in the case of jephthas daughter or whether the victim be supposed to carry on his head the sins of the people does not necessarily date from the period of savagery indeed sacrifice flourishes most not among savages but among advancing barbarians it would probably be impossible to find any examples of human sacrifices of an expiatory or piacular character any sacrifices at all among australians or andamanese or fuegians the notion of presenting food to the supernatural powers whether ghosts or gods is relatively rare among savages1 the terrible aztec banquets of which the gods were partakers are the most noted examples of human sacrifices with a purely cannibal origin now there is good reason to guess that human sacrifices with no other origin than cannibalism survived even in ancient greece it may be conjectured writes professor robertson smith2 that the human sacrifices offered to the wolf zeus lycaeus in arcadia were originally cannibal feasts of a wolf tribe the first participants in the rite were according to later legend changed into wolves and in later times3 at least one fragment of the human flesh was placed among the sacrificial portions derived from other victims and the man who ate it was believed to become a werewolf4 it is the almost universal rule with cannibals not to eat members of their own stock just as they do not eat their own totem thus as professor robertson smith says when the human victim is a captive or other foreigner the human sacrifice may be regarded as a survival of cannibalism where on the other hand the victim is a fellow tribesman the sacrifice is expiatory or piacular   1 jevons introduction to the science of religion pp 161 199  2 encyc brit s v sacrifice  3 plato rep viii 565 d  4 paus viii 2   among greek cannibal gods we cannot fail to reckon the socalled cannibal dionysus and probably the zeus of orchomenos zeus laphystius who is explained by suidas as the glutton zeus the cognate verb greek text omitted means to eat with mangling and rending to devour gluttonously by zeus laphystius then mens flesh was gorged in this distressing fashion  the evidence of human sacrifice especially when it seems not piacular but a relic of cannibalism raises a presumption that greeks had once been barbarians the presumption is confirmed by the evidence of early greek religious art  when his curiosity about human sacrifices was satisfied the pilgrim in greece might turn his attention to the statues and other representations of the gods he would find that the modern statues by famous artists were beautiful anthropomorphic works in marble or in gold and ivory it is true that the faces of the ancient gilded dionysi at corinth were smudged all over with cinnabar like fetishstones in india or africa1 as a rule however the statues of historic times were beautiful representations of kindly and gracious beings the older works were stiff and rigid images with the lips screwed into an unmeaning smile older yet were the bronze gods made before the art of soldering was invented and formed of beaten plates joined by small nails still more ancient were the wooden images which probably bore but a slight resemblance to the human frame and which were often mere stocks2 perhaps once a year were shown the very early gods the demeter with the horses head the artemis with the fishs tails the cuckoo hera whose image was of pearwood the zeus with three eyes the hermes made after the fashion of the pictures on the walls of sacred caves among the bushmen but the oldest gods of all says pausanias repeatedly were rude stones in the temple or the temple precinct in achaean pharae he found some thirty squared stones named each after a god among all the greeks in the oldest times rude stones were worshipped in place of statues the superstitious man in theophrastuss characters used to anoint the sacred stones with oil the stone which cronus swallowed in mistake for zeus was honoured at delphi and kept warm with wool wrappings there was another sacred stone among the troezenians and the megarians worshipped as apollo a stone cut roughly into a pyramidal form the argives had a big stone called zeus kappotas the thespians worshipped a stone which they called eros their oldest idol is a rude stone3 it is well known that the original fetishstone has been found in situ below the feet of the statue of apollo in delos on this showing then the religion of very early greeks in greece was not unlike that of modern negroes the artistic evolution of the gods a remarkably rapid one after a certain point could be traced in every temple it began with the rude stone and rose to the wooden idol in which as we have seen pausanias and porphyry found such sanctity next it reached the hammered bronze image passed through the archaic marbles and culminated in the finer marbles and the chryselephantine statues of zeus and athena but none of the ancient sacred objects lost their sacredness the oldest were always the holiest idols the oldest of all were stumps and stones like savage fetishstones   1 pausanias ii 2  2 clemens alex protrept oxford 1715 p 41  3 gill myths of south pacific p 60 compare a god which proved to be merely pumicestone and was regarded as the god of winds and waves having been drifted to pukapuka offerings of food were made to it during hurricanes   another argument in favour of the general thesis that savagery left deep marks on greek life in general and on myth in particular may be derived from survivals of totemism in ritual and legend the following instances need not necessarily be accepted but it may be admitted that they are precisely the traces which totemism would leave had it once existed and then waned away on the advance of civilisation1   1 the argument to be derived from the character of the greek greek text omitted as a modified form of the totemkindred is too long and complex to be put forward here it is stated in custom and myth the history of the family in mlennans studies in early history and is assumed if not proved in ancient society by the late mr lewis morgan   that greeks in certain districts regarded with religious reverence certain plants and animals is beyond dispute that some stocks even traced their lineage to beasts will be shown in the chapter on greek divine myths and the presumption is that these creatures though explained as incarnations and disguises of various gods were once totems sans phrase as will be inferred from various examples clemens alexandrinus again after describing the animalworship of the egyptians mentions cases of zoolatry in greece1 the thessalians revered storks the thebans weasels and the myth ran that the weasel had in some way aided alcmena when in labour with heracles in another form of the myth the weasel was the fostermother of the hero2 other thessalians the myrmidons claimed descent from the ant and revered ants the religious respect paid to mice in the temple of apollo smintheus in the troad rhodes gela lesbos and crete is well known and a local tribe were alluded to as mice by an oracle the god himself like the japanese harvestgod was represented in art with a mouse at his foot and mice as has been said were fed at his shrine3 the syrians says clemens alexandrinus worship doves and fishes as the elians worship zeus4 the people of delphi adored the wolf5 and the samians the sheep the athenians had a hero whom they worshipped in the shape of a wolf6 a remarkable testimony is that of the scholiast on apollonius rhodius ii 124 the wolf he says was a beast held in honour by the athenians and whosoever slays a wolf collects what is needful for its burial the burial of sacred animals in egypt is familiar an arab tribe mourns over and solemnly buries all dead gazelles7 nay flies were adored with the sacrifice of an ox near the temple of apollo in leucas8 pausanias iii 22 mentions certain colonists who were guided by a hare to a site where the animal hid in a myrtlebush they therefore adore the myrtle greek text omitted in the same way a carian stock the ioxidae revered the asparagus9 a remarkable example of descent mythically claimed from one of the lower animals is noted by otfried muller10 speaking of the swan of apollo he says that deity was worshipped according to the testimony of the iliad in the trojan island of tenedos there too was tennes honoured as the greek text omitted of the island now his father was called cycnus the swan in an ofttold and romantic legend11 the swan therefore as father to the chief hero on the apolline island stands in distinct relation to the god who is made to come forward still more prominently from the fact that apollo himself is also called father of tennes i think we can scarcely fail to recognise a mythus which was local at tenedos the fact too of calling the swan instead of apollo the father of a hero demands altogether a simplicity and boldness of fancy which are far more ancient than the poems of homer   1 op cit i 34  2 scholiast on iliad xix 119  3 aelian h a xii 5 strabo xiii 604 compare apollo and the mouse custom and myth pp 103120  4 lucian de dea syria  5 aelian h a xii 40  6

would probably have recognised in cycnus a survival from totemism the fancy survives again in virgils cupavo with swans plumes rising from his crest the mark of his fathers form1 descent was claimed not only from a swan apollo but from a dog apollo   1 aeneid x 187   in connection with the same set of ideas it is pointed out that several greek text omitted or stocks had eponymous heroes in whose names the names of the ancestral beast apparently survived in attica the crioeis have their hero crio ram the butadae have butas bullman the aegidae have aegeus goat and the cynadae cynus dog lycus according to harpocration s v has his statue in the shape of a wolf in the lyceum the general facts that certain animals might not be sacrificed to certain gods at athens the aegidae introduced athena to whom no goat might be offered on the acropolis while she herself wore the goat skin aegis while on the other hand each deity demanded particular victims explained by the ancients themselves in certain cases to be hostile animals find their natural explanation in totemism1 mr evelyn abbott points out however that the names aegeus aegae aegina and others may be connected with the goat only by an old volksetymologie as on coins of aegina in achaea the real meaning of the words may be different compare greek text omitted the seashore mr j g frazer does not at present regard totemism as proved in the case of greece2   1 some apparent survivals of totemism in ritual will be found in the chapter on greek gods especially zeus dionysus and apollo  2 see his golden bough an alternative explanation of these animals in connection with the corn spirit   as final examples of survivals from the age of barbarism in the religion of greece certain features in the mysteries may be noted plutarch speaks of the eating of raw flesh and tearing to pieces of victims as also fastings and beatings of the breast and again in many places abusive language at the sacrifices and other mad doings the mysteries of demeter as will appear when her legend is criticised contained one element all unlike these mad doings and the evidence of sophocles pindar plutarch and others demonstrate that religious consolations were somehow conveyed in the eleusinia but greece had many other local mysteries and in several of these it is undeniable the greeks acted much as contemporary australians zunis and negroes act in their secret initiations which however also inculcate moral ideas of considerable excellence important as these analogies are they appear to have escaped the notice of most mythologists m alfred maury however in les religions de la grece published in 1857 offers several instances of hidden rites common to hellas and to barbarism  there seem in the mysteries of savage races to be two chief purposes there is the intention of giving to the initiated a certain sacred character which puts them in close relation with gods or demons and there is the introduction of the young to complete or advancing manhood and to full participation in the savage church with its ethical ideas the latter ceremonies correspond in short to confirmation and they are usually of a severe character being meant to test by fasting as plutarch says and by torture as in the familiar spartan rite the courage and constancy of the young braves the greek mysteries best known to us are the thesmophoria and the eleusinia in the former the rites as will appear later partook of the nature of savage medicine or magic and were mainly intended to secure fertility in husbandry and in the family in the eleusinia the purpose was the purification of the initiated secured by ablutions and by standing on the ramsskin of zeus and after purifications the mystae engaged in sacred dances and were permitted to view a miracle play representing the sorrows and consolations of demeter there was a higher element necessarily obscure in nature the chief features in the whole were purifications dancing sacrifice and the representation of the miracle play it would be tedious to offer an exhaustive account of savage rites analogous to these mysteries of hellas let it suffice to display the points where greek found itself in harmony with australian and american and african practice these points are 1 mystic dances 2 the use of a little instrument called turndun in australia whereby a roaring noise is made and the profane are warned off 3 the habit of daubing persons about to be initiated with clay or anything else that is sordid and of washing this off apparently by way of showing that old guilt is removed and a new life entered upon 4 the performances with serpents may be noticed while the mad doings and howlings mentioned by plutarch are familiar to every reader of travels in uncivilised countries 5 ethical instruction is communicated  first as to the mystic dances lucian observes1 you cannot find a single ancient mystery in which there is not dancing this much all men know that most people say of the revealers of the mysteries that they dance them out greek text omitted clemens of alexandria uses the same term when speaking of his own appalling revelations2 so closely connected are mysteries with dancing among savages that when mr orpen asked qing the bushman hunter about some doctrines in which qing was not initiated he said only the initiated men of that dance know these things to dance this or that means to be acquainted with this or that myth which is represented in a dance or ballet daction3 greek text omitted so widely distributed is the practice that acosta in an interesting passage mentions it as familiar to the people of peru before and after the spanish conquest the text is a valuable instance of survival in religion when they were converted to christianity the peruvians detected the analogy between our sacrament and their mysteries and they kept up as much as possible of the old rite in the new ritual just as the mystae of eleusis practised chastity abstaining from certain food and above all from beans before the great pagan sacrament so did the indians to prepare themselves all the people fasted two days during which they did neyther company with their wives nor eate any meate with salt or garlicke nor drink any chic and although the indians now forbeare to sacrifice beasts or other things publikely which cannot be hidden from the spaniardes yet doe they still use many ceremonies that have their beginnings from these feasts and auntient superstitions for at this day do they covertly make their feast of ytu at the daunces of the feast of the sacrament another feast falleth almost at the same time whereas the christians observe the solempnitie of the holy sacrament which doth resemble it in some sort as in dauncing singing and representations4 the holy daunces at seville are under papal disapproval but are to be kept up it is said till the peculiar dresses used in them are worn out acostas indians also had garments which served only for this feast it is superfluous to multiply examples of the dancing which is an invariable feature of savage as of greek mysteries   1 greek text omitted chap xv 277  2 ap euseb praep ev ii 3 6  3 cape monthly magazine july 1874  4 acosta historie of the indies book v chap xxviii london 1604   2 the greek and savage use of the turndun or bribbun of australia in the mysteries is familiar to students this fishshaped flat board of wood is tied to a string and whirled round so as to cause a peculiar muffled roar lobeck quotes from the old scholia on clemens alexandrinus published by bastius in annotations on st gregory the following greek description of the turndun the bullroarer of english country lads the gaelic srannam1 greek text omitted the conus was a little slab of wood tied to a string and whirled round in the mysteries to make a whirring noise as the mystic uses of the turndun in australia new zealand new mexico and zululand have elsewhere been described at some length custom and myth pp 2844 it may be enough to refer the reader to the passage mr taylor has since found the instrument used in religious mysteries in west africa so it has now been tracked almost round the world that an instrument so rude should be employed by greek and australians on mystic occasions is in itself a remarkable coincidence unfortunately lobeck who published the greek description of the turndun aglaophamus 700 was unacquainted with the modern ethnological evidence   1 pronounced strantham for this information i am indebted to my friend mr mallister schoolmaster at st marys loch   3 the custom of plastering the initiated over with clay or filth was common in greek as in barbaric mysteries greek examples may be given first demosthenes accuses aeschines of helping his mother in certain mystic rites aiding her especially by bedaubing the initiate with clay and bran1 harpocration explains the term used greek text omitted thus daubing the clay and bran on the initiate to explain which they say that the titans when they attacked dionysus daubed themselves over with chalk but afterwards for ritual purposes clay was used it may be urged with some force that the mother of aeschines introduced foreign novel and possibly savage rites but sophocles in a fragment of his lost play the captives uses the term in the same ritual sense       greek text omitted   1 de corona 313   the idea clearly was that by cleansing away the filth plastered over the body was symbolised the pure and free condition of the initiate he might now cry in the mystic chant        greek text omitted      worse have i fled better have i found   that this was the significance of the daubing with clay in greek mysteries and the subsequent cleansing seems quite certain we are led straight to this conclusion by similar rites in which the purpose of mystically cleansing was openly put forward thus plutarch in his essay on superstition represents the guilty man who would be purified actually rolling in clay confessing his misdeeds and then sitting at home purified by the cleansing process greek text omitted1 in another rite the cleansing of bloodguiltiness a similar process was practised orestes after killing his mother complains that the eumenides do not cease to persecute him though he has been purified by blood of swine2 apollonius says that the red hand of the murderer was dipped in the blood of swine and then washed3 athenaeus describes a similar unpleasant ceremony4 the blood of whelps was apparently used also men being first

to have been a feature of greek mysteries it meets us everywhere among savages in okeepa that curiously minute account of the mandan mysteries catlin writes that a portion of the frame of the initiate was covered with clay which the operator took from a wooden bowl and with his hand plastered unsparingly over the fifty young men waiting for initiation were naked and entirely covered with clay of various colours7 the custom is mentioned by captain john smith in virginia mr winwood reade found it in africa where as among the mandans and spartans cruel torture and flogging accompanied the initiation of young men8 in australia the evidence for daubing the initiate is very abundant9 in new mexico the zunis stole mr cushings black paint as considering it even better than clay for

representations of the loves of zeus in serpentine form the great savage example is that of the snakedance of the moquis who handle rattlesnakes in the mysteries without being harmed1 the dance is

demeter cidiria in arcadia2   1 the snakedance of the moquis by captain john g bourke london 1884  2 pausanias viii 16   5 this last point of contact between certain greek and certain savage mysteries is highly important the argument of lobeck in his celebrated work aglaophamus is that the mysteries were of no great moment in religion had he known the evidence as to savage initiations he would have been confirmed in his opinion for many of the singular greek rites are clearly survivals from savagery but was there no more truly religious survival pindar is a very ancient witness that things of divine import were revealed happy is he who having seen these things goes under the hollow earth he knows the end of life and the godgiven beginning1 sophocles chimes in as lobeck says declaring that the initiate alone live in hades while other souls endure all evils crinagoras avers that even in life the initiate live secure and in death are the happier isagoras declares that about the end of life and all eternity they have sweet hopes   1 fragm cxvi 128 h p 265   splendida testimonia cries lobeck he tries to minimise the evidence remarking that isocrates promises the very same rewards to all who live justly and righteously but why not if to live justly and righteously was part of the teaching of the mysteries of eleusis ciceros evidence almost a translation of the greek passages already cited lobeck dismisses as purely rhetorical1 lobecks method is rather cavalier pindar and sophocles meant something of great significance   1 de legibus ii 14 aglaophamus pp 6974   now we have acknowledged savage survivals of ugly rites in the greek mysteries but it is only fair to remember that in certain of the few savage mysteries of which we know the secret righteousness of life and a knowledge of good are inculcated this is the case in australia and in central africa where to be uninitiated is equivalent to being selfish1 thus it seems not improbable that consolatory doctrines were expounded in the eleusinia and that this kind of sermon or exhortation was no less a survival from savagery than the daubing with clay and the greek text omitted and other wild rites   1 making of religion pp 193197 235   we have now attempted to establish that in greek law and ritual many savage customs and usages did undeniably survive we have seen that both philosophical and popular opinion in greece believed in a past age of savagery in law in religion in religious art in custom in human sacrifice in relics of totemism and in the mysteries we have seen that the greeks retained plenty of the usages now found among the remotest and most backward races we have urged against the suggestion of borrowing from egypt or asia that these survivals are constantly found in local and tribal religion and rituals and that consequently they probably date from that remote prehistoric past when the greeks lived in village settlements it may still doubtless be urged that all these things are pelasgic and were the customs of a race settled in hellas before the arrival of the homeric achaeans and dorians and argives who on this hypothesis adopted and kept up the old savage pelasgian ways and superstitions it is impossible to prove or disprove this belief nor does it affect our argument we allege that all greek life below the surface was rich in institutions now found among the most barbaric peoples these institutions whether borrowed or inherited would still be part of the legacy left by savages to cultivated peoples as this legacy is so large in custom and ritual it is not unfair to argue that portions of it will also be found in myths it is now time to discuss greek myths of the origin of things and decide whether they are or are not analogous in ideas to the myths which spring from the wild and ignorant fancy of australians cahrocs nootkas and bushmen    chapter x greek cosmogonic myths  nature of the evidencetraditions of origin of the world and

cronus modern and ancientthe orphic cosmogonyphanes and prajapatigreek myths of the origin of mantheir savage analogues   the authorities for greek cosmogonic myth are extremely various in date character and value the most ancient texts are the iliad and the poems attributed to hesiod the iliad whatever its date whatever the place of its composition was intended to please a noble class of warriors the hesiodic poems at least the theogony have clearly a didactic aim and the intention of presenting a systematic and orderly account of the divine genealogies to neither would we willingly attribute a date much later than the ninth century of our era but the question of the dates of all the epic and hesiodic poems and even of their various parts is greatly disputed among scholars yet it is nowhere denied that however late the present form of some of the poems may be they contain ideas of extreme antiquity although the homeric poems are usually considered on the whole more ancient than those attributed to hesiod1 it is a fact worth remembering that the notions of the origin of things in hesiod are much more savage and as we hold much more archaic than the opinions of homer   1 grote assigns his theogony to circ 750 ad the thegony was taught to boys in greece much as the church catechism and bible are taught in england aeschines in ctesiph 135 p 73 libanius 400 years after christ i 502509 iv 874   while hesiod offers a complete theogony or genealogy of deities and heroes homer gives no more than hints and allusions to the stormy past of the gods it is clear however that his conception of that past differed considerably from the traditions of hesiod however we explain it the homeric mythology though itself repugnant to the philosophers from xenophanes downwards is much more mild pure and humane than the mythology either of hesiod or of our other greek authorities some may imagine that homer retains a clearer and less corrupted memory than hesiod possessed of an original and authentic divine tradition others may find in homers comparative purity a proof of the later date of his epics in their present form or may even proclaim that homer was a kind of cervantes who wished to laugh the gods away there is no conceivable or inconceivable theory about homer that has not its advocates for ourselves we hold that the divine genius of homer though working in an age distant rather than early selected instinctively the purer mythical materials and burned away the coarser dross of antique legend leaving little but the gold which is comparatively refined  we must remember that it does not follow that any mythical ideas are later than the age of homer because we first meet them in poems of a later date we have already seen that though the brahmanas are much later in date of compilation than the veda yet a tradition which we first find in the brahmanas may be older than the time at which the veda was compiled in the same way as mr max muller observes we know that certain ideas which we find in later writers do not occur in homer but it does not follow at all that such ideas are all of later growth or possess a secondary character one myth may have belonged to one tribe one god may have had his chief worship in one locality and our becoming acquainted with these through a later poet does not in the least prove their later origin1   1 hibbert lectures pp 130 131   after homer and hesiod our most ancient authorities for greek cosmogonic myths are probably the socalled orphic fragments concerning the dates and the manner of growth of these poems volumes of erudition have been compiled as homer is silent about orpheus in spite of the position which the mythical thracian bard acquired as the inventor of letters and magic and the father of the mysteries it has been usual to regard the orphic ideas as of late introduction we may agree with grote and lobeck that these ideas and the ascetic orphic mode of life first acquired importance in greece about the time of epimenides or roughly speaking between 620 and 500 bc1 that age certainly witnessed a curious growth of superstitious fears and of mystic ceremonies intended to mitigate spiritual terrors greece was becoming more intimately acquainted with egypt and with asia and was comparing her own religion with the beliefs and rites of other peoples the times and the minds of men were being prepared for the clear philosophies that soon on argive heights divinely sang just as when the old world was about to accept christianity a deluge of oriental and barbaric superstitions swept across mens minds so immediately before the dawn of greek philosophy there came an irruption of mysticism and of spiritual fears we may suppose that the orphic poems were collected edited and probably interpolated in this dark hour of greece to me says lobeck it appears that the verses may be referred to the age of onomacritus an age curious in the writings of ancient poets and attracted by the allurements of mystic religions the style of the surviving fragments is sufficiently pure and epic the strange unheard of myths are unlike those which the alexandrian poets drew from fountains long lost2 but how much in the orphic myths is imported from asia or egypt how much is the invention of literary forgers like onomacritus how much should be regarded as the first guesses of the physical poetphilosophers and how much is truly ancient popular legend recast in literary form it is impossible with certainty to determine   1 lobeck aglaophamus i 317 grote iii 86  2 aglaophamus i 611   we must not regard a myth as necessarily late or necessarily foreign because we first meet it in an orphic composition if the myth be one of the sort which encounter us in every quarter nay in every obscure nook of the globe we may plausibly regard it as ancient if it bear the distinct marks of being a neoplatonic pastiche we may reject it without hesitation on the whole however our orphic authorities can never be quoted with much satisfaction the later sources of evidence for greek myths are not of great use to the student of cosmogonic legend though invaluable when we come to treat of the established dynasty of gods the heroes and the cultureheroes for these the authorities are the whole range of greek literature poets dramatists philosophers critics historians and travellers we have also the notes and comments of the scholiasts or commentators on the poets and dramatists sometimes these annotators only darken counsel by their guesses sometimes perhaps especially in the scholia on the iliad and odyssey they furnish us with a precious myth or popular marchen not otherwise recorded the regular professional mythographi again of whom apollodorus 150 bc is the type compiled manuals explanatory of the myths which were alluded to by the poets the scholiasts and mythographi often retain myths from lost poems and lost plays finally from the travellers and historians we occasionally glean examples of the tales holy chapters as mr grote calls them which were narrated by priests and temple officials to the pilgrims who visited the sacred shrines  these chapters are almost invariably puerile savage and obscene they bear the stamp of extreme antiquity because they never as a rule passed through the purifying medium of literature there were many myths too crude and archaic for the purposes of poetry and of the drama these were handed down from local priest to local priest with the inviolability of sacred and immutable tradition we have already given a reason for assigning a high antiquity to the local temple myths just as greeks lived in villages before they gathered into towns so their gods were gods of villages or tribes before they were national deities the local myths are those of the archaic village state of culture more ancient more savage than literary narrative very frequently the local legends were subjected to the process of allegorical interpretation as men became alive to the monstrosity of their unsophisticated meaning often they proved too savage for our authorities who merely remark concerning this a certain holy chapter is told but decline to record the legend in the same way missionaries with mistaken delicacy often refuse to repeat some savage legend with which they are acquainted  the latest sort of testimony as to greek myths must be sought in the writings of the heathen apologists or learned pagan defenders of paganism in the first centuries during christianity and in the works of their opponents the fathers of the church though the fathers certainly do not understate the abominations of paganism and though the heathen apologists make free use of allegorical and impossible interpretations the evidence of both is often useful and important the testimony of ancient art vases statues pictures and the descriptions of these where they no longer survive are also of service and interest  after this brief examination of the sources of our knowledge of greek myth we may approach the homeric legends of the origin of things and the worlds beginning in homer these matters are only referred to incidentally he more than once calls oceanus that is the fabled stream which flows all round the world here regarded as a person the origin of the gods the origin of all things1 that ocean is considered a person and that he is not an allegory for water or the aqueous element appears from the speech of hera to aphrodite i am going to visit the limits of the bountiful earth and oceanus father of the gods and mother tethys who reared me duly and nurtured me in their halls when farseeing zeus imprisoned cronus beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea2 homer does not appear to know uranus as the father of cronus and thus the myth of the mutilation of uranus necessarily does not occur in homer cronus the head of the dynasty which preceded that of zeus is described3 as the son of rhea but nothing is said of his father the passage contains the account which poseidon himself chose to give of the war in heaven three brethren are we and sons of cronus whom rhea barezeus and myself and hades is the third the ruler of the folk in the underworld and in three lots were all things divided and each drew a domain of his own here zeus is the eldest son of cronus though lots are drawn at hazard for the property of the father which we know to have been customary in homers time yet throughout the iliad zeus constantly claims the respect and obedience due to him by right of primogeniture4 we shall see that hesiod adopts exactly the opposite view zeus is the youngest child of cronus his supremacy is an example of jungsten recht the widespread custom which makes the youngest child the heir in chief5 but how did the sons of cronus come to have his property in their hands to divide by right of successful rebellion when zeus imprisoned cronus beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea with cronus in his imprisonment are the titans that is all that homer cares to tell about the absolute beginning of things and the first dynasty of rulers of olympus his interest is all in the actual reigning family that of the cronidae nor is he fond of reporting their youthful excesses   1 iliad xiv 201 302 246  2 in reading what homer and hesiod report about these matters we must remember that all the forces and phenomena are conceived of by them as persons in this regard the archaic and savage view of all things as personal and human is preserved i maintain says grote moreover fully the character of these great divine agents as persons which is the light in which they presented themselves to the homeric or hesiodic audience uranus nyx hypnos and oneiros heaven night sleep and dream are persons just as much as zeus or apollo to resolve them into mere allegories is unsafe and unprofitable we then depart from the point of view of the original hearers without acquiring any consistent or philosophical point of view of our own this holds good though portions of the hesiodic genealogies are distinctly poetic allegories cast in the mould or the ancient personal theory of things  3 iliad xv 187  4 the custom by which sons drew lots for equal shares of their dead fathers property is described in odyssey xiv 199212 here odysseus giving a false account of himself says that he was a cretan a bastard and that his halfbrothers born in wedlock drew lots for their fathers inheritance and did not admit him to the drawing but gave him a small portion apart  5 see elton origins of english history pp 185207   we now turn from homers incidental allusions to the ample and systematic narrative of hesiod as mr grote says men habitually took their information respecting their theogonic antiquities from the hesiodic poems hesiod was accepted as an authority both by the pious pausanias in the second century of our erawho protested against any attempt to alter stories about the godsand by moral reformers like plato and xenophanes who were revolted by the ancient legends1 and indeed denied their truth yet though hesiod represents greek orthodoxy we have observed that homer whose epics are probably still more ancient steadily ignores the more barbarous portions of hesiods narrative thus the question arises are the stories of hesiods invention and later than homer or does homers genius halfunconsciously purify materials like those which hesiod presents in the crudest form mr grote says how far these stories are the invention of hesiod himself it is impossible to determine they bring us down to a cast of fancy more coarse and indelicate than the homeric and more nearly resemble some of the holy chapters greek text omitted of the more recent mysteries such for example as the tale of dionysus zagreus there is evidence in the theogony itself that the author was acquainted with local legends current both at krete and at delphi for he mentions both the mountaincave in krete wherein the newlyborn zeus was hidden and the stone near the delphian templethe identical stone which kronos had swallowedplaced by zeus himself as a sign and marvel to mortal men both these monuments which the poet expressly refers to and had probably seen imply a whole train of accessory and explanatory local legends current probably among the priests of krete and delphi   1 timaeeus 41 republic 377   all these circumstances appear to be good evidence of the great antiquity of the legends recorded by hesiod in the first place arguing merely a priori it is extremely improbable that in the brief interval between the date of the comparatively pure and noble mythology of the iliad and the much ruder theogony of hesiod men invented stories like the mutilation of uranus and the swallowing of his offspring by cronus the former legend is almost exactly parallel as has already been shown to the myth of papa and rangi in new zealand the later has its parallels among the savage bushmen and australians it is highly improbable that men in an age so civilised as that of homer invented myths as hideous as those of the lowest savages but if we take these myths to be not new inventions but the sacred stories of local priesthoods their antiquity is probably incalculable the sacred stories as we know from pausanias herodotus and from all the writers who touch on the subject of the mysteries were myths communicated by the priests to the initiated plato speaks of such myths in the republic 378 if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a very few might hear them in a mystery and then let them sacrifice not a common pig but some huge and unprocurable victim this would have the effect of very greatly diminishing the number of the hearers this is an amusing example of a plan for veiling the horrors of myth the pig was the animal usually offered to demeter the goddess of the eleusinian mysteries plato proposes to substitute some unprocurable beast perhaps a giraffe or an elephant  to hesiod then we must turn for what is the earliest complete literary form of the greek cosmogonic myth hesiod begins like the new zealanders with the august race of gods by earth and wide heaven begotten1 so the new zealanders as we have seen say the heaven which is above us and the earth which is beneath us are the progenitors of men and the origin of all things hesiod2 somewhat differs from this view by making chaos absolutely first of all things followed by widebosomed earth tartarus and eros love chaos unaided produced erebus and night the children of night and erebus are aether and day earth produced heaven who then became her own lover and to heaven she bore oceanus and the titans coeeus and crius hyperion and iapetus thea and rhea themis mnemosyne phoebe tethys and youngest after these was born cronus of crooked counsel the most dreadful of her children who ever detested his puissant sire heaven there were other sons of earth and heaven peculiarly hateful to their father3 and these uranus used to hide from the light in a hollow of gaea both they and gaea resented this treatment and the titans like the children of heaven and earth in the new zealand poem sought to discern the difference between light and darkness gaea unlike earth in the new zealand myth for there she is purely passive conspired with her children produced iron and asked her sons to avenge their wrongs4 fear fell upon all of them save cronus who like tane mahuta in the maori poem determined to end the embraces of earth and heaven but while the new zealand like the indoaryan myth5 conceives of earth and heaven as two beings who have never previously been sundered at all hesiod makes heaven amorously approach his spouse from a distance this was the moment for cronus6 who stretched out his hand armed with the sickle of iron and mutilated uranus as in so many savage myths the blood of the wounded god fallen on the ground produced strange creatures nymphs of the ashtree giants and furies as in the maori myth one of the children of heaven stood apart and did not consent to the deed this was oceanus in greece7 and in new zealand it was tawhiri matea the wind who arose and followed his father heaven and remained with him in the open spaces of the sky uranus now predicted8 that there would come a day of vengeance for the evil deed of cronus and so ends the dynasty of uranus   1 theog 45  2 ibid 116  3 ibid 155  4 ibid 166  5 muir v 23 quoting aitareya brahmana iv 27 these two worlds were once joined subsequently they separated  6 theog 175185  7 apollod i 15  8 theog 209   this story was one of the great stumblingblocks of orthodox greece it was the tale that plato said should be told if at all only to a few in a mystery after the sacrifice of some rare and scarcely obtainable animal even among the maoris the conduct of the children who severed their father and mother is regarded as a singular instance of iniquity and is told to children as a moral warning an example to be condemned in greece on the other hand unless we are to take the euthyphro as wholly ironical some of the pious justified their conduct by the example of zeus euthyphro quotes this example when he is about to prosecute his own father for which act he says men are angry with me so inconsistently do they talk when i am concerned and when the gods are concerned1 but in greek the tale has no meaning it has been allegorised in various ways and lafitau fancied that it was a distorted form of the biblical account of the origin of sin in maori the legend is perfectly intelligible heaven and earth were conceived of like everything else as beings with human parts and passions linked in an endless embrace which crushed and darkened their children it became necessary to separate them and this feat was achieved not without pain then wailed the heaven and exclaimed the earth wherefore this murder why this great sin why separate us but what cared tane upwards he sent one and downwards the other he cruelly severed the sinews which united heaven and earth2 the greek myth too contemplated earth and heaven as beings corporeally united and heaven as a malignant power that concealed his children in darkness   1 euthyphro 6  2 taylor new zealand 119   but while the conception of heaven and earth as parents of living things remains perfectly intelligible in one sense the vivid personification which regarded them as creatures with human parts and passions had ceased to be intelligible in greece before the times of the earliest philosophers the old physical conception of the pair became a metaphor and the account of their rending asunder by their children lost all significance and seemed to be an abominable and unintelligible myth when examined in the light of the new zealand story and of the fact that early peoples do regard all phenomena as human beings with physical attributes like those of men the legend of cronus and uranus and gaea ceases to be a mystery it is at bottom a savage explanation as in the samoan story of the separation of earth and heaven an explanation which could only have occurred to people in a state of mind which civilisation has forgotten  the next generation of hesiodic gods if gods we are to call the members of this race of nonnatural men was not more fortunate than the first in its family relations  cronus wedded his sister rhea and begat demeter hera hades poseidon and the youngest zeus and mighty cronus swallowed down each of them each that came to their mothers knees from her holy womb with this intent that none other of the proud sons of heaven should hold his kingly sway among the immortals heaven and earth had warned him that he too should fall through his children wherefore he kept no vain watch but spied and swallowed down each of his offspring while grief immitigable took possession of rhea1 rhea being about to become the mother of zeus took counsel with uranus and gaea by their advice she went to crete where zeus was born and in place of the child she presented to cronus a huge stone swathed in swaddling bands this he swallowed and was easy in his mind zeus grew up and by some means suggested by gaea compelled zeus to disgorge all his offspring and he vomited out the stone first as he had swallowed it last2 the swallowed children emerged alive and zeus fixed the stone at pytho delphi where pausanias3 had the privilege of seeing it and where as it did not tempt the cupidity of barbarous invaders it probably still exists it was not a large stone pausanias says and the delphians used to pour oil over it as jacob did4 to the stone at bethel and on feastdays they covered it with wraps of wool the custom of smearing fetishstones which theophrastus mentions as one of the practices of the superstitious man is clearly a survival from the savage stage of religion as a rule however among savages fetishstones are daubed with red paint like the face of the wooden ancient dionysi in greece and of tsui goab among the hottentots not smeared with oil5   1 theog 460 465  2 theog 498  3 x 245  4 gen xxviii 18  5 pausanias ii 2 5 churinga in australia are greased

children by cronus was another of the stumblingblocks of greek orthodoxy the common explanation that time greek text omitted does swallow his children the days is not quite satisfactory time brings never the past back again as cronus did besides the myth of the swallowing is not confined to cronus modern philology has given as usual different analyses of the meaning of the name of the god hermann with preller derives it from greek text omitted to fulfil the harvestmonth says preller was named cronion in greece and cronia was the title of the harvestfestival the sickle of cronus is thus brought into connection with the sickle of the harvester1   1 preller gr myth i 44 hartung ii 48 porphyry abst ii 54 welcker will not hear of this etymology gr gott i 145 note 9   the second myth in which cronus swallows his children has numerous parallels in savage legend bushmen tell of kwai hemm the devourer who swallows that great god the mantis insect and disgorges him alive with all the other persons and animals whom he has engulphed in the course of a long and voracious career1 the moon in australia while he lived on earth was very greedy and swallowed the eaglegod whom he had to disgorge mr im thurn found similar tales among the indians of guiana the swallowing and disgorging of heracles by the monster that was to slay hesione is well known scotch peasants tell of the same feats but localise the myth on the banks of the ken in galloway basutos eskimos zulus and european fairy tales all possess this incident the swallowing of many persons by a being from whose maw they return alive and in good case   1 bleek bushman folklore pp 6 8   a mythical conception which prevails from greenland to south africa from delphi to the solomon islands from brittany to the shores of lake superior must have some foundation in the common elements of human nature1 now it seems highly probable that this curious idea may have been originally invented in an attempt to explain natural phenomena by a naturemyth it has already been shown chapter v that eclipses are interpreted even by the peasantry of advanced races as the swallowing of the moon by a beast or a monster the piutes account for the disappearance of the stars in the daytime by the hypothesis that the sun swallows his children in the melanesian myth dawn is cut out of the body of night by qat armed with a knife of red obsidian here are examples2 of transparent naturemyths in which this idea occurs for obvious explanatory purposes and in accordance with the laws of the savage imagination thus the conception of the swallowing and disgorging being may very well have arisen out of a naturemyth but why is the notion attached to the legend of cronus   1 the myth of cronus and the swallowed children and the stone is transferred to gargantua see sebillot gargantua dans les traditions populaires but it is impossible to be certain that this is not an example of direct borrowing by madame de cerny in her saint suliac p 69  2 compare tylor prim cult i 338   that is precisely the question about which mythologists differ as has been shown and perhaps it is better to offer no explanation however stories ariseand this story probably arose from a naturemythit is certain that they wander about the world that they change masters and thus a legend which is told of a princess with an impossible name in zululand is told of the mother of charlemagne in france the tale of the swallowing may have been attributed to cronus as a great truculent deity though it has no particular elemental signification in connection with his legend  this peculiarly savage trick of swallowing each other became an inherited habit in the family of cronus when zeus reached years of discretion he married metis and this lady according to the scholiast on hesiod had the power of transforming herself into any shape she pleased when she was about to be a mother zeus induced her to assume the shape of a fly and instantly swallowed her1 in behaving thus zeus acted on the advice of uranus and gaea it was feared that metis would produce a child more powerful than his father zeus avoided this peril by swallowing his wife and himself gave birth to athene the notion of swallowing a hostile person who has been changed by magic into a conveniently small bulk is very common it occurs in the story of taliesin2 caridwen in the shape of a hen swallows gwion bach in the form of a grain of wheat in the same manner the princess in the arabian nights swallowed the geni here then we have in the hesiodic myth an old marchen pressed into the service of the higher mythology the apprehension which zeus like herod and king arthur always felt lest an unborn child should overthrow him was also familiar to indra but instead of swallowing the mother and concealing her in his own body like zeus indra entered the mothers body and himself was born instead of the dreaded child3 a cow on this occasion was born along with indra this adventure of the greek text omitted or swallowing of metis was explained by the late platonists as a platonic allegory probably the people who originated the tale were not platonists any more than pandarus was all aristotelian   1 hesiod theogonia 886 see scholiast and note in aglaophamus i 613 compare puss in boots and the ogre  2 mabinogion p 473  3 black yajur veda quoted by sayana   after homer and hesiod the oldest literary authorities for greek cosmogonic myths are the poems attributed to orpheus about their probable date as has been said little is known they have reached us only in fragments but seem to contain the first guesses of a philosophy not yet disengaged from mythical conditions the poet preserves indeed some extremely rude touches of early imagination while at the same time one of the noblest and boldest expressions of pantheistic thought is attributed to him from the same source are drawn ideas as pure as those of the philosophical vedic hymn1 and as wild as those of the vedic purusha sukta or legend of the fashioning of the world out of the mangled limbs of purusha the authors of the orphic cosmogony appear to have begun with some remarks on time greek text omitted time was when as yet this world was not2 time regarded in the mythical fashion as a person generated chaos and aether the orphic poet styles chaos greek text omitted the monstrous gulph or gap this term curiously reminds one of ginnungagap in the scandinavian cosmogonic legends ginnungagap was light as windless air and therein the blast of heat met the cold rime whence ymir was generated the purusha of northern fable3 these ideas correspond well with the orphic conception of primitive space4   1 rigveda x 90  2 lobeck aglaophamus i 470 see also the quotations from proclus  3 gylfis mocking  4 aglaophamus p 473   in process of time chaos produced an egg shining and silver white it is absurd to inquire according to lobeck whether the poet borrowed this widely spread notion of a cosmic egg from phoenicia babylon egypt where the goosegod seb laid the egg or whether the orphic singer originated so obvious an idea quaerere ludicrum est the conception may have been borrowed but manifestly it is one of the earliest hypotheses that occur to the rude imagination we have now three primitive generations time chaos the egg and in the fourth generation the egg gave birth to phanes the great hero of the orphic cosmogony1 the earliest and rudest thinkers were puzzled as many savage cosmogonic myths have demonstrated to account for the origin of life the myths frequently hit on the theory of a hermaphroditic being both male and female who produces another being out of himself prajapati in the indian stories and hrimthursar in scandinavian legendone of his feet got a son on the otherwith lox in the algonquin tale are examples of these doublesexed personages in the orphic poem phanes is both male and female this phanes held within him the seed of all the gods2 and his name is confused with the names of metis and ericapaeus in a kind of trinity all this part of the orphic doctrine is greatly obscured by the allegorical and theosophistic interpretations of the late platonists long after our era who as usual insisted on finding their own trinitarian ideas commenta frigidissima concealed under the mythical narrative3   1 clemens alexan p 672  2 damascius ap lobeck i 481  3 aglaoph i 483   another description by hieronymus of the first being the orphic phanes as a serpent with bulls and lions heads with a human face in the middle and wings on the shoulders is sufficiently rude and senseless but these physical attributes could easily be explained away as types of anything the platonist pleased1 the orphic phanes too was almost as manyheaded as a giant in a fairy tale or as purusha in the rigveda he had a rams head a bulls head a snakes head and a lions head and glanced around with four eyes presumably human2 this remarkable being was also provided with golden wings the nature of the physical arrangements by which phanes became capable of originating life in the world is described in a style so savage and crude that the reader must be referred to suidas for the original text3 the tale is worthy of the swiftlike fancy of the australian narrinyeri   1 damascius 381 ap lobeck i 484  2 hermias in phaedr ap lobeck i 493  3 suidas s v phanes   nothing can be easier or more delusive than to explain all this wild part of the orphic cosmogony as an allegorical veil of any modern ideas we choose to select but why the allegory should closely imitate the rough guesses of uncivilised peoples ahts diggers zunis cahrocs it is less easy to explain we can readily imagine african or american tribes who were accustomed to revere bulls rams snakes and so forth ascribing the heads of all their various animal patrons to the deity of their confederation we can easily see how such races as practise the savage rites of puberty should attribute to the first being the special organs of phanes but on the neoplatonic hypothesis that orpheus was a seer of neoplatonic opinions we do not see why he should have veiled his ideas under so savage an allegory this part of the orphic speculation is left in judicious silence by some modern commentators such as m darmesteter in les cosmogonies aryennes1 indeed if we choose to regard apollonius rhodius an alexandrine poet writing in a highly civilised age as the representative of orphicism it is easy to mask and pass by the more stern and characteristic fortresses of the orphic divine the theriomorphic phanes is a much less aryan and agreeable object than the glorious goldenwinged eros the lovegod of apollonius rhodius and aristophanes2   1 essais orientaux p 166  2 argonautica 112 aves 693   on the whole the orphic fragments appear to contain survivals of savage myths of the origin of things blended with purer speculations the savage ideas are finally explained by late philosophers as allegorical veils and vestments of philosophy but the interpretation is arbitrary and varies with the taste and fancy of each interpreter meanwhile the coincidence of the wilder elements with the speculations native to races in the lowest grades of civilisation is undeniable this opinion is confirmed by the greek myths of the origin of man these too coincide with the various absurd conjectures of savages  in studying the various greek local legends of the origin of man we encounter the difficulty of separating them from the myths of heroes which it will be more convenient to treat separately this difficulty we have already met in our treatment of savage traditions of the beginnings of the race thus we saw that among the melanesians qat and among the ahts quawteaht were heroic persons who made men and most other things but it was desirable to keep their performances of this sort separate from their other feats their introduction of fire for example and of various arts in the same way it will be well in reviewing greek legends to keep prometheus share in the making of men apart from the other stories of his exploits as a benefactor of the men whom he made in hesiod prometheus is the son of the titan iapetus and perhaps his chief exploit is to play upon zeus a trick of which we find the parallel in various savage myths it seems however from ovid1 and other texts that hesiod somewhere spoke of prometheus as having made men out of clay like pundjel in the australian qat in the melanesian and tiki in the maori myths the same story is preserved in serviuss commentary on virgil2 a different legend is preserved in the etymologicum magnum voc ikonion according to this story after the deluge of deucalion zeus bade prometheus and athene make images of men out of clay and the winds blew into them the breath of life in confirmation of this legend pausanias was shown in phocis certain stones of the colour of clay and smelling very like human flesh and these according to the phocians were the remains of the clay from which the whole human race was fashioned by prometheus3   1 ovid metam i 82  2 eclogue vi 42  3 pausanias x 4 3   aristophanes too in the birds 686 talks of men as greek text omitted figures kneaded of clay thus there are sufficient traces in greek tradition of the savage myth that man was made of clay by some superior being like pundjel in the quaint australian story  we saw that among various rude races other theories of the origin of man were current men were thought to have come out of a hole in the ground or a bed of reeds and sometimes the very scene of their first appearance was still known and pointed out to the curious this myth was current among races who regarded themselves as the only people whose origin needed explanation other stories represented man as the fruit of a tree or the child of a rock or stone or as the descendant of one of the lower animals examples of these opinions in greek legend are now to be given in the first place we have a fragment of pindar in which the poet enumerates several of the centres from which different greek tribes believed men to have sprung hard it is to find out whether alalkomeneus first of men arose on the marsh of cephissus or whether the curetes of ida first a stock divine arose or if it was the phrygian corybantes that the sun earliest sawmen like trees walking and pindar mentions egyptian and libyan legends of the same description1 the thebans and the arcadians held themselves to be earthborn the black earth bore pelasgus on the high wooded hills says an ancient line of asius the dryopians were an example of a race of men born from ashtrees the myth of gens virum truncis et duro robore nata born of treetrunk and the heart of oak had passed into a proverb even in homers time2 lucian mentions3 the athenian myth that men grew like cabbages out of the earth as to greek myths of the descent of families from animals these will be examined in the discussion of the legend of zeus   1 preller aus auf p 158  2 virgil aen viii 315 odyssey xix 163 iliad ii xxii 120 juvenal vi 11 cf also bouche leclerq de origine generis humani  3 philops iii

spiritssuggestion that savage religion is borrowed from europeansreply to mr tylors arguments on this headthe morality of savages   the question of the origin of a belief in deity does not come within the scope of a strictly historical inquiry no man can watch the idea of god in the making or in the beginning we are acquainted with no race whose beginning does not lie far back in the unpenetrated past even on the hypothesis that the natives of australia for example were discovered in a state of culture more backward than that of other known races yet the institutions and ideas of the australians must have required for their development an incalculable series of centuries the notions of man about the deity mans religious sentiments and his mythical narratives must be taken as we find them there have been and are many theories as to the origin of the conception of a supernatural being or beings concerned with the fortunes of mankind and once active in the making of the earth and its inhabitants there is the hypothesis of an original divine tradition darkened by the smoke of foolish mortal fancies there is the hypothesis of an innate and intuitive sensus numinis there is the opinion that the notion of deity was introduced to man by the very nature of his knowledge and perceptions which compel him in all things to recognise a finite and an infinite there is the hypothesis that gods were originally ghosts the magnified shapes of ancestral spectres there is the doctrine that man seeking in his early speculations for the causes of things and conscious of his own powers as an active cause projected his own shadow on the mists of the unknown and peopled the void with figures of magnified nonnatural men his own parents and protectors and the makers of many of the things in the world  since the actual truth cannot be determined by observation and experiment the question as to the first germs of the divine conception must here be left unanswered but it is possible to disengage and examine apart the two chief elements in the earliest as in the latest ideas of godhead among the lowest and most backward as among the most advanced races there coexist the mythical and the religious elements in belief the rational factor or what approves itself to us as the rational factor is visible in religion the irrational is prominent in myth the australian the bushman the solomon islander in hours of danger and necessity yearns after the gods and has present in his heart the idea of a father and friend this is the religious element the same man when he comes to indulge his fancy for fiction will degrade this spiritual friend and father to the level of the beasts and will make him the hero of comic or repulsive adventures this is the mythical or irrational element religion in its moral aspect always traces back to the belief in a power that is benign and works for righteousness myth even in homer or the rigveda perpetually falls back on the old stock of absurd and immoral divine adventures1   1 m knappert here in a note to the dutch translation denies the lowest mythical element to the hebrews as their documents have reached us   it would be rash in the present state of knowledge to pronounce that the germ of the serious homeric sense of the justice and power of the divinity is earlier or later than the germ of the homeric stories of gods disguised as animals or imprisoned by mortals or kicked out of olympus the rational and irrational aspects of mythology and religion may be of coeval antiquity for all that is certainly known or either of them in the dark backward of mortal experience may have preceded the other there is probably no religion nor mythology which does not offer both aspects to the student but it is the part of advancing civilisation to adorn and purify the rational element and to subordinate and supersede the irrational element as far as religious conservatism ritual and priestly dogma will permit  such were the general remarks with which this chapter opened in the original edition of the present work but reading reflection and certain additions to the authors knowledge of facts have made it seem advisable to state more fully and forcibly than before that in his opinion not only the puzzling element of myth but the purer element of a religious belief sanctioning morality is derived by civilised people from a remote past of savagery it is also necessary to draw attention to a singular religious phenomena a break or fault as geologists call it in the religious strata while the most backward savages in certain cases present the conception of a being who sanctions ethics and while that conception recurs at a given stage of civilisation it appears to fade or even to disappear in some conditions of barbarism among some barbaric peoples such as the zulus and the red indians of french canada when first observed as among some polynesians and some tribes of western and central africa little trace of a supreme being is found except a name and that name is even occasionally a matter of ridicule the highest religious conception has been reached and is generally known yet the being conceived of as creative is utterly neglected while ghosts or minor gods are served and adored to this religious phenomenon if correctly observed we must attempt to assign a cause for this purpose it is necessary to state again what may be called the current or popular anthropological theory of the evolution of gods  that theory takes varying shapes in the philosophy of mr herbert spencer we find a pure euhemerism gods are but ghosts of dead men raised to a higher and finally to the highest power in the somewhat analogous but not identical system of mr tylor man first attains to the idea of spirit by reflection on various physical psychological and psychical experiences such as sleep dreams trances shadows hallucinations breath and death and he gradually extends the conception of soul or ghost till all nature is peopled with spirits of these spirits one is finally promoted to supremacy where the conception of a supreme being occurs in the lowest faiths there is said on this theory to be no connection or very little connection between religion and morality to supply a religious sanction of morals is the work of advancing thought1   1 prim cult ii 381 huxleys science and hebrew tradition pp 346372   this current hypothesis is confessedly animistic in mr tylors phrase or in mr spencers terminology it is the ghost theory the human soul says mr tylor has been the model on which all mans ideas of spiritual beings from the tiniest elf to the heavenly creator and ruler of the world the great spirit have been framed1 thus it has been necessary for mr tylor and for mr spencer to discover first an origin of mans idea of his own soul and that supposed origin in psychological physical and psychical experiences is no doubt adequate by reflection on these facts probably the idea of spirit was reached though the psychical experiences enumerated by mr tylor may contain points as yet unexplained by materialism from these sources are derived all really animistic gods all that from the first partake of the nature of hungry ghosts placated by sacrifices of food though in certain cases that hunger may have been transferred we surmise by worshippers to gods not originally animistic   1 prim cult ii 109   in answer to this theory of an animistic or ghostly origin of all gods it must first be observed that all gods are not necessarily it would seem of animistic origin among certain of the lowest savages although they believe in ghosts the animistic conception the spiritual idea is not attached to the relatively supreme being of their faith he is merely a powerful being unborn and not subject to death the purely metaphysical question was he a ghost does not seem always to have been asked consequently there is no logical reason why mans idea of a maker should not be prior to mans idea that there are such things as souls ghosts and spirits therefore the animistic theory is not necessary as material for the godidea we cannot of course prove that the godidea was historically prior to the ghostidea for we know no savages who have a god and yet are ignorant of ghosts but we can show that the idea of god may exist in germ without explicitly involving the idea of spirit thus gods may be prior in evolution to ghosts and therefore the animistic theory of the origin of gods in ghosts need not necessarily be accepted  in the first place the original evolution of a god out of a ghost need not be conceded because in perhaps all known savage theological philosophy the god the maker and master is regarded as a being who existed before death entered the world everywhere practically speaking death is looked on as a comparatively late intruder he came not only after god was active but after men and beasts had populated the world scores of myths accounting for this invasion of death have been collected all over the world1 thus the relatively supreme being or beings of religion are looked on as prior to death therefore not as ghosts they are sometimes expressly distinguished as original gods from other gods who are secondary being souls of chiefs thus all tongan gods are atua but all atua are not original gods2 the word atua according to mr white is atua a was the name given to the author of the universe and signifies am the unlimited in power the conception the leader the beyond all tua means beyond that which is most distant behind all matter and behind every action clearly these conceptions are not more mythical indeed a does not seem to occur in the myths nor are they more involved in ghosts than the unknown absolute of mr herbert spencer yet the word atua denotes gods who are recognised as ghosts of chiefs no less than it denotes the supreme existence3 these ideas are the metaphysical theology of a race considerably above the lowest level they lend no assistance to a theory that a was or was evolved out of a human ghost and he is not found in maori mythology as far as our knowledge goes but among the lowest known savages the australians we read that the creator was a gigantic black once on earth now among the stars this is in gippsland the deities of the fuegians and the blackfoot indians are also beings anthropomorphic unborn and undying like mangarrah the creative being of the larrakeah tribe in australia a very good man called mangarrah lives in the sky he made everything blacks excepted he never dies4 the melanesian vui never were men were something different and were not ghosts it is as a being not as a spirit that the kurnai deity munganngaur our father is described5 in short though europeans often speak of these divine beings of low savages as spirits it does not appear that the natives themselves advance here the metaphysical idea of spirit these gods are just beings anthropomorphic or in myth and fable very often bestial theriomorphic6 it is manifest that a divine being envisaged thus need not have been evolved out of the theory of spirits or ghosts and may even have been prior to the rise of the belief in ghosts   1 see modern mythology myths of origin of death  2 mariner ii 127  3 white ancient history of the maoris vol i p 4

statement   again these powerful or omnipotent divine beings are looked on as guardians of morality punishers of sin rewarders of righteousness both in this world and in a future life in places where ghosts though believed in are not worshipped nor in receipt of sacrifice and where great grandfathers being forgotten ancestral ghosts can scarcely swell into gods this occurs among andamanese fuegians and australians therefore among nonghostworshipping races ghosts cannot have developed into deities who are not even necessarily spirits these gods again do not receive sacrifice and thus lack the note of descent from hungry foodcraving ghosts in australia indeed while ghosts are not known to receive any offerings the recent custom of providing food for itthe dead body of a friendis derided by the intelligent old aborigines as white fellows gammon1   1 dawson australian aborigines p 51 1881   the australians possess no chiefs like vich ian vohr or chingachgook whose ghosts might be said to swell into supreme moral deities headmen they have leaders of various degrees of authority but no vich ian vohr no semisacred representative of the tribe1 nor are the ghosts of the headmen known to receive any particular posthumous attention or worship thus it really seems impossible to show proof that australian gods grew out of australian ghosts a subject to which we shall return   1 howitt organisation of australian tribes pp 101113 transactions of royal society of victoria 1889   some supporters of the current theory therefore fall back on the hypothesis that the australians are sadly degenerate1 chiefs it is argued or kings they once had and the gods are surviving ghosts of these wholly forgotten potentates to this we reply that we know not the very faintest trace of australian degeneration sir john lubbock and mr tylor have correctly argued that the soil of australia has not yet yielded so much as a fragment of native pottery nor any trace of native metal work not a vestige of stone buildings occurs nor of any work beyond the present native level of culture unless we reckon weirs for fishcatching the australian boomerang writes mr tylor has been claimed as derived from some hypothetical high culture whereas the transitionstages through which it is connected with the club are to be observed in its own country while no civilised race possesses the weapon2   1 see prof menzies history of religion pp 16 17 where a singular inconsistency has escaped the author  2 prim cult i 57 67   therefore the australian with his boomerang represents no degeneration but advance on his ancestors who had not yet developed the boomerang out of the club if the excessively complex nature of australian rules of prohibited degrees be appealed to as proof of degeneration from the stage in which they were evolved we reply that civilisation everywhere tends not to complicate but to simplify such rules as it also notoriously simplifies the forms of language  the australian people when discovered were only emerging from palaeolithic culture while the neighbouring tasmanians were frankly palaeolithic1 far from degenerating the australians show advance when they supersede their beast or other totem by an eponymous human hero2 the eponymous hero however changed with each generation so that no one name was fixed as that of tribal father later perhaps to become a tribal god we find several tribes in which the children now follow the fathers class and thus paternal kin takes the place of the usual early savage method of reckoning kinship by the mothers side elsewhere prevalent in australia in one of these tribes dwelling between the glenelg and mount napier headmanship is hereditary but nothing is said of any worship of the ghosts of chiefs all this social improvement denotes advance on the usual australian standard3 of degeneration except when produced recently by european vices and diseases i know no trace in australia their highest religious conceptions therefore are not to be disposed of as survivals of a religion of the ghosts of such chiefs as the australians are not shown ever to have recognised the god idea in australia or among the andamanese must have some other source than the ghosttheory this is all the more obvious because not only are ghosts not worshipped by the australians but also the divine beings who are alleged to form links between the ghost and the moral god are absent there are no departmental gods as of war peace the chase love and so forth sun sky and earth are equally unworshipped there is nothing in religion between a being on one hand with a son or sons and vague mischievous spirits boilyas or mrarts and ghosts who are not worshipped on the other hand the friends of the idea that the god is an ancient evolution from the ghost of such a chief as is not proved to have existed must apparently believe that the intermediate stages in religious evolution departmental gods nature gods and gods of polytheism in general once existed in australia and have all been swept away in a deluge of degeneration that deluge left in religion a moral potently active father and judge now that conception is considerably above the obsolescent belief in an otiose god which is usually found among barbaric races of the type from which the australians are said to have degenerated there is no proof of degeneracy and if degeneration has occurred why has it left just the kind of deity who in the higher barbaric culture is not commonly found clearly this attempt to explain the highest aspect of australian religion by an undemonstrated degeneration is an effort of despair   1 tylor preface to ling roths aborigines of tasmania pp vviii  2 kamilaroi and kurnai p 231  3 kamilaroi and kurnai pp 277 278   while the current theory thus appears to break down over the deities of certain australian tribes and of other low savages to be more particularly described later it is not more successful in dealing with what we have called the fault or break in the religious strata of higher races the nature of that fault may thus be described while the deities of several low savage peoples are religiously regarded as guardians and judges of conduct both in this life and in the next among higher barbarians they are often little or not at all interested in conduct again while among australians and andamanese and fuegians there is hardly a verifiable trace if any trace there be of sacrifice to any divine being among barbarians the gods beneath the very highest are in receipt even of human sacrifice even among barbarians the highest deity is very rarely worshipped with sacrifice through various degrees he is found to lose all claim on worship and even to become a mere name and finally a jest and a mockery meanwhile ancestral ghosts and gods framed on the same lines as ghosts receive sacrifice of food and of human victims once more the high gods of low savages are not localised not confined to any temple or region but the gods of higher barbarians the gods beneath the highest are localised in this way as occasionally even the highest god also is  all this shows that among advancing barbarians the gods if they started from the estate of gods among savages on the lowest level become demoralised limited conditioned relegated to an otiose condition and finally deposed till progressive civilisation as in greece reinstates or invents purer and more philosophic conceptions without being able to abolish popular and priestly myth and ritual  here then is a flaw or break in the strata of religion what was the cause of this flaw we answer the evolution through ghosts of animistic gods who retained the hunger and selfishness of these ancestral spirits whom the lowest savages are not known to worship  the moral divine beings of these lowest races beings when religiously regarded unconditioned in need of no gift that man can give are not to be won by offerings of food and blood of such offerings ghosts and gods modelled on ghosts are notoriously in need strengthened and propitiated by blood and sacrifice not offered to the gods of low savages the animistic deities will become partisans of their adorers and will either pay no regard to the morals of their worshippers or will be easily bribed to forgive sins here then is ethically speaking a flaw in the strata of religion a flaw found in the creeds of ghostworshipping barbarians but not of nonghostworshipping savages a crowd of venal easygoing serviceable deities has now been evolved out of ghosts and animism is on its way to supplant or overlay a rude early form of theism granting the facts we fail to see how they are explained by the current theory which makes the highest god the latest in evolution from a ghost that theory wrecks itself again on the circumstance that whereas the tribal or national highest divine being as latest in evolution ought to be the most potent he is in fact among barbaric races usually the most disregarded a new idea of course is not necessarily a powerful or fashionable idea it may be regarded as a fad or a heresy or a low form of dissent but when universally known to and accepted by a tribe or people then it must be deemed likely to possess great influence but that is not the case and among barbaric tribes the most advanced conception of deity is the least regarded the most obsolete  an excellent instance of the difference between the theory here advocated and that generally held by anthropologists may be found in mr abercrombys valuable work preand protohistoric finns i 150154 the gods and other early ideas says mr abercromby could in no sense be considered as supernatural we shall give examples of gods among the races nearest the beginning whose attributes of power and knowledge can not by us at least be considered other than supernatural the gods in this hypothesis were so human that they could be forced to act in accordance with the wishes of their worshippers and could likewise be punished these ideas to an australian black or an andamanese would seem dangerously blasphemous these older gods resided chiefly in trees wells rivers and animals but many gods of our lowest known savages live beyond the sky mr abercromby supposes the sky god to be of later evolution and to be worshipped after man had exhausted the helpers that seemed nearest at hand in the trees and waters at his very door now the australian black has not a door nor has he gods of any service to him in the trees and waters though sprites may lurk in such places for mischief but in mr abercrombys view some men turned at last to the skygod who in time would gain a large circle of worshippers he would come to be thought omnipotent omniscient the creator this notion says mr abercromby must if this view is correct be of late origin but the view is not correct the farseeing powerful maker beyond the sky is found among the very backward races who have not developed helpers nearer man dwelling round what would be his door if door he was civilised enough to possess such near neighbouring gods of human needs capable of being bullied or propitiated by sacrifice are found in races higher than the lowest who for their easily procurable aid have allowed the maker to sink into an otiose god or a mere name mr abercromby unconsciously proves our case by quoting the example of a samoyede this man knew a skygod num that conception was familiar to him he also knew a familiar spirit on mr abercrombys theory he should have resorted for help to the skygod not to the sprite but he did the reverse he said i cannot approach num he is too far away if i could reach him i should not beseech thee the familiar spirit but should go myself but i cannot for this precise reason people who have developed the belief in accessible affable spirits go to them with a spell to constrain or a gift to bribe and neglect in some cases almost forget their maker but he is worshipped by low savages who do not propitiate ghosts and who have no gods in wells and trees close at hand it seems an obvious inference that the greater god is the earlier evolved  these are among the difficulties of the current anthropological theory there is however a solution by which the weakness of the divine conception its neglected disused aspect among barbaric races might be explained by anthropologists without regarding it as an obsolescent form of a very early idea this solution is therefore in common use it is applied to the deity revealed in the ancient mysteries of the australians and it is employed in american and african instances  the custom is to say that the highest divine being of american or african native peoples has been borrowed from europeans and is especially a savage refraction from the god of missionaries if this can be proved the shadowy practically powerless master of life of certain barbaric peoples will have degenerated from the christian conception because of that conception he will be only a faint unsuccessful refraction he has been introduced by europeans it is argued but is not in harmony with his new environment and so is halfremembered and half forgot  the hypothesis of borrowing admits of only one answer but that answer should be conclusive if we can discover say in north america a single instance in which the supreme being occurs while yet he cannot possibly be accounted for by any traceable or verifiable foreign influence then the burden of proof in other cases falls on the opponent when he urges that other north american supreme beings were borrowed we can reply that our crucial example shows that this need not be the fact to prove that it is the fact in his instances is then his business it is obvious that for information on this subject we must go to the reports of the earliest travellers who knew the red indians well we must try to get at gods behind any known missionary efforts mr tylor offers us the testimony of heriot about 1586 that the natives of virginia believed in many gods also in one chief god who first made other principal gods and then the sun moon and stars as petty gods1 whence could the natives of virginia have borrowed this notion of a creator before 1586 if it is replied in the usual way that they developed him upwards out of sun moon and star gods other principal gods and finally reached the idea of the creator we answer that the idea of the maker is found where these alleged intermediate stages are not found as in australia in virginia then as in victoria a creator may have been evolved in some other way than that of gradual ascent from ghosts and may have been as in australia and elsewhere prior to verifiable ghostworship again in virginia at our first settlement the native priests strenuously resisted the introduction of christianity they were content with their deity ahone the great god who governs all the world and makes the sun to shine creating the moon and stars his companions the good and peaceable god needs not to be sacrificed unto for he intendeth all good unto them this good creator without sacrifice among a settled agricultural barbaric race sacrificing to other gods and ghosts manifestly cannot be borrowed from the newly arrived religion of christianity which his priests according to the observer vigorously resisted ahone had a subordinate deity magisterial in functions looking into all mens actions and punishing the same when evil to this god sacrifices were made and if his name okeus is derived from oki  spirit he was of course an animistic ghostevolved deity anthropological writers by an oversight have dwelt on oki but have not mentioned ahone2 manifestly it is not possible to insist that these virginian high deities were borrowed without saying whence and when they were borrowed by a barbaric race which was at the same time rejecting christian teaching   1 prim cult ii 341  2 history of travaile into virginia by william strachey 1612   mr tylor writes with his habitual perspicacity it is the widespread belief in the great spirit whatever his precise nature and origin that has long and deservedly drawn the attention of european thinkers to the native religions of the north american tribes now while in recent times christian ideas may undeniably have crystallised round the great spirit it has come to be thought that the whole doctrine of the great spirit was borrowed by the savages from missionaries and colonists but this view will not bear examination says mr tylor1   1 prim cult ii pp 339 340 1873 for some reason mr tylor modifies this passage in 1891   mr tylor proceeds to prove this by examples from greenland and the algonkins he instances the massachusett god kiehtan who created the other gods and receives the just into heaven this was recorded in 1622 but the belief says winslow our authority goes back into the unknown past they never saw kiehtan but they hold it a great charge and duty that one age teach another how could a deity thus rooted in a traditional past be borrowed from recent english settlers  in these cases the hypothesis of borrowing breaks down and still more does it break down over the algonkin deity atahocan  father le jeune sj went first among the algonkins a missionary pioneer in 1633 and suffered unspeakable things in his courageous endeavour to win souls in a most recalcitrant flock he writes 1633 as this savage has given me occasion to speak of their god i will remark that it is a great error to think that the savages have no knowledge of any deity i was surprised to hear this in france i do not know their secrets but from the little which i am about to tell it will be seen that they have such knowledge  they say that one exists whom they call atahocan who made the whole speaking of god in a wigwam one day they asked me what is god i told them that it was he who made all things heaven and earth they then began to cry out to each other atahocan atahocan it is atahocan  there could be no better evidence that atahocan was not as is often said borrowed from the jesuits the jesuits had only just arrived  later 1634 le jeune interrogated an old man and a partly europeanised sorcerer they replied that nothing was certain that atahocan was only spoken of as of a thing so remote that assurance was impossible in fact their word nitatohokan means i fable i tell an old story  thus atahocan though at once recognised as identical with the creator of the missionary was so far from being the latest thing in religious evolution that he had passed into a proverb for the ancient and the fabulous this of course is inconsistent with recent borrowing he was neglected for khichikouai spirits which inspire seers and are of some practical use receiving rewards in offerings of grease says le jeune1   1 relations 1633 1634   the obsolescent atahocan seems to have had no moral activity but in america this indolence of god is not universal mr parkman indeed writes in the primitive indians conception of a god the idea of moral good has no part1 but this is definitely contradicted by heriot strachey winslow already cited and by pere le jeune the good attributes of kiehtan and ahone were not borrowed from christianity were matter of indian belief before the english arrived mr parkman writes the moment the indians began to contemplate the object of his faith and sought to clothe it with attributes it became finite and commonly ridiculous it did so as usual in mythology but not in religion there is nothing ridiculous in what is known of ahone and kiehtan if they had a mythology and if we knew the myths doubtless they would be ridiculous enough the savage mind turned from belief and awe into the spinning of yarns instantly yields to humorous fancy as we know mediaeval popular christianity in imagery marchen or tales and art copiously illustrates the same mental phenomenon saints god our lord and the virgin all play ludicrous and immoral parts in christian folktales this is mythology and here is beyond all cavil a late corruption of religion here where we know the history of a creed religion is early and these myths are late other examples of american divine ideas might be given such as the extraordinary hymns in which the zunis address the eternal ahonawilona but as the zuni religion has only been studied in recent years the hymns would be dismissed as borrowed though there is nothing catholic or christian about them we have preferred to select examples where borrowing from christianity is out of the question the current anthropological theory is thus confronted with american examples of ideas of the divine which cannot have been borrowed while if the gods are said to have been evolved out of ghosts we reply that in some cases they receive no sacrifice sacrifice being usually a note of ghostly descent again similar gods as we show exist where ghosts of chiefs are not worshipped and as far as evidence goes never were worshipped because there is no evidence of the existence at any time of such chiefs the american highest gods may then be equally free from the taint of ghostly descent   1 parkman the jesuits in north america p lxxviii   there is another more or less moral north american deity whose evolution is rather questionable pere brebeuf 1636 speaking of the hurons says that they have recourse to heaven in almost all their necessities and i may say that it is in fact god whom they blindly adore for they imagine that there is an oki that is a demon in heaven who regulates the seasons bridles the winds and the waves of the sea and helps them in every need they dread his wrath and appeal to him as witness to the inviolability of their faith when they make a promise or treaty of peace with enemies heaven hear us today is their form of adjuration1   1 relations 1636 pp 106 107   a spiritual being whose home is heaven who rides on the winds whose wrath is dreaded who sanctions the oath is only called a demon by the prejudice of the worthy father who at the same time admits that the savages have a conception of godand that god so conceived is this demon  the debatable question is was the demon or the actual expanse of sky first in evolution that cannot precisely be settled but in the analogous chinese case of china we find heaven tien and shangti the personal ruling deity corresponding to the huron demon shangti the personal deity occurs most in the oldest preconfucian sacred documents and so far appears to be the earlier conception the demon in huron faith may also be earlier than the religious regard paid to his home the sky1 the unborrowed antiquity of a belief in a divine being creative and sometimes moral in north america is thus demonstrated so far i had written when i accidentally fell in with mr tylors essay on the limits of savage religion2 in that essay rather to my surprise mr tylor argues for the borrowing of the great spirit the great manitou from the jesuits now as to the phrase great spirit the jesuits doubtless caused its promulgation and where their teaching penetrated shreds of their doctrine may have adhered to the indian conception of that divine being but mr tylor in his essay does not allude to the early evidence his own for oki atahocan kiehtan and torngursak all undeniably prior to jesuit influence and found where jesuits later did not go as mr tylor offers no reason for disregarding evidence in 1892 which he had republished in a new edition of primitive culture in 1891 it is impossible to argue against him in this place he went on in the essay cited 1892 to contend that the australian god of the kamilaroi of victoria baiame is in name and attributes of missionary introduction happily this hypothesis can be refuted as we show in the following chapter on australian gods   1 see tylor prim cult ii 362 and making of religion p 318 also menzies history of religion pp 108109 and dr legges chinese classics in sacred books of the east vols iii xxvii xxviii  2 journ of anthrop inst vol xxi 1892   it would be easy enough to meet the hypothesis of borrowing in the case of the many african tribes who possess something approaching to a rude monotheistic conception among these are the dinkas of the upper nile with their neighbours whose creed russegger compares to that of modern deists in europe the dinka god dendid is omnipotent but so benevolent that he is not addressed in prayer nor propitiated by sacrifice compare the supreme being of the caribs beneficent otiose unadored1 a similar deity veiled in the instruction of the as yet unpenetrated mysteries exists among the yao of central africa2 of the negro race waitz says even if we do not call them monotheists we may still think of them as standing on the boundary of monotheism despite their innumerable rude superstitions3 the tshi speaking people of the gold coast have their unworshipped nyankupon a now otiose unadored being with a magisterial deputy worshipped with many sacrifices the case is almost an exact parallel to that of ahone and oki in america these were not borrowed and the author has argued at length against major elliss theory of the borrowing from christians of nyankupon4   1 rochefort les isles antilles p 415 tylor

anthropologie ii 167  4 making of religion pp 243250   to conclude this chapter the study of savage and barbaric religions seems to yield the following facts  1 low savages no regular chiefs great beings not in receipt of sacrifice sanctioning morality ghosts are not worshipped though believed in polytheism departmental gods and gods of heaven earth sky and so forth have not been developed or are not found  2 barbaric races aristocratic or monarchic ghosts are worshipped and receive sacrifice polytheistic gods are in renown and receive sacrifice there is usually a supreme maker who is in some cases moral in others otiose in only one or two known cases as in that of the polynesian taaroa is he in receipt of sacrifice  3 barbaric races zulus monarchic with unkulunkulu some algonquins feebly aristocratic with atahocan religion is mainly ancestor worship or vague spirit worship ghosts are propitiated with food there are traces of an original divine being whose name is becoming obsolescent and a matter of jest  4 early civilisations monarchic or aristocratic greece egypt india peru mexico polytheism one god tends to be supreme religiously regarded gods are moral in myth are the reverse gods are in receipt of sacrifice heavenly society is modelled on that of men monarchic or aristocratic philosophic thought tends towards belief in one pure god who may be named zeus in greece  5 the religion of israel probably a revival and purification of the old conception of a moral beneficent creator whose creed had been involved in sacrifice and anthropomorphic myth  in all the stages thus roughly sketched myths of the lowest sort prevail except in the records of the last stage where the documents have been edited by earnest monotheists  if this theory be approximately correct mans earliest religious ideas may very well have consisted in a sense of dependence on a supreme moral being who when attempts were made by savages to describe the modus of his working became involved in the fancies of mythology how this belief in such a being arose we have no evidence to prove we make no hint at a sensus numinis or direct revelation  while offering no hypothesis of the origin of belief in a moral creator we may present a suggestion mr darwin says about early man the same high mental faculties which first led man to believe in unseen spiritual agencies then in fetichism polytheism and ultimately monotheism would infallibly lead him so long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed to various strange superstitions and customs1 now accepting mr darwins theory that early man had high mental faculties the conception of a maker of things does not seem beyond his grasp man himself made plenty of things and could probably conceive of a being who made the world and the objects in it certainly there must be some being who made all these things he must be very good too said an eskimo to a missionary2 the goodness is inferred by the eskimo from his own contentment with the things which are made3   1 darwin descent of man i p 66  2 cranz i 199  3 romans i 19   another example of barbaric man seeking after god may be adduced  what the greenlander said is corroborated by what a kaffir said kaffir religion is mainly animistic ancestral spirits receive food and sacrificethere is but an evanescent tradition of a lord in heaven thus a very respectable kaffir said to m arbrousset your tidings christianity are what i want and i was seeking before i knew you i asked myself sorrowful questions who has touched the stars with his hands who makes the waters flow who can have given earth the wisdom and power to produce corn then i buried my face in my hands  this says sir john lubbock was however an exceptional case as a general rule savages do not set themselves to think out such questions1   1 origin of civilisation p 201   as a common fact if savages never ask the question at all events somehow they have the answer ready made mangarrah or baiame puluga or dendid or ahone or ahonawilona or atahocan or taaroa or tui laga was the maker therefore savages who know that leave the question alone or add mythical accretions but their ancestors must have asked the question like the very respectable kaffir before they answered it  having reached the idea of a creator it was not difficult to add that he was good or beneficent and was deathless  a notion of a good powerful maker not subject to death because necessarily prior to death who only invaded the world late seems easier of attainment than the notion of spirit which ex hypothesi demands much delicate psychological study and hard thought the idea of a good maker once reached becomes perhaps the germ of future theism but as mr darwin says the human mind was infallibly led to various strange superstitions as st paul says in perfect agreement with mr darwin on this point they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened  among other imaginations right or wrong was the belief in spirits with all that followed in the way of instituting sacrifices even of human beings and of dropping morality about which the ghost of a deceased medicineman was not likely to be much interested the supposed nearness to man and the venal and partial character of worshipped gods and ghostgods would inevitably win for them more service and attention than would be paid to a maker remote unbought and impartial hence the conception of such a being would tend to obsolescence as we see that it does and would be most obscured where ghosts were most propitiated as among the zulus later philosophy would attach the spiritual conception to the revived or newly discovered idea of the supreme god  in all this speculation there is nothing mystical no supernatural or supernormal interference is postulated supernormal experiences may have helped to originate or support the belief in spirits that however is another question but this hypothesis of the origin of belief in a good unceasing maker of things is of course confessedly a conjecture for which historical evidence cannot be given in the nature of the case all our attempts to discover origins far behind history must be conjectural their value must be estimated by the extent to which this or that hypothesis colligates the facts now our hypothesis does colligate the facts it shows how belief in a moral supreme being might arise before ghosts were worshipped and it accounts for the flaw in the religious strata for the mythical accretions for the otiose creator in the background of many barbaric religions and for the almost universal absence of sacrifice to the god relatively supreme he was from his earliest conception in no need of gifts from men  on this matter of otiose supreme gods professor menzies writes it is very common to find in savage beliefs a vague faroff god who is at the back of all the others takes little part in the management of things and receives little worship but it is impossible to judge what that being was at an earlier time he may have been a nature god or a spirit who has by degrees grown faint and come to occupy this position  now the position which he occupies is usually if not universally that of the creator he could not arrive at this rank by becoming faint nor could a naturegod be the maker of nature the only way by which we can discover what that being was at an earlier time is to see what he is at an earlier time that is to say what the conception of him is among men in an earlier state of culture among them as we show he is very much more near potent and moral than among races more advanced in social evolution and material culture we can form no opinion as to the nature of such vague faroff gods at the back of all the others till we collect and compare examples and endeavour to ascertain what points they have in common and in what points they differ from each other it then becomes plain that they are least far away and most potent where there is least ghostly and polytheistic competition that is among the most backward races the more animism the less theism is the general rule manifestly the current hypothesisthat all religion is animistic in origindoes not account for these facts and is obliged to fly to an undemonstrated theory of degradation or to an undemonstrated theory of borrowing that our theory is inconsistent with the general doctrine of evolution we cannot admit if we are allowed to agree with mr darwins statement about the high mental faculties which first led man to sympathetic and then to wild beliefs we do not pretend to be more darwinian than mr darwin who compares these miserable and indirect results of our higher faculties to the occasional mistakes of the instincts of the lower animals  the opinion here maintained namely that a germ of pure belief may be detected amidst the confusion of low savage faith and that in a still earlier stage it may have been less overlaid with fable is in direct contradiction to current theories it is also in contradiction with the opinions entertained by myself before i made an independent examination of the evidence like others i was inclined to regard reports of a moral creator who observes conduct and judges it even in the next life as rumours due either to christian influence or to mistake i well know however and could and did discount the sources of error i was on my guard against the twin fallacies of describing all savage religion as devil worship and of expecting to find a primitive divine tradition i was also on my guard against the modern bias derived from the ghosttheory and mr spencers works and i kept an eye on opportunities of borrowing1 i had in fact classified all known idola in the first edition of this work such as the fallacy of leading questions and the chance of deliberate deception i sought the earliest evidence prior to any missionary teaching and the evidence of what the first missionaries found in the way of belief on their arrival i preferred the testimony of the best educated observers and of those most familiar with native languages i sought for evidence in native hymns maori zuni dinka red indian and in native ceremonial and mystery as these sources were least likely to be contaminated   1 making of religion p 187   on the other side i found a vast body of testimony that savages had no religion at all but that testimony en masse was refuted by roskoff and also in places by tylor when three witnesses were brought to swear that they saw the irishman commit a crime he offered to bring a dozen witnesses who did not see him negative evidence of squatters sailors and colonists who did not see any religion among this or that race is not worth much against evidence of trained observers and linguists who did find what the others missed and who found more the more they knew the tribe in question again like others i thought savages incapable of such relatively pure ideas as i now believe some of them to possess but i could not resist the evidence and i abandoned my a priori notions the evidence forcibly attests gradations in the central belief it is found in various shades from relative potency down to a vanishing trace and it is found in significant proportion to the prevalence of animistic ideas being weakest where they are most developed strongest where they are least developed there must be a reason for these phenomena and that reason as it seems to me is the overlaying and supersession of a rudely theistic by an animistic creed that one cause would explain and does colligate all the facts  there remains a point on which misconception proves to be possible it will be shown contrary to the current hypothesis that the religion of the lowest races in its highest form sanctions morality that morality again in certain instances demands unselfishness of course we are not claiming for that doctrine any supernatural origin religion if it sanctions ethics at all will sanction those which the conscience accepts and those ethics in one way or other must have been evolved that the cosmical law is the weakest must go to the wall is generally conceded man however is found trying to reverse the law by equal and friendly dealing at least within what is vaguely called the tribe his religion as in australia will be shown to insist on this unselfishness how did he evolve his ethics  be it little or be it much they get says dampier about the australians in 1688 every one has his part as well the young and tender as the old and feeble who are not able to get abroad as the strong and lusty this conduct reverses the cosmical process and notoriously civilised society christian society does not act on these principles neither do the savages who knock the old and feeble on the head or deliberately leave them to starve act on these principles sanctioned by australian religion but according to mr dawson not carried out in australian practice when old people become infirm it is lawful and customary to kill them1   1 australian aborigines p 62   as to the point of unselfishness evolutionists are apt to account for it by common interest a tribe in which the strongest monopolise what is best will not survive so well as an unselfish tribe in the struggle for existence but precisely the opposite is true aristocracy marks the more successful barbaric races and an aristocratic slaveholding tribe could have swept australia as the zulus swept south africa that aristocracy and acquisition of separate property are steps in advance on communistic savagery all history declares therefore a tribe which in australia developed private property and reduced its neighbours to slavery would have been better fitted to survive than such a tribe as dampier describes  this is so evident that probably or possibly the dampier state of society was not developed in obedience to a recognised tribal interest but in obedience to an affectionate instinct ils sentr aiment les une les autres says brebeuf of the hurons1 i never heard the women complain of being left out of feasts or that the men ate the best portions every one does his business sweetly peaceably without dispute you never see disputes quarrels hatred or reproach among them brebeuf then tells how a young indian stranger in a time of want stole the best part of a moose they did not rage or curse they only bantered him and yet to take our meat was almost to take our lives brebeuf wanted to lecture the lad his indian host bade him hold his peace and the stranger was given hospitality with his wife and children they are very generous and make it a point not to attach themselves to the goods of this world their greatest reproach is that man wants everything he is greedy they support with never a murmur widows orphans and old men yet they kill hopeless or troublesome invalids and their whole conduct to europeans was the reverse of their domestic behaviour   1 relations 1634 p 29   another example of savage unselfish ethics may be found in mr manns account of the andaman islanders a nomad race very low in culture it is a noteworthy trait and one which deserves high commendation that every care and consideration are paid by all classes to the very young the weak the aged and the helpless and these being made special objects of interest and attention invariably fare better in regard to the comforts and necessaries of daily life than any of the otherwise more fortunate members of the community1   1 j a i xii p 93   mr huxley in his celebrated romanes lecture on evolution and morality laid stress on mans contravention of the cosmic law the weakest must go to the wall he did not explain the evolution of mans opposition to this law the ordinary evolutionist hypothesis that the tribe would prosper most whose members were least selfseeking is contradicted by all history the overbearing grabbing aristocratic individualistic unscrupulous races beat the others out of the field mr huxley indeed alleged that the influence of the cosmic process in the evolution of society is the greater the more rudimentary its civilisation social progress means a checking of the cosmic process at every step and the substitution for it of another which may be called the ethical process as civilisation has advanced so has the extent of this interference increased1 but where in europe is the interference so marked as among the andamanese we have still to face the problem of the generosity of low savages   1 ethics of evolution pp 8184   it is conceivable that the higher ethics of low savages rather reflect their emotional instincts than arise from tribal legislation which is supposed to enable a tribe to prosper in the struggle for existence as brebeuf and dampier among others prove savages often set a good example to christians and their ethics are in certain cases as among the andamanese and fuegians and probably among the yao sanctioned by their religion but as mr tylor says the better savage social life seems but in unstable equilibrium liable to be easily upset by a touch of distress temptation or violence1 still religion does its best in certain cases to lend equilibrium though all the world over religion often fails in practice   1 prim cult i 51
