34021311	a phyllis of the sierras   by bret harte     chapter i   where the great highway of the sierras nears the summit and the pines begin to show sterile reaches of rock and waste in their drawnup files there are signs of occasional departures from the main road as if the weary traveller had at times succumbed to the long ascent and turned aside for rest and breath again the tired eyes of many a dusty passenger on the old overland coach have gazed wistfully on those sylvan openings and imagined recesses of primeval shade and virgin wilderness in their dim perspectives had he descended however and followed one of these diverging paths he would have come upon some rude wagon track or logslide leading from a clearing on the slope or the ominous sawmill half hidden in the forest it was slowly decimating the woodland hush might have been broken by the sound of water passing over some unseen dam in the hollow or the hiss of escaping steam and throb of an invisible engine in the covert  such at least was the experience of a young fellow of fiveandtwenty who knapsack on back and stick in hand had turned aside from the highway and entered the woods one pleasant afternoon in july but he was evidently a deliberate pedestrian and not a recent deposit of the proceeding stagecoach and although his stout walkingshoes were covered with dust he had neither the habitual slouch and slovenliness of the tramp nor the hurried fatigue and growing negligence of an involuntary wayfarer his clothes which were strong and serviceable were better fitted for their present usage than the ordinary garments of the californian travellers which were too apt to be either above or below their requirements but perhaps the strangers greatest claim to originality was the absence of any weapon in his equipment he carried neither rifle nor gun in his hand and his narrow leathern belt was empty of either knife or revolver  a halfmile from the main road which seemed to him to have dropped out of sight the moment he had left it he came upon a halfcleared area where the hastilycut stumps of pines of irregular height bore an odd resemblance to the broken columns of some vast and ruined temple a few fallen shafts denuded of their bark and tessellated branches sawn into symmetrical cylinders lay beside the stumps and lent themselves to the illusion but the freshlycut chips so damp that they still clung in layers to each other as they had fallen from the axe and the stumps themselves still wet and viscous from their drained lifeblood were redolent of an odor of youth and freshness  the young man seated himself on one of the logs and deeply inhaled the sharp balsamic fragrancealbeit with a slight cough and a later hurried respiration this and a certain drawn look about his upper lip seemed to indicate in spite of his strength and color some pulmonary weakness he however rose after a moments rest with undiminished energy and cheerfulness readjusted his knapsack and began to lightly pick his way across the fallen timber a few paces on the muffled whir of machinery became more audible with the lazy monotonous command of gee thar from some unseen oxdriver presently the slow deliberatelyswaying heads of a team of oxen emerged from the bushes followed by the clanking chain of the skids of sawn planks which they were ponderously dragging with that ostentatious submissiveness peculiar to their species they had nearly passed him when there was a sudden hitch in the procession from where he stood he could see that a projecting plank had struck a pile of chips and become partly imbedded in it to run to the obstruction and with a few dexterous strokes and the leverage of his stout stick dislodge the plank was the work not only of the moment but of an evidently energetic hand the teamster looked back and merely nodded his appreciation and with a gee up out of that now the skids moved on  much obliged there said a hearty voice as if supplementing the teamsters imperfect acknowledgment  the stranger looked up the voice came from the open sashless shutterless window of a rude buildinga mere shell of boards and beams half hidden in the still leafy covert before him he had completely overlooked it in his approach even as he had ignored the nearer throbbing of the machinery which was so violent as to impart a decided tremor to the slight edifice and to shake the speaker so strongly that he was obliged while speaking to steady himself by the sashless frame of the window at which he stood he had a face of goodnatured and alert intelligence a masters independence and authority of manner in spite of his blue jean overalls and flannel shirt  dont mention it said the stranger smiling with equal but more deliberate goodhumor then seeing that his interlocutor still lingered a hospitable moment in spite of his quick eyes and the jarring impatience of the machinery he added hesitatingly i fancy ive wandered off the track a bit do you know a mr bradleysomewhere here  the strangers hesitation seemed to be more from some habitual conscientiousness of statement than awkwardness the man in the window replied im bradley  ah thank you ive a letter for yousomewhere here it is he produced a note from his breastpocket bradley stooped to a sitting posture in the window pitch it up it was thrown and caught cleverly bradley opened it read it hastily smiled and nodded glanced behind him as if to implore further delay from the impatient machinery leaned perilously from the window and said  look here do you see that silverfir straight ahead  yes  a little to the left theres a trail follow it and skirt along the edge of the canyon until you see my house ask for my wifethats mrs bradleyand give her your letter stop he drew a carpenters pencil from his pocket scrawled two or three words across the open sheet and tossed it back to the stranger see you at tea excuse memr mainwaringwere shorthandedandthe engine but here he disappeared suddenly  without glancing at the note again the stranger quietly replaced it in his pocket and struck out across the fallen trunks towards the silverfir he quickly found the trail indicated by bradley although it was faint and apparently worn by a single pair of feet as a shorter and private cut from some more travelled path it was well for the stranger that he had a keen eye or he would have lost it it was equally fortunate that he had a mountaineering instinct for a sudden profound deepening of the blue mist seen dimly through the leaves before him caused him to slacken his steps the trail bent abruptly to the right a gulf fully two thousand feet deep was at his feet it was the great canyon  at the first glance it seemed so narrow that a rifleshot could have crossed its tranquil depths but a second look at the comparative size of the trees on the opposite mountain convinced him of his error a nearer survey of the abyss also showed him that instead of its walls being perpendicular they were made of successive ledges or terraces to the valley below yet the air was so still and the outlines so clearly cut that they might have been only the reflections of the mountains around him cast upon the placid mirror of a lake the spectacle arrested him as it arrested all men by some occult power beyond the mere attraction of beauty or magnitude even the teamster never passed it without the tribute of a stone or broken twig tossed into its immeasurable profundity  reluctantly leaving the spot the stranger turned with the trail that now began to skirt its edge this was no easy matter as the undergrowth was very thick and the foliage dense to the perilous brink of the precipice he walked on however wondering why bradley had chosen so circuitous and dangerous a route to his house which naturally would be some distance back from the canyon at the end of ten minutes struggling through the brush the trail became vague and to all appearances ended had he arrived the thicket was as dense as before through the interstices of leaf and spray he could see the blue void of the canyon at his side and he even fancied that the foliage ahead of him was more symmetrical and less irregular and was touched here and there with faint bits of color to complete his utter mystification a womans voice very fresh very youthful and by no means unmusical rose apparently from the circumambient air he looked hurriedly to the right and left and even hopelessly into the trees above him  yes said the voice as if renewing a suspended conversation it was too funny for anything there were the two missouri girls from skinners with their auburn hair ringleted my dear like the old books of beautyin white frocks and sashes of an unripe greenish yellow that puckered up your mouth like persimmons one of them was speechless from good behavior and the otherwell the other was so energetic she called out the figures before the fiddler did and shrieked to my visavis to dance up to the entire strangermeaning me if you please  the voice appeared to come from the foliage that overhung the canyon and the stranger even fancied he could detect through the shimmering leafy veil something that moved monotonously to and fro mystified and impatient he made a hurried stride forward his foot struck a wooden step and the next moment the mystery was made clear he had almost stumbled upon the end of a long veranda that projected over the abyss before a low modern dwelling till then invisible nestling on its very brink the symmetricallytrimmed foliage he had noticed were the luxuriant madeira vines that hid the rude pillars of the veranda the moving object was a rockingchair with its back towards the intruder that disclosed only the brown hair above and the white skirts and small slippered feet below of a seated female figure in the mean time a second voice from the interior of the house had replied to the figure in the chair who was evidently the first speaker  it must have been very funny but as long as jim is always bringing somebody over from the mill i dont see how i can go to those places you were lucky my dear to escape from the new division superintendent last night he was insufferable to jim with his talk of his friend the san francisco millionaire and to me with his cheap society airs i do hate a provincial fine gentleman  the situation was becoming embarrassing to the intruder at the apparition of the woman the unaffected and simple directness he had previously shown in his equally abrupt contact with bradley had fled utterly confused by the awkwardness of his arrival and shocked at the idea of overhearing a private conversation he stepped hurriedly on the veranda  well go on said the second voice impatiently well who else was there what did you say i dont hear you whats the matter  the seated figure had risen from her chair and turned a young and pretty face somewhat superciliously towards the stranger as she said in a low tone to her unseen auditor hush there is somebody here  the young man came forward with an awkwardness that was more boyish than rustic his embarrassment was not lessened by the simultaneous entrance from the open door of a second woman apparently as young as and prettier than the first  i trust youll excuse me forforbeing so wretchedly stupid he stammered but i really thought you know thatthati was following the trail totothe front of the house when i stumbled inin here  long before he had finished both women by some simple feminine intuition were relieved and even prepossessed by his voice and manner they smiled graciously the latercomer pointed to the empty chair but with his habit of pertinacious conscientiousness the stranger continued it was regularly stupid wasnt itand i ought to have known better i should have turned back and gone away when i found out what an ass i was likely to be but i wasafraidyou know of alarming you by the noise  wont you sit down said the second lady pleasantly  oh thanks ive a letter hereihe transferred his stick and hat to his left hand as he felt in his breastpocket with his right but the action was so awkward that the stick dropped on the veranda both women made a movement to restore it to its embarrassed owner who however quickly anticipated them pray dont mind it he continued with accelerated breath and heightened color ah heres the letter he produced the note bradley had returned to him its mine in factthat is i brought it to mr bradley he said i was to give it tototomrs bradley he paused glancing embarrassedly from the one to the other  im mrs bradley said the prettiest one with a laugh he handed her the letter it ran as follows  dear bradleyput mr mainwaring through as far as he wants to go or hang him up at the lookout just as he likes the banks behind him and his hats chalked all over the road but he dont care much about being on velvet that aint his styleand youll like him hes somebodys son in england b  mrs bradley glanced simply at the first sentence pray sit down mr mainwaring she said gently or rather let me first introduce my cousinmiss macy  thanks said mainwaring with a bow to miss macy but iiithink he added conscientiously you did not notice that your husband had written something across the paper  mrs bradley smiled and glanced at her husbands indorsementall right wade in its nothing but jims slang she said with a laugh and a slightly heightened color he ought not to have sent you by that short cut its a bother and even dangerous for a stranger if you had come directly to us by the road without making your first call at the mill she added with a touch of coquetry you would have had a pleasanter walk and seen us sooner i suppose however you got off the stage at the mill  i was not on the coach said mainwaring unfastening the strap of his knapsack i walked over from lone pine flat  walked echoed both women in simultaneous astonishment  yes returned mainwaring simply laying aside his burden and taking the proffered seat its a very fine bit of country  why its fifteen miles said mrs bradley glancing horrorstricken at her cousin how dreadful and to think jim could have sent you a horse to lone pine why you must be dead  thanks im all right i rather enjoyed it you know  but said miss macy glancing wonderingly at his knapsack you must want something a changeor some refreshmentafter fifteen miles  pray dont disturb yourself said mainwaring rising hastily but not quickly enough to prevent the young girl from slipping past him into the house whence she rapidly returned with a decanter and glasses  perhaps mr mainwaring would prefer to go into jims room and wash his hands and put on a pair of slippers said mrs bradley with gentle concern  thanks no i really am not tired i sent some luggage yesterday by the coach to the summit hotel he said observing the womens eyes still fixed upon his knapsack i dare say i can get them if i want them ive got a change here he continued lifting the knapsack as if with a sudden sense of its incongruity with its surroundings and depositing it on the end of the veranda  do let it remain where it is said mrs bradley greatly amused and pray sit still and take some refreshment youll make yourself ill after your exertions she added with a charming assumption of matronly solicitude  but im not at all deserving of your sympathy said mainwaring with a laugh im awfully fond of walking and my usual constitutional isnt much under this  perhaps you were stronger than you are now said mrs bradley gazing at him with a frank curiosity that however brought a faint deepening of color to his cheek  i dare say youre right he said suddenly with an apologetic smile i quite forgot that im a sort of an invalid you know travelling for my health im not very strong here he added lightly tapping his chest that now relieved of the bands of his knapsack appeared somewhat thin and hollow in spite of his broad shoulders his voice too had become less clear and distinct  mrs bradley who was still watching him here rose potentially you ought to take more care of yourself she said you should begin by eating this biscuit drinking that glass of whiskey and making yourself more comfortable in jims room until we can get the spare room fixed a little  but i am not to be sent to bedam i asked mainwaring in halfreal halfamused consternation  im not so sure of that said mrs bradley with playful precision but for the present well let you off with a good wash and a nap afterwards in that rockingchair while my cousin and i make some little domestic preparations you see she added with a certain proud humility weve got only one servanta chinaman and there are many things we cant leave to him  the color again rose in mainwarings cheek but he had tact enough to reflect that any protest or hesitation on his part at that moment would only increase the difficulties of his gentle entertainers he allowed himself to be ushered into the house by mrs bradley and shown to her husbands room without perceiving that miss macy had availed herself of his absence to run to the end of the veranda mischievously try to lift the discarded knapsack to her own pretty shoulder but failing heroically stagger with it into the passage and softly deposit it at his door this done she pantingly rejoined her cousin in the kitchen  well said mrs bradley emphatically did you ever walking fifteen miles for pleasureand with such lungs  and that knapsack added louise macy pointing to the mark in her little palm where the strap had imbedded itself in the soft flesh  hes nice though isnt he said mrs bradley tentatively  yes said miss macy he isnt certainly one of those provincial fine gentlemen you object to but did you see his shoes i suppose they make the miles go quickly or seem to measure less by comparison  theyre probably more serviceable than those highheeled things that captain greyson hops about in  but the captain always ridesand rides very wellyou know said louise reflectively there was a moments pause  i suppose jim will tell us all about him said mrs bradley dismissing the subject as she turned her sleeves back over her white arms preparatory to grappling certain culinary difficulties  jim observed miss macy shortly in my opinion knows nothing more than his note says thats like jim  theres nothing more to know really said mrs bradley with a superior air hes undoubtedly the son of some englishman of fortune sent out here for his health  hush  miss macy had heard a step in the passage it halted at last half irresolutely before the open door of the kitchen and the stranger appeared with an embarrassed air  but in his brief absence he seemed to have completely groomed himself and stood there the impersonation of closecropped clean and wholesome english young manhood the two women appreciated it with catlike fastidiousness  i beg your pardon but really youre going to let a fellow do something for you he said just to keep him from looking like a fool i really can do no end of things you know if youll try me ive done some campingout and can cook as well as the next man  the two women made a movement of smiling remonstrance half coquettish and half superior until mrs bradley becoming conscious of her bare arms and the strangers wandering eyes colored faintly and said with more decision  certainly not youd only be in the way besides you need rest more than we do put yourself in the rockingchair in the veranda and go to sleep until mr bradley comes  mainwaring saw that she was serious and withdrew a little ashamed at his familiarity into which his boyishness had betrayed him but he had scarcely seated himself in the rockingchair before miss macy appeared carrying with both hands a large tin basin of unshelled peas  there she said pantingly placing her burden in his lap if you really want to help theres something to do that isnt very fatiguing you may shell these peas  shell themi beg pardon but how he asked with smiling earnestness  how why ill show youlook  she frankly stepped beside him so close that her fullskirted dress half encompassed him and the basin in a delicious confusion and leaning over his lap with her left hand picked up a peacod which with a single movement of her charming little right thumb she broke at the end and stripped the green shallow of its tiny treasures  he watched her with smiling eyes her own looking down on him were very bright and luminous there thats easy enough she said and turned away  butone moment missmiss  macy said louise  where am i to put the shells  oh throw them down theretheres room enough  she was pointing to the canyon below the veranda actually projected over its brink and seemed to hang in mid air above it mainwaring almost mechanically threw his arm out to catch the incautious girl who had stepped heedlessly to its extreme edge  how odd dont you find it rather dangerous here he could not help saying i meanyou might have had a railing that wouldnt intercept the view and yet be safe  its a fancy of mr bradleys returned the young girl carelessly its all like this the house was built on a ledge against the side of the precipice and the road suddenly drops down to it  its tremendously pretty all the same you know said the young man thoughtfully gazing however at the girls rounded chin above him  yes she replied curtly but this isnt working i must go back to jenny you can shell the peas until mr bradley comes home he wont be long  she turned away and reentered the house without knowing why he thought her withdrawal abrupt and he was again feeling his ready color rise with the suspicion of either having been betrayed by the young girls innocent fearlessness into some unpardonable familiarity which she had quietly resented or of feeling an ease and freedom in the company of these two women that were inconsistent with respect and should be restrained  he however began to apply himself to the task given to him with his usual conscientiousness of duty and presently acquired a certain manual dexterity in the operation it was good fun to throw the castoff husks into the mighty unfathomable void before him and watch them linger with suspended gravity in mid air for a momentapparently motionlessuntil they either lost themselves a mere vanishing black spot in the thin ether or slid suddenly at a sharp angle into unknown shadow how deuced odd for him to be sitting here in this fashion it would be something to talk of hereafter and yethe stoppedit was not at all in the line of that characteristic adventure uncivilized novelty and barbarous freedom which for the last month he had sought and experienced it was not at all like his meeting with the grizzly last week while wandering in a lonely canyon not a bit in the line of his chance acquaintance with that notorious ruffian spanish jack or his witnessing with his own eyes that actual lynching affair at angels no nor was it at all characteristic according to his previous ideas of frontier rural seclusionas for instance the pike county cabin of the family where he stayed one night and where the handsome daughter asked him what his christian name was no these two young women were very unlike her they seemed really quite the equals of his family and friends in englandperhaps more attractiveand yet yes it was this very attractiveness that alarmed his inbred social conservatism regarding women with a man it was very different that alert active intelligent husband instinct with the throbbing life of his sawmill creator and worker in one challenged his unqualified trust and admiration  he had become conscious for the last minute or two of thinking rapidly and becoming feverishly excited of breathing with greater difficulty and a renewed tendency to cough the tendency increased until he instinctively put aside the pan from his lap and half rose but even that slight exertion brought on an accession of coughing he put his handkerchief to his lips partly to keep the sound from disturbing the women in the kitchen partly because of a certain significant taste in his mouth which he unpleasantly remembered when he removed the handkerchief it was as he expected spotted with blood he turned quickly and reentered the house softly regaining the bedroom without attracting attention an increasing faintness here obliged him to lie down on the bed until it should pass  everything was quiet he hoped they would not discover his absence from the veranda until he was better it was deucedly awkward that he should have had this attack just nowand after he had made so light of his previous exertions they would think him an effeminate fraud these two bright active women and that alert energetic man a faint color came into his cheek at the idea and an uneasy sense that he had been in some way foolishly imprudent about his health again they might be alarmed at missing him from the veranda perhaps he had better have remained there perhaps he ought to tell them that he had concluded to take their advice and lie down he tried to rise but the deep blue chasm before the window seemed to be swelling up to meet him the bed slowly sinking into its oblivious profundity he knew no more  he came to with the smell and taste of some powerful volatile spirit and the vague vision of mr bradley still standing at the window of the mill and vibrating with the machinery this changed presently to a pleasant lassitude and lazy curiosity as he perceived mr bradley smile and apparently slip from the window of the mill to his bedside youre all right now said bradley cheerfully  he was feeling mainwarings pulse had he really been ill and was bradley a doctor  bradley evidently saw what was passing in his mind dont be alarmed he said gayly im not a doctor but i practise a little medicine and surgery on account of the men at the mill and accidents you know youre all right now youve lost a little blood but in a couple of weeks in this air well have that tubercle healed and youll be as right as a trivet  in a couple of weeks echoed mainwaring in faint astonishment why i leave here tomorrow  youll do nothing of the kind said mrs bradley with smiling peremptoriness suddenly slipping out from behind her husband everything is all perfectly arranged jim has sent off messengers to your friends so that if you cant come to them they can come to you you see you cant help yourself if you will walk fifteen miles with such lungs and then frighten people to death you must abide by the consequences  you see the old lady has fixed you said bradley smiling and shes the master here come mainwaring you can send any other message you like and have who and what you want here but here you must stop for a while  but did i frighten you really stammered mainwaring faintly to mrs bradley  frighten us said mrs bradley well look there  she pointed to the window which commanded a view of the veranda miss macy had dropped into the vacant chair with her little feet stretched out before her her cheeks burning with heat and fire her eyes partly closed her straw hat hanging by a ribbon round her neck her brown hair clinging to her ears and forehead in damp tendrils and an enormous palmleaf fan in each hand violently playing upon this charming picture of exhaustion and abandonment  she came tearing down to the mill barebacked on our halfbroken mustang about half an hour ago to call me to help you explained bradley heaven knows how she managed to do it     chaper ii   the medication of the woods was not overestimated by bradley there was surely some occult healing property in that vast reservoir of balmy and resinous odors over which the lookout beetled and clung and from which at times the pure exhalations of the terraced valley seemed to rise under its remedial influence and a conscientious adherence to the rules of absolute rest and repose laid down for him mainwaring had no return of the hemorrhage the nearest professional medical authority hastily summoned saw no reason for changing or for supplementing bradleys intelligent and simple treatment although astounded that the patient had been under no more radical or systematic cure than travel and exercise the women especially were amazed that mainwaring had taken nothing for it in their habitual experience of an unfettered pillandelixirconsuming democracy in their knowledge of the thousand panaceas that filled the shelves of the general store this singular abstention of their guest seemed to indicate a national peculiarity  his bed was moved beside the low window from which he could not only view the veranda but converse at times with its occupants and even listen to the book which miss macy seated without read aloud to him in the evening bradley would linger by his couch until late beguiling the tedium of his convalescence with characteristic stories and information which he thought might please the invalid for mainwaring who had been early struck with bradleys ready and cultivated intelligence ended by shyly avoiding the discussion of more serious topics partly because bradley impressed him with a suspicion of his own inferiority and partly because mainwaring questioned the taste of bradleys apparent exhibition of his manifest superiority he learned accidentally that this millowner and backwoodsman was a collegebred man but the practical application of that education to the ordinary affairs of life was new to the young englishmans traditions and grated a little harshly on his feelings he would have been quite content if bradley had like himself and fellows he knew undervalued his training and kept his gifts conservatively impractical the knowledge also that his hosts education naturally came from some provincial institution unlike oxford and cambridge may have unconsciously affected his general estimate i say unconsciously for his strict conscientiousness would have rejected any such formal proposition  another trifle annoyed him he could not help noticing also that although bradleys manner and sympathy were confidential and almost brotherly he never made any allusion to mainwarings own family or connections and in fact gave no indication of what he believed was the national curiosity in regard to strangers somewhat embarrassed by this indifference mainwaring made the occasion of writing some letters home an opportunity for laughingly alluding to the fact that he had made his mother and his sisters fully aware of the great debt they owed the household of the lookout  theyll probably all send you a round robin of thanks except perhaps my next brother bob  bradley contented himself with a gesture of general deprecation and did not ask why mainwarings young brother should contemplate his death with satisfaction nevertheless some time afterwards miss macy remarked that it seemed hard that the happiness of one member of a family should depend upon a calamity to another as for instance asked mainwaring who had already forgotten the circumstance why if you had died and your younger brother succeeded to the baronetcy and become sir robert mainwaring responded miss macy with precision this was the first and only allusion to his family and prospective rank on the other hand he hadthrough naive and boyish inquiries which seemed to amuse his entertainersacquired as he believed a full knowledge of the history and antecedents of the bradley household he knew how bradley had brought his young wife and her cousin to california and abandoned a lucrative law practice in san francisco to take possession of this mountain mill and woodland which he had acquired through some professional service  then you are a barrister really said mainwaring gravely  bradley laughed im afraid ive had more practicethough not as lucrative a oneas surgeon or doctor  but youre regularly on the rolls you know youre entered as counsel and all that sort of thing continued mainwaring with great seriousness  well yes replied bradley much amused im afraid i must plead guilty to that  its not a bad sort of thing said mainwaring naively ignoring bradleys amusement ive got a cousin whos gone in for the law got out of the army to do ittoo hes a sharp fellow  then you do allow a man to try many tradesover there said miss macy demurely  yes sometimes said mainwaring graciously but by no means certain that the case was at all analogous  nevertheless as if relieved of certain doubts of the conventional quality of his hosts attainments he now gave himself up to a very hearty and honest admiration of bradley you know its awfully kind of him to talk to a fellow like me who just pulled through and never got any prizes at oxford and dont understand the half of these things he remarked confidentially to mrs bradley he knows more about the things we used to go in for at oxford than lots of our men and hes never been there hes uncommonly clever  jim was always very brilliant returned mrs bradley indifferently and with more than even conventionally polite wifely deprecation i wish he were more practical  practical oh i say mrs bradley why a fellow that can go in among a lot of workmen and tell them just what to doan allround chap that can be independent of his valet his doctor and hisbanker by jovethats practical  i mean said mrs bradley coldly that there are some things that a gentleman ought not to be practical about nor independent of mr bradley would have done better to have used his talents in some more legitimate and established way  mainwaring looked at her in genuine surprise to his inexperienced observation bradleys intelligent energy and above all his originality ought to have been priceless in the eyes of his wifethe american female of his species he felt that slight shock which most loyal or logical men feel when first brought face to face with the easy disloyalty and incomprehensible logic of the feminine affections here was a fellow by jove that any woman ought to be proud of andandhe stopped blankly he wondered if miss macy sympathized with her cousin  howbeit this did not affect the charm of their idyllic life at the lookout the precipice over which they hung was as charming as ever in its poetic illusions of space and depth and color the isolation of their comfortable existence in the tasteful yet audacious habitation the pleasant routine of daily tasks and amusements all tended to make the enforced quiet and inaction of his convalescence a lazy recreation he was really improving more than that he was conscious of a certain satisfaction in this passive observation of novelty that was healthier and perhaps truer than his previous passion for adventure and that febrile desire for change and excitement which he now felt was a part of his disease nor were incident and variety entirely absent from this tranquil experience he was one day astonished at being presented by bradley with copies of the latest english newspapers procured from sacramento and he equally astonished his host after profusely thanking him by only listlessly glancing at their columns he estopped a proposed visit from one of his influential countrymen in the absence of his fair entertainers at their domestic duties he extracted infinite satisfaction from fooyup the chinese servant who was particularly detached for his service from his invalid coign of vantage at the window he was observant of all that passed upon the veranda that alfresco audienceroom of the lookout and he was goodhumoredly conscious that a great many eccentric and peculiar visitors were invariably dragged thither by miss macy and goaded into characteristic exhibition within sight and hearing of her guest with a too evident view under the ostentatious excuse of extending his knowledge of national character or mischievously shocking him  when you are strong enough to stand captain gashweilers opinions of the established church and chinamen said miss macy after one of these revelations ill get jim to bring him here for really he swears so outrageously that even in the broadest interests of international understanding and goodwill neither mrs bradley nor myself could be present  on another occasion she provokingly lingered before his window for a moment with a rifle slung jauntily over her shoulder if you hear a shot or two dont excite yourself and believe were having a lynching case in the woods it will be only me theres some creatureconfess you expected me to say critterhanging round the barn it may be a bear goodby she missed the creaturewhich happened to be really a bearmuch to mainwarings illogical satisfaction i wonder why he reflected with vague uneasiness she doesnt leave all that sort of thing to girls like that towheaded girl at the blacksmiths  it chanced however that this blacksmiths towheaded daughter who it may be incidentally remarked had the additional eccentricities of large black eyes and large white teeth came to the fore in quite another fashion shortly after this mainwaring being able to leave his room and join the family board mrs bradley found it necessary to enlarge her domestic service and arranged with her nearest neighbor the blacksmith to allow his daughter to come to the lookout for a few days to do the chores and assist in the housekeeping as she had on previous occasions the day of her advent bradley entered mainwarings room and closing the door mysteriously fixed his blue eyes kindling with mischief on the young englishman  you are aware my dear boy he began with affected gravity that you are now living in a land of liberty where mere artificial distinctions are not known and where freedom from her mountain heights generally levels all social positions i think you have graciously admitted that fact  i know ive been taking a tremendous lot of freedom with you and yours old man and its a deuced shame interrupted mainwaring with a faint smile  and that nowhere continued bradley with immovable features does equality exist as perfectly as above yonder unfathomable abyss where you have also doubtless observed the american eagle proudly soars and screams defiance  then that was the fellow that kept me awake this morning and made me wonder if i was strong enough to hold a gun again  that wouldnt have settled the matter continued bradley imperturbably the case is simply this miss minty sharpe that blacksmiths daughter has once or twice consented for a slight emolument to assist in our domestic service for a day or two and she comes back again today now under the aegis of that noble bird whom your national instincts tempt you to destroy she has on all previous occasions taken her meals with us at the same table on terms of perfect equality she will naturally expect to do the same now mrs bradley thought it proper therefore to warn you that in case your health was not quite equal to this democratic simplicity you could still dine in your room  it would be great funif miss sharpe wont object to my presence  but it must not be great fun returned bradley more seriously for miss mintys perception of humor is probably as keen as yours and she would be quick to notice it and so far from having any objection to you i am inclined to think that we owe her consent to come to her desire of making your acquaintance  she will find my conduct most exemplary said mainwaring earnestly  let us hope so concluded bradley with unabated gravity and now that you have consented let me add from my own experience that miss mintys lemonpies alone are worthy of any concession  the dinnerhour came mainwaring a little pale and interesting leaning on the arm of bradley crossed the hall and for the first time entered the diningroom of the house where he had lodged for three weeks it was a bright cheerful apartment giving upon the laurels of the rocky hillside and permeated like the rest of the house with the wholesome spice of the valleyan odor that in its pure desiccating property seemed to obliterate all flavor of alien human habitation and even to dominate and etherealize the appetizing smell of the viands before them the bare shining planed boarded walls appeared to resent any decoration that might have savored of dust decay or moisture the four large windows and long open door set in scanty strips of the plainest spotless muslin framed in themselves pictures of woods and rock and sky of limitless depth color and distance that made all other adornment impertinent nature invading the room at every opening had banished art from those neutral walls  its like a picnic with comfort said mainwaring glancing round him with boyish appreciation miss minty was not yet there the chinaman was alone in attendance mainwaring could not help whispering half mischievously to louise you draw the line at chinamen i suppose  we dont but he does answered the young girl he considers us his social inferiors buthush  minty sharpe had just entered the room and was advancing with smiling confidence towards the table mainwaring was a little startled he had seen minty in a holland sunbonnet and turned up skirt crossing the veranda only a moment before in the brief instant between the dishingup of dinner and its actual announcement she had managed to change her dress put on a clean collar cuffs and a large jet brooch and apply some odorous unguent to her rebellious hair her face guiltless of powder or cold cream was still shining with the healthy perspiration of her last labors as she promptly took the vacant chair beside mainwaring  dont mind me folks she said cheerfully resting her plump elbow on the table and addressing the company generally but gazing with frank curiosity into the face of the young man at her side it was a keen jump i tell yer to get out of my old duds inter these and look decent inside o five minutes but i reckon i aint kept yer waitin longleast of all this yer sick stranger but youre looking pearter than you did youre wonderin like ez not where i ever saw ye before she continued laughing well ill tell you last week id kem over yer on a chance of seein jenny bradley and while i was meanderin down the veranda i saw you lyin back in your chair by the window drowned in sleep like a baby lordy i mout hev won a pair o gloves but i reckoned you were loos game and not mine  the slightly constrained laugh which went round the table after miss mintys speech was due quite as much to the faint flush that had accented mainwarings own smile as to the embarrassing remark itself mrs bradley and miss macy exchanged rapid glances bradley who alone retained his composure with a slight flicker of amusement in the corner of his eye and nostril said quickly you see mainwaring how nature stands ready to help your convalescence at every turn if miss minty had only followed up her healing opportunity your cure would have been complete  ye mout hev left some o that pretty talk for him to say said minty taking up her knife and fork with a slight shrug and you neednt call me miss minty either jest because theres kempeny present  i hope you wont look upon me as company minty or i shall be obliged to call you miss too said mainwaring unexpectedly regaining his usual frankness  bradleys face brightened miss minty raised her black eyes from her plate with still broader appreciation  theres nothin mean about that she said showing her white teeth well whats your first name  not as pretty as yours im afraid its frank  no it aint its francis you reckon to be sir francis some day she said gravely you cant play any frank off on me you wouldnt do it on her she added indicating louise with her elbow  a momentous silence followed the particular form that mintys vulgarity had taken had not been anticipated by the two other women they had not unreasonably expected some original audacity or gaucherie from the blacksmiths daughter which might astonish yet amuse their guest and condone for the situation forced upon them but they were not prepared for a playfulness that involved themselves in a ridiculous indiscretion mrs bradleys eyes sought her husbands meaningly louises pretty mouth hardened luckily the cheerful cause of it suddenly jumped up from the table and saying that the stranger was starving insisted upon bringing a dish from the other side and helping him herself plentifully mainwaring rose gallantly to take the dish from her hand a slight scuffle ensued which ended in the young man being forced down in his chair by the pressure of mintys strong plump hand on his shoulder there she said ye kin mind your dinner now and i reckon well give the others a chance to chip into the conversation and at once applied herself to the plate before her  the conversation presently became general with the exception that minty more or less engrossed by professional anxiety in the quality of the dinner and occasional hurried visits to the kitchen briefly answered the few polite remarks which mainwaring felt called upon to address to her nevertheless he was conscious malgre her rallying allusions to miss macy that he felt none of the vague yet half pleasant anxiety with which louise was beginning to inspire him he felt at ease in mintys presence and believed rightly or wrongly that she understood him as well as he understood her and there were certainly points in common between his two hostesses and their humbler though proud dependent the social evolution of mrs bradley and louise macy from some previous minty was neither remote nor complete the selfsufficient independence ease and quiet selfassertion were alike in each the superior position was still too recent and accidental for either to resent or criticise qualities that were common to both at least this was what he thought when not abandoning himself to the gratification of a convalescent appetite to the presence of two pretty women the sympathy of a genial friend the healthy intoxication of the white sunlight that glanced upon the pine walls the views that mirrored themselves in the open windows and the pure atmosphere in which the lookout seemed to swim wandering breezes of balm and spice lightly stirred the flowers on the table and seemed to fan his hair and forehead with softly healing breath looking up in an interval of silence he caught bradleys gray eyes fixed upon him with a subdued light of amusement and affection as of an elder brother regarding a schoolboys boisterous appetite at some feast mainwaring laid down his knife and fork with a laughing color touched equally by bradleys fraternal kindliness and the consciousness of his gastronomical powers  hang it bradley look here i know my appetites disgraceful but what can a fellow do in such air with such viands and such company its like the bees getting drunk on hybla and hymettus you know im not responsible  its the first square meal i believe youve really eaten in six months said bradley gravely i cant understand why your doctor allowed you to run down so dreadfully  i reckon you aint as keerful of yourself you britishers ez us said minty lordy why theres pop invests in more patent medicines in one day than you have in two weeks and hed make two of you mebbe your folks dont look after you enough  im a splendid advertisement of what your care and your medicines have done said mainwaring gratefully to mrs bradley and if you ever want to set up a cure here im ready with a tenpage testimonial  have a care mainwaring said bradley laughing that the ladies dont take you at your word louise and jenny have been doing their best for the last year to get me to accept a flattering offer from a sacramento firm to put up a hotel for tourists on the site of the lookout why i believe that they have already secretly in their hearts concocted a flaming prospectus of unrivalled scenery and healthgiving air and are looking forward to saturday night hops on the piazza  have you really though said mainwaring gazing from the one to the other  we should certainly see more company than we do now and feel a little less out of the world said louise candidly there are no neighbors herei mean the people at the summit are not she added with a slight glance towards minty  and mr bradley would find it more profitablenot to say more suitable to a man of his positionthan this wretched sawmill and timber business said mrs bradley decidedly  mainwaring was astounded was it possible they considered it more dignified for a lawyer to keep a hotel than a sawmill bradley as if answering what was passing in his mind said mischievously im not sure exactly what my position is my dear and im afraid ive declined the hotel on business principles but by the way mainwaring i found a letter at the mill this morning from mr richardson he is about to pay us the distinguished honor of visiting the lookout solely on your account my dear fellow  but i wrote him that i was much better and it wasnt necessary for him to come said mainwaring  he makes an excuse of some law business with me i suppose he considers the mere fact of his taking the trouble to come here all the way from san francisco a sufficient honor to justify any absence of formal invitation said bradley smiling  but hes onlyi mean hes my fathers banker said mainwaring correcting himself andyou dont keep a hotel  not yet returned bradley with a mischievous glance at the two women but the lookout is elastic and i dare say we can manage to put him up  a silence ensued it seemed as if some shadow or momentary darkening of the brilliant atmosphere some film across the mirrorlike expanse of the open windows or misty dimming of their wholesome light had arisen to their elevation mainwaring felt that he was looking forward with unreasoning indignation and uneasiness to this impending interruption of their idyllic life mrs bradley and louise who had become a little more constrained and formal under mintys freedom were less sympathetic even the irrepressible minty appeared absorbed in the responsibilities of the dinner  bradley alone preserved his usual patient goodhumor well take our coffee on the veranda and the ladies will join us by and by mainwaring besides i dont know that i can allow you as an invalid to go entirely through mintys bountiful menu at present you shall have the sweets another time  when they were alone on the veranda he said between the puffs of his black brierwood pipea pet aversion of mrs bradleyi wonder how richardson will accept minty  if i can i think he must returned mainwaring dryly by jove it will be great fun to see him buthe stopped and hesitatedi dont know about the ladies i dont think you know that theyll stand minty again before another stranger  bradley glanced quickly at the young man their eyes met and they both joined in a superior and i fear disloyal smile after a pause bradley as if in a spirit of further confidence took his pipe from his mouth and pointed to the blue abyss before them  look at that profundity mainwaring and think of it ever being bullied and overawed by a long verandaload of gaping patronizing tourists and the idiotic flirting females of their species think of a lot of overdressed creatures flouting those severe outlines and deeptoned distances with frippery and garishness you know how you have been lulled to sleep by that delicious indefinite faroff murmur of the canyon at nightthink of it being broken by a crazy waltz or a monotonous germanby the clatter of waiters and the pop of champagne corks and yet by thunder those women are capable of liking both and finding no discord in them  dancing aint half bad you know said mainwaring conscientiously if a chaps got the wind to do it and all americans especially the women dance better than we do but i say bradley to hear you talk a fellow wouldnt suspect you were as big a vandal as anybody with a beastly howling sawmill in the heart of the primeval forest by jove you quite bowled me over that first day we met when you popped your head out of that delirium tremens shaking mill like the very genius of destructive improvement  but that was fighting nature not patronizing her and its a business that pays that reminds me that i must go back to it said bradley rising and knocking the ashes from his pipe  not after dinner surely said mainwaring in surprise come now thats too much like the bolting yankee of the travellers books  theres a heavy run to get through tonight were working against time returned bradley even while speaking he had vanished within the house returned quicklyhaving replaced his dark suit by jean trousers tucked in heavy boots and a red flannel shirt over his starched white oneand nodding gayly to mainwaring stepped from the lower end of the veranda the beggar actually looks pleased to go said mainwaring to himself in wonderment  oh jim said mrs bradley appearing at the door  yes said bradley faintly from the bushes  mintys ready you might take her home  all right ill wait  i hope i havent frightened miss sharpe away said mainwaring she isnt going surely  only to get some better clothes on account of company im afraid you are giving her a good deal of trouble mr mainwaring said mrs bradley laughing  she wished me to say goodby to you for her as she couldnt come on the veranda in her old shawl and sunbonnet added louise who had joined them what do you really think of her mr mainwaring i call her quite pretty at times dont you  mainwaring knew not what to say he could not understand why they could have any special interest in the girl or care to know what he a perfect stranger thought of her he avoided a direct reply however by playfully wondering how mrs bradley could subject her husband to miss mintys undivided fascinations  oh jim always takes her homeif its in the evening he gets along with these people better than we do returned mrs bradley dryly but she added with a return of her piquant quakerlike coquettishness jim says we are to devote ourselves to you tonightin retaliation i suppose we are to amuse you and not let you get excited and you are to be sent to bed early  it is to be feared that these latter wise precautionsinvaluable for all defenceless and enfeebled humanitywere not carried out and it was late when mainwaring eventually retired with brightened eyes and a somewhat accelerated pulse for the ladies who had quite regained that kindly equanimity which minty had rudely interrupted had also added a delicate and confidential sympathy in their relations with mainwaringas of people who had suffered in commonand he experienced these tender attentions at their hands which any two women are emboldened by each others saving presence to show any single member of our sex indeed he hardly knew if his satisfaction was the more complete when mrs bradley withdrawing for a few moments left him alone on the veranda with louise and the vast omnipotent night  for a while they sat silent in the midst of the profound and measureless calm looking down upon the dim moonlit abyss at their feet they themselves seemed a part of this night that arched above it the halfrisen moon appeared to linger long enough at their side to enwrap and suffuse them with its glory a few bright stars quietly ringed themselves around them and looked wonderingly into the level of their own shining eyes for some vague yearning to humanity seemed to draw this dark and passionless void towards them the vast protecting maternity of nature leant hushed and breathless over the solitude warm currents of air rose occasionally from the valley which one might have believed were sighs from its full and overflowing breast or a grateful coolness swept their cheeks and hair when the tranquil heights around them were moved to slowly respond odors from invisible bay and laurel sometimes filled the air the incense of some rare and remoter cultivated meadow beyond their ken or the strong germinating breath of leagues of wild oats that had yellowed the upland by day in the silence and shadow their voices took upon themselves almost without their volition a faroff confidential murmur with intervals of meaning silencerather as if their thoughts had spoken for themselves and they had stopped wonderingly to listen they talked at first vaguely to this discreet audience of space and darkness and then growing bolder spoke to each other and of themselves invested by the infinite gravity of nature they had no fear of human ridicule to restrain their youthful conceit or the extravagance of their unimportant confessions they talked of their tastes of their habits of their friends and acquaintances they settled some points of doctrine duty and etiquette with the sweet seriousness of youth and its allpowerful convictions the listening vines would have recognized no flirtation or lovemaking in their animated but important confidences yet when mrs bradley reappeared to warn the invalid that it was time to seek his couch they both coughed slightly in the nervous consciousness of some unaccustomed quality in their voices and a sense of interruption far beyond their own or the innocent intruders ken  well said mrs bradley in the sittingroom as mainwarings steps retreated down the passage to his room  well said louise with a slight yawn leaning her pretty shoulders languidly against the doorpost as she shaded her moonlightaccustomed eyes from the vulgar brilliancy of mrs bradleys bedroom candle welloh he talked a great deal about his people as he called them and i talked about us hes very nice you know in some things hes really like a boy  he looks much better  yes but he is far from strong yet  meantime mainwaring had no other confidant of his impressions than his own thoughts mingled with his exaltation which was the more seductive that it had no welldefined foundation for existing and implied no future responsibility was a recurrence of his uneasiness at the impending visit of richardson the next day strangely enough it had increased under the stimulus of the evening just as he was really getting on with the family he felt sure that this visitor would import some foreign element into their familiarity as minty had done it was possible they would not like him now he remembered there was really something ostentatiously british and insular about this richardsonsomething they would likely resent why couldnt this fellow have come lateror even before before what but here he fell asleep and almost instantly slipped from this veranda in the sierras six thousand miles away to an ancient terrace overgrown with moss and tradition that overlooked the sedate glory of an english park here he found himself restricted painfully by his inconsistent nightclothes endeavoring to impress his mother and sisters with the singular virtues and excellences of his american host and hostessesvirtues and excellences that he himself was beginning to feel conscious had become more or less apocryphal in that atmosphere he heard his mothers voice saying severely when you learn francis to respect the opinions and prejudices of your family enough to prevent your appearing before them in this uncivilized aboriginal costume we will listen to what you have to say of the friends whose habits you seem to have adopted and he was frantically indignant that his efforts to convince them that his negligence was a personal oversight and not a californian custom were utterly futile but even then this vision was brushed away by the bewildering sweep of louises pretty skirt across the dreamy picture and her delicate features and softlyfringed eyes remained the last to slip from his fading consciousness  the moon rose higher and higher above the sleeping house and softly breathing canyon there was nothing to mar the idyllic repose of the landscape only the growing light of the last two hours had brought out in the far eastern horizon a dim white peak that gleamed faintly among the stars like a bridal couch spread between the hills fringed with fading nuptial torches no one would have believed that behind that impenetrable shadow to the west in the heart of the forest the throbbing sawmill of james bradley was even at that moment eating its destructive way through the conserved growth of nature and centuries and that the refined proprietor of house and greenwood with the glow of his furnace fires on his red shirt and his alert intelligent eyes was the genie of that devastation and the toiling leader of the shadowy toiling figures around him     chaper iii   amid the beauty of the most uncultivated and untrodden wilderness there are certain localities where the meaner and mere common processes of nature take upon themselves a degrading likeness to the slovenly wasteful and improvident processes of man the unrecorded landslip disintegrating a whole hillside will not only lay bare the delicate framework of strata and deposit to the vulgar eye but hurl into the valley a debris so monstrous and unlovely as to shame even the hideous ruins left by dynamite hydraulic or pick and shovel an overflown and forgotten woodland torrent will leave in some remote hollow a disturbed and ungraceful chaos of inextricable logs branches rock and soil that will rival the unsavory details of some wrecked or abandoned settlement of lesser magnitude and importance there are certain natural dustheaps sinks and cesspools where the elements have collected the castoff broken and frayed disjecta of wood and fieldthe sweepings of the sylvan household it was remarkable that nature so kindly considerate of mere human ruins made no attempt to cover up or disguise these monuments of her own mortality no grass grew over the unsightly landslides no moss or ivy clothed the stripped and bleached skeletons of overthrown branch and tree the dead leaves and withered husks rotted in their open grave uncrossed by vine and creeper even the animals except the lower organizations shunned those haunts of decay and ruin  it was scarcely a hundred yards from one of those dreary receptacles that mr bradley had taken leave of miss minty sharpe the cabin occupied by her father herself and a younger brother stood in fact on the very edge of the little hollow which was partly filled with decayed wood leaves and displacements of the crumbling bank with the coal dust and ashes which mr sharpe had added from his forge that stood a few paces distant at the corner of a crossroad the occupants of the cabin had also contributed to the hollow the refuse of their household in broken boxes earthenware tin cans and castoff clothing and it is not improbable that the site of the cabin was chosen with reference to this convenient disposal of useless and encumbering impedimenta it was true that the locality offered little choice in the way of beauty an outcrop of brown granitea portent of higher altitudesextended a quarter of a mile from the nearest fringe of dwarf laurel and brush in one direction in the other an advanced file of bradleys woods had suffered from some longforgotten fire and still raised its blackened masts and broken stumps over the scorched and arid soil swept of older underbrush and verdure on the other side of the road a dark ravine tangled with briers and haunted at night by owls and wild cats struggled wearily on until blundering at last upon the edge of the great canyon it slipped and lost itself forever in a single furrow of those mighty flanks when bradley had once asked sharpe why he had not built his house in the ravine the blacksmith had replied that until the lord had appointed his time he reckoned to keep his head above ground and the foundations thereof howbeit the ravine or the run as it was locally known was mintys only saturday afternoon resort for recreation or berries it was she had explained powful soothin and solitary  she entered the housea rude square building of unpainted boardscontaining a sittingroom a kitchen and two bedrooms a glance at these rooms which were plainly furnished and whose canvascolored walls were adorned with gorgeous agricultural implement circulars patent medicine calendars with polytinted chromos and cheaplyilluminated scriptural texts showed her that a certain neatness and order had been preserved during her absence and finding the house empty she crossed the barren and blackened intervening space between the back door and her fathers forge and entered the open shed the light was fading from the sky but the glow of the forge lit up the dusty road before it and accented the blackness of the rocky ledge beyond a small curlyheaded boy bearing a singular likeness to a smudged and blackened crayon drawing of minty was mechanically blowing the bellows and obviously intent upon something else while her fathera powerfully built man with a quaintly dissatisfied expression of countenancewas with equal want of interest mechanically hammering at a horseshoe without noticing mintys advent he lazily broke into a querulous drawling chant of some vague religious character       o turren sinner turren      for the lord bids you turnah      o turren sinner turren      why will you die  the musical accent adapted itself to the monotonous fall of the sledgehammer and at every repetition of the word turn he suited the action to the word by turning the horseshoe with the iron in his left hand a slight grunt at the end of every stroke and the simultaneous repetition of turn seemed to offer him amusement and relief minty without speaking crossed the shop and administered a sound box on her brothers ear take that and let me ketch you agen layin low when my backs turned to put on your store pants  the others had fetched away in the laig said the boy opposing a knee and elbow at acute angle to further attack  you jest get and change em said minty  the sudden collapse of the bellows broke in upon the soothing refrain of mr sharpe and caused him to turn also  its minty he said replacing the horseshoe on the coals and setting his powerful arms and the sledge on the anvil with an exaggerated expression of weariness  yes its me said minty and creation knows its time i did come to keep that boy from ruinin us with his airs and conceits  did ye bring over any o that fever mixter  no bradley sez youre loading yerself up with so much o that bitter barkkuinine they call it over therethat youll lift the ruff off your head next he allows ye aint got no ague its jest wind and dyspepsy he sez yers strong ez a hoss  bradley said sharpe laying aside his sledge with an aggrieved manner which was however as complacent as his fatigue and discontent ez one of them natral born finikin skunks ez i despise i reckon he began to give pints to his parents when he was about kneehigh to richelieu there hes on them confidential terms with hisself and the almighty that he reckons he ken run a sawmill and a mans insides at the same time with one hand tied behind him and this finikin is up to his conceit he wanted to tell me that that yer handy brush dump outside our shanty was unhealthy give a man with frills like that his own way and hed be a sprinkling odor cologne and peppermint all over the country  he set your shoulder as well as any doctor said minty  thats bonesettin and a natral gift returned sharpe as triumphantly as his habitual depression would admit it aint conceit and finikin got out o books well he added after a pause wots happened  mintys face slightly changed nothin i kem back to get some things she said shortly moving away  and ye saw him  yees drawled minty carelessly still retreating  bixby was along here about noon he says the stranger was suthin high and mighty in his own country and them frisco millionaires are quite sweet on him where are ye goin  in the house  well look yer minty now that youre here ye might get up a batch o hot biscuit for supper dinner was that promiscous and experimental today along o richelieus natral foolin that i think i could git outside of a little suthin now if only to prop up a kind of innard sinkin that takes me ye ken tell me the news at supper  later however when mr sharpe had quitted his forge for the night and seated at his domestic board was with a dismal presentiment of future indigestion voraciously absorbing his favorite meal of hot saleratus biscuits swimming in butter he had apparently forgotten his curiosity concerning mainwaring and settled himself to a complaining chronicle of the days mishaps natrally havin an extra lot o work on hand and no time for foolin what does that ornery richelieu get up and do this mornin ye know them ridiklus specimens that hes been chippin outer that ledge that the yearth slipped from down the run and litterin up the whole shanty with em well darn my skin if he didnt run a heap of em mixed up with coal unbeknowned to me in the forge to make what he called a fire essay of em natrally i couldnt get a blessed iron hot and didnt know what had gone of the fire or the coal either for two hours till i stopped work and raked out the coal that comes from his hangin round that sawmill in the woods and listenin to bradleys highfalutin talk about rocks and strata and sich  but bradley dont go a cent on minin pop said minty he sez the woods is good enough for him and theres millions to be made when the railroad comes along and timbers wanted  but until then hes got to keep hisself to pay wages and keep the mill runnin onless its ez bixby says that he hopes to get that englishman to rope in some o them frisco friends of his to take a hand ye didnt have any o that kind o talk did ye  no not that kind o talk said minty  not that kind o talk repeated her father with aggrieved curiosity wot kind then  well said minty lifting her black eyes to her fathers i aint no account and you aint no account either you aint got no college education aint got no friends in frisco and aint got no hightoned style i cant play the pianner jabber french nor get french dresses we aint got no fancy shallet as they call it with a firstclass view of nothing but only a shanty on dry rock but afore id take advantage of a lazy gawky boyfor it aint anything else though hes good meanin enoughthat happened to fall sick in my house and coax and cosset him and wrap him in white cotton and mother him and sister him and aunt sukey him and almost drynuss him ginrally jist to get him sweet on me and on mine and take the inside track of othersid be an injin and if youd allow it pop youd be wuss nor a nigger  sho said her father kindling with that intense gratification with which the male receives any intimation of alien feminine weakness it aint that minty i wanter know  its jist that pop and i ez good ez let em know i seed it i aint a fool if some folks do drop their eyes and pertend to wipe the laugh out of their noses with a handkerchief when i let out to speak i maynt be good enough kempany  look yer minty interrupted the blacksmith sternly half rising from his seat with every trace of his former weakness vanished from his hardset face do you mean to say that they put on airs to yeto my darter  no said minty quickly the men didnt and dont you a man mix yourself up with womens meannesses i ken manage em pop with one hand  mr sharpe looked at his daughters flashing black eyes perhaps an uneasy recollection of the late mrs sharpes remarkable capacity in that respect checked his further rage  no wot i was sayin resumed minty ez that i maynt be thought by others good enough to keep kempany with baronetts ez is to bethough baronetts mightnt objectbut i aint mean enough to try to steal away some ole womans darling boy in england or snatch some likely young english girls big brother outer the family without sayin by your leave howd you like it if richelieu was growed up and went to seaand it would be like his peartnessand he fell sick in some foreign land and some princess or other skyulged him underhand away from us  probably owing to the affair of the specimens the elder sharpe did not seem to regard the possible mesalliance of richelieu with extraordinary disfavor that boy is conceited enough with hair ile and fine clothes for anything he said plaintively but didnt that louise macy hev a feller alreadythat captain greyson wots gone o him  thats it said minty he kin go out in the woods and whistle now but all the same she could hitch him in again at any time if the other stranger kicked over the traces thats the style over there at the lookout there aint ez much heart in them two women put together ez would make a green gal flush up playin forfeits its all in their breed pop love aint going to spile their appetites and complexions give em nosebleed nor put a drop o water into their eyes in all their natural born days thats wot makes me mad ef i thought that loo cared a bit for that child i wouldnt mind id just advise her to make him get up and getpack his duds out o camp and go home and not come back until he had a written permit from his mother or the other baronet in office  looks sorter ef some one orter interfere said the blacksmith reflectively taint exackly a case for a vigilance committee tho its agin public morals this sorter kidnappin o strangers looks ez if it might bring the country into discredit in england  well dont you go and interfere and havin folks say ez my nose was put out o jint over there said minty curtly theres another englishman comin up from frisco to see him tomorrow ef he aint scooped up by jenny bradley hell guess theres a nigger in the fence somewhere but there pop let it drop its a bad aig anyway she concluded rising from the table and passing her hands down her frock and her shapely hips as if to wipe off further contamination of the subject wheres richelieu agin  said he didnt want supper and like ez not hes gone over to see that fammerly at the summit theres a little girl thar hes sparkin about his own age  his own age said minty indignantly why shes double that if shes a day wellif he aint the triflinest conceitednest little limb that ever grew id like to know where he got it fromit wasnt mars style  mr sharpe smiled darkly richelieus precocious gallantry evidently was not considered as gratuitous as his experimental metallurgy but as his eyes followed his daughters wholesome phyllislike figure a new idea took possession of him needless to say however it was in the line of another personal aggrievement albeit it took the form of religious reflection  its curous minty wots foreordained and wot aint now yers one of them high and mighty fellows after the lord ez comes meanderin around here and drops offez fur ez i kin hearin a kind o faint at the first house he kems to and is taken in and lodged and sumptuously fed and natrally they gets their reward for it now wots to hev kept that young feller from coming here and droppin down in my forge or in this very room and you a tendin him and jist layin over them folks at the lookout  wots got hold o ye pop dont i tell ye he had a letter to jim bradley said minty quickly with an angry flash of color in her cheek  that aint it said sharpe confidently its cos he walked natrally youd think hed ride being high and mighty and thats where ez the parson will tell ye wots merely finite and human wisdom errs ef that feller had ridden hed have had to come by this yer road and by this yer forge and stop a spell like any other but it was foreordained that he should walk jest cos it wasnt generally kalkilated and reckoned on so you had no show  for a moment minty seemed struck with her fathers original theory but with a vigorous shake of her shoulders she threw it off her eyes darkened  i reckon you aint thinking pop she began  i was only sayin it was curous he rejoined quietly nevertheless after a pause he rose coughed and going up to the young girl as she leaned over the dresser bent his powerful arm around her and drawing her and the plate she was holding against his breast laid his bearded cheek for an instant softly upon her rebellious head its all right minty he said aint it pet mintys eyelids closed gently under the familiar pressure wots that in your hair minty he said tactfully breaking an embarrassing pause  bars grease father murmured minty in a childs voicethe grownup woman under that magic touch having lapsed again into her fathers motherless charge of ten years before  its powful soothin and pretty said her father  i made it myselfdo you want some asked minty  not now girl for a moment they slightly rocked each other in that attitudethe man dexterously the woman with infinite tendernessand then they separated  late that night after richelieu had returned and her father wrestled in his fitful sleep with the remorse of his guilty indulgence at supper minty remained alone in her room hard at work surrounded by the contents of one of her mothers trunks and the fragments of certain rippedup and newlyturned dresses for minty had conceived the bold idea of altering one of her mothers gowns to the fashion of a certain fascinating frock worn by louise macy it was late when her selfimposed task was completed with a nervous trepidation that was novel to her minty began to disrobe herself preparatory to trying on her new creation the light of a tallow candle and a large swinging lantern borrowed from her fathers forge fell shyly on her milky neck and shoulders and shone in her sparkling eyes as she stood before her largest mirrorthe long glazed door of a kitchen clock which she had placed upon her chest of drawers had poor minty been content with the full free and goddesslike outlines that it reflected she would have been spared her impending disappointment for alas the dress of her model had been framed upon a symmetrically attenuated french corset and the unfortunate mintys fuller and ampler curves had under her simple country stays known no more restraining cincture than knew the venus of milo the alteration was a hideous failure it was neither mintys statuesque outline nor louise macys graceful contour minty was no fool and the revelation of this slow education of the figure and training of outlinewhether fair or false in artstruck her quick intelligence with all its full and hopeless significance a bitter light sprang to her eyes she tore the wretched sham from her shoulders and then wrapping a shawl around her threw herself heavily and sullenly on the bed but inaction was not a characteristic of mintys emotion she presently rose again and taking an old workbox from her trunk began to rummage in its recesses it was an old shellincrusted affair and the apparent receptacle of such cheap odds and ends of jewelry as she possessed a hideous cameo ring the property of the late mrs sharpe was missing she again rapidly explored the contents of the box and then an inspiration seized her and she darted into her brothers bedroom  that precocious and gallant lovelace of ten despite all sentiment had basely succumbed to the gross materialism of youthful slumber on a cot in the corner half hidden under the wreck of his own careless and hurried disrobing with one arm hanging out of the coverlid richelieu lay supremely unconscious on the forefinger of his small but dirty hand the missing cameo was still glittering guiltily with a swift movement of indignation minty rushed with uplifted palm towards the tempting expanse of youthful cheek that lay invitingly exposed upon the pillow then she stopped suddenly  she had seen him lying thus a hundred times before on the pillow near him an indistinguishable mass of golden furthe helpless bulk of a squirrel chained to the leg of his cot at his feet a walleyed cat who had followed his tyrannous caprices with the longsuffering devotion of her sex on the shelf above him a loathsome collection of flies and tarantulas in dull green bottles a slab of gingerbread for light nocturnal refection and her own pot of bears grease perhaps it was the piteous defencelessness of youthful sleep perhaps it was some lingering memory of her fathers caress but as she gazed at him with troubled eyes the juvenile reprobate slipped back into the babyboy that she had carried in her own childish arms such a short time ago when the maternal responsibility had descended with the dead mothers illfitting dresses upon her lank girlish figure and scant virgin breastand her hand fell listlessly at her side  the sleeper stirred slightly and awoke at the same moment by some mysterious sympathy a pair of beady bright eyes appeared in the bulk of fur near his curls the cat stretched herself and even a vague agitation was heard in the bottles on the shelf richelieus blinking eyes wandered from the candle to his sister and then the guilty hand was suddenly withdrawn under the bedclothes  no matter dear said minty its mars and you kin wear it when you like if youll only ask for it  richelieu wondered if he was dreaming this unexpected mildnessthis inexplicable tremor in his sisters voice it must be some occult influence of the night season on the sisterly mind possibly akin to a fear of ghosts he made a mental note of it in view of future favors yet for the moment he felt embarrassedly gratified ye aint wantin anything minty he said affectionately a pail o cold water from the far springno nothin he made an ostentatious movement as if to rise yet sufficiently protracted to prevent any hasty acceptance of his prodigal offer  no dear she said still gazing at him with an absorbed look in her dark eyes  richelieu felt a slight creepy sensation under that lonely faroff gaze your eyes look awful big at night minty he said he would have added and pretty but she was his sister and he had the lofty fraternal conviction of his duty in repressing the inordinate vanity of the sex yere sure ye aint wantin nothin  not now dear she paused a moment and then said deliberately but you wouldnt mind turnin out after sunup and runnin an errand for me over to the lookout  richelieus eyes sparkled so suddenly that even in her absorption minty noticed the change but yere not goin to tarry over there ner gossipyou hear yer to take this yer message yer to say that it will be onpossible for me to come back there on accounton account of  important business suggested richelieu thats the perlite style  ef you like she leaned over the bed and put her lips to his forehead still damp with the dews of sleep and then to his longlashed lids mind nipthe squirrelhe practically suggested for an instant their blond curls mingled on the pillow now go to sleep she said curtly  but richelieu had taken her white neck in the short strangulatory hug of the small boy and held her fast yell let me put on my best pants  yes  and wear that ring  yesa little sadly  then yer kin count me in minty and see herehis voice sank to a confidential whispermebbee some day yell be beholden to me for a lot o real jewelry  she returned slowly to her room and opening the window looked out upon the night the same moon that had lent such supererogatory grace to the natural beauty of the lookout here seemed to have failed as minty had in disguising the relentless limitations of nature or the cruel bonds of custom the black plain of granite under its rays appeared only to extend its poverty to some remoter barrier the blackened stumps of the burnt forest stood bleaker against the sky like broken and twisted pillars of iron the cavity of the broken ledge where richelieu had prospected was a hideous chasm of bluish blackness over which a purple vapor seemed to hover the brush dump beside the house showed a cavern of writhing and distorted objects stiffened into dark rigidity she had often looked upon the prospect it had never seemed so hard and changeless yet she accepted it as she had accepted it before  she turned away undressed herself mechanically and went to bed she had an idea that she had been very foolish that her escape from being still more foolish was something miraculous and in some measure connected with providence her father her little brother and her dead mother whose dress she had recklessly spoiled but that she had even so slightly touched the bitterness and glory of renunciationas written of heroines and fine ladies by novelists and poetsnever entered the foolish head of minty sharpe the blacksmiths daughter     chaper iv   it was a little after daybreak next morning that mainwaring awoke from the first unrefreshing night he had passed at the lookout he was so feverish and restless that he dressed himself at sunrise and cautiously stepped out upon the still silent veranda the chairs which he and louise macy had occupied were still it seemed to him conspicuously confidential with each other and he separated them but as he looked down into the great canyon at his feet he was conscious of some undefinable change in the prospect a slight mist was rising from the valley as if it were the last of last nights illusions the first level sunbeams were obtrusively searching and the keen morning air had a dryly practical insistence which irritated him until a light footstep on the farther end of the veranda caused him to turn sharply  it was the singular apparition of a small boy bearing a surprising resemblance to minty sharpe and dressed in an unique fashion on a tumbled sea of blond curls a chip sailor hat with a broad red ribbon rode jauntily but here the nautical suggestion changed as had the desire of becoming a pirate which induced it a red shirt with a white collar and a yellow plaid ribbon tie that also recalled minty sharpe lightly turned the suggestion of his costume to mining short black velvet trousers coming to his knee and ostentatiously new shortlegged boots with visible straps like curling ears completed the entirely original character of his lower limbs  mainwaring always easily gentle and familiar with children and his inferiors looked at him with an encouraging smile richelieufor it was headvanced gravely and held out his hand with the cameo ring apparent mainwaring with equal gravity shook it warmly and removed his hat richelieu keenly observant did the same  is jim bradley out yet asked richelieu carelessly  no i think not but im frank mainwaring will i do  richelieu smiled the dimples the white teeth the dark laughing eyes were surely mintys  im richelieu he rejoined with equal candor  richelieu  yes that frenchmanthe lord cardinalyou know mar saw forrest do him out in st louis  do him  yes in the theayter  with a confused misconception of his meaning mainwaring tried to recall the historical dress of the great cardinal and fit it to the masqueraderif such he werebefore him but richelieu relieved him by adding  richelieu sharpe  oh thats your name said mainwaring cheerfully then youre miss mintys brother i know her how jolly lucky  they both shook hands again richelieu eager to get rid of the burden of his sisters message which he felt was in the way of freeandeasy intercourse with this charming stranger looked uneasily towards the house  i say said mainwaring if youre in a hurry youd better go in there and knock i hear some one stirring in the kitchen  richelieu nodded but first went back to the steps of the veranda picked up a small blue knotted handkerchief apparently containing some heavy objects and repassed mainwaring  what have you cut it richelieu with your valuables what have you got there  specimins said richelieu shortly and vanished  he returned presently well cardinal did you see anybody asked mainwaring  mrs bradley but jims over to the mill im goin there  did you see miss macy continued mainwaring carelessly  loo  loowell yes  no shes philanderin with captain greyson  philandering with greyson echoed mainwaring in wonder  yes on horseback on the ridge  you mean shes riding out with mrwith captain greyson  yes ridin and philanderin persisted richelieu  and what do you call philandering  well i reckon you and she oughter know returned richelieu with a precocious air  certainly said mainwaring with a faint smile richelieu really was like minty  there was a long silence this young englishman was becoming exceedingly uninteresting richelieu felt that he was gaining neither profit nor amusement and losing time im going he said  good morning said mainwaring without looking up  richelieu picked up his specimens thoroughly convinced of the strangers glittering deceitfulness and vanished  it was nearly eight oclock when mrs bradley came from the house she apologized with a slightly distrait smile for the tardiness of the household mr bradley stayed at the mill all night and will not be here until breakfast when he brings your friend mr richardson with himmainwaring scarcely repressed a movement of impatiencewho arrives early its unfortunate that miss sharpe cant come today  in his abstraction mainwaring did not notice that mrs bradley slightly accented mintys formal appellation and said carelessly  oh thats why her brother came over here so early  did you see him asked mrs bradley almost abruptly  yes he is an amusing little beggar but i think he shares his sisters preference for mr bradley he deserted me here in the veranda for him at the mill  louise will keep you company as soon as she has changed her dress continued mrs bradley she was out riding early this morning with a friend shes very fond of early morning rides  and philandering repeated mainwaring to himself it was quite natural for miss macy to ride out in the morning after the fashion of the country with an escort but why had the cub insisted on the philandering he had said and philandering distinctly it was a nasty thing for him to say any other fellow but he mainwaring might misunderstand the whole thing perhaps he ought to warn herbut no he could not repeat the gossip of a child and that child the brother of one of her inferiors but was minty an inferior did she and minty talk together about this fellow greyson at all events it would only revive the awkwardness of the preceding day and he resolved to say nothing  he was rewarded by a halfinquiring halfconfiding look in louises bright eyes when she presently greeted him on the veranda she had quite forgotten she said to tell him last night of her mornings engagement indeed she had half forgotten it it used to be a favorite practice of hers with captain greyson but she had lately given it up she believed she had not ridden sincesince  since when asked mainwaring  well since you were ill she said frankly  a quick pleasure shone in mainwarings cheek and eye but louises pretty lids did not drop nor her faint quiet bloom deepen breakfast was already waiting when mr richardson arrived alone  he explained that mr bradley had some important and unexpected business which had delayed him but which he added mr bradley says may prove interesting enough to you to excuse his absence this morning mainwaring was not displeased that his critical and observant host was not present at their meeting louise macy was however as demurely conscious of the different bearing of the two compatriots richardsons somewhat selfimportant patronage of the two ladies and that californian familiarity he had acquired changed to a certain uneasy deference towards mainwaring while the younger englishmans slightly stiff and deliberate cordiality was nevertheless mingled with a mysterious understanding that appeared innate and unconscious louise was quick to see that these two men more widely divergent in quality than any two of her own countrymen were yet more subtly connected by some unknown sympathy than the most equal of americans mintys prophetic belief of the effect of the two women upon richardson was certainly true as regarded mrs bradley the bankera large material naturewas quickly fascinated by the demure puritanic graces of that lady and was inclined to exhibit a somewhat broad and ostentatious gallantry that annoyed mainwaring when they were seated alone on the veranda which the ladies had discreetly left to them richardson said  odd i didnt hear of bradleys wife before she seems a spicy pretty comfortable creature regularly thrown away with him up here  mainwaring replied coldly that she was an admirable helpmeet of a very admirable man not however without an uneasy recollection of her previous confidences respecting her husband they have been most thoroughly good and kind to me my own brother and sister could not have done more and certainly not with better taste or delicacy he added markedly  certainly certainly said richardson hurriedly i wrote to lady mainwaring that you were taken capital care of by some very honest people and that  lady mainwaring already knows what i think of them and what she owes to their kindness said mainwaring dryly  true true said richardson apologetically of course you must have seen a good deal of them i only know bradley in a business way hes been trying to get the bank to help him to put up some new mills here but we didnt see it i dare say he is good companyrather amusing eh  mainwaring had the gift of his class of snubbing by the polite and forgiving oblivion of silence richardson shifted uneasily in his chair but continued with assumed carelessness  no i only knew of this cousin miss macy i heard of her when she was visiting some friends in menlo park last year rather an attractive girl they say colonel johnson of sacramento took quite a fancy to herit would have been a good match i dare say for he is very richbut the thing fell through in some way then they say she wanted to marry that spaniard young pico of the amador ranche but his family wouldnt hear of it somehow shes deuced unlucky i suppose shell make a mess of it with captain greyson she was out riding with this morning  didnt the bank think bradleys mills a good investment asked mainwaring quietly when richardson paused  not with him in it he is not a business man you know  i thought he was he seems to me an energetic man who knows his work and is not afraid to look after it himself  thats just it he has got absurd ideas of cooperating with his workmen you know and doing everything slowly and on a limited scale the only thing to be done is to buy up all the land on this ridge run off the settlers freeze out all the other mills and put it into a big san francisco company on shares thats the only way we would look at it  but you dont consider the investment bad even from his point of view  perhaps not  and you only decline it because it isnt big enough for the bank  exactly  richardson said mainwaring slowly rising putting his hands in his trousers pockets and suddenly looking down upon the banker from the easy level of habitual superiority i wish youd attend to this thing for me i desire to make some return to mr bradley for his kindness i wish to give him what help he wantsin his own wayyou understand i wish it and i believe my father wishes it too if youd like him to write to you to that effect  by no means its not at all necessary said richardson dropping with equal suddenness into his oldworld obsequiousness i shall certainly do as you wish it is not a bad investment mr mainwaring and as you suggest a very proper return for their kindness and being here it will come quite naturally for me to take up the affair again  andi say richardson  yes sir  as these ladies are rather shorthanded in their domestic service you know perhaps youd better not stay to luncheon or dinner but go on to the summit houseits only a mile or two fartherand come back here this evening i shant want you until then  certainly stammered richardson ill just take leave of the ladies  its not at all necessary said mainwaring quietly you would only disturb them in their household duties ill tell them what ive done with you if they ask youll find your stick and hat in the passage and you can leave the veranda by these steps by the way you had better manage at the summit to get some one to bring my traps from here to be forwarded to sacramento tomorrow ill want a conveyance or a horse of some kind myself for ive given up walking for a while but we can settle about that tonight come early good morning  he accompanied his thoroughly subjugated countrymanwho however far from attempting to reassert himself actually seemed easier and more cheerful in his submissionto the end of the veranda and watched him depart as he turned back he saw the pretty figure of louise macy leaning against the doorway how graceful and refined she looked in that simple morning dress what wonder that she was admired by greyson by johnson and by that spaniardno by jove it was she that wanted to marry him  what have you sent away mr richardson for asked the young girl with a halfreproachful halfmischievous look in her bright eyes  i packed him off because i thought it was a little too hard on you and mrs bradley to entertain him without help  but as he was our guest you might have left that to us said miss macy  by jove i never thought of that said mainwaring coloring in consternation pray forgive me miss macybut you see i knew the man and could say it and you couldnt  well i forgive you for you look really so cut up said louise laughing but i dont know what jenny will say of your disposing of her conquest so summarily she stopped and regarded him more attentively has he brought you any bad news if so its a pity you didnt send him away before hes quite spoiling our cure  mainwaring thought bitterly that he had but its a cure for all that miss macy he said with an attempt at cheerfulness and being a cure you see theres no longer an excuse for my staying here i have been making arrangements for leaving here tomorrow  so soon  do you think it soon miss macy asked mainwaring turning pale in spite of himself  i quite forgotthat you were here as an invalid only and that we owe our pleasure to the accident of your pain  she spoke a little artificially he thought yet her cheeks had not lost their pink bloom nor her eyes their tranquillity had he heard mintys criticism he might have believed that the organic omission noticed by her was a fact  and now that your good work as sister of charity is completed youll be able to enter the world of gayety again with a clear conscience said mainwaring with a smile that he inwardly felt was a miserable failure youll be able to resume your morning rides you know which the wretched invalid interrupted  louise raised her clear eyes to his without reproach indignation or even wonder he felt as if he had attempted an insult and failed  does my cousin know you are going so soon she asked finally  no i did not know myself until today you see he added hastily while his honest blood blazoned the lie in his cheek ive heard of some miserable business affairs that will bring me back to england sooner that i expected  i think you should consider your health more important than any mere business said louise i dont mean that you should remain here she added with a hasty laugh but it would be a pity now that you have reaped the benefit of rest and taking care of yourself that you should not make it your only business to seek it elsewhere  mainwaring longed to say that within the last half hour living or dying had become of little moment to him but he doubted the truth or efficacy of this timeworn heroic of passion he felt too that anything he said was a mere subterfuge for the real reason of his sudden departure and how was he to question her as to that reason in escaping from these subterfugeshe was compelled to lie again with an assumption of changing the subject he said calmly richardson thought he had met you beforein menlo park i think  amazed at the evident irrelevance of the remark louise said coldly that she did not remember having seen him before  i think it was at a mr johnsonsor with a mr johnsonor perhaps at one of those spanish ranchesi think he mentioned some name like pico  louise looked at him wonderingly for an instant and then gave way to a frank irrepressible laugh which lent her delicate but rather set little face all the color he had missed partially relieved by her unconcern and yet mortified that he had only provoked her sense of the ludicrous he tried to laugh also  then to be quite plain said louise wiping her now humid eyes you want me to understand that you really didnt pay sufficient attention to hear correctly thank you thats a pretty english compliment i suppose  i dare say you wouldnt call it philandering  i certainly shouldnt for i dont know what philandering means  mainwaring could not reply with richelieu you ought to know nor did he dare explain what he thought it meant and how he knew it louise however innocently solved the difficulty  theres a country song ive heard minty sing she said it runs       come philander let us be amarchin      every one for his true love asarchin      choose your true love now or never     have you been listening to her also  no said mainwaring with a sudden incomprehensible but utterly irrepressible resolution but im amarchin you know and perhaps i must choose my true love now or never will you help me miss macy  he drew gently near her he had become quite white but also very manly and it struck her more deeply thoroughly and conscientiously sincere than any man who had before addressed her she moved slightly away as if to rest herself by laying both hands upon the back of the chair  where do you expect to begin your sarchin she said leaning on the chair and tilting it before her or are you as vague as usual as to locality is it at some mr johnson or mr pico or  here he interrupted boldly  i really think you ought to first tell my cousin that you are going away tomorrow she said with a faint smile its such short notice shes just in there she nodded her pretty head without raising her eyes towards the hall  but it may not be so soon said mainwaring  oh then the sarchin is not so important said louise raising her head and looking towards the hall with some uneasy but indefinable feminine instinct  she was right the sittingroom door opened and mrs bradley made her smiling appearance  mr mainwaring was just looking for you said louise for the first time raising her eyes to him hes not only sent off mr richardson but hes going away himself tomorrow  mrs bradley looked from the one to the other in mute wonder mainwaring cast an imploring glance at louise which had the desired effect much more seriously and in a quaint businesslike way the young girl took it upon herself to explain to mrs bradley that richardson had brought the invalid some important news that would unfortunately not only shorten his stay in america but even compel him to leave the lookout sooner than he expected perhaps tomorrow mainwaring thanked her with his eyes and then turned to mrs bradley  whether i go tomorrow or next day he said with simple and earnest directness i intend you know to see you soon again either here or in my own home in england i do not know he added with marked gravity that i have succeeded in convincing you that i have made your family already well known to my people and thathe fixed his eyes with a meaning look on louiseno matter when or in what way you come to them your place is made ready for you you may not like them you know the governor is getting to be an old manperhaps too old for young americansbut they will like you and you must put up with that my mother and sisters know miss macy as well as i do and will make her one of the family  the conscientious earnestness with which these apparent conventionalities were uttered and some occult quality of quiet conviction in the young mans manner brought a pleasant sparkle to the eyes of mrs bradley and louise  but said mrs bradley gayly our going to england is quite beyond our present wildest dreams nothing but a windfall an unexpected rise in timber or even the tabooed hotel speculation could make it possible  but i shall take the liberty of trying to present it to mr bradley tonight in some practical way that may convince even his critical judgment said mainwaring still seriously it will be he added more lightly the famous testimonial of my cure which i promised you  and you will find mr bradley so sceptical that you will be obliged to defer your going said mrs bradley triumphantly come louise we must not forget that we have still mr mainwarings present comfort to look after that minty has basely deserted us and that we ourselves must see that the last days of our guest beneath our roof are not remembered for their privation  she led louise away with a halfmischievous suggestion of maternal propriety and left mainwaring once more alone on the veranda  he had done it certainly she must have understood his meaning and there was nothing left for him to do but to acquaint bradley with his intentions tonight and press her for a final answer in the morning there would be no indelicacy then in asking her for an interview more free from interruption than this public veranda without conceit he did not doubt what the answer would be his indecision his sudden resolution to leave her had been all based upon the uncertainty of his own feelings the propriety of his declaration the possibility of some previous experience of hers that might compromise him convinced by her unembarrassed manner of her innocence or rather satisfied of her indifference to richardsons gossip he had been hurried by his feelings into an unexpected avowal brought up in the perfect security of his own social position and familiarly consciouswithout vanityof its importance and power in such a situation he believed without undervaluing louises charms or independence that he had no one else than himself to consult even the slight uneasiness that still pursued him was more due to his habitual conscientiousness of his own intention than to any fear that she would not fully respond to it indeed with his conservative ideas of proper feminine selfrestraint louises calm passivity and undemonstrative attitude were a proof of her superiority had she blushed overmuch cried or thrown herself into his arms he would have doubted the wisdom of so easy a selection it was true he had known her scarcely three weeks if he chose to be content with that his own accessible record of three centuries should be sufficient for her and condone any irregularity  nevertheless as an hour slipped away and louise did not make her appearance either on the veranda or in the little sittingroom off the hall mainwaring became more uneasy as to the incompleteness of their interview perhaps a faint suspicion of the inadequacy of her response began to trouble him but he still fatuously regarded it rather as owing to his own hurried and unfinished declaration it was true that he hadnt said half what he intended to say it was true that she might have misunderstood it as the conventional gallantry of the situation asterrible thoughtthe light banter of the habitual lovemaking american to which she had been accustomed perhaps even now she relegated him to the level of greyson and this accounted for her singular impassivenessan impassiveness that certainly was singular now he reflected upon itthat might have been even contempt the last thought pricked his deep conscientiousness he walked hurriedly up and down the veranda and then suddenly reentering his room took up a sheet of notepaper and began to write to her   can you grant me a few moments interview alone i cannot bear you should think that what i was trying to tell you when we were interrupted was prompted by anything but the deepest sincerity and conviction or that i am willing it should be passed over lightly by you or be forgotten pray give me a chance of proving it by saying you will see me f m   but how should he convey this to her his delicacy revolted against handing it to her behind mrs bradleys back or the prestidigitation of slipping it into her lap or under her plate before them at luncheon he thought for an instant of the chinaman but gentlemenexcept in that mirror of nature the stageusually hesitate to suborn other peoples servants or entrust a womans secret to her inferiors he remembered that louises room was at the farther end of the house and its low window gave upon the veranda and was guarded at night by a film of white and blue curtains that were parted during the day to allow a triangular revelation of a pale blue and white draped interior mainwaring reflected that the low inside window ledge was easily accessible from the veranda would afford a capital lodgment for the note and be quickly seen by the fair occupant of the room on entering he sauntered slowly past the window the room was empty the moment propitious a slight breeze was stirring the blue ribbons of the curtain it would be necessary to secure the note with something he returned along the veranda to the steps where he had noticed a small irregular stone lying which had evidently escaped from richelieus bag of treasure specimens and had been overlooked by that ingenuous child it was of a pretty peacockblue color and besides securing a paper would be sure to attract her attention he placed his note on the inside ledge and the blue stone atop and went away with a sense of relief  another half hour passed without incident he could hear the voices of the two women in the kitchen and diningroom after a while they appeared to cease and he heard the sound of an opening door it then occurred to him that the veranda was still too exposed for a confidential interview and he resolved to descend the steps pass before the windows of the kitchen where louise might see him and penetrate the shrubbery where she might be induced to follow him they would not be interrupted nor overheard there  but he had barely left the veranda before the figure of richelieu who had been patiently waiting for mainwarings disappearance emerged stealthily from the shrubbery he had discovered his loss on handing his fire assays to the goodhumored bradley for later examination and he had retraced his way step by step looking everywhere for his missing stone with the unbounded hopefulness lazy persistency and lofty disregard for time and occupation known only to the genuine boy he remembered to have placed his knotted bag upon the veranda and slipping off his stiff boots slowly and softly slid along against the wall of the house looking carefully on the floor and yet preserving a studied negligence of demeanor with one hand in his pocket and his small mouth contracted into a singularly soothing and almost voiceless whistlerichelieus own peculiar accomplishment but no stone appeared like most of his genus he was superstitious and repeated to himself the cabalistic formula losins seekins findins keepinspresumed to be of great efficacy in such caseswith religious fervor he had laboriously reached the end of the veranda when he noticed the open window of louises room and stopped as a perfunctory duty to look in and then richelieu sharpe stood for an instant utterly confounded and aghast at this crowning proof of the absolute infamy and sickening enormity of man  there was his stonehis richelieus own specimen carefully gathered by himself and none otherand now stolen abstracted skyugled smouged hooked by this rotten skunkified longlegged splayfooted hosslaughin niggertoothed ornary despot and worse than all actually made to do infamous duty as a love tokena candygifta philanderin box to his richelieus girlfor louise belonged to that innocent and vague outside seraglio of richelieus boyish dreamsand put atop of a letter to her and providence permitted such an outrage wot was he richelieu sent to school for and organized wickedness in the shape of gorilla injins like this allowed to ride high horses rampant over californey he looked at the heavens in mute appeal and thenprovidence not immediately interferinghe thrust his own small arm into the window regained his priceless treasure and fled swiftly  a fateful silence ensued the wind slightly moved the curtain outward as if in a playful attempt to follow him and then subsided a moment later apparently reenforced by other winds or sympathizing with richelieu it lightly lifted the unlucky missive and cast it softly from the window but here another wind lying in wait caught it cleverly and tossed it in a long curve into the abyss for an instant it seemed to float lazily as on the mirrored surface of a lake until turning upon its side it suddenly darted into utter oblivion  when mainwaring returned from the shrubbery he went softly to the window the disappearance of the letter and stone satisfied him of the success of his stratagem and for the space of three hours relieved his anxiety but at the end of that time finding no response from louise his former uneasiness returned was she offended orthe first doubt of her acceptance of him crossed his mind  a sudden and inexplicable sense of shame came upon him at the same moment he heard his name called from the steps turnedand beheld minty  her dark eyes were shining with a pleasant light and her lips parted on her white teeth with a frank happy smile she advanced and held out her hand he took it with a mingling of disappointment and embarrassment  youre wondering why i kem on here arter i sent word this morning that i kelkilated not to come well twixt then and now suthin s happened weve had fine doins over at our house you bet pop dont know which end hes standin on and i reckon that for about ten minutes i didnt know my own name but ez soon ez i got fairly hold o the hull thing and had it put straight in my mind i sez to myself minty sharpe sez i the first thing for you to do now is to put on yer bonnet and shawl and trapse over to jim bradleys and help them two womenfolks get dinner for themselves and that sick stranger and continued minty throwing herself into a chair and fanning her glowing face with her apron yer i am  but you have not told me what has happened said mainwaring with a constrained smile and an uneasy glance towards the house  thats so said minty with a brilliant laugh i clean forgot the hull gist of the thing well were rich folks nowover thar on barren ledge that onery brother of mine richelieu hez taken some of his specimens over to jim bradley to be tested and bradley just to please that child takes em and not an hour ago bradley comes running likety switch over to pop to tell him to put up his notices for the hull of that ledge where the forge stands is a mine o silver and copper afore ye knew it lordy half the folks outer the summit and the mill was scattered down thar all over it richardsonthat stranger ez knows youkem thar too with jim and he allows ef bradleys essay is right its worth more than a hundred thousand dollars ez it stands  i suppose i must congratulate you miss sharpe said mainwaring with an attempt at interest but his attention still preoccupied with the open doorway  oh they know all about it said minty following the direction of his abstracted eyes with a slight darkening of her own i jest kem out o the kitchen the other way and jim sent em a note but i allowed id tell you myself specially ez you are going away tomorrow  who said i was going away tomorrow asked mainwaring uneasily  loo macy  ahshe did but i may change my mind you know he continued with a faint smile  minty shook her curls decisively i reckon she knows she said dryly shes got law and gospel for wot she says but yer she comes ask her look yer loo she added as the two women appeared at the doorway with a certain exaggeration of congratulatory manner that struck mainwaring as being as artificial and disturbed as his own didnt sir francis yer say he was going tomorrow  thats what i understood returned louise with cold astonishment letting her clear indifferent eyes fall upon mainwaring i do not know that he has changed his mind  unless as miss sharpe is a great capitalist now she is willing to use her powers of persuasion added mrs bradley with a slight acidulous pointing of her usual prim playfulness  i reckon minty sharpes the same ez she allus wos unless more so returned minty with an honest egotism that carried so much conviction to the hearer as to condone its vanity but i kem yer to do a days work gals and i allow to pitch in and do it and not sit yer swoppin compliments and keeping him from packin his duds onless she stopped and looked around at the uneasy unsympathetic circle with a faint tremulousness of lip that belied the brave black eyes above it onless im in yer way  the two women sprang forward with a feminine bewildering excess of protestation and mainwaring suddenly pierced through his outer selfish embarrassment to his more honest depths stammered quickly  look here miss sharpe if you think of running away again after having come all the way here to make us share the knowledge of your good fortune and your better heart by jove ill go back with you  but here the two women effusively hurried her away from the dangerous proximity of such sympathetic honesty and a moment later mainwaring heard her laughing voice as of old ringing in the kitchen and then as if unconsciously responding to the significant common sense that lay in her last allusion to him he went to his room and grimly began his packing  he did not again see louise alone at their informal luncheon the conversation turned upon the more absorbing topic of the sharpes discovery its extent and its probable effect upon the fortunes of the locality he noticed abstractedly that both mrs bradley and her cousin showed a real or assumed scepticism of its value this did not disturb him greatly except for its intended check upon mintys enthusiasm he was more conscious perhapswith a faint touch of mortified vanitythat his own contemplated departure was of lesser importance than this local excitement yet in his growing conviction that all was overif indeed it had ever begunbetween himself and louise he was grateful to this natural diversion of incident which spared them both an interval of embarrassing commonplaces and with the suspicion of some indefinable insincerityeither of his own or louiseshaunting him mintys frank heartiness and outspoken loyalty gave him a strange relief it seemed to him as if the clear cool breath of the forest had entered with her homely garments and the steadfast truth of nature were incarnate in her shining eyes how far this poetic fancy would have been consistent or even coexistent with any gleam of tenderness or selfforgetfulness in louises equally pretty orbs i leave the satirical feminine reader to determine  it was late when bradley at last returned bringing further and more complete corroboration of the truth of sharpes good fortune two experts had arrived one from pine flat and another from the summit and upon this statement richardson had offered to purchase an interest in the discovery that would at once enable the blacksmith to develop his mine i shouldnt wonder mainwaring he added cheerfully if hed put you into it too and make your eternal fortune  with larks falling from the skies all round you its a pity you couldnt get put into something said mrs bradley straightening her pretty brows  im not a goldminer my dear said bradley pleasantly  nor a goldfinder returned his wife with a cruel little depression of her pink nostrils but you can work all night in that stupid mill and then she added in a low voice to escape mintys attention spend the whole of the next day examining and following up a boys discovery that his own relations had been too lazy and too ignorant to understand and profit by i suppose that next you will be hunting up a site on the other side of the canyon where somebody else can put up a hotel and ruin your own prospects  a sensitive shadow of pain quickly dimmed bradleys glancenot the first or last time evidently for it was gradually bringing out a background of sadness in his intelligent eyes but the next moment he turned kindly to mainwaring and began to deplore the necessity of his early departure which richardson had already made known to him with practical and satisfying reasons  i hope you wont forget my dear fellow that your most really urgent business is to look after your health and if hereafter youll only remember the old lookout enough to impress that fact upon you i shall feel that any poor service i have rendered you has been amply repaid  mainwaring notwithstanding that he winced slightly at this fateful echo of louises advice returned the grasp of his friends hand with an honest pressure equal to his own he longed now only for the coming of richardson to complete his scheme of grateful benefaction to his host  the banker came fortunately as the conversation began to flag and mrs bradleys halfcoquettish illhumor of a pretty woman and louises abstracted indifference were becoming so noticeable as to even impress minty into a thoughtful taciturnity the graciousness of his reception by mrs bradley somewhat restored his former ostentatious gallantry and his selfsatisfied domineering manner had enough masculine power in it to favorably affect the three women who it must be confessed were a little bored by the finer abstractions of bradley and mainwaring after a few moments mainwaring rose and with a significant glance at richardson to remind him of his proposed conference with bradley turned to leave the room he was obliged to pass louise who was sitting by the table his attention was suddenly arrested by something in her hand with which she was listlessly playing it was the stone which he had put on his letter to her  as he had not been present when bradley arrived he did not know that this fateful object had been brought home by his host who after receiving it from richelieu had put it in his pocket to illustrate his story of the discovery on the contrary it seemed that louises careless exposure of his foolish stratagem was gratuitously and purposely cruel nevertheless he stopped and looked at her  thats a queer stone you have there he said in a tone which she recognized as coldly and ostentatiously civil  yes she replied without looking up its the outcrop of that mine she handed it to him as if to obviate any further remark i thought you had seen it before  the outcrop he repeated dryly that isititit is the indication or sign of something important thats below itisnt it  louise shrugged her shoulders sceptically it dont follow its just as likely to cover rubbish after youve taken the trouble to look  thanks he said with measured gentleness and passed quietly out of the room  the moon had already risen when bradley with his brierwood pipe preceded richardson upon the veranda the latter threw his large frame into louises rockingchair near the edge of the abyss bradley with his own chair tilted against the side of the house after the national fashion waited for him to speak the absence of mainwaring and the stimulus of mrs bradleys graciousness had given the banker a certain condescending familiarity which bradley received with amused and ironical tolerance that his twinkling eyes made partly visible in the darkness  one of the things i wanted to talk to you about bradley was that old affair of the advance you asked for from the bank we did not quite see our way to it then and speaking as a business man it isnt really a matter of business now but it has lately been put to me in a light that would make the doing of it possibleyou understand the fact of the matter is this sir robert mainwaring the father of the young fellow youve got in your house is one of our directors and largest shareholders and i can tell youif you dont suspect it alreadyyouve been lucky bradleydeucedly luckyto have had him in your house and to have rendered him a service hes the heir to one of the largest landed estates in his country one of the oldest county families and will step into the title some day but ahem he coughed patronizingly you knew all that no well that charming wife of yours at least does for shes been talking about it gad bradley it takes those women to find out anything of that kind eh  the light in bradleys eyes and his pipe went slowly out together  then well say that affair of the advance is as good as settled its sir roberts wish you understand and this young fellows wishand if youll come down to the bank next week well arrange it for you i think youll admit theyre doing the handsome to you and yours and therefore he lowered his voice confidentially youll see bradley that it will only be the honorable thing in you you know to look upon the affair as finished and in fact to do all you canhe drew his chair closertototo drop this other foolishness  i dont think i quite understand you said bradley slowly  but your wife does if you dont returned richardson bluntly i mean this foolish flirtation between louise macy and mainwaring which is utterly preposterous why man it cant possibly come to anything and it couldnt be allowed for a moment look at his position and hers i should think as a practical man it would strike you  only one thing strikes me richardson interrupted bradley in a singularly distinct whisper rising and moving nearer the speaker it is that youre sitting perilously near the edge of this veranda for by the living god if you dont take yourself out of that chair and out of this house i wont be answerable for the consequences  hold on there a minute will you said mainwarings voice from the window  both men turned towards it a long leg was protruding from mainwarings window it was quickly followed by the other leg and body of the occupant and the next moment mainwaring come towards the two men with his hands in his pockets  not so loud he said looking towards the house  let that man go said bradley in a repressed voice you and i mainwaring can speak together afterwards  that man must stay until he hears what i have got to say said mainwaring stepping between them he was very white and grave in the moonlight but very quiet and he did not take his hands from his pockets ive listened to what he said because he came here on my business which was simply to offer to do you a service that was all bradley that i told him to do this rot about what he expects of you in return is his own impertinence if youd punched his head when he began it it would have been all right but since he has begun it before he goes i think he ought to hear me tell you that i have already offered myself to miss macy and she has refused me if she had given me the least encouragement i should have told you before further i want to say that in spite of that mans insinuations i firmly believe that no one is aware of the circumstance except miss macy and myself  i had no idea of intimating that anything had happened that was not highly honorable and creditable to you and the young lady began richardson hurriedly  i dont know that it was necessary for you to have any ideas on the subject at all said mainwaring sternly nor that having been shown how you have insulted this gentleman and myself you need trouble us an instant longer with your company you need not come back i will manage my other affairs myself  very well mr mainwaringbutyou may be sure that i shall certainly take the first opportunity to explain myself to sir robert returned richardson as with an attempt at dignity he strode away  there was an interval of silence  dont be too hard upon a fellow bradley said mainwaring as bradley remained dark and motionless in the shadow it is a poor return im making you for your kindness but i swear i never thought of anything likelikethis  nor did i said bradley bitterly  i know it and thats what makes it so infernally bad for me forgive me wont you think of me old fellow as the wretchedest ass you ever met but not such a cad as this would make me as mainwaring stepped out from the moonlight towards him with extended hand bradley grasped it warmly  thankstherethanks old fellow and bradleyi saydont say anything to your wife for i dont think she knows it and bradleylook herei didnt like to be anything but plain before that fellow but i dont mind telling you now that its all over that i really think louisemiss macydidnt altogether understand me either  with another shake of the hand they separated for the night for a long time after mainwaring had gone bradley remained gazing thoughtfully into the great canyon he thought of the time when he had first come there full of life and enthusiasm making an ideal world of his pure and wholesome eyrie on the ledge what else he thought will probably never be known until the misunderstanding of honorable and chivalrous men by a charming and illogical sex shall incite the audacious pen of some more daring romancer  when he returned to the house he said kindly to his wife i have been thinking today about your hotel scheme and i shall write to sacramento tonight to accept that capitalists offer     chaper v   the sun was just rising in two years of mutation and change it had seen the little cottage clinging like a swallows nest to the rocky caves of a great sierran canyon give way to a straggling manygalleried hotel and a dozen blackened chimneys rise above the barren tableland where once had stood the lonely forge to that conservative orb of light and heat there must have been a peculiar satisfaction in looking down a few hours earlier upon the battlements and gables of oldenhurst whose base was deeply embedded in the matured foundations and settled traditions of an english county for the rising sun had for ten centuries found oldenhurst in its place from the heavy stone terrace that covered the deadandforgotten wall where a roman sentinel had once paced to the little grating in the cloistered quadrangle where it had seen a cistercian brother place the morning dole it had daily welcomed the growth of this vast and picturesque excrescence of the times it had smiled every morning upon this formidable yet quaint incrustation of power and custom ignoring as oldenhurst itself had ignored the generations who possessed it the men who built it the men who carried it with fire and sword the men who had lied and cringed for it the king who had given it to a favorite the few brave hearts who had died for it in exile and the one or two who had bought and paid for it for oldenhurst had absorbed all these and more until it had become a story of the past incarnate in stone greenwood and flower it had even drained the lifeblood from adjacent hamlets repaying them with tumuli growths like its own in the shape of purposeless lodges quaintly incompetent hospitals and schools and churches where the inestimable blessing and knowledge of its gospel were taught and fostered nor had it dealt more kindly with the gentry within its walls sending some to the scaffold pillorying others in infamous office reducing a few to poverty and halting its later guests with gout and paralysis it had given them in exchange the dubious immortality of a portrait gallery from which they stared with stony and equal resignation it had preserved their useless armor and accoutrements it had set up their marble effigies in churches or laid them in crosslegged attitudes to trip up the unwary until in death as in life they got between the congregation and the truth that was taught there it had allowed an oldenhurst crusader with a broken nose like a pugilist on the strength of his having been twice to the holy land to hide the beautifully illuminated word from the lowlier worshipper on the humbler benches it had sent an iconoclastic bishop of the reformation to a nearer minster to ostentatiously occupy the place of the consecrated image he had overthrown small wonder that crowding the oldenhurst retainers gradually into smaller space with occasional sabbath glimpses of the living rulers of oldenhurst already in railedoff exaltation it had forced them to accept oldenhurst as a synonym of eternity and left the knowledge of a higher power to what time they should be turned out to their longer sleep under the tender grass of the beautiful outer churchyard  and even so while every stone of the pile of oldenhurst and every tree in its leafy park might have been eloquent with the story of vanity selfishness and unequal justice it had been left to the infinite mercy of nature to seal their lips with a spell of beauty that left mankind equally dumb earth air and moisture had entered into a gentle conspiracy to soften mellow and clothe its external blemishes of breach and accident its irregular design its additions accretions ruins and lapses with a harmonious charm of outline and color poets romancers and historians had equally conspired to illuminate the dark passages and uglier inconsistencies of its interior life with the glamour of their own fancy the fragment of menacing keep with its choked oubliettes became a bower of tender ivy the grim story of its crimes properly edited by a contemporary bard of the family passed into a charming ballad even the superstitious darkness of its religious house had escaped through fallen roof and shattered wall leaving only the foliated and sunpierced screen of front with its rosewindow and pinnacle of cross behind pilgrims from all lands had come to see it fierce republicans had crossed the seas to gaze at its mediaeval outlines and copy them in wood and stucco on their younger soil politicians had equally pointed to it as a convincing evidence of their own principles and in refutation of each other and it had survived both for it was this belief in its own perpetuity that was its strength and weakness and that belief was never stronger than on this bright august morning when it was on the verge of dissolution a telegram brought to sir robert mainwaring had even then as completely shattered and disintegrated oldenhurst in all it was and all it meant as if the brownpaper envelope had been itself charged with the electric fluid  sir robert mainwaring whose family had for three centuries possessed oldenhurst had received the news of his financial ruin and the vast pile which had survived the repeated invasion of superstition force intrigue and even progress had succumbed to a foe its founders and proprietors had loftily ignored and left to jews and traders the acquisition of money except by despoilment gift royal favor or inheritance had been unknown at oldenhurst the present degenerate custodian of its fortunes staggering under the weight of its sentimental mortmain already alluded to had speculated in order to keep up its material strength that was gradually shrinking through impoverished land and the ruined trade it had despised he had invested largely in california mines and was the chief shareholder in a san francisco bank but the mines had proved worthless the bank had that morning suspended payment owing to the failure of a large land and timber company on the sierras which it had imprudently carried the spark which had demolished oldenhurst had been fired from the new telegraphstation in the hotel above the great sierran canyon  there was a large houseparty at oldenhurst that morning but it had been a part of the history of the mainwarings to accept defeat gallantly and as became their blood sir percivalthe second gentleman on the left as you entered the libraryunhorsed dying on a distant moor with a handful of followers abandoned by a charming prince and a miserable cause was scarcely a greater hero than this ruined but undaunted gentleman of eighty entering the breakfastroom a few hours later as jauntily as his gout would permit and conscientiously dispensing the hospitalities of his crumbling house when he had arranged a few pleasure parties for the day and himself thoughtfully anticipated the different tastes of his guests he turned to lady mainwaring  dont forget that somebody ought to go to the station to meet the bradleys frank writes from st moritz that they are due here today  lady mainwaring glanced quickly at her husband and said sotto voce do you think theyll care to come now they probably have heard all about it  not how it affects me returned sir robert in the same tone and as they might think that because frank was with them on that california mountain we would believe it had something to do with richardson involving the bank in that wretched company we must really insist upon their coming  bradley echoed the hon captain fitzharry overhearing the name during a late forage on the sideboard bradleythere was an awfully pretty american at biarritz travelling with a cousin i thinka miss mason or macy those sort of people you know who have a companion as pretty as themselves bring you down with the other barrel if one misseseh very clever both of them and hardly any accent  mr bradley was a very dear friend of franks and most kind to him said lady mainwaring gravely  didnt know there was a mr bradley really he didnt come to the fore then said the unabashed captain deuced hard to follow up those american husbands  and their wives wouldnt thank you if you did said lady griselda armiger with a sweet smile  if it is the mrs bradley i mean said lady canterbridge from the lower end of the table looking up from her letter who looks a little like mrs summertree and has a pretty cousin with her who has very good frocks im afraid you wont be able to get her down here shes booked with engagements for the next six weeks she and her cousin made all the running at grigsby royal and she has quite deposed that other american beauty in northforelands good graces she regularly affiched him and it is piteous to see him follow her about no my dear i dont believe theyll come to any one of less rank than a marquis if they did im sure canterbridge would have had them at buckenthorpe already  i wonder if there was ever anything in franks admiration of this miss macy said lady mainwaring a few moments later lingering beside her husband in his study  i really dont know said sir robert abstractedly his letters were filled with her praises and richardson thought  pray dont mention that mans name again said lady mainwaring with the first indication of feeling she had shown i shouldnt trust him  but why do you ask returned her husband  lady mainwaring was silent for a moment she is very rich i believe she said slowly at least frank writes that some neighbors of theirs whom he met in the engadine told him they had sold the site of that absurd cottage where he was ill for some extravagant sum  my dear geraldine said the old man affectionately taking his wifes hand in his own that now for the first time trembled if you have any hope based upon what you are thinking of now let it be the last and least you forget that paget told us that with the best care he could scarcely ensure franks return to perfect health even if god in his mercy spared him long enough to take my place what girl would be willing to tie herself to a man doomed to sickness and poverty hardly the one you speak of my dear  lady canterbridge proved a true prophet mrs bradley and miss macy did not come regretfully alleging a previous engagement made on the continent with the duke of northforeland and the marquis of dungeness but the unexpected and apocryphal husband did arrive i myself have not seen my wife and cousin since i returned from my visit to your son in switzerland i am glad they were able to amuse themselves without waiting for me at a london hotel though i should have preferred to have met them here sir robert and lady mainwaring were courteous but slightly embarrassed lady canterbridge who had come to the station in bored curiosity raised her clear blue eyes to his he did not look like a fool a complaisant or fashionablycynical husbandthis welldressed wellmannered but quietly and sympathetically observant man did he really care for his selfish wife was it perfect trust or some absurd transatlantic custom she did not understand him it wearied her and she turned her eyes indifferently away bradley a little irritated he knew not why at the scrutiny of this tall handsome gentlemanlylooking woman who however in spite of her broad shoulders and narrow hips possessed a refined muliebrity superior to mere womanliness of outline turned slightly towards sir robert lady canterbridge franks cousin explained sir robert hesitatingly as if conscious of some vague awkwardness bradley and lady canterbridge both bowedpossibly the latters salutation was the most masculineand bradley eventually forgetting her presence plunged into an earnest sympathetic and intelligent account of the condition in which he found the invalid at st moritz the old man at first listened with an almost perfunctory courtesy and a hesitating reserve but as bradley was lapsing into equal reserve and they drove up to the gates of the quadrangle he unexpectedly warmed with a word or two of serious welcome looking up with a halfunconscious smile bradley met lady canterbridges examining eyes  the next morning finding an opportunity to be alone with him bradley with a tactful mingling of sympathy and directness informed his host that he was cognizant of the disaster that had overtaken the bank and delicately begged him to accept any service he could render him pardon me he said if i speak as plainly to you as i would to your son my friendship for him justifies an equal frankness to any one he loves but i should not intrude upon your confidence if i did not believe that my knowledge and assistance might be of benefit to you although i did not sell my lands to richardson or approve of his methods he continued i fear it was some suggestion of mine that eventually induced him to form the larger and more disastrous scheme that ruined the bank so you see he added lightly i claim a right to offer you my services touched by bradleys sincerity and discreet intelligence sir robert was equally frank during the recital of his californian investmentsa chronicle of almost fatuous speculation and imbecile enterprisebradley was profoundly moved at the naive ignorance of business and hopeless ingenuousness of this old habitue of a cynical world and an intriguing and insincere society to whom no scheme had been too wild for acceptance as bradley listened with a halfsaddened smile to the grave visions of this aged enthusiast he remembered the sons unsophisticated simplicity what he had considered as the boyishness of immaturity was the taint of the utterly unpractical mainwaring blood it was upon this blood and others like it that oldenhurst had for centuries waxed and fattened  bradley was true to his promise of assistance and with the aid of two or three of his brothermillionaires whose knowledge of the resources of the locality was no less powerful and convincing than the security of their actual wealth managed to stay the immediate action of the catastrophe until the affairs of the sierran land and timber company could be examined and some plan of reconstruction arranged  during this interval of five months in which the credit of sir robert mainwaring was preserved with the secret of his disaster bradley was a frequent and welcome visitor to oldenhurst apart from his strange and chivalrous friendship for the mainwaringswhich was as incomprehensible to sir robert as sir roberts equally eccentric and quixotic speculations had been to bradleyhe began to feel a singular and weird fascination for the place a patient martyr in the vast london house he had taken for his wife and cousins amusement he loved to escape the loneliness of its autumn solitude or the occasional greater loneliness of his wifes social triumphs the handsome thoughtful man who sometimes appeared at the foot of his wifes table or melted away like a wellbred ghost in the hollow emptiness of her brilliant receptions piqued the languid curiosity of a few a distinguished personage known for his tactful observance of convenances that others forgot had made a point of challenging this gentlemanly apparition and had followed it up with courteous civilities which led to exchange of much respect but no increase of acquaintance he had even spent a week at buckenthorpe with canterbridge in the coverts and lady canterbridge in the musicroom and library he had returned more thoughtful and for some time after was more frequent in his appearances at home and more earnest in his renewed efforts to induce his wife to return to america with him  youll never be happy anywhere but in california among those common people she replied and while i was willing to share your poverty there she added dryly i prefer to share your wealth among civilized ladies and gentlemen besides she continued we must consider louise she is as good as engaged to lord dunshunner and i do not intend that you shall make a mess of her affairs here as you did in california  it was the first time he had heard of lord dunshunners proposals it was the first allusion she had ever made to louise and mainwaring  meantime the autumn leaves had fallen silently over the broad terraces of oldenhurst with little changes to the fortunes of the great house itself the christmas houseparty included lady canterbridge whose husband was still detained at homburg in company with dunshunner and bradley whose wife and cousin lingered on the continent he was slightly embarrassed when lady canterbridge turned to him one afternoon as they were returning from the lake and congratulated him abruptly upon louises engagement  perhaps you dont care to be congratulated she said as he did not immediately respond and you had as little to do with it as with that other it is a womans function  what other echoed bradley  lady canterbridge slightly turned her handsome head towards him as she walked unbendingly at his side tell me how you manage to keep your absolute simplicity so fresh do you suppose it wasnt known at oldenhurst that frank had quite compromised himself with miss macy over there  it certainly was not known over there said bradley curtly  dont be angry with me  such an appeal from the tall indifferent woman at his side so confidently superior to criticism and uttered in a low tone made him smile albeit uneasily  i only meant to congratulate you she continued carelessly dunshunner is not a bad sort of fellow and will come into a good property some day and then society is so made up of caprice just now that it is well for your wifes cousin to make the most of her opportunities while they last she is very popular now but next season seeing that bradley remained silent she did not finish the sentence but said with her usual abruptness do you know a miss araminta eulalie sharpe  bradley started could any one recognize honest minty in the hopeless vulgarity which this fine lady had managed to carelessly import into her name his eye kindled  she is an old friend of mine lady canterbridge  how fortunate then i can please you by giving you good news of her she is the coming sensation they say she is very rich but quite one of the people you know in fact she makes no scruples of telling you her father was a blacksmith i think and takes the dear old man with her everywhere fitzharry raves about her and says her naivete is something too delicious she is regularly in with some of the best people already lady dungeness has taken her up and northforeland is only waiting for your cousins engagement to be able to go over decently shall i ask her to buckenthorpecome now as an apology for my rudeness to your cousin she was very womanly now in spite of her high collar her straight back and her tightlyfitting jacket as she stood there smiling suddenly her smile faded she drew her breath in quickly  she had caught a glimpse of his usually thoughtful face and eyes now illuminated with some pleasant memory  thank you he said smilingly yet with a certain hesitation as he thought of the lookout and araminta eulalie sharpe and tried to reconcile them with the lady before him i should like it very much  then you have known miss sharpe a long time continued lady canterbridge as they walked on  while we were at the lookout she was our nearest neighbor  and i suppose your wife will consider it quite proper for you to see her again at my house said lady canterbridge with a return of conventional levity  oh quite said bradley  they had reached the low normanarched sideentrance to the quadrangle as bradley swung open the boltstudded oaken door to let her pass she said carelessly  then you are not coming in now  no i shall walk a little longer  and i am quite forgiven  i am thanking you very much he said smiling directly into her blue eyes she lowered them and vanished into the darkness of the passage  the news of mintys success was further corroborated by sir robert who later that evening called bradley into the study frank has been writing from nice that he has renewed his acquaintance with some old californian friends of yoursa mr and miss sharpe lady canterbridge says that they are well known in london to some of our friends but i would like to ask you something about them lady mainwaring was on the point of inviting them here when i received a letter from mr sharpe asking for a business interview pray who is this sharpe  you say he writes for a business interview asked bradley  yes  bradley hesitated for a moment and then said quietly perhaps then i am justified in a breach of confidence to him in order to answer your question he is the man who has assumed all the liabilities of the sierran land and timber company to enable the bank to resume payment but he did it on the condition that you were never to know it for the rest he was a blacksmith who made a fortune as lady canterbridge will tell you  how very oddhow kind i mean i should like to have been civil to him on franks account alone  i should see him on business and be civil to him afterwards sir robert received the americans levity with his usual seriousness  no they must come here for christmas his daughter is  araminta eulalie sharpe said bradley in defiant memory of lady canterbridge  sir robert winced audibly i shall rely on you my dear boy to help me make it pleasant for them he said  christmas came but not minty it drew a large contingent from oldenhurst to the quaint old church who came to view the greenwreathed monuments and walls spotted with crimson berries as if with the blood of former oldenhurst warriors and to impress the wondering villagers with the ineffable goodness and bounty of the creator towards the lords of oldenhurst and their friends sir robert a little gouty kept the house and bradley somewhat uneasy at the sharpes absence but more distrait with other thoughts wandered listlessly in the long library at the lower angle it was embayed into the octagon space of a former tower which was furnished as a quaint recess for writing or study pierced through its enormous walls with a lanceshaped window hidden by heavy curtains he was gazing abstractedly at the melancholy eyes of sir percival looking down from the dark panel opposite when he heard the crisp rustle of a skirt lady canterbridge tightly and stiffly buttoned in black from her long narrow boots to her slim whitecollared neck stood beside him with a prayerbook in her ungloved hand bradley colored quickly the penetrating incense of the christmas boughs and branches that decked the walls and ceilings mingled with some indefinable intoxicating aura from the woman at his side confused his senses he seemed to be losing himself in some forgotten past coeval with the long quaintlylighted room the rich hangings and the painted ancestor of this handsome woman he recovered himself with an effort and said  you are going to church  i may meet them coming home its all the same you like him she said abruptly pointing to the portrait i thought you did not care for that sort of man over there  a man like that must have felt the impotence of his sacrifice before he died and that condoned everything said bradley thoughtfully  then you dont think him a fool bob says it was a fair bargain for a title and an office and that by dying he escaped trial and the confiscation of what he had  bradley did not reply  i am disturbing your illusions again yet i rather like them i think you are quite capable of a sacrificeperhaps you know what it is already  he felt that she was looking at him he felt equally that he could not respond with a commonplace he was silent  i have offended you again mr bradley she said please be christian and pardon me you know this is a season of peace and goodwill she raised her blue eyes at the same moment to the christmas decorations on the ceiling they were standing before the parted drapery of the lance window midway between the arched curtains hung a spray of mistletoethe conceit of a mischievous housemaid their eyes met it simultaneously  bradley had lady canterbridges slim white hand in his own the next moment voices were heard in the passage and the door nearly opposite to them opened deliberately the idea of their apparent seclusion and half compromising attitude flashed through the minds of both at the same time lady canterbridge stepped quickly backward drawing bradley with her into the embrasure of the window the folds of the curtain swung together and concealed them from view  the door had been opened by the footman ushering in a broadshouldered man who was carrying a travellingbag and an umbrella in his hand dropping into an armchair before the curtain he waved away the footman who even now mechanically repeated a previously vain attempt to relieve the stranger of his luggage  you leave that ere grip sack where it is young man and tell sir robert mainwaring that mr demander sharpe of californy wishes to see himon businesson business do ye hear you hang onter that sentenceon business its about ez much ez you kin carry i reckon and leave that grip sack alone  from behind the curtain bradley made a sudden movement to go forward but lady canterbridgenow quite pale but collectedrestrained him with a warning movement of her hand sir roberts stick and halting step were next heard along the passage and he entered the room his simple and courteous greeting of the stranger was instantly followed by a renewed attack upon the grip sack and a renewed defence of it by the stranger  no sir robert said the voice argumentatively this yers a business interview and until its overif you pleasewell remain ez we air im demander sharpe of californy and i and my darter minty oncet had the pleasure of knowing your boy over thar and of meeting him agin the other day at nice  i think said sir roberts voice gently that these are not the only claims you have upon me i have only a day or two ago heard from mr bradley that i owe to your generous hands and your disinterested liberality the saving of my california fortune  there was the momentary sound of a pushedback chair a stamping of feet and then mr sharpes voice rose high with the blacksmiths old querulous aggrieved utterance  so its that finikin conceited bradley aginthats giv me away ef that mans allfired belief in his being the angel gabriel and danl webster rolled inter one dont beat anythin i suppose that highflyin jaybird kalkilated to put you and me and my gal and yer boy inter harness for his four hoss chariot and he sittin kam on

hurried voice he told me you had pledged him to secrecy and he only revealed it to explain why you wished to see me  there was a grunt of halfplacated wrath from sharpe and then the voice resumed but more deliberately well to come back to business youve got a boy francis and ive got a darter araminty theyve sorter taken a shine to each other and they want to get married mind yerwait a momentit wasnt allus so no sir when my gal araminty first seed your boy in californy she was poor and she didnt kalkilate to get inter anybodys family unbeknownst or on sufferance then she got rich and you got poor and thenhold on a minitshe allows does my girl that there aint any nearer chance o their making a match than they were afore for she isnt goin to hev it said that she married your son fur the chance of some day becomin lady mainwaring  one moment mr sharpe said the voice of the baronet gravely i am both flattered and pained by what i believe to be the kindly object of your visit indeed i may say i have gathered a suspicion of what might be the sequel of this most unhappy acquaintance of my son and your daughter but i cannot believe that he has kept you in ignorance of his unfortunate prospects and his still more unfortunate state of health  when i told ye to hold on a minit continued the blacksmiths voice with a touch of querulousness in its accent that was jist wot i was comin to i knowed part of it from my own pocket she knowed the rest of it from his lip and the doctors she interviewed and then she says to mesez my girl mintypop she sez hes got nothing to live for now but his title and that he never may live to get so that i think ye kin jist go pop and fairly and squarely as a honest man ask his father to let me hev him thems my darters own words sir robert and when i tell yer that shes got a million o dollars to back them yell know she means business every time  did francis know that you were coming here  bless ye no he dont know that she would have him ef it kem to that he aint even asked her she wouldnt let him until she was sure of you  then you mean to say there is no engagement  in course not i reckoned to do the square thing first with ye  the halting step of the baronet crossing the room was heard distinctly he had stopped beside sharpe my dear mr sharpe he said in a troubled voice i cannot permit this sacrifice it is tootoo great  then said sharpe s voice querulously im afraid we must do without your permission i didnt reckon to find a sort o british jim bradley in you if you cant permit my darter to sacrifice herself by marryin your son i cant permit her to sacrifice her love and him by not marryin him so i reckon this yer interview is over  i am afraid we are both old fools mr sharpe butwe will talk this over with lady mainwaring come there was evidently a slight struggle near the chair over some inanimate object but the next moment the baronets voice rose persuasively really i must insist upon relieving you of your bag and umbrella  well if youll let me telegraph yes to minty i dont care if yer do  when the room was quiet again lady canterbridge and james bradley silently slipped from the curtain and without a word separated at the door   there was a merry christmas at oldenhurst and at nice but whether mintys loving sacrifice was accepted or not or whether she ever reigned as lady mainwaring or lived an untitled widow i cannot say but as oldenhurst still exists in all its pride and power it is presumed that the peril that threatened its fortunes was averted and that if another heroine was not found worthy of a frame in its picturegallery at least it had been sustained as of old by devotion and renunciation
