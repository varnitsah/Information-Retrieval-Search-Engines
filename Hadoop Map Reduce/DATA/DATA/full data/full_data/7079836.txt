7079836	the chimes                               a goblin story                                       of                    some bells that rang an old year out                             and a new year in     chapter i—first quarter   there are not many people—and as it is desirable that a storyteller and a storyreader should establish a mutual understanding as soon as possible i beg it to be noticed that i confine this observation neither to young people nor to little people but extend it to all conditions of people little and big young and old yet growing up or already growing down again—there are not i say many people who would care to sleep in a church  i don’t mean at sermontime in warm weather when the thing has actually been done once or twice but in the night and alone  a great multitude of persons will be violently astonished i know by this position in the broad bold day  but it applies to night  it must be argued by night and i will undertake to maintain it successfully on any gusty winter’s night appointed for the purpose with any one opponent chosen from the rest who will meet me singly in an old churchyard before an old churchdoor and will previously empower me to lock him in if needful to his satisfaction until morning  for the nightwind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round a building of that sort and moaning as it goes and of trying with its unseen hand the windows and the doors and seeking out some crevices by which to enter  and when it has got in as one not finding what it seeks whatever that may be it wails and howls to issue forth again and not content with stalking through the aisles and gliding round and round the pillars and tempting the deep organ soars up to the roof and strives to rend the rafters then flings itself despairingly upon the stones below and passes muttering into the vaults  anon it comes up stealthily and creeps along the walls seeming to read in whispers the inscriptions sacred to the dead  at some of these it breaks out shrilly as with laughter and at others moans and cries as if it were lamenting  it has a ghostly sound too lingering within the altar where it seems to chaunt in its wild way of wrong and murder done and false gods worshipped in defiance of the tables of the law which look so fair and smooth but are so flawed and broken  ugh  heaven preserve us sitting snugly round the fire  it has an awful voice that wind at midnight singing in a church  but high up in the steeple  there the foul blast roars and whistles high up in the steeple where it is free to come and go through many an airy arch and loophole and to twist and twine itself about the giddy stair and twirl the groaning weathercock and make the very tower shake and shiver  high up in the steeple where the belfry is and iron rails are ragged with rust and sheets of lead and copper shrivelled by the changing weather crackle and heave beneath the unaccustomed tread and birds stuff shabby nests into corners of old oaken joists and beams and dust grows old and grey and speckled spiders indolent and fat with long security swing idly to and fro in the vibration of the bells and never loose their hold upon their threadspun castles in the air or climb up sailorlike in quick alarm or drop upon the ground and ply a score of nimble legs to save one life  high up in the steeple of an old church far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it is the wild and dreary place at night and high up in the steeple of an old church dwelt the chimes i tell of  they were old chimes trust me  centuries ago these bells had been baptized by bishops so many centuries ago that the register of their baptism was lost long long before the memory of man and no one knew their names  they had had their godfathers and godmothers these bells for my own part by the way i would rather incur the responsibility of being godfather to a bell than a boy and had their silver mugs no doubt besides  but time had mowed down their sponsors and henry the eighth had melted down their mugs and they now hung nameless and mugless in the churchtower  not speechless though  far from it  they had clear loud lusty sounding voices had these bells and far and wide they might be heard upon the wind  much too sturdy chimes were they to be dependent on the pleasure of the wind moreover for fighting gallantly against it when it took an adverse whim they would pour their cheerful notes into a listening ear right royally and bent on being heard on stormy nights by some poor mother watching a sick child or some lone wife whose husband was at sea they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering nor’ wester aye ‘all to fits’ as toby veck said—for though they chose to call him trotty veck his name was toby and nobody could make it anything else either except tobias without a special act of parliament he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the bells had been in theirs though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing  for my part i confess myself of toby veck’s belief for i am sure he had opportunities enough of forming a correct one  and whatever toby veck said i say  and i take my stand by toby veck although he did stand all day long and weary work it was just outside the churchdoor  in fact he was a ticketporter toby veck and waited there for jobs  and a breezy gooseskinned bluenosed redeyed stonytoed toothchattering place it was to wait in in the wintertime as toby veck well knew  the wind came tearing round the corner—especially the east wind—as if it had sallied forth express from the confines of the earth to have a blow at toby  and oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected for bouncing round the corner and passing toby it would suddenly wheel round again as if it cried ‘why here he is’  incontinently his little white apron would be caught up over his head like a naughty boy’s garments and his feeble little cane would be seen to wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand and his legs would undergo tremendous agitation and toby himself all aslant and facing now in this direction now in that would be so banged and buffeted and to touzled and worried and hustled and lifted off his feet as to render it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive miracle that he wasn’t carried up bodily into the air as a colony of frogs or snails or other very portable creatures sometimes are and rained down again to the great astonishment of the natives on some strange corner of the world where ticketporters are unknown  but windy weather in spite of its using him so roughly was after all a sort of holiday for toby  that’s the fact  he didn’t seem to wait so long for a sixpence in the wind as at other times the having to fight with that boisterous element took off his attention and quite freshened him up when he was getting hungry and lowspirited  a hard frost too or a fall of snow was an event and it seemed to do him good somehow or other—it would have been hard to say in what respect though toby  so wind and frost and snow and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail were toby veck’s redletter days  wet weather was the worst the cold damp clammy wet that wrapped him up like a moist greatcoat—the only kind of greatcoat toby owned or could have added to his comfort by dispensing with  wet days when the rain came slowly thickly obstinately down when the street’s throat like his own was choked with mist when smoking umbrellas passed and repassed spinning round and round like so many teetotums as they knocked against each other on the crowded footway throwing off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings when gutters brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy when the wet from the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip drip drip on toby making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time those were the days that tried him  then indeed you might see toby looking anxiously out from his shelter in an angle of the church wall—such a meagre shelter that in summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a goodsized walking stick upon the sunny pavement—with a disconsolate and lengthened face but coming out a minute afterwards to warm himself by exercise and trotting up and down some dozen times he would brighten even then and go back more brightly to his niche  they called him trotty from his pace which meant speed if it didn’t make it  he could have walked faster perhaps most likely but rob him of his trot and toby would have taken to his bed and died  it bespattered him with mud in dirty weather it cost him a world of trouble he could have walked with infinitely greater ease but that was one reason for his clinging to it so tenaciously  a weak small spare old man he was a very hercules this toby in his good intentions  he loved to earn his money  he delighted to believe—toby was very poor and couldn’t well afford to part with a delight—that he was worth his salt  with a shilling or an eighteenpenny message or small parcel in hand his courage always high rose higher  as he trotted on he would call out to fast postmen ahead of him to get out of the way devoutly believing that in the natural course of things he must inevitably overtake and run them down and he had perfect faith—not often tested—in his being able to carry anything that man could lift  thus even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet day toby trotted  making with his leaky shoes a crooked line of slushy footprints in the mire and blowing on his chilly hands and rubbing them against each other poorly defended from the searching cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted with a private apartment only for the thumb and a common room or tap for the rest of the fingers toby with his knees bent and his cane beneath his arm still trotted  falling out into the road to look up at the belfry when the chimes resounded toby trotted still  he made this last excursion several times a day for they were company to him and when he heard their voices he had an interest in glancing at their lodgingplace and thinking how they were moved and what hammers beat upon them  perhaps he was the more curious about these bells because there were points of resemblance between themselves and him they hung there in all weathers with the wind and rain driving in upon them facing only the outsides of all those houses never getting any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the windows or came puffing out of the chimney tops and incapable of participation in any of the good things that were constantly being handled through the street doors and the area railings to prodigious cooks  faces came and went at many windows sometimes pretty faces youthful faces pleasant faces sometimes the reverse but toby knew no more though he often speculated on these trifles standing idle in the streets whence they came or where they went or whether when the lips moved one kind word was said of him in all the year than did the chimes themselves  toby was not a casuist—that he knew of at least—and i don’t mean to say that when he began to take to the bells and to knit up his first rough acquaintance with them into something of a closer and more delicate woof he passed through these considerations one by one or held any formal review or great fieldday in his thoughts  but what i mean to say and do say is that as the functions of toby’s body his digestive organs for example did of their own cunning and by a great many operations of which he was altogether ignorant and the knowledge of which would have astonished him very much arrive at a certain end so his mental faculties without his privity or concurrence set all these wheels and springs in motion with a thousand others when they worked to bring about his liking for the bells  and though i had said his love i would not have recalled the word though it would scarcely have expressed his complicated feeling  for being but a simple man he invested them with a strange and solemn character  they were so mysterious often heard and never seen so high up so far off so full of such a deep strong melody that he regarded them with a species of awe and sometimes when he looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower he half expected to be beckoned to by something which was not a bell and yet was what he had heard so often sounding in the chimes  for all this toby scouted with indignation a certain flying rumour that the chimes were haunted as implying the possibility of their being connected with any evil thing  in short they were very often in his ears and very often in his thoughts but always in his good opinion and he very often got such a crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide open at the steeple where they hung that he was fain to take an extra trot or two afterwards to cure it  the very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day when the last drowsy sound of twelve o’clock just struck was humming like a melodious monster of a bee and not by any means a busy bee all through the steeple  ‘dinnertime eh’ said toby trotting up and down before the church ‘ah’  toby’s nose was very red and his eyelids were very red and he winked very much and his shoulders were very near his ears and his legs were very stiff and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty side of cool  ‘dinnertime eh’ repeated toby using his righthand muffler like an infantine boxingglove and punishing his chest for being cold ‘ahhhh’  he took a silent trot after that for a minute or two  ‘there’s nothing’ said toby breaking forth afresh—but here he stopped short in his trot and with a face of great interest and some alarm felt his nose carefully all the way up  it was but a little way not being much of a nose and he had soon finished  ‘i thought it was gone’ said toby trotting off again  ‘it’s all right however  i am sure i couldn’t blame it if it was to go  it has a precious hard service of it in the bitter weather and precious little to look forward to for i don’t take snuff myself  it’s a good deal tried poor creetur at the best of times for when it does get hold of a pleasant whiff or so which an’t too often it’s generally from somebody else’s dinner acoming home from the baker’s’  the reflection reminded him of that other reflection which he had left unfinished  ‘there’s nothing’ said toby ‘more regular in its coming round than dinnertime and nothing less regular in its coming round than dinner that’s the great difference between ’em  it’s took me a long time to find it out  i wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman’s while now to buy that obserwation for the papers or the parliament’  toby was only joking for he gravely shook his head in selfdepreciation  ‘why lord’ said toby  ‘the papers is full of obserwations as it is and so’s the parliament  here’s last week’s paper now’ taking a very dirty one from his pocket and holding it from him at arm’s length ‘full of obserwations  full of obserwations  i like to know the news as well as any man’ said toby slowly folding it a little smaller and putting it in his pocket again ‘but it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper now  it frightens me almost  i don’t know what we poor people are coming to  lord send we may be coming to something better in the new year nigh upon us’  ‘why father father’ said a pleasant voice hard by  but toby not hearing it continued to trot backwards and forwards musing as he went and talking to himself  ‘it seems as if we can’t go right or do right or be righted’ said toby  ‘i hadn’t much schooling myself when i was young and i can’t make out whether we have any business on the face of the earth or not sometimes i think we must have—a little and sometimes i think we must be intruding  i get so puzzled sometimes that i am not even able to make up my mind whether there is any good at all in us or whether we are born bad  we seem to be dreadful things we seem to give a deal of trouble we are always being complained of and guarded against  one way or other we fill the papers  talk of a new year’ said toby mournfully  ‘i can bear up as well as another man at most times better than a good many for i am as strong as a lion and all men an’t but supposing it should really be that we have no right to a new year—supposing we really are intruding—’  ‘why father father’ said the pleasant voice again  toby heard it this time started stopped and shortening his sight which had been directed a long way off as seeking the enlightenment in the very heart of the approaching year found himself face to face with his own child and looking close into her eyes  bright eyes they were  eyes that would bear a world of looking in before their depth was fathomed  dark eyes that reflected back the eyes which searched them not flashingly or at the owner’s will but with a clear calm honest patient radiance claiming kindred with that light which heaven called into being  eyes that were beautiful and true and beaming with hope  with hope so young and fresh with hope so buoyant vigorous and bright despite the twenty years of work and poverty on which they had looked that they became a voice to trotty veck and said ‘i think we have some business here—a little’  trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes and squeezed the blooming face between his hands  ‘why pet’ said trotty  ‘what’s to do  i didn’t expect you today meg’  ‘neither did i expect to come father’ cried the girl nodding her head and smiling as she spoke  ‘but here i am  and not alone not alone’  ‘why you don’t mean to say’ observed trotty looking curiously at a covered basket which she carried in her hand ‘that you—’  ‘smell it father dear’ said meg  ‘only smell it’  trotty was going to lift up the cover at once in a great hurry when she gaily interposed her hand  ‘no no no’ said meg with the glee of a child  ‘lengthen it out a little  let me just lift up the corner just the little tiny corner you know’ said meg suiting the action to the word with the utmost gentleness and speaking very softly as if she were afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket ‘there  now  what’s that’  toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket and cried out in a rapture  ‘why it’s hot’  ‘it’s burning hot’ cried meg  ‘ha ha ha  it’s scalding hot’  ‘ha ha ha’ roared toby with a sort of kick  ‘it’s scalding hot’  ‘but what is it father’ said meg  ‘come  you haven’t guessed what it is  and you must guess what it is  i can’t think of taking it out till you guess what it is  don’t be in such a hurry  wait a minute  a little bit more of the cover  now guess’  meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too soon shrinking away as she held the basket towards him curling up her pretty shoulders stopping her ear with her hand as if by so doing she could keep the right word out of toby’s lips and laughing softly the whole time  meanwhile toby putting a hand on each knee bent down his nose to the basket and took a long inspiration at the lid the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process as if he were inhaling laughing gas  ‘ah  it’s very nice’ said toby  ‘it an’t—i suppose it an’t polonies’  ‘no no no’ cried meg delighted  ‘nothing like polonies’  ‘no’ said toby after another sniff  ‘it’s—it’s mellower than polonies it’s very nice  it improves every moment  it’s too decided for trotters  an’t it’  meg was in an ecstasy  he could not have gone wider of the mark than trotters—except polonies  ‘liver’ said toby communing with himself  ‘no  there’s a mildness about it that don’t answer to liver  pettitoes  no  it an’t faint enough for pettitoes  it wants the stringiness of cocks’ heads  and i know it an’t sausages  i’ll tell you what it is  it’s chitterlings’  ‘no it an’t’ cried meg in a burst of delight  ‘no it an’t’  ‘why what am i athinking of’ said toby suddenly recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume  ‘i shall forget my own name next  it’s tripe’  tripe it was and meg in high joy protested he should say in half a minute more it was the best tripe ever stewed  ‘and so’ said meg busying herself exultingly with the basket ‘i’ll lay the cloth at once father for i have brought the tripe in a basin and tied the basin up in a pockethandkerchief and if i like to be proud for once and spread that for a cloth and call it a cloth there’s no law to prevent me is there father’  ‘not that i know of my dear’ said toby  ‘but they’re always abringing up some new law or other’  ‘and according to what i was reading you in the paper the other day father what the judge said you know we poor people are supposed to know them all  ha ha  what a mistake  my goodness me how clever they think us’  ‘yes my dear’ cried trotty ‘and they’d be very fond of any one of us that did know ’em all  he’d grow fat upon the work he’d get that man and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighbourhood  very much so’  ‘he’d eat his dinner with an appetite whoever he was if it smelt like this’ said meg cheerfully  ‘make haste for there’s a hot potato besides and half a pint of freshdrawn beer in a bottle  where will you dine father  on the post or on the steps  dear dear how grand we are  two places to choose from’  ‘the steps today my pet’ said trotty  ‘steps in dry weather  post in wet  there’s a greater conveniency in the steps at all times because of the sitting down but they’re rheumatic in the damp’  ‘then here’ said meg clapping her hands after a moment’s bustle ‘here it is all ready  and beautiful it looks  come father  come’  since his discovery of the contents of the basket trotty had been standing looking at her—and had been speaking too—in an abstracted manner which showed that though she was the object of his thoughts and eyes to the exclusion even of tripe he neither saw nor thought about her as she was at that moment but had before him some imaginary rough sketch or drama of her future life  roused now by her cheerful summons he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just coming upon him and trotted to her side  as he was stooping to sit down the chimes rang  ‘amen’ said trotty pulling off his hat and looking up towards them  ‘amen to the bells father’ cried meg  ‘they broke in like a grace my dear’ said trotty taking his seat ‘they’d say a good one i am sure if they could  many’s the kind thing they say to me’  ‘the bells do father’ laughed meg as she set the basin and a knife and fork before him  ‘well’  ‘seem to my pet’ said trotty falling to with great vigour  ‘and where’s the difference  if i hear ’em what does it matter whether they speak it or not  why bless you my dear’ said toby pointing at the tower with his fork and becoming more animated under the influence of dinner ‘how often have i heard them bells say “toby veck toby veck keep a good heart toby  toby veck toby veck keep a good heart toby” a million times  more’  ‘well i never’ cried meg  she had though—over and over again  for it was toby’s constant topic  ‘when things is very bad’ said trotty ‘very bad indeed i mean almost at the worst then it’s “toby veck toby veck job coming soon toby toby veck toby veck job coming soon toby”  that way’  ‘and it comes—at last father’ said meg with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice  ‘always’ answered the unconscious toby  ‘never fails’  while this discourse was holding trotty made no pause in his attack upon the savoury meat before him but cut and ate and cut and drank and cut and chewed and dodged about from tripe to hot potato and from hot potato back again to tripe with an unctuous and unflagging relish  but happening now to look all round the street—in case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window for a porter—his eyes in coming back again encountered meg sitting opposite to him with her arms folded and only busy in watching his progress with a smile of happiness  ‘why lord forgive me’ said trotty dropping his knife and fork  ‘my dove  meg why didn’t you tell me what a beast i was’  ‘father’  ‘sitting here’ said trotty in penitent explanation ‘cramming and stuffing and gorging myself and you before me there never so much as breaking your precious fast nor wanting to when—’  ‘but i have broken it father’ interposed his daughter laughing ‘all to bits  i have had my dinner’  ‘nonsense’ said trotty  ‘two dinners in one day  it an’t possible you might as well tell me that two new year’s days will come together or that i have had a gold head all my life and never changed it’  ‘i have had my dinner father for all that’ said meg coming nearer to him  ‘and if you’ll go on with yours i’ll tell you how and where and how your dinner came to be brought and—and something else besides’  toby still appeared incredulous but she looked into his face with her clear eyes and laying her hand upon his shoulder motioned him to go on while the meat was hot  so trotty took up his knife and fork again and went to work  but much more slowly than before and shaking his head as if he were not at all pleased with himself  ‘i had my dinner father’ said meg after a little hesitation ‘with—with richard  his dinnertime was early and as he brought his dinner with him when he came to see me we—we had it together father’  trotty took a little beer and smacked his lips  then he said ‘oh’—because she waited  ‘and richard says father—’ meg resumed  then stopped  ‘what does richard say meg’ asked toby  ‘richard says father—’  another stoppage  ‘richard’s a long time saying it’ said toby  ‘he says then father’ meg continued lifting up her eyes at last and speaking in a tremble but quite plainly ‘another year is nearly gone and where is the use of waiting on from year to year when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now  he says we are poor now father and we shall be poor then but we are young now and years will make us old before we know it  he says that if we wait people in our condition until we see our way quite clearly the way will be a narrow one indeed—the common way—the grave father’  a bolder man than trotty veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness largely to deny it  trotty held his peace  ‘and how hard father to grow old and die and think we might have cheered and helped each other  how hard in all our lives to love each other and to grieve apart to see each other working changing growing old and grey  even if i got the better of it and forgot him which i never could oh father dear how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now and live to have it slowly drained out every drop without the recollection of one happy moment of a woman’s life to stay behind and comfort me and make me better’  trotty sat quite still  meg dried her eyes and said more gaily that is to say with here a laugh and there a sob and here a laugh and sob together  ‘so richard says father as his work was yesterday made certain for some time to come and as i love him and have loved him full three years—ah longer than that if he knew it—will i marry him on new year’s day the best and happiest day he says in the whole year and one that is almost sure to bring good fortune with it  it’s a short notice father—isn’t it—but i haven’t my fortune to be settled or my wedding dresses to be made like the great ladies father have i  and he said so much and said it in his way so strong and earnest and all the time so kind and gentle that i said i’d come and talk to you father  and as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning unexpectedly i am sure and as you have fared very poorly for a whole week and as i couldn’t help wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me father i made a little treat and brought it to surprise you’  ‘and see how he leaves it cooling on the step’ said another voice  it was the voice of this same richard who had come upon them unobserved and stood before the father and daughter looking down upon them with a face as glowing as the iron on which his stout sledgehammer daily rung a handsome wellmade powerful youngster he was with eyes that sparkled like the redhot droppings from a furnace fire black hair that curled about his swarthy temples rarely and a smile—a smile that bore out meg’s eulogium on his style of conversation  ‘see how he leaves it cooling on the step’ said richard  ‘meg don’t know what he likes  not she’  trotty all action and enthusiasm immediately reached up his hand to richard and was going to address him in great hurry when the housedoor opened without any warning and a footman very nearly put his foot into the tripe  ‘out of the vays here will you  you must always go and be asettin on our steps must you  you can’t go and give a turn to none of the neighbours never can’t you  will you clear the road or won’t you’  strictly speaking the last question was irrelevant as they had already done it  ‘what’s the matter what’s the matter’ said the gentleman for whom the door was opened coming out of the house at that kind of lightheavy pace—that peculiar compromise between a walk and a jogtrot—with which a gentleman upon the smooth downhill of life wearing creaking boots a watchchain and clean linen may come out of his house not only without any abatement of his dignity but with an expression of having important and wealthy engagements elsewhere  ‘what’s the matter  what’s the matter’  ‘you’re always abeing begged and prayed upon your bended knees you are’ said the footman with great emphasis to trotty veck ‘to let our doorsteps be  why don’t you let ’em be  can’t you let ’em be’  ‘there  that’ll do that’ll do’ said the gentleman  ‘halloa there porter’ beckoning with his head to trotty veck  ‘come here  what’s that  your dinner’  ‘yes sir’ said trotty leaving it behind him in a corner  ‘don’t leave it there’ exclaimed the gentleman  ‘bring it here bring it here  so  this is your dinner is it’  ‘yes sir’ repeated trotty looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious titbit which the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of the fork  two other gentlemen had come out with him  one was a lowspirited gentleman of middle age of a meagre habit and a disconsolate face who kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepperandsalt trousers very large and dog’seared from that custom and was not particularly well brushed or washed  the other a fullsized sleek wellconditioned gentleman in a blue coat with bright buttons and a white cravat  this gentleman had a very red face as if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head which perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold about the heart  he who had toby’s meat upon the fork called to the first one by the name of filer and they both drew near together  mr filer being exceedingly shortsighted was obliged to go so close to the remnant of toby’s dinner before he could make out what it was that toby’s heart leaped up into his mouth  but mr filer didn’t eat it  ‘this is a description of animal food alderman’ said filer making little punches in it with a pencilcase ‘commonly known to the labouring population of this country by the name of tripe’  the alderman laughed and winked for he was a merry fellow alderman cute  oh and a sly fellow too  a knowing fellow  up to everything not to be imposed upon  deep in the people’s hearts  he knew them cute did  i believe you  ‘but who eats tripe’ said mr filer looking round  ‘tripe is without an exception the least economical and the most wasteful article of consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce the loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be in the boiling seveneights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other animal substance whatever  tripe is more expensive properly understood than the hothouse pineapple  taking into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone and forming a low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals reasonably well butchered would yield i find that the waste on that amount of tripe if boiled would victual a garrison of five hundred men for five months of thirtyone days each and a february over  the waste the waste’  trotty stood aghast and his legs shook under him  he seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand  ‘who eats tripe’ said mr filer warmly  ‘who eats tripe’  trotty made a miserable bow  ‘you do do you’ said mr filer  ‘then i’ll tell you something  you snatch your tripe my friend out of the mouths of widows and orphans’  ‘i hope not sir’ said trotty faintly  ‘i’d sooner die of want’  ‘divide the amount of tripe beforementioned alderman’ said mr filer ‘by the estimated number of existing widows and orphans and the result will be one pennyweight of tripe to each  not a grain is left for that man  consequently he’s a robber’  trotty was so shocked that it gave him no concern to see the alderman finish the tripe himself  it was a relief to get rid of it anyhow  ‘and what do you say’ asked the alderman jocosely of the redfaced gentleman in the blue coat  ‘you have heard friend filer  what do you say’  ‘what’s it possible to say’ returned the gentleman  ‘what is to be said  who can take any interest in a fellow like this’ meaning trotty ‘in such degenerate times as these  look at him  what an object  the good old times the grand old times the great old times  those were the times for a bold peasantry and all that sort of thing  those were the times for every sort of thing in fact  there’s nothing nowadays ah’ sighed the redfaced gentleman  ‘the good old times the good old times’  the gentleman didn’t specify what particular times he alluded to nor did he say whether he objected to the present times from a disinterested consciousness that they had done nothing very remarkable in producing himself  ‘the good old times the good old times’ repeated the gentleman  ‘what times they were  they were the only times  it’s of no use talking about any other times or discussing what the people are in these times  you don’t call these times do you  i don’t  look into strutt’s costumes and see what a porter used to be in any of the good old english reigns’  ‘he hadn’t in his very best circumstances a shirt to his back or a stocking to his foot and there was scarcely a vegetable in all england for him to put into his mouth’ said mr filer  ‘i can prove it by tables’  but still the redfaced gentleman extolled the good old times the grand old times the great old times  no matter what anybody else said he still went turning round and round in one set form of words concerning them as a poor squirrel turns and turns in its revolving cage touching the mechanism and trick of which it has probably quite as distinct perceptions as ever this redfaced gentleman had of his deceased millennium  it is possible that poor trotty’s faith in these very vague old times was not entirely destroyed for he felt vague enough at that moment  one thing however was plain to him in the midst of his distress to wit that however these gentlemen might differ in details his misgivings of that morning and of many other mornings were well founded  ‘no no we can’t go right or do right’ thought trotty in despair  ‘there is no good in us  we are born bad’  but trotty had a father’s heart within him which had somehow got into his breast in spite of this decree and he could not bear that meg in the blush of her brief joy should have her fortune read by these wise gentlemen  ‘god help her’ thought poor trotty  ‘she will know it soon enough’  he anxiously signed therefore to the young smith to take her away but he was so busy talking to her softly at a little distance that he only became conscious of this desire simultaneously with alderman cute now the alderman had not yet had his say but he was a philosopher too—practical though  oh very practical—and as he had no idea of losing any portion of his audience he cried ‘stop’  ‘now you know’ said the alderman addressing his two friends with a selfcomplacent smile upon his face which was habitual to him ‘i am a plain man and a practical man and i go to work in a plain practical way  that’s my way  there is not the least mystery or difficulty in dealing with this sort of people if you only understand ’em and can talk to ’em in their own manner  now you porter  don’t you ever tell me or anybody else my friend that you haven’t always enough to eat and of the best because i know better  i have tasted your tripe you know and you can’t “chaff” me  you understand what “chaff” means eh  that’s the right word isn’t it  ha ha ha lord bless you’ said the alderman turning to his friends again ‘it’s the easiest thing on earth to deal with this sort of people if you understand ’em’  famous man for the common people alderman cute  never out of temper with them  easy affable joking knowing gentleman  ‘you see my friend’ pursued the alderman ‘there’s a great deal of nonsense talked about want—“hard up” you know that’s the phrase isn’t it ha ha ha—and i intend to put it down  there’s a certain amount of cant in vogue about starvation and i mean to put it down  that’s all lord bless you’ said the alderman turning to his friends again ‘you may put down anything among this sort of people if you only know the way to set about it’  trotty took meg’s hand and drew it through his arm  he didn’t seem to know what he was doing though  ‘your daughter eh’ said the alderman chucking her familiarly under the chin  always affable with the working classes alderman cute  knew what pleased them  not a bit of pride  ‘where’s her mother’ asked that worthy gentleman  ‘dead’ said toby  ‘her mother got up linen and was called to heaven when she was born’  ‘not to get up linen there i suppose’ remarked the alderman pleasantly  toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in heaven from her old pursuits  but query if mrs alderman cute had gone to heaven would mr alderman cute have pictured her as holding any state or station there  ‘and you’re making love to her are you’ said cute to the young smith  ‘yes’ returned richard quickly for he was nettled by the question ‘and we are going to be married on new year’s day’  ‘what do you mean’ cried filer sharply  ‘married’  ‘why yes we’re thinking of it master’ said richard  ‘we’re rather in a hurry you see in case it should be put down first’  ‘ah’ cried filer with a groan  ‘put that down indeed alderman and you’ll do something  married  married  the ignorance of the first principles of political economy on the part of these people their improvidence their wickedness is by heavens enough to—now look at that couple will you’  well  they were worth looking at  and marriage seemed as reasonable and fair a deed as they need have in contemplation  ‘a man may live to be as old as methuselah’ said mr filer ‘and may labour all his life for the benefit of such people as those and may heap up facts on figures facts on figures facts on figures mountains high and dry and he can no more hope to persuade ’em that they have no right or business to be married than he can hope to persuade ’em that they have no earthly right or business to be born  and that we know they haven’t  we reduced it to a mathematical certainty long ago’  alderman cute was mightily diverted and laid his right forefinger on the side of his nose as much as to say to both his friends ‘observe me will you  keep your eye on the practical man’—and called meg to him  ‘come here my girl’ said alderman cute  the young blood of her lover had been mounting wrathfully within the last few minutes and he was indisposed to let her come  but setting a constraint upon himself he came forward with a stride as meg approached and stood beside her  trotty kept her hand within his arm still but looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream  ‘now i’m going to give you a word or two of good advice my girl’ said the alderman in his nice easy way  ‘it’s my place to give advice you know because i’m a justice  you know i’m a justice don’t you’  meg timidly said ‘yes’  but everybody knew alderman cute was a justice oh dear so active a justice always  who such a mote of brightness in the public eye as cute  ‘you are going to be married you say’ pursued the alderman  ‘very unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex  but never mind that after you are married you’ll quarrel with your husband and come to be a distressed wife  you may think not but you will because i tell you so now i give you fair warning that i have made up my mind to put distressed wives down  so don’t be brought before me  you’ll have children—boys  those boys will grow up bad of course and run wild in the streets without shoes and stockings  mind my young friend  i’ll convict ’em summarily every one for i am determined to put boys without shoes and stockings down  perhaps your husband will die young most likely and leave you with a baby  then you’ll be turned out of doors and wander up and down the streets  now don’t wander near me my dear for i am resolved to put all wandering mothers down  all young mothers of all sorts and kinds it’s my determination to put down  don’t think to plead illness as an excuse with me or babies as an excuse with me for all sick persons and young children i hope you know the churchservice but i’m afraid not i am determined to put down  and if you attempt desperately and ungratefully and impiously and fraudulently attempt to drown yourself or hang yourself i’ll have no pity for you for i have made up my mind to put all suicide down  if there is one thing’ said the alderman with his selfsatisfied smile ‘on which i can be said to have made up my mind more than on another it is to put suicide down  so don’t try it on  that’s the phrase isn’t it  ha ha now we understand each other’  toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad to see that meg had turned a deadly white and dropped her lover’s hand  ‘and as for you you dull dog’ said the alderman turning with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith ‘what are you thinking of being married for  what do you want to be married for you silly fellow  if i was a fine young strapping chap like you i should be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a woman’s apronstrings  why she’ll be an old woman before you’re a middleaged man  and a pretty figure you’ll cut then with a draggletailed wife and a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go’  o he knew how to banter the common people alderman cute  ‘there  go along with you’ said the alderman ‘and repent  don’t make such a fool of yourself as to get married on new year’s day  you’ll think very differently of it long before next new year’s day a trim young fellow like you with all the girls looking after you  there  go along with you’  they went along  not arm in arm or hand in hand or interchanging bright glances but she in tears he gloomy and downlooking  were these the hearts that had so lately made old toby’s leap up from its faintness  no no  the alderman a blessing on his head had put them down  ‘as you happen to be here’ said the alderman to toby ‘you shall carry a letter for me  can you be quick  you’re an old man’  toby who had been looking after meg quite stupidly made shift to murmur out that he was very quick and very strong  ‘how old are you’ inquired the alderman  ‘i’m over sixty sir’ said toby  ‘o  this man’s a great deal past the average age you know’ cried mr filer breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying but this really was carrying matters a little too far  ‘i feel i’m intruding sir’ said toby  ‘i—i misdoubted it this morning oh dear me’  the alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket toby would have got a shilling too but mr filer clearly showing that in that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of ninepencehalfpenny apiece he only got sixpence and thought himself very well off to get that  then the alderman gave an arm to each of his friends and walked off in high feather but he immediately came hurrying back alone as if he had forgotten something  ‘porter’ said the alderman  ‘sir’ said toby  ‘take care of that daughter of yours  she’s much too handsome’  ‘even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other i suppose’ thought toby looking at the sixpence in his hand and thinking of the tripe  ‘she’s been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom apiece i shouldn’t wonder  it’s very dreadful’  ‘she’s much too handsome my man’ repeated the alderman  ‘the chances are that she’ll come to no good i clearly see  observe what i say take care of her’  with which he hurried off again  ‘wrong every way  wrong every way’ said trotty clasping his hands ‘born bad  no business here’  the chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the words  full loud and sounding—but with no encouragement  no not a drop  ‘the tune’s changed’ cried the old man as he listened  ‘there’s not a word of all that fancy in it  why should there be  i have no business with the new year nor with the old one neither  let me die’  still the bells pealing forth their changes made the very air spin put ’em down put ’em down  good old times good old times  facts and figures facts and figures  put ’em down put ’em down  if they said anything they said this until the brain of toby reeled  he pressed his bewildered head between his hands as if to keep it from splitting asunder  a welltimed action as it happened for finding the letter in one of them and being by that means reminded of his charge he fell mechanically into his usual trot and trotted off     chapter ii—the second quarter   the letter toby had received from alderman cute was addressed to a great man in the great district of the town  the greatest district of the town  it must have been the greatest district of the town because it was commonly called ‘the world’ by its inhabitants  the letter positively seemed heavier in toby’s hand than another letter  not because the alderman had sealed it with a very large coat of arms and no end of wax but because of the weighty name on the superscription and the ponderous amount of gold and silver with which it was associated  ‘how different from us’ thought toby in all simplicity and earnestness as he looked at the direction  ‘divide the lively turtles in the bills of mortality by the number of gentlefolks able to buy ’em and whose share does he take but his own  as to snatching tripe from anybody’s mouth—he’d scorn it’  with the involuntary homage due to such an exalted character toby interposed a corner of his apron between the letter and his fingers  ‘his children’ said trotty and a mist rose before his eyes ‘his daughters—gentlemen may win their hearts and marry them they may be happy wives and mothers they may be handsome like my darling me’  he couldn’t finish the name  the final letter swelled in his throat to the size of the whole alphabet  ‘never mind’ thought trotty  ‘i know what i mean  that’s more than enough for me’  and with this consolatory rumination trotted on  it was a hard frost that day  the air was bracing crisp and clear the wintry sun though powerless for warmth looked brightly down upon the ice it was too weak to melt and set a radiant glory there  at other times trotty might have learned a poor man’s lesson from the wintry sun but he was past that now  the year was old that day  the patient year had lived through the reproaches and misuses of its slanderers and faithfully performed its work  spring summer autumn winter  it had laboured through the destined round and now laid down its weary head to die  shut out from hope high impulse active happiness itself but active messenger of many joys to others it made appeal in its decline to have its toiling days and patient hours remembered and to die in peace  trotty might have read a poor man’s allegory in the fading year but he was past that now  and only he  or has the like appeal been ever made by seventy years at once upon an english labourer’s head and made in vain  the streets were full of motion and the shops were decked out gaily the new year like an infant heir to the whole world was waited for with welcomes presents and rejoicings  there were books and toys for the new year glittering trinkets for the new year dresses for the new year schemes of fortune for the new year new inventions to beguile it its life was parcelled out in almanacks and pocketbooks the coming of its moons and stars and tides was known beforehand to the moment all the workings of its seasons in their days and nights were calculated with as much precision as mr filer could work sums in men and women  the new year the new year  everywhere the new year  the old year was already looked upon as dead and its effects were selling cheap like some drowned mariner’s aboardship  its patterns were last year’s and going at a sacrifice before its breath was gone  its treasures were mere dirt beside the riches of its unborn successor  trotty had no portion to his thinking in the new year or the old  ‘put ’em down put ’em down  facts and figures facts and figures  good old times good old times  put ’em down put ’em down’—his trot went to that measure and would fit itself to nothing else  but even that one melancholy as it was brought him in due time to the end of his journey  to the mansion of sir joseph bowley member of parliament  the door was opened by a porter  such a porter  not of toby’s order quite another thing  his place was the ticket though not toby’s  this porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak having breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair without first taking time to think about it and compose his mind  when he had found his voice—which it took him a long time to do for it was a long way off and hidden under a load of meat—he said in a fat whisper  ‘who’s it from’  toby told him  ‘you’re to take it in yourself’ said the porter pointing to a room at the end of a long passage opening from the hall  ‘everything goes straight in on this day of the year  you’re not a bit too soon for the carriage is at the door now and they have only come to town for a couple of hours a’ purpose’  toby wiped his feet which were quite dry already with great care and took the way pointed out to him observing as he went that it was an awfully grand house but hushed and covered up as if the family were in the country  knocking at the roomdoor he was told to enter from within and doing so found himself in a spacious library where at a table strewn with files and papers were a stately lady in a bonnet and a not very stately gentleman in black who wrote from her dictation while another and an older and a much statelier gentleman whose hat and cane were on the table walked up and down with one hand in his breast and looked complacently from time to time at his own picture—a full length a very full length—hanging over the fireplace  ‘what is this’ said the lastnamed gentleman  ‘mr fish will you have the goodness to attend’  mr fish begged pardon and taking the letter from toby handed it with great respect  ‘from alderman cute sir joseph’  ‘is this all  have you nothing else porter’ inquired sir joseph  toby replied in the negative  ‘you have no bill or demand upon me—my name is bowley sir joseph bowley—of any kind from anybody have you’ said sir joseph  ‘if you have present it  there is a chequebook by the side of mr fish  i allow nothing to be carried into the new year  every description of account is settled in this house at the close of the old one  so that if death was to—to—’  ‘to cut’ suggested mr fish  ‘to sever sir’ returned sir joseph with great asperity ‘the cord of existence—my affairs would be found i hope in a state of preparation’  ‘my dear sir joseph’ said the lady who was greatly younger than the gentleman  ‘how shocking’  ‘my lady bowley’ returned sir joseph floundering now and then as in the great depth of his observations ‘at this season of the year we should think of—of—ourselves  we should look into our—our accounts  we should feel that every return of so eventful a period in human transactions involves a matter of deep moment between a man and his—and his banker’  sir joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full morality of what he was saying and desired that even trotty should have an opportunity of being improved by such discourse  possibly he had this end before him in still forbearing to break the seal of the letter and in telling trotty to wait where he was a minute  ‘you were desiring mr fish to say my lady—’ observed sir joseph  ‘mr fish has said that i believe’ returned his lady glancing at the letter  ‘but upon my word sir joseph i don’t think i can let it go after all  it is so very dear’  ‘what is dear’ inquired sir joseph  ‘that charity my love  they only allow two votes for a subscription of five pounds  really monstrous’  ‘my lady bowley’ returned sir joseph ‘you surprise me  is the luxury of feeling in proportion to the number of votes or is it to a rightly constituted mind in proportion to the number of applicants and the wholesome state of mind to which their canvassing reduces them  is there no excitement of the purest kind in having two votes to dispose of among fifty people’  ‘not to me i acknowledge’ replied the lady  ‘it bores one  besides one can’t oblige one’s acquaintance  but you are the poor man’s friend you know sir joseph  you think otherwise’  ‘i am the poor man’s friend’ observed sir joseph glancing at the poor man present  ‘as such i may be taunted  as such i have been taunted but i ask no other title’  ‘bless him for a noble gentleman’ thought trotty  ‘i don’t agree with cute here for instance’ said sir joseph holding out the letter  ‘i don’t agree with the filer party  i don’t agree with any party  my friend the poor man has no business with anything of that sort and nothing of that sort has any business with him  my friend the poor man in my district is my business  no man or body of men has any right to interfere between my friend and me  that is the ground i take i assume a—a paternal character towards my friend  i say “my good fellow i will treat you paternally”’  toby listened with great gravity and began to feel more comfortable  ‘your only business my good fellow’ pursued sir joseph looking abstractedly at toby ‘your only business in life is with me  you needn’t trouble yourself to think about anything  i will think for you i know what is good for you i am your perpetual parent  such is the dispensation of an allwise providence  now the design of your creation is—not that you should swill and guzzle and associate your enjoyments brutally with food toby thought remorsefully of the tripe ‘but that you should feel the dignity of labour  go forth erect into the cheerful morning air and—and stop there  live hard and temperately be respectful exercise your selfdenial bring up your family on next to nothing pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes be punctual in your dealings i set you a good example you will find mr fish my confidential secretary with a cashbox before him at all times and you may trust to me to be your friend and father’  ‘nice children indeed sir joseph’ said the lady with a shudder ‘rheumatisms and fevers and crooked legs and asthmas and all kinds of horrors’  ‘my lady’ returned sir joseph with solemnity ‘not the less am i the poor man’s friend and father  not the less shall he receive encouragement at my hands  every quarterday he will be put in communication with mr fish  every new year’s day myself and friends will drink his health  once every year myself and friends will address him with the deepest feeling  once in his life he may even perhaps receive in public in the presence of the gentry a trifle from a friend  and when upheld no more by these stimulants and the dignity of labour he sinks into his comfortable grave then my lady’—here sir joseph blew his nose—‘i will be a friend and a father—on the same terms—to his children’  toby was greatly moved  ‘o you have a thankful family sir joseph’ cried his wife  ‘my lady’ said sir joseph quite majestically ‘ingratitude is known to be the sin of that class  i expect no other return’  ‘ah  born bad’ thought toby  ‘nothing melts us’  ‘what man can do i do’ pursued sir joseph  ‘i do my duty as the poor man’s friend and father and i endeavour to educate his mind by inculcating on all occasions the one great moral lesson which that class requires  that is entire dependence on myself  they have no business whatever with—with themselves  if wicked and designing persons tell them otherwise and they become impatient and discontented and are guilty of insubordinate conduct and blackhearted ingratitude which is undoubtedly the case i am their friend and father still  it is so ordained  it is in the nature of things’  with that great sentiment he opened the alderman’s letter and read it  ‘very polite and attentive i am sure’ exclaimed sir joseph  ‘my lady the alderman is so obliging as to remind me that he has had “the distinguished honour”—he is very good—of meeting me at the house of our mutual friend deedles the banker and he does me the favour to inquire whether it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down’  ‘most agreeable’ replied my lady bowley  ‘the worst man among them he has been committing a robbery i hope’  ‘why no’ said sir joseph’ referring to the letter  ‘not quite  very near  not quite  he came up to london it seems to look for employment trying to better himself—that’s his story and being found at night asleep in a shed was taken into custody and carried next morning before the alderman  the alderman observes very properly that he is determined to put this sort of thing down and that if it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down he will be happy to begin with him’  ‘let him be made an example of by all means’ returned the lady  ‘last winter when i introduced pinking and eyeletholing among the men and boys in the village as a nice evening employment and had the lines      o let us love our occupations     bless the squire and his relations     live upon our daily rations     and always know our proper stations  set to music on the new system for them to sing the while this very fern—i see him now—touched that hat of his and said “i humbly ask your pardon my lady but an’t i something different from a great girl”  i expected it of course who can expect anything but insolence and ingratitude from that class of people  that is not to the purpose however  sir joseph  make an example of him’  ‘hem’ coughed sir joseph  ‘mr fish if you’ll have the goodness to attend—’  mr fish immediately seized his pen and wrote from sir joseph’s dictation  ‘private  my dear sir  i am very much indebted to you for your courtesy in the matter of the man william fern of whom i regret to add i can say nothing favourable  i have uniformly considered myself in the light of his friend and father but have been repaid a common case i grieve to say with ingratitude and constant opposition to my plans  he is a turbulent and rebellious spirit  his character will not bear investigation  nothing will persuade him to be happy when he might under these circumstances it appears to me i own that when he comes before you again as you informed me he promised to do tomorrow pending your inquiries and i think he may be so far relied upon his committal for some short term as a vagabond would be a service to society and would be a salutary example in a country where—for the sake of those who are through good and evil report the friends and fathers of the poor as well as with a view to that generally speaking misguided class themselves—examples are greatly needed  and i am’ and so forth  ‘it appears’ remarked sir joseph when he had signed this letter and mr fish was sealing it ‘as if this were ordained really  at the close of the year i wind up my account and strike my balance even with william fern’  trotty who had long ago relapsed and was very lowspirited stepped forward with a rueful face to take the letter  ‘with my compliments and thanks’ said sir joseph  ‘stop’  ‘stop’ echoed mr fish  ‘you have heard perhaps’ said sir joseph oracularly ‘certain remarks into which i have been led respecting the solemn period of time at which we have arrived and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs and being prepared  you have observed that i don’t shelter myself behind my superior standing in society but that mr fish—that gentleman—has a chequebook at his elbow and is in fact here to enable me to turn over a perfectly new leaf and enter on the epoch before us with a clean account  now my friend can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you also have made preparations for a new year’  ‘i am afraid sir’ stammered trotty looking meekly at him ‘that i am a—a—little behindhand with the world’  ‘behindhand with the world’ repeated sir joseph bowley in a tone of terrible distinctness  ‘i am afraid sir’ faltered trotty ‘that there’s a matter of ten or twelve shillings owing to mrs chickenstalker’  ‘to mrs chickenstalker’ repeated sir joseph in the same tone as before  ‘a shop sir’ exclaimed toby ‘in the general line  also a—a little money on account of rent  a very little sir  it oughtn’t to be owing i know but we have been hard put to it indeed’  sir joseph looked at his lady and at mr fish and at trotty one after another twice all round  he then made a despondent gesture with both hands at once as if he gave the thing up altogether  ‘how a man even among this improvident and impracticable race an old man a man grown grey can look a new year in the face with his affairs in this condition how he can lie down on his bed at night and get up again in the morning and—there’ he said turning his back on trotty ‘take the letter  take the letter’  ‘i heartily wish it was otherwise sir’ said trotty anxious to excuse himself  ‘we have been tried very hard’  sir joseph still repeating ‘take the letter take the letter’ and mr fish not only saying the same thing but giving additional force to the request by motioning the bearer to the door he had nothing for it but to make his bow and leave the house  and in the street poor trotty pulled his worn old hat down on his head to hide the grief he felt at getting no hold on the new year anywhere  he didn’t even lift his hat to look up at the bell tower when he came to the old church on his return  he halted there a moment from habit and knew that it was growing dark and that the steeple rose above him indistinct and faint in the murky air  he knew too that the chimes would ring immediately and that they sounded to his fancy at such a time like voices in the clouds  but he only made the more haste to deliver the alderman’s letter and get out of the way before they began for he dreaded to hear them tagging ‘friends and fathers friends and fathers’ to the burden they had rung out last  toby discharged himself of his commission therefore with all possible speed and set off trotting homeward  but what with his pace which was at best an awkward one in the street and what with his hat which didn’t improve it he trotted against somebody in less than no time and was sent staggering out into the road  ‘i beg your pardon i’m sure’ said trotty pulling up his hat in great confusion and between the hat and the torn lining fixing his head into a kind of beehive  ‘i hope i haven’t hurt you’  as to hurting anybody toby was not such an absolute samson but that he was much more likely to be hurt himself and indeed he had flown out into the road like a shuttlecock  he had such an opinion of his own strength however that he was in real concern for the other party and said again  ‘i hope i haven’t hurt you’  the man against whom he had run a sunbrowned sinewy countrylooking man with grizzled hair and a rough chin stared at him for a moment as if he suspected him to be in jest  but satisfied of his good faith he answered  ‘no friend  you have not hurt me’  ‘nor the child i hope’ said trotty  ‘nor the child’ returned the man  ‘i thank you kindly’  as he said so he glanced at a little girl he carried in his arms asleep and shading her face with the long end of the poor handkerchief he wore about his throat went slowly on  the tone in which he said ‘i thank you kindly’ penetrated trotty’s heart  he was so jaded and footsore and so soiled with travel and looked about him so forlorn and strange that it was a comfort to him to be able to thank any one no matter for how little  toby stood gazing after him as he plodded wearily away with the child’s arm clinging round his neck  at the figure in the worn shoes—now the very shade and ghost of shoes—rough leather leggings common frock and broad slouched hat trotty stood gazing blind to the whole street  and at the child’s arm clinging round its neck  before he merged into the darkness the traveller stopped and looking round and seeing trotty standing there yet seemed undecided whether to return or go on  after doing first the one and then the other he came back and trotty went halfway to meet him  ‘you can tell me perhaps’ said the man with a faint smile ‘and if you can i am sure you will and i’d rather ask you than another—where alderman cute lives’  ‘close at hand’ replied toby  ‘i’ll show you his house with pleasure’  ‘i was to have gone to him elsewhere tomorrow’ said the man accompanying toby ‘but i’m uneasy under suspicion and want to clear myself and to be free to go and seek my bread—i don’t know where  so maybe he’ll forgive my going to his house tonight’  ‘it’s impossible’ cried toby with a start ‘that your name’s fern’  ‘eh’ cried the other turning on him in astonishment  ‘fern  will fern’ said trotty  ‘that’s my name’ replied the other  ‘why then’ said trotty seizing him by the arm and looking cautiously round ‘for heaven’s sake don’t go to him  don’t go to him  he’ll put you down as sure as ever you were born  here come up this alley and i’ll tell you what i mean  don’t go to him’  his new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad but he bore him company nevertheless  when they were shrouded from observation trotty told him what he knew and what character he had received and all about it  the subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that surprised him  he did not contradict or interrupt it once  he nodded his head now and then—more in corroboration of an old and wornout story it appeared than in refutation of it and once or twice threw back his hat and passed his freckled hand over a brow where every furrow he had ploughed seemed to have set its image in little  but he did no more  ‘it’s true enough in the main’ he said ‘master i could sift grain from husk here and there but let it be as ’tis  what odds  i have gone against his plans to my misfortun’  i can’t help it i should do the like tomorrow  as to character them gentlefolks will search and search and pry and pry and have it as free from spot or speck in us afore they’ll help us to a dry good word—well i hope they don’t lose good opinion as easy as we do or their lives is strict indeed and hardly worth the keeping  for myself master i never took with that hand’—holding it before him—‘what wasn’t my own and never held it back from work however hard or poorly paid  whoever can deny it let him chop it off  but when work won’t maintain me like a human creetur when my living is so bad that i am hungry out of doors and in when i see a whole working life begin that way go on that way and end that way without a chance or change then i say to the gentlefolks “keep away from me  let my cottage be  my doors is dark enough without your darkening of ’em more  don’t look for me to come up into the park to help the show when there’s a birthday or a fine speechmaking or what not  act your plays and games without me and be welcome to ’em and enjoy ’em  we’ve nowt to do with one another  i’m best let alone”’  seeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes and was looking about her in wonder he checked himself to say a word or two of foolish prattle in her ear and stand her on the ground beside him  then slowly winding one of her long tresses round and round his rough forefinger like a ring while she hung about his dusty leg he said to trotty  ‘i’m not a crossgrained man by natu’ i believe and easy satisfied i’m sure  i bear no illwill against none of ’em  i only want to live like one of the almighty’s creeturs  i can’t—i don’t—and so there’s a pit dug between me and them that can and do  there’s others like me  you might tell ’em off by hundreds and by thousands sooner than by ones’  trotty knew he spoke the truth in this and shook his head to signify as much  ‘i’ve got a bad name this way’ said fern ‘and i’m not likely i’m afeared to get a better  ’tan’t lawful to be out of sorts and i am out of sorts though god knows i’d sooner bear a cheerful spirit if i could well  i don’t know as this alderman could hurt me much by sending me to jail but without a friend to speak a word for me he might do it and you see—’ pointing downward with his finger at the child  ‘she has a beautiful face’ said trotty  ‘why yes’ replied the other in a low voice as he gently turned it up with both his hands towards his own and looked upon it steadfastly ‘i’ve thought so many times  i’ve thought so when my hearth was very cold and cupboard very bare  i thought so t’other night when we were taken like two thieves  but they—they shouldn’t try the little face too often should they lilian  that’s hardly fair upon a man’  he sunk his voice so low and gazed upon her with an air so stern and strange that toby to divert the current of his thoughts inquired if his wife were living  ‘i never had one’ he returned shaking his head  ‘she’s my brother’s child a orphan  nine year old though you’d hardly think it but she’s tired and worn out now  they’d have taken care on her the union—eightandtwenty mile away from where we live—between four walls as they took care of my old father when he couldn’t work no more though he didn’t trouble ’em long but i took her instead and she’s lived with me ever since  her mother had a friend once in london here  we are trying to find her and to find work too but it’s a large place  never mind  more room for us to walk about in lilly’  meeting the child’s eyes with a smile which melted toby more than tears he shook him by the hand  ‘i don’t so much as know your name’ he said ‘but i’ve opened my heart free to you for i’m thankful to you with good reason  i’ll take your advice and keep clear of this—’  ‘justice’ suggested toby  ‘ah’ he said  ‘if that’s the name they give him  this justice  and tomorrow will try whether there’s better fortun’ to be met with somewheres near london  good night  a happy new year’  ‘stay’ cried trotty catching at his hand as he relaxed his grip ‘stay  the new year never can be happy to me if we part like this  the new year never can be happy to me if i see the child and you go wandering away you don’t know where without a shelter for your heads come home with me  i’m a poor man living in a poor place but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it  come home with me here  i’ll take her’ cried trotty lifting up the child  ‘a pretty one  i’d carry twenty times her weight and never know i’d got it  tell me if i go too quick for you  i’m very fast  i always was’  trotty said this taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion and with his thin legs quivering again beneath the load he bore  ‘why she’s as light’ said trotty trotting in his speech as well as in his gait for he couldn’t bear to be thanked and dreaded a moment’s pause ‘as light as a feather  lighter than a peacock’s feather—a great deal lighter  here we are and here we go  round this first turning to the right uncle will and past the pump and sharp off up the passage to the left right opposite the publichouse  here we are and here we go cross over uncle will and mind the kidney pieman at the corner  here we are and here we go  down the mews here uncle will and stop at the black door with “t veck ticket porter” wrote upon a board and here we are and here we go and here we are indeed my precious  meg surprising you’  with which words trotty in a breathless state set the child down before his daughter in the middle of the floor  the little visitor looked once at meg and doubting nothing in that face but trusting everything she saw there ran into her arms  ‘here we are and here we go’ cried trotty running round the room and choking audibly  ‘here uncle will here’s a fire you know  why don’t you come to the fire  oh here we are and here we go  meg my precious darling where’s the kettle  here it is and here it goes and it’ll bile in no time’  trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course of his wild career and now put it on the fire while meg seating the child in a warm corner knelt down on the ground before her and pulled off her shoes and dried her wet feet on a cloth  ay and she laughed at trotty too—so pleasantly so cheerfully that trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled for he had seen that when they entered she was sitting by the fire in tears  ‘why father’ said meg  ‘you’re crazy tonight i think  i don’t know what the bells would say to that  poor little feet  how cold they are’  ‘oh they’re warmer now’ exclaimed the child  ‘they’re quite warm now’  ‘no no no’ said meg  ‘we haven’t rubbed ’em half enough  we’re so busy  so busy  and when they’re done we’ll brush out the damp hair and when that’s done we’ll bring some colour to the poor pale face with fresh water and when that’s done we’ll be so gay and brisk and happy—’  the child in a burst of sobbing clasped her round the neck caressed her fair cheek with its hand and said ‘oh meg oh dear meg’  toby’s blessing could have done no more  who could do more  ‘why father’ cried meg after a pause  ‘here i am and here i go my dear’ said trotty  ‘good gracious me’ cried meg  ‘he’s crazy  he’s put the dear child’s bonnet on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door’  ‘i didn’t go for to do it my love’ said trotty hastily repairing this mistake  ‘meg my dear’  meg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor where with many mysterious gestures he was holding up the sixpence he had earned  ‘i see my dear’ said trotty ‘as i was coming in half an ounce of tea lying somewhere on the stairs and i’m pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too  as i don’t remember where it was exactly i’ll go myself and try to find ’em’  with this inscrutable artifice toby withdrew to purchase the viands he had spoken of for ready money at mrs chickenstalker’s and presently came back pretending he had not been able to find them at first in the dark  ‘but here they are at last’ said trotty setting out the teathings ‘all correct  i was pretty sure it was tea and a rasher  so it is meg my pet if you’ll just make the tea while your unworthy father toasts the bacon we shall be ready immediate  it’s a curious circumstance’ said trotty proceeding in his cookery with the assistance of the toastingfork ‘curious but well known to my friends that i never care myself for rashers nor for tea  i like to see other people enjoy ’em’ said trotty speaking very loud to impress the fact upon his guest ‘but to me as food they’re disagreeable’  yet trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing bacon—ah—as if he liked it and when he poured the boiling water in the teapot looked lovingly down into the depths of that snug cauldron and suffered the fragrant steam to curl about his nose and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud however for all this he neither ate nor drank except at the very beginning a mere morsel for form’s sake which he appeared to eat with infinite relish but declared was perfectly uninteresting to him  no  trotty’s occupation was to see will fern and lilian eat and drink and so was meg’s  and never did spectators at a city dinner or court banquet find such high delight in seeing others feast although it were a monarch or a pope as those two did in looking on that night  meg smiled at trotty trotty laughed at meg  meg shook her head and made belief to clap her hands applauding trotty trotty conveyed in dumbshow unintelligible narratives of how and when and where he had found their visitors to meg and they were happy  very happy  ‘although’ thought trotty sorrowfully as he watched meg’s face ‘that match is broken off i see’  ‘now i’ll tell you what’ said trotty after tea  ‘the little one she sleeps with meg i know’  ‘with good meg’ cried the child caressing her  ‘with meg’  ‘that’s right’ said trotty  ‘and i shouldn’t wonder if she kiss meg’s father won’t she  i’m meg’s father’  mightily delighted trotty was when the child went timidly towards him and having kissed him fell back upon meg again  ‘she’s as sensible as solomon’ said trotty  ‘here we come and here we—no we don’t—i don’t mean that—i—what was i saying meg my precious’  meg looked towards their guest who leaned upon her chair and with his face turned from her fondled the child’s head half hidden in her lap  ‘to be sure’ said toby  ‘to be sure  i don’t know what i’m rambling on about tonight  my wits are woolgathering i think  will fern you come along with me  you’re tired to death and broken down for want of rest  you come along with me’  the man still played with the child’s curls still leaned upon meg’s chair still turned away his face  he didn’t speak but in his rough coarse fingers clenching and expanding in the fair hair of the child there was an eloquence that said enough  ‘yes yes’ said trotty answering unconsciously what he saw expressed in his daughter’s face  ‘take her with you meg  get her to bed  there now will i’ll show you where you lie  it’s not much of a place only a loft but having a loft i always say is one of the great conveniences of living in a mews and till this coachhouse and stable gets a better let we live here cheap  there’s plenty of sweet hay up there belonging to a neighbour and it’s as clean as hands and meg can make it  cheer up  don’t give way  a new heart for a new year always’  the hand released from the child’s hair had fallen trembling into trotty’s hand  so trotty talking without intermission led him out as tenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself  returning before meg he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber an adjoining room  the child was murmuring a simple prayer before lying down to sleep and when she had remembered meg’s name ‘dearly dearly’—so her words ran—trotty heard her stop and ask for his  it was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose himself to mend the fire and draw his chair to the warm hearth  but when he had done so and had trimmed the light he took his newspaper from his pocket and began to read  carelessly at first and skimming up and down the columns but with an earnest and a sad attention very soon  for this same dreaded paper redirected trotty’s thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day and which the day’s events had so marked out and shaped  his interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of thinking and a happier one for the time but being alone again and reading of the crimes and violences of the people he relapsed into his former train  in this mood he came to an account and it was not the first he had ever read of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not only on her own life but on that of her young child  a crime so terrible and so revolting to his soul dilated with the love of meg that he let the journal drop and fell back in his chair appalled  ‘unnatural and cruel’ toby cried  ‘unnatural and cruel  none but people who were bad at heart born bad who had no business on the earth could do such deeds  it’s too true all i’ve heard today too just too full of proof  we’re bad’  the chimes took up the words so suddenly—burst out so loud and clear and sonorous—that the bells seemed to strike him in his chair  and what was that they said  ‘toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby  toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby  come and see us come and see us drag him to us drag him to us haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt him break his slumbers break his slumbers  toby veck toby veck door open wide toby toby veck toby veck door open wide toby—’ then fiercely back to their impetuous strain again and ringing in the very bricks and plaster on the walls  toby listened  fancy fancy  his remorse for having run away from them that afternoon  no no  nothing of the kind  again again and yet a dozen times again  ‘haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt him drag him to us drag him to us’  deafening the whole town  ‘meg’ said trotty softly tapping at her door  ‘do you hear anything’  ‘i hear the bells father  surely they’re very loud tonight’  ‘is she asleep’ said toby making an excuse for peeping in  ‘so peacefully and happily  i can’t leave her yet though father  look how she holds my hand’  ‘meg’ whispered trotty  ‘listen to the bells’  she listened with her face towards him all the time  but it underwent no change  she didn’t understand them  trotty withdrew resumed his seat by the fire and once more listened by himself  he remained here a little time  it was impossible to bear it their energy was dreadful  ‘if the towerdoor is really open’ said toby hastily laying aside his apron but never thinking of his hat ‘what’s to hinder me from going up into the steeple and satisfying myself  if it’s shut i don’t want any other satisfaction  that’s enough’  he was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked for he knew the door well and had so rarely seen it open that he couldn’t reckon above three times in all it was a low arched portal outside the church in a dark nook behind a column and had such great iron hinges and such a monstrous lock that there was more hinge and lock than door  but what was his astonishment when coming bareheaded to the church and putting his hand into this dark nook with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized and a shivering propensity to draw it back again he found that the door which opened outwards actually stood ajar  he thought on the first surprise of going back or of getting a light or a companion but his courage aided him immediately and he determined to ascend alone  ‘what have i to fear’ said trotty  ‘it’s a church  besides the ringers may be there and have forgotten to shut the door’  so he went in feeling his way as he went like a blind man for it was very dark and very quiet for the chimes were silent  the dust from the street had blown into the recess and lying there heaped up made it so soft and velvetlike to the foot that there was something startling even in that  the narrow stair was so close to the door too that he stumbled at the very first and shutting the door upon himself by striking it with his foot and causing it to rebound back heavily he couldn’t open it again  this was another reason however for going on  trotty groped his way and went on  up up up and round and round and up up up higher higher higher up  it was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work so low and narrow that his groping hand was always touching something and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to pass without discovery that he would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face and downward searching for its feet while a chill tingling crept all over him  twice or thrice a door or niche broke the monotonous surface and then it seemed a gap as wide as the whole church and he felt on the brink of an abyss and going to tumble headlong down until he found the wall again  still up up up and round and round and up up up higher higher higher up  at length the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen presently to feel quite windy presently it blew so strong that he could hardly keep his legs  but he got to an arched window in the tower breast high and holding tight looked down upon the housetops on the smoking chimneys on the blur and blotch of lights towards the place where meg was wondering where he was and calling to him perhaps all kneaded up together in a leaven of mist and darkness  this was the belfry where the ringers came  he had caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through apertures in the oaken roof at first he started thinking it was hair then trembled at the very thought of waking the deep bell  the bells themselves were higher higher trotty in his fascination or in working out the spell upon him groped his way  by ladders now and toilsomely for it was steep and not too certain holding for the feet  up up up and climb and clamber up up up higher higher higher up  until ascending through the floor and pausing with his head just raised above its beams he came among the bells  it was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom but there they were  shadowy and dark and dumb  a heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal  his head went round and round  he listened and then raised a wild ‘holloa’  holloa was mournfully protracted by the echoes  giddy confused and out of breath and frightened toby looked about him vacantly and sunk down in a swoon     chapter iii—third quarter   black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters when the sea of thought first heaving from a calm gives up its dead  monsters uncouth and wild arise in premature imperfect resurrection the several parts and shapes of different things are joined and mixed by chance and when and how and by what wonderful degrees each separates from each and every sense and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives again no man—though every man is every day the casket of this type of the great mystery—can tell  so when and how the darkness of the nightblack steeple changed to shining light when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad figures when and how the whispered ‘haunt and hunt him’ breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears of trotty ‘break his slumbers’ when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things were companioning a host of others that were not there are no dates or means to tell  but awake and standing on his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain he saw this goblin sight  he saw the tower whither his charmed footsteps had brought him swarming with dwarf phantoms spirits elfin creatures of the bells  he saw them leaping flying dropping pouring from the bells without a pause  he saw them round him on the ground above him in the air clambering from him by the ropes below looking down upon him from the massive irongirded beams peeping in upon him through the chinks and loopholes in the walls spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles as the water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them  he saw them of all aspects and all shapes  he saw them ugly handsome crippled exquisitely formed  he saw them young he saw them old he saw them kind he saw them cruel he saw them merry he saw them grim he saw them dance and heard them sing he saw them tear their hair and heard them howl  he saw the air thick with them  he saw them come and go incessantly  he saw them riding downward soaring upward sailing off afar perching near at hand all restless and all violently active  stone and brick and slate and tile became transparent to him as to them  he saw them in the houses busy at the sleepers’ beds  he saw them soothing people in their dreams he saw them beating them with knotted whips he saw them yelling in their ears he saw them playing softest music on their pillows he saw them cheering some with the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers he saw them flashing awful faces on the troubled rest of others from enchanted mirrors which they carried in their hands  he saw these creatures not only among sleeping men but waking also active in pursuits irreconcilable with one another and possessing or assuming natures the most opposite  he saw one buckling on innumerable wings to increase his speed another loading himself with chains and weights to retard his  he saw some putting the hands of clocks forward some putting the hands of clocks backward some endeavouring to stop the clock entirely  he saw them representing here a marriage ceremony there a funeral in this chamber an election in that a ball he saw everywhere restless and untiring motion  bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures as well as by the uproar of the bells which all this while were ringing trotty clung to a wooden pillar for support and turned his white face here and there in mute and stunned astonishment  as he gazed the chimes stopped  instantaneous change  the whole swarm fainted their forms collapsed their speed deserted them they sought to fly but in the act of falling died and melted into air  no fresh supply succeeded them  one straggler leaped down pretty briskly from the surface of the great bell and alighted on his feet but he was dead and gone before he could turn round  some few of the late company who had gambolled in the tower remained there spinning over and over a little longer but these became at every turn more faint and few and feeble and soon went the way of the rest  the last of all was one small hunchback who had got into an echoing corner where he twirled and twirled and floated by himself a long time showing such perseverance that at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a foot before he finally retired but he vanished in the end and then the tower was silent  then and not before did trotty see in every bell a bearded figure of the bulk and stature of the bell—incomprehensibly a figure and the bell itself  gigantic grave and darkly watchful of him as he stood rooted to the ground  mysterious and awful figures  resting on nothing poised in the night air of the tower with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim roof motionless and shadowy  shadowy and dark although he saw them by some light belonging to themselves—none else was there—each with its muffled hand upon its goblin mouth  he could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor for all power of motion had deserted him  otherwise he would have done so—aye would have thrown himself headforemost from the steepletop rather than have seen them watching him with eyes that would have waked and watched although the pupils had been taken out  again again the dread and terror of the lonely place and of the wild and fearful night that reigned there touched him like a spectral hand his distance from all help the long dark winding ghostbeleaguered way that lay between him and the earth on which men lived his being high high high up there where it had made him dizzy to see the birds fly in the day cut off from all good people who at such an hour were safe at home and sleeping in their beds all this struck coldly through him not as a reflection but a bodily sensation  meantime his eyes and thoughts and fears were fixed upon the watchful figures which rendered unlike any figures of this world by the deep gloom and shade enwrapping and enfolding them as well as by their looks and forms and supernatural hovering above the floor were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were the stalwart oaken frames crosspieces bars and beams set up there to support the bells  these hemmed them in a very forest of hewn timber from the entanglements intricacies and depths of which as from among the boughs of a dead wood blighted for their phantom use they kept their darksome and unwinking watch  a blast of air—how cold and shrill—came moaning through the tower  as it died away the great bell or the goblin of the great bell spoke  ‘what visitor is this’ it said  the voice was low and deep and trotty fancied that it sounded in the other figures as well  ‘i thought my name was called by the chimes’ said trotty raising his hands in an attitude of supplication  ‘i hardly know why i am here or how i came  i have listened to the chimes these many years  they have cheered me often’  ‘and you have thanked them’ said the bell  ‘a thousand times’ cried trotty  ‘how’  ‘i am a poor man’ faltered trotty ‘and could only thank them in words’  ‘and always so’ inquired the goblin of the bell  ‘have you never done us wrong in words’  ‘no’ cried trotty eagerly  ‘never done us foul and false and wicked wrong in words’ pursued the goblin of the bell  trotty was about to answer ‘never’  but he stopped and was confused  ‘the voice of time’ said the phantom ‘cries to man advance  time is for his advancement and improvement for his greater worth his greater happiness his better life his progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view and set there in the period when time and he began  ages of darkness wickedness and violence have come and gone—millions uncountable have suffered lived and died—to point the way before him  who seeks to turn him back or stay him on his course arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead and be the fiercer and the wilder ever for its momentary check’  ‘i never did so to my knowledge sir’ said trotty  ‘it was quite by accident if i did  i wouldn’t go to do it i’m sure’  ‘who puts into the mouth of time or of its servants’ said the goblin of the bell ‘a cry of lamentation for days which have had their trial and their failure and have left deep traces of it which the blind may see—a cry that only serves the present time by showing men how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a past—who does this does a wrong  and you have done that wrong to us the chimes’  trotty’s first excess of fear was gone  but he had felt tenderly and gratefully towards the bells as you have seen and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily his heart was touched with penitence and grief  ‘if you knew’ said trotty clasping his hands earnestly—‘or perhaps you do know—if you know how often you have kept me company how often you have cheered me up when i’ve been low how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter meg almost the only one she ever had when first her mother died and she and me were left alone you won’t bear malice for a hasty word’  ‘who hears in us the chimes one note bespeaking disregard or stern regard of any hope or joy or pain or sorrow of the manysorrowed throng who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human passions and affections as it gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither does us wrong  that wrong you have done us’ said the bell  ‘i have’ said trotty  ‘oh forgive me’  ‘who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth the putters down of crushed and broken natures formed to be raised up higher than such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive’ pursued the goblin of the bell ‘who does so does us wrong  and you have done us wrong’  ‘not meaning it’ said trotty  ‘in my ignorance  not meaning it’  ‘lastly and most of all’ pursued the bell  ‘who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind abandons them as vile and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good—grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below does wrong to heaven and man to time and to eternity  and you have done that wrong’  ‘spare me’ cried trotty falling on his knees ‘for mercy’s sake’  ‘listen’ said the shadow  ‘listen’ cried the other shadows  ‘listen’ said a clear and childlike voice which trotty thought he recognised as having heard before  the organ sounded faintly in the church below  swelling by degrees the melody ascended to the roof and filled the choir and nave  expanding more and more it rose up up up up higher higher higher up awakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak the hollow bells the ironbound doors the stairs of solid stone until the tower walls were insufficient to contain it and it soared into the sky  no wonder that an old man’s breast could not contain a sound so vast and mighty  it broke from that weak prison in a rush of tears and trotty put his hands before his face  ‘listen’ said the shadow  ‘listen’ said the other shadows  ‘listen’ said the child’s voice  a solemn strain of blended voices rose into the tower  it was a very low and mournful strain—a dirge—and as he listened trotty heard his child among the singers  ‘she is dead’ exclaimed the old man  ‘meg is dead  her spirit calls to me  i hear it’  ‘the spirit of your child bewails the dead and mingles with the dead—dead hopes dead fancies dead imaginings of youth’ returned the bell ‘but she is living  learn from her life a living truth  learn from the creature dearest to your heart how bad the bad are born  see every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem and know how bare and wretched it may be  follow her  to desperation’  each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth and pointed downward  ‘the spirit of the chimes is your companion’ said the figure  ‘go  it stands behind you’  trotty turned and saw—the child  the child will fern had carried in the street the child whom meg had watched but now asleep  ‘i carried her myself tonight’ said trotty  ‘in these arms’  ‘show him what he calls himself’ said the dark figures one and all  the tower opened at his feet  he looked down and beheld his own form lying at the bottom on the outside crushed and motionless  ‘no more a living man’ cried trotty  ‘dead’  ‘dead’ said the figures all together  ‘gracious heaven  and the new year—’  ‘past’ said the figures  ‘what’ he cried shuddering  ‘i missed my way and coming on the outside of this tower in the dark fell down—a year ago’  ‘nine years ago’ replied the figures  as they gave the answer they recalled their outstretched hands and where their figures had been there the bells were  and they rung their time being come again  and once again vast multitudes of phantoms sprung into existence once again were incoherently engaged as they had been before once again faded on the stopping of the chimes and dwindled into nothing  ‘what are these’ he asked his guide  ‘if i am not mad what are these’  ‘spirits of the bells  their sound upon the air’ returned the child ‘they take such shapes and occupations as the hopes and thoughts of mortals and the recollections they have stored up give them’  ‘and you’ said trotty wildly  ‘what are you’  ‘hush hush’ returned the child  ‘look here’  in a poor mean room working at the same kind of embroidery which he had often often seen before her meg his own dear daughter was presented to his view  he made no effort to imprint his kisses on her face he did not strive to clasp her to his loving heart he knew that such endearments were for him no more  but he held his trembling breath and brushed away the blinding tears that he might look upon her that he might only see her  ah  changed  changed  the light of the clear eye how dimmed  the bloom how faded from the cheek  beautiful she was as she had ever been but hope hope hope oh where was the fresh hope that had spoken to him like a voice  she looked up from her work at a companion  following her eyes the old man started back  in the woman grown he recognised her at a glance  in the long silken hair he saw the selfsame curls around the lips the child’s expression lingering still  see  in the eyes now turned inquiringly on meg there shone the very look that scanned those features when he brought her home  then what was this beside him  looking with awe into its face he saw a something reigning there a lofty something undefined and indistinct which made it hardly more than a remembrance of that child—as yonder figure might be—yet it was the same the same and wore the dress  hark  they were speaking  ‘meg’ said lilian hesitating  ‘how often you raise your head from your work to look at me’  ‘are my looks so altered that they frighten you’ asked meg  ‘nay dear  but you smile at that yourself  why not smile when you look at me meg’  ‘i do so  do i not’ she answered smiling on her  ‘now you do’ said lilian ‘but not usually  when you think i’m busy and don’t see you you look so anxious and so doubtful that i hardly like to raise my eyes  there is little cause for smiling in this hard and toilsome life but you were once so cheerful’  ‘am i not now’ cried meg speaking in a tone of strange alarm and rising to embrace her  ‘do i make our weary life more weary to you lilian’  ‘you have been the only thing that made it life’ said lilian fervently kissing her ‘sometimes the only thing that made me care to live so meg such work such work  so many hours so many days so many long long nights of hopeless cheerless neverending work—not to heap up riches not to live grandly or gaily not to live upon enough however coarse but to earn bare bread to scrape together just enough to toil upon and want upon and keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate  oh meg meg’ she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she spoke like one in pain  ‘how can the cruel world go round and bear to look upon such lives’  ‘lilly’ said meg soothing her and putting back her hair from her wet face  ‘why lilly  you  so pretty and so young’  ‘oh meg’ she interrupted holding her at arm’slength and looking in her face imploringly  ‘the worst of all the worst of all  strike me old meg  wither me and shrivel me and free me from the dreadful thoughts that tempt me in my youth’  trotty turned to look upon his guide  but the spirit of the child had taken flight  was gone  neither did he himself remain in the same place for sir joseph bowley friend and father of the poor held a great festivity at bowley hall in honour of the natal day of lady bowley  and as lady bowley had been born on new year’s day which the local newspapers considered an especial pointing of the finger of providence to number one as lady bowley’s destined figure in creation it was on a new year’s day that this festivity took place  bowley hall was full of visitors  the redfaced gentleman was there mr filer was there the great alderman cute was there—alderman cute had a sympathetic feeling with great people and had considerably improved his acquaintance with sir joseph bowley on the strength of his attentive letter indeed had become quite a friend of the family since then—and many guests were there  trotty’s ghost was there wandering about poor phantom drearily and looking for its guide  there was to be a great dinner in the great hall  at which sir joseph bowley in his celebrated character of friend and father of the poor was to make his great speech  certain plumpuddings were to be eaten by his friends and children in another hall first and at a given signal friends and children flocking in among their friends and fathers were to form a family assemblage with not one manly eye therein unmoistened by emotion  but there was more than this to happen  even more than this  sir joseph bowley baronet and member of parliament was to play a match at skittles—real skittles—with his tenants  ‘which quite reminds me’ said alderman cute ‘of the days of old king hal stout king hal bluff king hal  ah  fine character’  ‘very’ said mr filer dryly  ‘for marrying women and murdering ’em considerably more than the average number of wives by the bye’  ‘you’ll marry the beautiful ladies and not murder ’em eh’ said alderman cute to the heir of bowley aged twelve  ‘sweet boy  we shall have this little gentleman in parliament now’ said the alderman holding him by the shoulders and looking as reflective as he could ‘before we know where we are  we shall hear of his successes at the poll his speeches in the house his overtures from governments his brilliant achievements of all kinds ah we shall make our little orations about him in the common council i’ll be bound before we have time to look about us’  ‘oh the difference of shoes and stockings’ trotty thought  but his heart yearned towards the child for the love of those same shoeless and stockingless boys predestined by the alderman to turn out bad who might have been the children of poor meg  ‘richard’ moaned trotty roaming among the company to and fro ‘where is he  i can’t find richard  where is richard’  not likely to be there if still alive  but trotty’s grief and solitude confused him and he still went wandering among the gallant company looking for his guide and saying ‘where is richard  show me richard’  he was wandering thus when he encountered mr fish the confidential secretary in great agitation  ‘bless my heart and soul’ cried mr fish  ‘where’s alderman cute  has anybody seen the alderman’  seen the alderman  oh dear  who could ever help seeing the alderman he was so considerate so affable he bore so much in mind the natural desires of folks to see him that if he had a fault it was the being constantly on view  and wherever the great people were there to be sure attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls was cute  several voices cried that he was in the circle round sir joseph  mr fish made way there found him and took him secretly into a window near at hand  trotty joined them  not of his own accord  he felt that his steps were led in that direction  ‘my dear alderman cute’ said mr fish  ‘a little more this way  the most dreadful circumstance has occurred  i have this moment received the intelligence  i think it will be best not to acquaint sir joseph with it till the day is over  you understand sir joseph and will give me your opinion  the most frightful and deplorable event’  ‘fish’ returned the alderman  ‘fish  my good fellow what is the matter  nothing revolutionary i hope  no—no attempted interference with the magistrates’  ‘deedles the banker’ gasped the secretary  ‘deedles brothers—who was to have been here today—high in office in the goldsmiths’ company—’  ‘not stopped’ exclaimed the alderman ‘it can’t be’  ‘shot himself’  ‘good god’  ‘put a doublebarrelled pistol to his mouth in his own counting house’ said mr fish ‘and blew his brains out  no motive  princely circumstances’  ‘circumstances’ exclaimed the alderman  ‘a man of noble fortune  one of the most respectable of men  suicide mr fish  by his own hand’  ‘this very morning’ returned mr fish  ‘oh the brain the brain’ exclaimed the pious alderman lifting up his hands  ‘oh the nerves the nerves the mysteries of this machine called man  oh the little that unhinges it poor creatures that we are perhaps a dinner mr fish  perhaps the conduct of his son who i have heard ran very wild and was in the habit of drawing bills upon him without the least authority  a most respectable man  one of the most respectable men i ever knew  a lamentable instance mr fish  a public calamity  i shall make a point of wearing the deepest mourning  a most respectable man  but there is one above  we must submit mr fish  we must submit’  what alderman  no word of putting down  remember justice your high moral boast and pride  come alderman  balance those scales  throw me into this the empty one no dinner and nature’s founts in some poor woman dried by starving misery and rendered obdurate to claims for which her offspring has authority in holy mother eve  weigh me the two you daniel going to judgment when your day shall come  weigh them in the eyes of suffering thousands audience not unmindful of the grim farce you play  or supposing that you strayed from your five wits—it’s not so far to go but that it might be—and laid hands upon that throat of yours warning your fellows if you have a fellow how they croak their comfortable wickedness to raving heads and stricken hearts  what then  the words rose up in trotty’s breast as if they had been spoken by some other voice within him  alderman cute pledged himself to mr fish that he would assist him in breaking the melancholy catastrophe to sir joseph when the day was over  then before they parted wringing mr fish’s hand in bitterness of soul he said ‘the most respectable of men’  and added that he hardly knew not even he why such afflictions were allowed on earth  ‘it’s almost enough to make one think if one didn’t know better’ said alderman cute ‘that at times some motion of a capsizing nature was going on in things which affected the general economy of the social fabric deedles brothers’  the skittleplaying came off with immense success  sir joseph knocked the pins about quite skilfully master bowley took an innings at a shorter distance also and everybody said that now when a baronet and the son of a baronet played at skittles the country was coming round again as fast as it could come  at its proper time the banquet was served up  trotty involuntarily repaired to the hall with the rest for he felt himself conducted thither by some stronger impulse than his own free will  the sight was gay in the extreme the ladies were very handsome the visitors delighted cheerful and goodtempered  when the lower doors were opened and the people flocked in in their rustic dresses the beauty of the spectacle was at its height but trotty only murmured more and more ‘where is richard  he should help and comfort her  i can’t see richard’  there had been some speeches made and lady bowley’s health had been proposed and sir joseph bowley had returned thanks and had made his great speech showing by various pieces of evidence that he was the born friend and father and so forth and had given as a toast his friends and children and the dignity of labour when a slight disturbance at the bottom of the hall attracted toby’s notice  after some confusion noise and opposition one man broke through the rest and stood forward by himself  not richard  no  but one whom he had thought of and had looked for many times  in a scantier supply of light he might have doubted the identity of that worn man so old and grey and bent but with a blaze of lamps upon his gnarled and knotted head he knew will fern as soon as he stepped forth  ‘what is this’ exclaimed sir joseph rising  ‘who gave this man admittance  this is a criminal from prison  mr fish sir will you have the goodness—’  ‘a minute’ said will fern  ‘a minute  my lady you was born on this day along with a new year  get me a minute’s leave to speak’  she made some intercession for him  sir joseph took his seat again with native dignity  the ragged visitor—for he was miserably dressed—looked round upon the company and made his homage to them with a humble bow  ‘gentlefolks’ he said  ‘you’ve drunk the labourer  look at me’  ‘just come from jail’ said mr fish  ‘just come from jail’ said will  ‘and neither for the first time nor the second nor the third nor yet the fourth’  mr filer was heard to remark testily that four times was over the average and he ought to be ashamed of himself  ‘gentlefolks’ repeated will fern  ‘look at me  you see i’m at the worst  beyond all hurt or harm beyond your help for the time when your kind words or kind actions could have done me good’—he struck his hand upon his breast and shook his head ‘is gone with the scent of last year’s beans or clover on the air  let me say a word for these’ pointing to the labouring people in the hall ‘and when you’re met together hear the real truth spoke out for once’  ‘there’s not a man here’ said the host ‘who would have him for a spokesman’  ‘like enough sir joseph  i believe it  not the less true perhaps is what i say  perhaps that’s a proof on it  gentlefolks i’ve lived many a year in this place  you may see the cottage from the sunk fence over yonder  i’ve seen the ladies draw it in their books a hundred times it looks well in a picter i’ve heerd say but there an’t weather in picters and maybe ’tis fitter for that than for a place to live in well  i lived there  how hard—how bitter hard i lived there i won’t say  any day in the year and every day you can judge for your own selves’  he spoke as he had spoken on the night when trotty found him in the street  his voice was deeper and more husky and had a trembling in it now and then but he never raised it passionately and seldom lifted it above the firm stern level of the homely facts he stated  ‘’tis harder than you think for gentlefolks to grow up decent commonly decent in such a place  that i growed up a man and not a brute says something for me—as i was then  as i am now there’s nothing can be said for me or done for me  i’m past it’  ‘i am glad this man has entered’ observed sir joseph looking round serenely  ‘don’t disturb him  it appears to be ordained  he is an example a living example  i hope and trust and confidently expect that it will not be lost upon my friends here’  ‘i dragged on’ said fern after a moment’s silence ‘somehow  neither me nor any other man knows how but so heavy that i couldn’t put a cheerful face upon it or make believe that i was anything but what i was  now gentlemen—you gentlemen that sits at sessions—when you see a man with discontent writ on his face you says to one another “he’s suspicious  i has my doubts” says you “about will fern  watch that fellow”  i don’t say gentlemen it ain’t quite nat’ral but i say ’tis so and from that hour whatever will fern does or lets alone—all one—it goes against him’  alderman cute stuck his thumbs in his waistcoatpockets and leaning back in his chair and smiling winked at a neighbouring chandelier  as much as to say ‘of course  i told you so  the common cry  lord bless you we are up to all this sort of thing—myself and human nature’  ‘now gentlemen’ said will fern holding out his hands and flushing for an instant in his haggard face ‘see how your laws are made to trap and hunt us when we’re brought to this  i tries to live elsewhere  and i’m a vagabond  to jail with him  i comes back here  i goes anutting in your woods and breaks—who don’t—a limber branch or two  to jail with him  one of your keepers sees me in the broad day near my own patch of garden with a gun  to jail with him  i has a nat’ral angry word with that man when i’m free again  to jail with him  i cuts a stick  to jail with him  i eats a rotten apple or a turnip  to jail with him it’s twenty mile away and coming back i begs a trifle on the road  to jail with him  at last the constable the keeper—anybody—finds me anywhere adoing anything  to jail with him for he’s a vagrant and a jailbird known and jail’s the only home he’s got’  the alderman nodded sagaciously as who should say ‘a very good home too’  ‘do i say this to serve my cause’ cried fern  ‘who can give me back my liberty who can give me back my good name who can give me back my innocent niece  not all the lords and ladies in wide england  but gentlemen gentlemen dealing with other men like me begin at the right end  give us in mercy better homes when we’re alying in our cradles give us better food when we’re aworking for our lives give us kinder laws to bring us back when were agoing wrong and don’t set jail jail jail afore us everywhere we turn  there an’t a condescension you can show the labourer then that he won’t take as ready and as grateful as a man can be for he has a patient peaceful willing heart  but you must put his rightful spirit in him first for whether he’s a wreck and ruin such as me or is like one of them that stand here now his spirit is divided from you at this time  bring it back gentlefolks bring it back  bring it back afore the day comes when even his bible changes in his altered mind and the words seem to him to read as they have sometimes read in my own eyes—in jail “whither thou goest i can not go where thou lodgest i do not lodge thy people are not my people nor thy god my god”’  a sudden stir and agitation took place in hall  trotty thought at first that several had risen to eject the man and hence this change in its appearance  but another moment showed him that the room and all the company had vanished from his sight and that his daughter was again before him seated at her work  but in a poorer meaner garret than before and with no lilian by her side  the frame at which she had worked was put away upon a shelf and covered up  the chair in which she had sat was turned against the wall  a history was written in these little things and in meg’s griefworn face oh who could fail to read it  meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to see the threads and when the night closed in she lighted her feeble candle and worked on  still her old father was invisible about her looking down upon her loving her—how dearly loving her—and talking to her in a tender voice about the old times and the bells  though he knew poor trotty though he knew she could not hear him  a great part of the evening had worn away when a knock came at her door she opened it  a man was on the threshold  a slouching moody drunken sloven wasted by intemperance and vice and with his matted hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder but with some traces on him too of having been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth  he stopped until he had her leave to enter and she retiring a pace of two from the open door silently and sorrowfully looked upon him  trotty had his wish  he saw richard  ‘may i come in margaret’  ‘yes  come in  come in’  it was well that trotty knew him before he spoke for with any doubt remaining on his mind the harsh discordant voice would have persuaded him that it was not richard but some other man  there were but two chairs in the room  she gave him hers and stood at some short distance from him waiting to hear what he had to say  he sat however staring vacantly at the floor with a lustreless and stupid smile  a spectacle of such deep degradation of such abject hopelessness of such a miserable downfall that she put her hands before her face and turned away lest he should see how much it moved her  roused by the rustling of her dress or some such trifling sound he lifted his head and began to speak as if there had been no pause since he entered  ‘still at work margaret  you work late’  ‘i generally do’  ‘and early’  ‘and early’  ‘so she said  she said you never tired or never owned that you tired not all the time you lived together  not even when you fainted between work and fasting  but i told you that the last time i came’  ‘you did’ she answered  ‘and i implored you to tell me nothing more and you made me a solemn promise richard that you never would’  ‘a solemn promise’ he repeated with a drivelling laugh and vacant stare  ‘a solemn promise  to be sure  a solemn promise’  awakening as it were after a time in the same manner as before he said with sudden animation  ‘how can i help it margaret  what am i to do  she has been to me again’  ‘again’ cried meg clasping her hands  ‘o does she think of me so often  has she been again’  ‘twenty times again’ said richard  ‘margaret she haunts me  she comes behind me in the street and thrusts it in my hand  i hear her foot upon the ashes when i’m at my work ha ha that an’t often and before i can turn my head her voice is in my ear saying “richard don’t look round for heaven’s love give her this”  she brings it where i live she sends it in letters she taps at the window and lays it on the sill  what can i do  look at it’  he held out in his hand a little purse and chinked the money it enclosed  ‘hide it’ sad meg  ‘hide it  when she comes again tell her richard that i love her in my soul  that i never lie down to sleep but i bless her and pray for her  that in my solitary work i never cease to have her in my thoughts  that she is with me night and day  that if i died tomorrow i would remember her with my last breath  but that i cannot look upon it’  he slowly recalled his hand and crushing the purse together said with a kind of drowsy thoughtfulness  ‘i told her so  i told her so as plain as words could speak  i’ve taken this gift back and left it at her door a dozen times since then but when she came at last and stood before me face to face what could i do’  ‘you saw her’ exclaimed meg  ‘you saw her  o lilian my sweet girl o lilian lilian’  ‘i saw her’ he went on to say not answering but engaged in the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts  ‘there she stood trembling  “how does she look richard  does she ever speak of me  is she thinner  my old place at the table what’s in my old place  and the frame she taught me our old work on—has she burnt it richard”  there she was  i heard her say it’  meg checked her sobs and with the tears streaming from her eyes bent over him to listen  not to lose a breath  with his arms resting on his knees and stooping forward in his chair as if what he said were written on the ground in some half legible character which it was his occupation to decipher and connect he went on  ‘“richard i have fallen very low and you may guess how much i have suffered in having this sent back when i can bear to bring it in my hand to you  but you loved her once even in my memory dearly  others stepped in between you fears and jealousies and doubts and vanities estranged you from her but you did love her even in my memory”  i suppose i did’ he said interrupting himself for a moment  ‘i did that’s neither here nor there—“o richard if you ever did if you have any memory for what is gone and lost take it to her once more  once more  tell her how i laid my head upon your shoulder where her own head might have lain and was so humble to you richard  tell her that you looked into my face and saw the beauty which she used to praise all gone all gone and in its place a poor wan hollow cheek that she would weep to see  tell her everything and take it back and she will not refuse again  she will not have the heart”’  so he sat musing and repeating the last words until he woke again and rose  ‘you won’t take it margaret’  she shook her head and motioned an entreaty to him to leave her  ‘good night margaret’  ‘good night’  he turned to look upon her struck by her sorrow and perhaps by the pity for himself which trembled in her voice  it was a quick and rapid action and for the moment some flash of his old bearing kindled in his form  in the next he went as he had come  nor did this glimmer of a quenched fire seem to light him to a quicker sense of his debasement  in any mood in any grief in any torture of the mind or body meg’s work must be done  she sat down to her task and plied it  night midnight still she worked  she had a meagre fire the night being very cold and rose at intervals to mend it  the chimes rang halfpast twelve while she was thus engaged and when they ceased she heard a gentle knocking at the door  before she could so much as wonder who was there at that unusual hour it opened  o youth and beauty happy as ye should be look at this  o youth and beauty blest and blessing all within your reach and working out the ends of your beneficent creator look at this  she saw the entering figure screamed its name cried ‘lilian’  it was swift and fell upon its knees before her clinging to her dress  ‘up dear  up  lilian  my own dearest’  ‘never more meg never more  here  here  close to you holding to you feeling your dear breath upon my face’  ‘sweet lilian  darling lilian  child of my heart—no mother’s love can be more tender—lay your head upon my breast’  ‘never more meg  never more  when i first looked into your face you knelt before me  on my knees before you let me die  let it be here’  ‘you have come back  my treasure  we will live together work together hope together die together’  ‘ah  kiss my lips meg fold your arms about me press me to your bosom look kindly on me but don’t raise me  let it be here  let me see the last of your dear face upon my knees’  o youth and beauty happy as ye should be look at this  o youth and beauty working out the ends of your beneficent creator look at this  ‘forgive me meg  so dear so dear  forgive me  i know you do i see you do but say so meg’  she said so with her lips on lilian’s cheek  and with her arms twined round—she knew it now—a broken heart  ‘his blessing on you dearest love  kiss me once more  he suffered her to sit beside his feet and dry them with her hair  o meg what mercy and compassion’  as she died the spirit of the child returning innocent and radiant touched the old man with its hand and beckoned him away     chapter iv—fourth quarter   some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the bells some faint impression of the ringing of the chimes some giddy consciousness of having seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and reproduced until the recollection of them lost itself in the confusion of their numbers some hurried knowledge how conveyed to him he knew not that more years had passed and trotty with the spirit of the child attending him stood looking on at mortal company  fat company rosycheeked company comfortable company  they were but two but they were red enough for ten  they sat before a bright fire with a small low table between them and unless the fragrance of hot tea and muffins lingered longer in that room than in most others the table had seen service very lately  but all the cups and saucers being clean and in their proper places in the cornercupboard and the brass toastingfork hanging in its usual nook and spreading its four idle fingers out as if it wanted to be measured for a glove there remained no other visible tokens of the meal just finished than such as purred and washed their whiskers in the person of the basking cat and glistened in the gracious not to say the greasy faces of her patrons  this cosy couple married evidently had made a fair division of the fire between them and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped into the grate now nodding off into a doze now waking up again when some hot fragment larger than the rest came rattling down as if the fire were coming with it  it was in no danger of sudden extinction however for it gleamed not only in the little room and on the panes of windowglass in the door and on the curtain half drawn across them but in the little shop beyond a little shop quite crammed and choked with the abundance of its stock a perfectly voracious little shop with a maw as accommodating and full as any shark’s  cheese butter firewood soap pickles matches bacon tablebeer pegtops sweetmeats boys’ kites birdseed cold ham birch brooms hearthstones salt vinegar blacking redherrings stationery lard mushroomketchup staylaces loaves of bread shuttlecocks eggs and slate pencil everything was fish that came to the net of this greedy little shop and all articles were in its net  how many other kinds of petty merchandise were there it would be difficult to say but balls of packthread ropes of onions pounds of candles cabbagenets and brushes hung in bunches from the ceiling like extraordinary fruit while various odd canisters emitting aromatic smells established the veracity of the inscription over the outer door which informed the public that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in tea coffee tobacco pepper and snuff  glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the shining of the blaze and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which burnt but dimly in the shop itself as though its plethora sat heavy on their lungs and glancing then at one of the two faces by the parlourfire trotty had small difficulty in recognising in the stout old lady mrs chickenstalker always inclined to corpulency even in the days when he had known her as established in the general line and having a small balance against him in her books  the features of her companion were less easy to him  the great broad chin with creases in it large enough to hide a finger in the astonished eyes that seemed to expostulate with themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of the soft face the nose afflicted with that disordered action of its functions which is generally termed the snuffles the short thick throat and labouring chest with other beauties of the like description though calculated to impress the memory trotty could at first allot to nobody he had ever known and yet he had some recollection of them too  at length in mrs chickenstalker’s partner in the general line and in the crooked and eccentric line of life he recognised the former porter of sir joseph bowley an apoplectic innocent who had connected himself in trotty’s mind with mrs chickenstalker years ago by giving him admission to the mansion where he had confessed his obligations to that lady and drawn on his unlucky head such grave reproach  trotty had little interest in a change like this after the changes he had seen but association is very strong sometimes and he looked involuntarily behind the parlourdoor where the accounts of credit customers were usually kept in chalk  there was no record of his name some names were there but they were strange to him and infinitely fewer than of old from which he argued that the porter was an advocate of readymoney transactions and on coming into the business had looked pretty sharp after the chickenstalker defaulters  so desolate was trotty and so mournful for the youth and promise of his blighted child that it was a sorrow to him even to have no place in mrs chickenstalker’s ledger  ‘what sort of a night is it anne’ inquired the former porter of sir joseph bowley stretching out his legs before the fire and rubbing as much of them as his short arms could reach with an air that added ‘here i am if it’s bad and i don’t want to go out if it’s good’  ‘blowing and sleeting hard’ returned his wife ‘and threatening snow dark  and very cold’  ‘i’m glad to think we had muffins’ said the former porter in the tone of one who had set his conscience at rest  ‘it’s a sort of night that’s meant for muffins  likewise crumpets  also sally lunns’  the former porter mentioned each successive kind of eatable as if he were musingly summing up his good actions  after which he rubbed his fat legs as before and jerking them at the knees to get the fire upon the yet unroasted parts laughed as if somebody had tickled him  ‘you’re in spirits tugby my dear’ observed his wife  the firm was tugby late chickenstalker  ‘no’ said tugby  ‘no  not particular  i’m a little elewated  the muffins came so pat’  with that he chuckled until he was black in the face and had so much ado to become any other colour that his fat legs took the strangest excursions into the air  nor were they reduced to anything like decorum until mrs tugby had thumped him violently on the back and shaken him as if he were a great bottle  ‘good gracious goodness lordamercy bless and save the man’ cried mrs tugby in great terror  ‘what’s he doing’  mr tugby wiped his eyes and faintly repeated that he found himself a little elewated  ‘then don’t be so again that’s a dear good soul’ said mrs tugby ‘if you don’t want to frighten me to death with your struggling and fighting’  mr tugby said he wouldn’t but his whole existence was a fight in which if any judgment might be founded on the constantlyincreasing shortness of his breath and the deepening purple of his face he was always getting the worst of it  ‘so it’s blowing and sleeting and threatening snow and it’s dark and very cold is it my dear’ said mr tugby looking at the fire and reverting to the cream and marrow of his temporary elevation  ‘hard weather indeed’ returned his wife shaking her head  ‘aye aye  years’ said mr tugby ‘are like christians in that respect some of ’em die hard some of ’em die easy  this one hasn’t many days to run and is making a fight for it  i like him all the better  there’s a customer my love’  attentive to the rattling door mrs tugby had already risen  ‘now then’ said that lady passing out into the little shop  ‘what’s wanted  oh  i beg your pardon sir i’m sure  i didn’t think it was you’  she made this apology to a gentleman in black who with his wristbands tucked up and his hat cocked loungingly on one side and his hands in his pockets sat down astride on the tablebeer barrel and nodded in return  ‘this is a bad business upstairs mrs tugby’ said the gentleman  ‘the man can’t live’  ‘not the backattic can’t’ cried tugby coming out into the shop to join the conference  ‘the backattic mr tugby’ said the gentleman ‘is coming downstairs fast and will be below the basement very soon’  looking by turns at tugby and his wife he sounded the barrel with his knuckles for the depth of beer and having found it played a tune upon the empty part  ‘the backattic mr tugby’ said the gentleman tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time ‘is going’  ‘then’ said tugby turning to his wife ‘he must go you know before he’s gone’  ‘i don’t think you can move him’ said the gentleman shaking his head ‘i wouldn’t take the responsibility of saying it could be done myself you had better leave him where he is  he can’t live long’  ‘it’s the only subject’ said tugby bringing the butterscale down upon the counter with a crash by weighing his fist on it ‘that we’ve ever had a word upon she and me and look what it comes to  he’s going to die here after all  going to die upon the premises  going to die in our house’  ‘and where should he have died tugby’ cried his wife  ‘in the workhouse’ he returned  ‘what are workhouses made for’  ‘not for that’ said mrs tugby with great energy  ‘not for that neither did i marry you for that  don’t think it tugby  i won’t have it  i won’t allow it  i’d be separated first and never see your face again  when my widow’s name stood over that door as it did for many years this house being known as mrs chickenstalker’s far and wide and never known but to its honest credit and its good report when my widow’s name stood over that door tugby i knew him as a handsome steady manly independent youth i knew her as the sweetestlooking sweetesttempered girl eyes ever saw i knew her father poor old creetur he fell down from the steeple walking in his sleep and killed himself for the simplest hardestworking childesthearted man that ever drew the breath of life and when i turn them out of house and home may angels turn me out of heaven  as they would  and serve me right’  her old face which had been a plump and dimpled one before the changes which had come to pass seemed to shine out of her as she said these words and when she dried her eyes and shook her head and her handkerchief at tugby with an expression of firmness which it was quite clear was not to be easily resisted trotty said ‘bless her  bless her’  then he listened with a panting heart for what should follow  knowing nothing yet but that they spoke of meg  if tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour he more than balanced that account by being not a little depressed in the shop where he now stood staring at his wife without attempting a reply secretly conveying however—either in a fit of abstraction or as a precautionary measure—all the money from the till into his own pockets as he looked at her  the gentleman upon the tablebeer cask who appeared to be some authorised medical attendant upon the poor was far too well accustomed evidently to little differences of opinion between man and wife to interpose any remark in this instance  he sat softly whistling and turning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the ground until there was a perfect calm when he raised his head and said to mrs tugby late chickenstalker  ‘there’s something interesting about the woman even now  how did she come to marry him’  ‘why that’ said mrs tugby taking a seat near him ‘is not the least cruel part of her story sir  you see they kept company she and richard many years ago  when they were a young and beautiful couple everything was settled and they were to have been married on a new year’s day  but somehow richard got it into his head through what the gentlemen told him that he might do better and that he’d soon repent it and that she wasn’t good enough for him and that a young man of spirit had no business to be married  and the gentlemen frightened her and made her melancholy and timid of his deserting her and of her children coming to the gallows and of its being wicked to be man and wife and a good deal more of it  and in short they lingered and lingered and their trust in one another was broken and so at last was the match  but the fault was his  she would have married him sir joyfully  i’ve seen her heart swell many times afterwards when he passed her in a proud and careless way and never did a woman grieve more truly for a man than she for richard when he first went wrong’  ‘oh he went wrong did he’ said the gentleman pulling out the ventpeg of the tablebeer and trying to peep down into the barrel through the hole  ‘well sir i don’t know that he rightly understood himself you see  i think his mind was troubled by their having broke with one another and that but for being ashamed before the gentlemen and perhaps for being uncertain too how she might take it he’d have gone through any suffering or trial to have had meg’s promise and meg’s hand again that’s my belief  he never said so more’s the pity  he took to drinking idling bad companions all the fine resources that were to be so much better for him than the home he might have had  he lost his looks his character his health his strength his friends his work everything’  ‘he didn’t lose everything mrs tugby’ returned the gentleman ‘because he gained a wife and i want to know how he gained her’  ‘i’m coming to it sir in a moment  this went on for years and years he sinking lower and lower she enduring poor thing miseries enough to wear her life away  at last he was so cast down and cast out that no one would employ or notice him and doors were shut upon him go where he would  applying from place to place and door to door and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman who had often and often tried him he was a good workman to the very end that gentleman who knew his history said “i believe you are incorrigible there is only one person in the world who has a chance of reclaiming you ask me to trust you no more until she tries to do it”  something like that in his anger and vexation’  ‘ah’ said the gentleman  ‘well’  ‘well sir he went to her and kneeled to her said it was so said it ever had been so and made a prayer to her to save him’  ‘and she—don’t distress yourself mrs tugby’  ‘she came to me that night to ask me about living here  “what he was once to me” she said “is buried in a grave side by side with what i was to him  but i have thought of this and i will make the trial  in the hope of saving him for the love of the lighthearted girl you remember her who was to have been married on a new year’s day and for the love of her richard”  and she said he had come to her from lilian and lilian had trusted to him and she never could forget that  so they were married and when they came home here and i saw them i hoped that such prophecies as parted them when they were young may not often fulfil themselves as they did in this case or i wouldn’t be the makers of them for a mine of gold’  the gentleman got off the cask and stretched himself observing  ‘i suppose he used her ill as soon as they were married’  ‘i don’t think he ever did that’ said mrs tugby shaking her head and wiping her eyes  ‘he went on better for a short time but his habits were too old and strong to be got rid of he soon fell back a little and was falling fast back when his illness came so strong upon him  i think he has always felt for her  i am sure he has  i have seen him in his crying fits and tremblings try to kiss her hand and i have heard him call her “meg” and say it was her nineteenth birthday  there he has been lying now these weeks and months  between him and her baby she has not been able to do her old work and by not being able to be regular she has lost it even if she could have done it  how they have lived i hardly know’  ‘i know’ muttered mr tugby looking at the till and round the shop and at his wife and rolling his head with immense intelligence  ‘like fighting cocks’  he was interrupted by a cry—a sound of lamentation—from the upper story of the house  the gentleman moved hurriedly to the door  ‘my friend’ he said looking back ‘you needn’t discuss whether he shall be removed or not  he has spared you that trouble i believe’  saying so he ran upstairs followed by mrs tugby while mr tugby panted and grumbled after them at leisure being rendered more than commonly shortwinded by the weight of the till in which there had been an inconvenient quantity of copper  trotty with the child beside him floated up the staircase like mere air  ‘follow her  follow her  follow her’  he heard the ghostly voices in the bells repeat their words as he ascended  ‘learn it from the creature dearest to your heart’  it was over  it was over  and this was she her father’s pride and joy this haggard wretched woman weeping by the bed if it deserved that name and pressing to her breast and hanging down her head upon an infant  who can tell how spare how sickly and how poor an infant  who can tell how dear  ‘thank god’ cried trotty holding up his folded hands  ‘o god be thanked  she loves her child’  the gentleman not otherwise hardhearted or indifferent to such scenes than that he saw them every day and knew that they were figures of no moment in the filer sums—mere scratches in the working of these calculations—laid his hand upon the heart that beat no more and listened for the breath and said ‘his pain is over  it’s better as it is’ mrs tugby tried to comfort her with kindness  mr tugby tried philosophy  ‘come come’ he said with his hands in his pockets ‘you mustn’t give way you know  that won’t do  you must fight up  what would have become of me if i had given way when i was porter and we had as many as six runaway carriagedoubles at our door in one night  but i fell back upon my strength of mind and didn’t open it’  again trotty heard the voices saying ‘follow her’  he turned towards his guide and saw it rising from him passing through the air  ‘follow her’ it said  and vanished  he hovered round her sat down at her feet looked up into her face for one trace of her old self listened for one note of her old pleasant voice  he flitted round the child so wan so prematurely old so dreadful in its gravity so plaintive in its feeble mournful miserable wail  he almost worshipped it  he clung to it as her only safeguard as the last unbroken link that bound her to endurance  he set his father’s hope and trust on the frail baby watched her every look upon it as she held it in her arms and cried a thousand times ‘she loves it  god be thanked she loves it’  he saw the woman tend her in the night return to her when her grudging husband was asleep and all was still encourage her shed tears with her set nourishment before her  he saw the day come and the night again the day the night the time go by the house of death relieved of death the room left to herself and to the child he heard it moan and cry he saw it harass her and tire her out and when she slumbered in exhaustion drag her back to consciousness and hold her with its little hands upon the rack but she was constant to it gentle with it patient with it  patient  was its loving mother in her inmost heart and soul and had its being knitted up with hers as when she carried it unborn  all this time she was in want languishing away in dire and pining want  with the baby in her arms she wandered here and there in quest of occupation and with its thin face lying in her lap and looking up in hers did any work for any wretched sum a day and night of labour for as many farthings as there were figures on the dial  if she had quarrelled with it if she had neglected it if she had looked upon it with a moment’s hate if in the frenzy of an instant she had struck it  no his comfort was she loved it always  she told no one of her extremity and wandered abroad in the day lest she should be questioned by her only friend for any help she received from her hands occasioned fresh disputes between the good woman and her husband and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause of strife and discord where she owed so much  she loved it still  she loved it more and more  but a change fell on the aspect of her love  one night  she was singing faintly to it in its sleep and walking to and fro to hush it when her door was softly opened and a man looked in  ‘for the last time’ he said  ‘william fern’  ‘for the last time’  he listened like a man pursued and spoke in whispers  ‘margaret my race is nearly run  i couldn’t finish it without a parting word with you  without one grateful word’  ‘what have you done’ she asked regarding him with terror  he looked at her but gave no answer  after a short silence he made a gesture with his hand as if he set her question by as if he brushed it aside and said  ‘it’s long ago margaret now but that night is as fresh in my memory as ever ’twas  we little thought then’ he added looking round ‘that we should ever meet like this  your child margaret  let me have it in my arms  let me hold your child’  he put his hat upon the floor and took it  and he trembled as he took it from head to foot  ‘is it a girl’  ‘yes’  he put his hand before its little face  ‘see how weak i’m grown margaret when i want the courage to look at it let her be a moment  i won’t hurt her  it’s long ago but—what’s her name’  ‘margaret’ she answered quickly  ‘i’m glad of that’ he said  ‘i’m glad of that’  he seemed to breathe more freely and after pausing for an instant took away his hand and looked upon the infant’s face  but covered it again immediately  ‘margaret’ he said and gave her back the child  ‘it’s lilian’s’  ‘lilian’s’  ‘i held the same face in my arms when lilian’s mother died and left her’  ‘when lilian’s mother died and left her’ she repeated wildly  ‘how shrill you speak  why do you fix your eyes upon me so  margaret’  she sunk down in a chair and pressed the infant to her breast and wept over it  sometimes she released it from her embrace to look anxiously in its face then strained it to her bosom again  at those times when she gazed upon it then it was that something fierce and terrible began to mingle with her love  then it was that her old father quailed  ‘follow her’ was sounded through the house  ‘learn it from the creature dearest to your heart’  ‘margaret’ said fern bending over her and kissing her upon the brow ‘i thank you for the last time  good night  good bye  put your hand in mine and tell me you’ll forget me from this hour and try to think the end of me was here’  ‘what have you done’ she asked again  ‘there’ll be a fire tonight’ he said removing from her  ‘there’ll be fires this wintertime to light the dark nights east west north and south  when you see the distant sky red they’ll be blazing  when you see the distant sky red think of me no more or if you do remember what a hell was lighted up inside of me and think you see its flames reflected in the clouds  good night  good bye’  she called to him but he was gone  she sat down stupefied until her infant roused her to a sense of hunger cold and darkness  she paced the room with it the livelong night hushing it and soothing it  she said at intervals ‘like lilian when her mother died and left her’  why was her step so quick her eye so wild her love so fierce and terrible whenever she repeated those words  ‘but it is love’ said trotty  ‘it is love  she’ll never cease to love it  my poor meg’  she dressed the child next morning with unusual care—ah vain expenditure of care upon such squalid robes—and once more tried to find some means of life  it was the last day of the old year  she tried till night and never broke her fast  she tried in vain  she mingled with an abject crowd who tarried in the snow until it pleased some officer appointed to dispense the public charity the lawful charity not that once preached upon a mount to call them in and question them and say to this one ‘go to such a place’ to that one ‘come next week’ to make a football of another wretch and pass him here and there from hand to hand from house to house until he wearied and lay down to die or started up and robbed and so became a higher sort of criminal whose claims allowed of no delay  here too she failed  she loved her child and wished to have it lying on her breast  and that was quite enough  it was night a bleak dark cutting night when pressing the child close to her for warmth she arrived outside the house she called her home  she was so faint and giddy that she saw no one standing in the doorway until she was close upon it and about to enter  then she recognised the master of the house who had so disposed himself—with his person it was not difficult—as to fill up the whole entry  ‘o’ he said softly  ‘you have come back’  she looked at the child and shook her head  ‘don’t you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent don’t you think that without any money you’ve been a pretty constant customer at this shop now’ said mr tugby  she repeated the same mute appeal  ‘suppose you try and deal somewhere else’ he said  ‘and suppose you provide yourself with another lodging  come  don’t you think you could manage it’  she said in a low voice that it was very late  tomorrow  ‘now i see what you want’ said tugby ‘and what you mean  you know there are two parties in this house about you and you delight in setting ’em by the ears  i don’t want any quarrels i’m speaking softly to avoid a quarrel but if you don’t go away i’ll speak out loud and you shall cause words high enough to please you  but you shan’t come in  that i am determined’  she put her hair back with her hand and looked in a sudden manner at the sky and the dark lowering distance  ‘this is the last night of an old year and i won’t carry illblood and quarrellings and disturbances into a new one to please you nor anybody else’ said tugby who was quite a retail friend and father  ‘i wonder you an’t ashamed of yourself to carry such practices into a new year if you haven’t any business in the world but to be always giving way and always making disturbances between man and wife you’d be better out of it  go along with you’  ‘follow her  to desperation’  again the old man heard the voices  looking up he saw the figures hovering in the air and pointing where she went down the dark street  ‘she loves it’ he exclaimed in agonised entreaty for her  ‘chimes she loves it still’  ‘follow her’  the shadow swept upon the track she had taken like a cloud  he joined in the pursuit he kept close to her he looked into her face he saw the same fierce and terrible expression mingling with her love and kindling in her eyes  he heard her say ‘like lilian  to be changed like lilian’ and her speed redoubled  o for something to awaken her  for any sight or sound or scent to call up tender recollections in a brain on fire  for any gentle image of the past to rise before her  ‘i was her father  i was her father’ cried the old man stretching out his hands to the dark shadows flying on above  ‘have mercy on her and on me  where does she go  turn her back  i was her father’  but they only pointed to her as she hurried on and said ‘to desperation  learn it from the creature dearest to your heart’  a hundred voices echoed it  the air was made of breath expended in those words  he seemed to take them in at every gasp he drew  they were everywhere and not to be escaped  and still she hurried on the same light in her eyes the same words in her mouth ‘like lilian  to be changed like lilian’  all at once she stopped  ‘now turn her back’ exclaimed the old man tearing his white hair  ‘my child  meg  turn her back  great father turn her back’  in her own scanty shawl she wrapped the baby warm  with her fevered hands she smoothed its limbs composed its face arranged its mean attire  in her wasted arms she folded it as though she never would resign it more  and with her dry lips kissed it in a final pang and last long agony of love  putting its tiny hand up to her neck and holding it there within her dress next to her distracted heart she set its sleeping face against her closely steadily against her and sped onward to the river  to the rolling river swift and dim where winter night sat brooding like the last dark thoughts of many who had sought a refuge there before her where scattered lights upon the banks gleamed sullen red and dull as torches that were burning there to show the way to death  where no abode of living people cast its shadow on the deep impenetrable melancholy shade  to the river  to that portal of eternity her desperate footsteps tended with the swiftness of its rapid waters running to the sea  he tried to touch her as she passed him going down to its dark level but the wild distempered form the fierce and terrible love the desperation that had left all human check or hold behind swept by him like the wind  he followed her  she paused a moment on the brink before the dreadful plunge  he fell down on his knees and in a shriek addressed the figures in the bells now hovering above them  ‘i have learnt it’ cried the old man  ‘from the creature dearest to my heart  o save her save her’  he could wind his fingers in her dress could hold it  as the words escaped his lips he felt his sense of touch return and knew that he detained her  the figures looked down steadfastly upon him  ‘i have learnt it’ cried the old man  ‘o have mercy on me in this hour if in my love for her so young and good i slandered nature in the breasts of mothers rendered desperate  pity my presumption wickedness and ignorance and save her’  he felt his hold relaxing they were silent still  ‘have mercy on her’ he exclaimed ‘as one in whom this dreadful crime has sprung from love perverted from the strongest deepest love we fallen creatures know  think what her misery must have been when such seed bears such fruit  heaven meant her to be good  there is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to this if such a life had gone before  o have mercy on my child who even at this pass means mercy to her own and dies herself and perils her immortal soul to save it’  she was in his arms  he held her now  his strength was like a giant’s  ‘i see the spirit of the chimes among you’ cried the old man singling out the child and speaking in some inspiration which their looks conveyed to him  ‘i know that our inheritance is held in store for us by time  i know there is a sea of time to rise one day before which all who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves  i see it on the flow  i know that we must trust and hope and neither doubt ourselves nor doubt the good in one another  i have learnt it from the creature dearest to my heart  i clasp her in my arms again  o spirits merciful and good i take your lesson to my breast along with her  o spirits merciful and good i am grateful’  he might have said more but the bells the old familiar bells his own dear constant steady friends the chimes began to ring the joypeals for a new year so lustily so merrily so happily so gaily that he leapt upon his feet and broke the spell that bound him                                        ‘and whatever you do father’ said meg ‘don’t eat tripe again without asking some doctor whether it’s likely to agree with you for how you have been going on good gracious’  she was working with her needle at the little table by the fire dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her wedding  so quietly happy so blooming and youthful so full of beautiful promise that he uttered a great cry as if it were an angel in his house then flew to clasp her in his arms  but he caught his feet in the newspaper which had fallen on the hearth and somebody came rushing in between them  ‘no’ cried the voice of this same somebody a generous and jolly voice it was  ‘not even you  not even you  the first kiss of meg in the new year is mine  mine  i have been waiting outside the house this hour to hear the bells and claim it  meg my precious prize a happy year  a life of happy years my darling wife’  and richard smothered her with kisses  you never in all your life saw anything like trotty after this  i don’t care where you have lived or what you have seen you never in all your life saw anything at all approaching him  he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and cried he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed and cried together he got out of his chair and hugged meg he got out of his chair and hugged richard he got out of his chair and hugged them both at once he kept running up to meg and squeezing her fresh face between his hands and kissing it going from her backwards not to lose sight of it and running up again like a figure in a magic lantern and whatever he did he was constantly sitting himself down in his chair and never stopping in it for one single moment being—that’s the truth—beside himself with joy  ‘and tomorrow’s your weddingday my pet’ cried trotty  ‘your real happy weddingday’  ‘today’ cried richard shaking hands with him  ‘today  the chimes are ringing in the new year  hear them’  they were ringing  bless their sturdy hearts they were ringing  great bells as they were melodious deepmouthed noble bells cast in no common metal made by no common founder when had they ever chimed like that before  ‘but today my pet’ said trotty  ‘you and richard had some words today’  ‘because he’s such a bad fellow father’ said meg  ‘an’t you richard such a headstrong violent man  he’d have made no more of speaking his mind to that great alderman and putting him down i don’t know where than he would of—’  ‘—kissing meg’ suggested richard  doing it too  ‘no  not a bit more’ said meg  ‘but i wouldn’t let him father  where would have been the use’  ‘richard my boy’ cried trotty  ‘you was turned up trumps originally and trumps you must be till you die  but you were crying by the fire tonight my pet when i came home  why did you cry by the fire’  ‘i was thinking of the years we’ve passed together father  only that and thinking that you might miss me and be lonely’  trotty was backing off to that extraordinary chair again when the child who had been awakened by the noise came running in halfdressed  ‘why here she is’ cried trotty catching her up  ‘here’s little lilian  ha ha ha  here we are and here we go  o here we are and here we go again  and here we are and here we go and uncle will too’ stopping in his trot to greet him heartily  ‘o uncle will the vision that i’ve had tonight through lodging you  o uncle will the obligations that you’ve laid me under by your coming my good friend’  before will fern could make the least reply a band of music burst into the room attended by a lot of neighbours screaming ‘a happy new year meg’  ‘a happy wedding’  ‘many of ’em’ and other fragmentary good wishes of that sort  the drum who was a private friend of trotty’s then stepped forward and said  ‘trotty veck my boy  it’s got about that your daughter is going to be married tomorrow  there an’t a soul that knows you that don’t wish you well or that knows her and don’t wish her well  or that knows you both and don’t wish you both all the happiness the new year can bring  and here we are to play it in and dance it in accordingly’  which was received with a general shout  the drum was rather drunk bythebye but never mind  ‘what a happiness it is i’m sure’ said trotty ‘to be so esteemed  how kind and neighbourly you are  it’s all along of my dear daughter  she deserves it’  they were ready for a dance in half a second meg and richard at the top and the drum was on the very brink of feathering away with all his power when a combination of prodigious sounds was heard outside and a goodhumoured comely woman of some fifty years of age or thereabouts came running in attended by a man bearing a stone pitcher of terrific size and closely followed by the marrowbones and cleavers and the bells not the bells but a portable collection on a frame  trotty said ‘it’s mrs chickenstalker’  and sat down and beat his knees again  ‘married and not tell me meg’ cried the good woman  ‘never  i couldn’t rest on the last night of the old year without coming to wish you joy  i couldn’t have done it meg  not if i had been bedridden so here i am and as it’s new year’s eve and the eve of your wedding too my dear i had a little flip made and brought it with me’  mrs chickenstalker’s notion of a little flip did honour to her character  the pitcher steamed and smoked and reeked like a volcano and the man who had carried it was faint  ‘mrs tugby’ said trotty who had been going round and round her in an ecstasy—‘i should say chickenstalker—bless your heart and soul  a happy new year and many of ’em  mrs tugby’ said trotty when he had saluted her—‘i should say chickenstalker—this is william fern and lilian’  the worthy dame to his surprise turned very pale and very red  ‘not lilian fern whose mother died in dorsetshire’ said she  her uncle answered ‘yes’ and meeting hastily they exchanged some hurried words together of which the upshot was that mrs chickenstalker shook him by both hands saluted trotty on his cheek again of her own free will and took the child to her capacious breast  ‘will fern’ said trotty pulling on his righthand muffler  ‘not the friend you was hoping to find’  ‘ay’ returned will putting a hand on each of trotty’s shoulders  ‘and like to prove a’most as good a friend if that can be as one i found’  ‘o’ said trotty  ‘please to play up there  will you have the goodness’  to the music of the band and the bells the marrowbones and cleavers all at once and while the chimes were yet in lusty operation out of doors trotty making meg and richard second couple led off mrs chickenstalker down the dance and danced it in a step unknown before or since founded on his own peculiar trot  had trotty dreamed  or are his joys and sorrows and the actors in them but a dream himself a dream the teller of this tale a dreamer waking but now  if it be so o listener dear to him in all his visions try to bear in mind the stern realities from which these shadows come and in your sphere—none is too wide and none too limited for such an end—endeavour to correct improve and soften them  so may the new year be a happy one to you happy to many more whose happiness depends on you so may each year be happier than the last and not the meanest of our brethren or sisterhood debarred their rightful share in what our great creator formed them to enjoy
