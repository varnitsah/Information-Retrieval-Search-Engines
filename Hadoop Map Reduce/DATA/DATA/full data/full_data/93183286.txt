    preface   in making the following selections i have tried to avoid the appearance of such a volume as used to be entitled elegant extracts wherever practicable entire chapters or lectures are given or at least passages of sufficient length to insure a correct notion of the general complexion of ruskins work the text is in all cases that of the first editions unless these were later revised by ruskin himself the original spelling and punctuation are preserved but a few minor changes have been made for the sake of uniformity among the various extracts for similar reasons ruskins numbering of paragraphs is dispensed with  i have aimed not to multiply notes practically all ruskins own annotation is given with the exception of one or two very long and somewhat irrelevant notes from stones of venice it has not been deemed necessary to give the dates of every painter or to explain every geographical reference on the other hand the sources of most of the quotations are indicated in the preparation of these notes the magnificent library edition of messrs cook and wedderburn has inevitably been of considerable assistance but all their references have been verified many errors have been corrected and much has of course been added  in closing i wish to express my obligation to my former colleague dr lucius h holt without whose assistance this volume would never have appeared he

church of st mark venice st marks central arch of faÇade     introduction   sidenote two conflicting tendencies in ruskin  it is distinctive of the nineteenth century that in its passion for criticising everything in heaven and earth it by no means spared to criticise itself alike in carlyles fulminations against its insincerity in arnolds nice ridicule of philistinism and in ruskins repudiation of everything modern we detect that fine dissatisfaction with the age which is perhaps only proof of its idealistic trend for the various ills of society each of these men had his panacea what carlyle had found in heroworship and arnold in hellenic culture ruskin sought in the study of art and it is of the last importance to remember that throughout his work he regarded himself not merely as a writer on painting or buildings or myths or landscape but as the appointed critic of the age for there existed in him side by side with his consuming love of the beautiful a rigorous puritanism which was constantly correcting any tendency toward a mere cult of the aesthetic it is with the interaction of these two forces that any study of the life and writings of ruskin should be primarily concerned     i  the life of ruskin   sidenote ancestry  it is easy to trace in the life of ruskin these two forces tending respectively toward the love of beauty and toward the contempt of mere beauty they are indeed present from the beginning he inherited from his scotch parents that upright fearlessness which has always characterized the race his stern mother devoted him to god before he was born1 and she guarded her gift with unremitting but perhaps misguided caution the child was early taught to find most of his entertainment within himself and when he did not he was whipped he had no playmates and few toys his chief storybook was the bible which he read many times from cover to cover at his mothers knee his father the perfectly honest winemerchant seems to have been the one to foster the boys aesthetic sense he was in the habit of reading aloud to his little family and his sons apparently genuine appreciation of scott pope and homer dates from the incredibly early age of five it was his father also to whom he owed his early acquaintance with the finest landscape for the boy was his companion in yearly business trips about britain and later visited in his parents company belgium western germany and the alps  sidenote early education  all this of course developed the childs precocity he was early suffered and even encouraged to compose verses2 by ten he had written a play which has unfortunately been preserved the hothouse rearing which his parents believed in and his facility in teaching himself tended to make a regular course of schooling a mere annoyance such schooling as he had did not begin till he was fifteen and lasted less than two years and was broken by illness but the chief effect of the sheltered life and advanced education to which he was subjected was to endow him with depth at the expense of breadth and to deprive him of a possibly vulgar but certainly healthy contact with his kind which one must believe would have checked a certain disposition in him to egotism sentimentality and dogmatic vehemence the bridle and blinkers were never taken off me he writes3  sidenote student at oxford  sidenote traveling in europe  at oxfordwhither his cautious mother pursued himruskin seems to have been impressed in no very essential manner by curriculum or college mates with learning per se he was always dissatisfied and never had much to do his course was distinguished not so much by erudition as by culture he easily won the newdigate prize in poetry his rooms in christ church were hung with excellent examples of turners landscapesthe gift of his artloving fatherof which he had been an intimate student ever since the age of thirteen but his course was interrupted by an illness apparently of a tuberculous nature which necessitated total relaxation and various trips in italy and switzerland where he seems to have been healed by walking among his beloved alps for many years thereafter he passed months of his time in these two countries accompanied sometimes by his parents and sometimes rather luxuriously it seems by valet and guide  sidenote career as an author begins  meanwhile he had commenced his career as author with the first volume of modern painters begun the world knows as a short defense of turner originally intended for nothing more than a magazine article but the role of artcritic and lawgiver pleased the youthhe was only twentyfour when the volume appearedand having no desire to realize the ambition of his parents and become a bishop and even less to duplicate his fathers career as vintner he gladly seized the opportunity thus offered him to develop his aesthetic vein and to redeem the public mind from its vulgar apathy thereby he continued his work on modern painters with some intermissions for eighteen years and supplemented it with the equally famous seven lamps of architecture in 1849 and the stones of venice in 1853  sidenote domestic troubles  this life of zealous work and brilliant recognition was interrupted in 1848 by ruskins amazing marriage to miss euphemia gray a union into which he entered at the desire of his parents with a docility as stupid as it was stupendous five years later the couple were quietly divorced that mrs ruskin might marry millais all the authors biographers maintain an indiscreet reserve in discussing the affair but there can be no concealment of the fact that its effect upon ruskin was profound in its depression experiences like this and his later sad passion for miss la touche at once presage and indicate his mental disorder and no doubt had their sharea large onein causing ruskins dissatisfaction with everything and above all with his own life and work be this as it may it is at this time in the life of ruskin that we must begin to reckon with the decline of his aesthetic and the rise of his ethical impulse his interest passes from art to conduct it is also the period in which he began his career as lecturer his chief interest being the social life of his age  sidenote ruskins increasing interest in social questions  by 1860 he was publishing the papers on political economy later called unto this last which roused so great a storm of protest when they appeared in the cornhill magazine that their publication had to be suspended the attitude of the public toward such works as theseits alternate excitement and apathythe death of his parents combined with the distressing events mentioned above darkened ruskins life and spoiled his interest in everything that did not tend to make the national life more thoughtfully solemn      it seems to me that now  the thoughts of the true nature of     our life and of its powers and responsibilities should present     themselves with absolute sadness and sternness4  his lectures as slade professor of art at oxford a post which he held at various times from 1870 to 1883 failed to reestablish his undistracted interest in things beautiful  sidenote triumph of the reformer over the artcritic  the complete triumph of the reformer over the artcritic is marked by fors clavigera a series of letters to workingmen begun new years day 1871 in which it was proposed to establish a model colony of peasants whose lives should be made simple honest happy and even cultured by a return to more primitive methods of tilling the soil and of making useful and beautiful objects the guild of st george established to slay the dragon of industrialism to dispose of machinery slums and discontent consumed a large part of ruskins time and money he had inherited a fortune of approximately a million dollars and he now began to dispose of it in various charitable schemesestablishing teashops supporting young painters planning model tenements but above all in elaborating his ideas for the guild the result of it allwhatever particular reforms were effected or manual industries establishedwas to ruskins view failure and his mind weakening under the strain of its profound disappointments at last crashed in ruin  sidenote death in 1900  it is needless to follow the broken author through the desolation of his closing years to his death in 1900 save for his charming reminiscences præterita his work was done the long struggle was over the struggle of one man to reduce the complexities of a national life to an apostolic simplicity to make it beautiful and good      till the high god behold it from beyond     and enter it     1 præterita he was born february 8 1819    2 ruskin himself quotes a not very brilliant specimen in modern   painters iii in moral of landscape    3 præterita § 53    4 the mystery of life     ii  the unity of ruskins writings   sidenote diversity of his writings  ruskin is often described as an author of bewildering variety whose mind drifted waywardly from topic to topicfrom painting to political economy from architecture to agriculturewith a license as illogical as it was indiscriminating to this impression ruskin himself sometimes gave currency he was for illustration once announced to lecture on crystallography but as we are informed by one present5 he opened by asserting that he was really about to lecture on cistercian architecture nor did it greatly matter what the title was for said he if i had begun to speak about cistercian abbeys i should have been sure to get on crystals presently and if i had begun upon crystals i should soon have drifted into architecture those who conceive of ruskin as being thus a kind of literary proteus like to point to the year 1860 that of the publication of his tracts on economics as witnessing the greatest and suddenest of his changes that from reforming art to reforming society and it is true that this year affords a simple dividingline between ruskins earlier work which is sufficiently described by the three titles modern painters the seven lamps of architecture and the stones of venice and his later work chiefly on social subjects such as are discussed in unto this last the crown of wild olive and fors clavigera and yet we cannot insist too often on the essential unity of this work for viewed in the large it betrays one continuous development the seeds of fors are in the stones of venice  sidenote underlying idea in all his works  the governing idea of ruskins first published work modern painters volume i was a moral idea the book was dedicated to the principle that that art is greatest which deals with the greatest number of greatest ideasthose we learn presently which reveal divine truth the office of the painter we are told6 is the same as that of the preacher for the duty of both is to take for each discourse one essential truth as if recalling this argument that the painter is a preacher carlyle described the stones of venice as a sermon in stones in the idea that all art when we have taken due account of technique and training springs from a moral character we find the unifying principle of ruskins strangely diversified work the very title the seven lamps of architecture with its chapters headed sacrifice obedience etc is a sufficient illustration of ruskins identification of moral principles with aesthetic principles a glance at the following pages of this book will show how ruskin is for ever halting himself to demand the moral significance of some fair landscape gorgeous painting heavenaspiring cathedral in mountain glory for example he refers to the mountains as kindly in simple lessons to the workman and inquires later at what times mankind has offered worship in these mountain churches of the english cathedral he says weigh the influence of those dark towers on all who have passed through the lonely square at their feet for centuries7 of st marks and what effect has this splendour on those who pass beneath itand it will be noticed on referring to the two boyhoods that in seeking to define the difference between giorgione and turner the author instinctively has recourse to distinguishing the religious influences exerted on the two in youth  sidenote underlying idea a moral one  now it is clear that a student of the relation of art to life of work to the character of the workman and of his nation may and in fact inevitably must be led in time to attend to the producer rather than to the product to the cause rather than to the effect and if we grant with ruskin that the sources of art namely the national life are denied it will obviously be the part not only of humanity but of common sense for such a student to set about purifying the social life of the nation whether the reformation proposed by ruskin be the proper method of attack is not the question we are here concerned with our only object at present being to call attention to the fact that such a lecture as that on traffic in the crown of wild olive is the logical outgrowth of such a chapter as ideas of beauty in the first volume of modern painters between the author who wrote in 1842 of the necessity of revealing new truths in painting this if it be an honest work of art it must have done for no man ever yet worked honestly without giving some such help to his race god appoints to every one of his creatures a separate mission and if they discharge it honourably  there will assuredly come of it such burning as in its appointed mode and measure shall shine before men and be of service constant and holy8 and the author who wrote that country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings9 or the beginning of art is in getting our country clean and our people beautiful10between these two i say there is no essential difference they are not contradictory but consistent  sidenote art dependent upon personal and national greatness  amidst the maze of subjects then which ruskin with kaleidoscopic suddenness and variety brings before the astonished gaze of his readers let them confidently hold this guiding clue they will find that ruskins facts are often not facts at all they will discover that many of ruskins choicest theories have been dismissed to the limbo of exploded hypotheses but they will seek long before they find a more eloquent and convincing plea for the proposition that all great art reposes upon a foundation of personal and national greatness critics of ruskin will show you that he began modern painters while he was yet ignorant of the classic italians that he wrote the stones of venice without realizing the full indebtedness of the venetian to the byzantine architecture that he proposed to unify the various religious sects although he had no knowledge of theology that he attempted a reconstruction of society though he had had no scientific training in political economy but in all this neglect of mere fact the sympathetic reader will discover that contempt for the letter of the law which was characteristic of the nineteenthcentury prophetof carlyle of arnold and of emersonand which if it be blindness is that produced by an excess of light     5 see harrisons life p 111 cf the opening of the mystery   of life    6 part 2 sec 1 chap 4    7 see p 159    8 modern painters vol 1 part 2 sec 1 chap 7    9 unto this last    10 see p 262     iii  ruskins style   sidenote sensuousness of his style  many people regard the style of ruskin as his chief claim to greatness if the time ever come when men no longer study him for sermons in stones they will nevertheless turn to his pages to enjoy one of the most gorgeous prose styles of the nineteenth century for a parallel to the sensuous beauties of ruskins essays on art one turns instinctively to poetry and of all the poets ruskin is perhaps likest keats his sentences like the poets are thickset with jeweled phrases they are full of subtle harmonies that respond like a stradivarius to the players every mood in its ornateness ruskins style is like his favorite cathedral of amiens in the large stately in detail exquisite profuse and not without a touch of the grotesque it is the style of an artist  sidenote ruskins method of construction in description  a critical fancy may even discover in the construction of his finest descriptions a method not unlike that of a painter at work upon his canvas he blocks them out in large masses then sketches and colors rapidly for general effects treating detail at first more or less vaguely and collectively but passing in the end to the elaboration of detail in the concrete touching the whole with an imaginative gleam that lends a momentary semblance of life to the thing described after the manner of the pathetic fallacy thus it is in the famous description of st marks11 we are given first the largest general impression the long low pyramid of coloured light which the artist proceeds to hollow beneath into five great vaulted porches whence he leads the eye slowly upwards amidst a mass of bewildering detaila confusion of delightfrom which there slowly emerge those concrete details with which the author particularly wishes to impress us the breasts of the greek horses blazing in their breadth of golden strength and st marks lion lifted on a blue field covered with stars in lesser compass we are shown the environs of venice12 the general impression of the long low sadcoloured line being presently broken by the enumeration of unanalyzed detail tufted irregularly with brushwood and willows and passing to concrete detail in the hills of arqua a dark cluster of purple pyramids in the still more miniature description of the original site of venice13 we have the same method      the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath     the night pathless comfortless infirm lost in dark languor     and fearful silence except where the salt runlets plash into the     tideless pools and the seabirds flit from their margins with a     questioning cry  sidenote his love of color  equally characteristic of the painter is the everpresent use of color it is interesting merely to count the number and variety of colors used in the descriptions it will serve at least to call the readers attention to the felicitous choice of words used in describing the opalescence of st marks or the skillful combination of the colors characteristic of the great venetians in such a sentence as the low bronzed gleaming of searusted armor shot angrily under their bloodred mantlefolds14a glimpse of a giorgione  sidenote his love of prose rhythm  he is even more attentive to the ear than to the eye he loves the sentence of stately rhythms and longdrawn harmonies and he omits no poetic device that can heighten the charm of soundalliteration as in the famous description of the streets of venice      far as the eye could reach still the soft moving of stainless     waters proudly pure as not the flower so neither the thorn nor     the thistle could grow in those glancing fields15  the balanced close for some long period      to write her history on the white scrolls of the seasurges and     to word it in their thunder and to gather and give forth in the     worldwide pulsation the glory of the west and of the east from     the burning heart of her fortitude and splendour16  and the tendency almost a mannerism to add to the music of his own rhythm the deep organnotes of biblical text and paraphrase but if we wish to see how aptly ruskins style responds to the tone of his subject we need but remark the rich liquid sentence descriptive of giorgiones home      brightness out of the north and balm from the south and the stars     of evening and morning clear in the limitless light of arched     heaven and circling sea17  which he has set over against the harsh explosiveness of      near the southwest corner of covent garden a square brick pit     or wall is formed by a closeset block of house to the back     windows of which it admits a few rays of light  the birthplace of turner  sidenote his beauty of style often distracts from the thought  but none knew better than ruskin that a style so stiff with ornament was likely to produce all manner of faults in overloading his sentences with jewelry he frequently obscures the sense his beauties often degenerate into mere prettiness his sweetness cloys his free indulgence of the emotions often at the expense of the intellect leads to a riotous extravagance of superlative but above all his richness distracts attention from matter to manner in the case of an author so profoundly in earnest this could not but be unfortunate nothing enraged him more than to have people look upon the beauties of his style rather than ponder the substance of his book in a passage of complacent selfscourging he says      for i have had what in many respects i boldly call the     misfortune to set my words sometimes prettily together not     without a foolish vanity in the poor knack that i had of doing     so until i was heavily punished for this pride by finding that     many people thought of the words only and cared nothing for their     meaning happily therefore the power of using such languageif     indeed it ever were mineis passing away from me and whatever i     am now able to say at all i find myself forced to say with great     plainness18  sidenote his picturesque extravagance of style  but ruskins decision to speak with great plainness by no means made the people of england attend to what he said rather than the way he said it he could be and in his later work he usually was strong and clear but the old picturesqueness and exuberance of passion were with him still the public discovered that it enjoyed ruskins denunciations of machinery much as it had enjoyed his descriptions of mountains and without obviously mending its ways called loudly for more lecturerooms were crowded and editions exhausted by the ladies and gentlemen of england whose nerves were pleasantly thrilled with a gentle surprise on being told that they had despised literature art science nature and compassion and that what they thought upon any subject was a matter of no serious importance that they could not be said to have any thoughts at allindeed no right to think19 the fiercer his anathemas the greater the applause the louder he shouted the better he pleased let him split the ears of the groundlings let him outherod herodthe judicious might grieve but all would be excitedly attentive their jeremiah seemed at times like to become a jesterthere was a suggestion of the ludicrous in the sudden passage from birds to greek coins to mills to walter scott to millionaire malefactorsa suggestion of acrobatic tumbling and somersault but he always got a hearing in lecturing to the students of a military academy he had the pleasing audacity to begin      young soldiers i do not doubt but that many of you came     unwillingly tonight and many of you in merely contemptuous     curiosity to hear what a writer on painting could possibly say     or would venture to say respecting your great art of war20  after which stinging challenge one has no doubt any feeling of offense was swallowed up in admiration of the speakers physical courage  sidenote influence of carlyle upon ruskin  sidenote the unity of ruskins style  there can be little doubt that this later manner in which ruskin allowed his puritan instincts to defeat his aestheticism and indulged to an alarming degree his gift of vituperation was profoundly influenced by his master carlyle who had long since passed into his later and raucous manner carlyles delight in the disciples diatribes probably encouraged the younger man in a vehemence of invective to which his love of dogmatic assertion already rendered him too prone at his best ruskin like carlyle reminds us of a major prophet at his worst he shrieks and heats the air his high indignations lead him into all manner of absurdity and selfcontradiction an amusing instance of this may be given from sesame and lilies in the first lecture which it will be recalled was given in aid of a library fund we find21 the remark we are filthy and foolish enough to thumb one anothers books out of circulating libraries his friends and his enemies the clergy who teach a false gospel for hire and the scientists the merchants and the universities darwin and dante all had their share in the indignant lecturers indiscriminate abuse and yet in all the tropical luxuriance of his inconsistency one can never doubt the mans sincerity he never wrote for effect he may dazzle us but his fire is never pyrotechnical it always springs from the deep volcanic heart of him his was a fervor too easily stirred and often illdirected but its wild brilliance cannot long be mistaken for the skyrockets it flares madly in all directions now beautifying now appalling the night the fine ardor of the painter passing into the fierce invective of the prophet but in the end it is seen that ruskins style like his subjectmatter is a unityan emanation from a divine enthusiasm making for whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are of good report     11 see p 162    12 see p 139

first volume was published in may 1843 the second in april 1846 the third january 15 1856 the fourth april 14 1856 the last in june 1860 as his knowledge of his subject broadened and deepened we find the later volumes differing greatly in viewpoint and style from the earlier but as stated in the preface to the last volume in the main aim and principle of the book there is no variation from its first syllable to its last ruskin himself maintained that the most important influence upon his thought in preparation for his work in modern painters was not from his love of art but of mountains and seas and all the power of judgment he had obtained in art he ascribed to his steady habit of always looking for the subject principally and for the art only as the means of expressing it the first volume was published as the work of a graduate of oxford ruskin fearing that i might not obtain fair hearing if the reader knew my youth the authors proud father did not allow the secret to be kept long the title ruskin originally chose for the volume was turner and the ancients to this smith elder  co his publishers objected and the substitution of modern painters was their suggestion the following is the titlepage of the first volume in the original edition                      modern painters                   their superiority           in the art of landscape painting                        to all                  the ancient masters                  proved by examples of      the true the beautiful and the intellectual                        from the           works of modern artists especially         from those of jmw turner esq ra                 by a graduate of oxford               quotation from wordsworth         london smith elder  co 65 cornhill

of kept itfeeding our warhorses with its flowers and splintering its trees into spearshafts  and at the east a flaming sword22  is its flame quenchless and are those gates that keep the way indeed passable no more or is it not rather that we no more desire to enter for what can we conceive of that first eden which we might not yet win back if we chose it was a place full of flowers we say well the flowers are always striving to grow wherever we suffer them and the fairer the closer there may indeed have been a fall of flowers as a fall of man but assuredly creatures such as we are can now fancy nothing lovelier than roses and lilies which would grow for us side by side leaf overlapping leaf till the earth was white and red with them if we cared to have it so and paradise was full of pleasant shades and fruitful avenues well what hinders us from covering as much of the world as we like with pleasant shade and pure blossom and goodly fruit who forbids its valleys to be covered over with corn till they laugh and sing who prevents its dark forests ghostly and uninhabitable from being changed into infinite orchards wreathing the hills with frailfloreted snow far away to the halflighted horizon of april and flushing the face of all the autumnal earth with glow of clustered food but paradise was a place of peace we say and all the animals were gentle servants to us well the world would yet be a place of peace if we were all peacemakers and gentle service should we have of its creatures if we gave them gentle mastery but so long as we make sport of slaying bird and beast so long as we choose to contend rather with our fellows than with our faults and make battlefield of our meadows instead of pastureso long truly the flaming sword will still turn every way and the gates of eden remain barred close enough till we have sheathed the sharper flame of our own passions and broken down the closer gates of our own hearts  i have been led to see and feel this more and more as i consider the service which the flowers and trees which man was at first appointed to keep were intended to render to him in return for his care and the services they still render to him as far as he allows their influence or fulfils his own task towards them for what infinite wonderfulness there is in this vegetation considered as indeed it is as the means by which the earth becomes the companion of manhis friend and his teacher in the conditions which we have traced in its rocks there could only be seen preparation for his existencethe characters which enable him to live on it safely and to work with it easilyin all these it has been inanimate and passive but vegetation is to it as an imperfect soul given to meet the soul of man the earth in its depths must remain dead and cold incapable except of slow crystalline change but at its surface which human beings look upon and deal with it ministers to them through a veil of strange intermediate being which breathes but has no voice moves but cannot leave its appointed place passes through life without consciousness to death without bitterness wears the beauty of youth without its passion and declines to the weakness of age without its regret  and in this mystery of intermediate being entirely subordinate to us with which we can deal as we choose having just the greater power as we have the less responsibility for our treatment of the unsuffering creature most of the pleasures which we need from the external world are gathered and most of the lessons we need are written all kinds of precious grace and teaching being united in this link between the earth and man wonderful in universal adaptation to his need desire and discipline gods daily preparation of the earth for him with beautiful means of life first a carpet to make it soft for him then a coloured fantasy of embroidery thereon then tall spreading of foliage to shade him from sun heat and shade also the fallen rain that it may not dry quickly back into the clouds but stay to nourish the springs among the moss stout wood to bear this leafage easily to be cut yet tough and light to make houses for him or instruments lanceshaft or ploughhandle according to his temper useless it had been if harder useless if less fibrous useless if less elastic winter comes and the shade of leafage falls away to let the sun warm the earth the strong boughs remain breaking the strength of winter winds the seeds which are to prolong the race innumerable according to the need are made beautiful and palatable varied into infinitude of appeal to the fancy of man or provision for his service cold juice or glowing spice or balm or incense softening oil preserving resin medicine of styptic febrifuge or lulling charm and all these presented in forms of endless change fragility or force softness and strength in all degrees and aspects unerring uprightness as of temple pillars or unguided wandering of feeble tendrils on the ground mighty resistances of rigid arm and limb to the storms of ages or wavings to and fro with faintest pulse of summer streamlet roots cleaving the strength of rock or binding the transience of the sand crests basking in sunshine of the desert or hiding by dripping spring and lightless cave foliage far tossing in entangled fields beneath every wave of oceanclothing with variegated everlasting films the peaks of the trackless mountains or ministering at cottage doors to every gentlest passion and simplest joy of humanity  being thus prepared for us in all ways and made beautiful and good for food and for building and for instruments in our hands this race of plants deserving boundless affection and admiration from us becomes in proportion to their obtaining it a nearly perfect test of our being in right temper of mind and way of life so that no one can be far wrong in either who loves the trees enough and every one is assuredly wrong in both who does not love them if his life has brought them in his way it is clearly possible to do without them for the great companionship of the sea and sky are all that sailors need and many a noble heart has been taught the best it had to learn between dark stone walls still if human life be cast among trees at all the love borne to them is a sure test of its purity and it is a sorrowful proof of the mistaken ways of the world that the country in the simple sense of a place of fields and trees has hitherto been the source of reproach to its inhabitants and that the words countryman rustic clown paysan villager still signify a rude and untaught person as opposed to the words townsman and citizen we accept this usage of words or the evil which it signifies somewhat too quietly as if it were quite necessary and natural that countrypeople should be rude and townspeople gentle whereas i believe that the result of each mode of life may in some stages of the worlds progress be the exact reverse and that another use of words may be forced upon us by a new aspect of facts so that we may find ourselves saying such and such a person is very gentle and kindhe is quite rustic and such and such another person is very rude and illtaughthe is quite urbane  at all events cities have hitherto gained the better part of their good report through our evil ways of going on in the world generally chiefly and eminently through our bad habit of fighting with each other no field in the middle ages being safe from devastation and every country lane yielding easier passage to the marauders peacefullyminded men necessarily congregated in cities and walled themselves in making as few crosscountry roads as possible while the men who sowed and reaped the harvests of europe were only the servants or slaves of the barons the disdain of all agricultural pursuits by the nobility and of all plain facts by the monks kept educated europe in a state of mind over which natural phenomena could have no power body and intellect being lost in the practice of war without purpose and the meditation of words without meaning men learned the dexterity with sword and syllogism which they mistook for education within cloister and tiltyard and looked on all the broad space of the world of god mainly as a place for exercise of horses or for growth of food  there is a beautiful type of this neglect of the perfectness of the earths beauty by reason of the passions of men in that picture of paul uccellos of the battle of sant egidio23 in which the armies meet on a country road beside a hedge of wild roses the tender red flowers tossing above the helmets and glowing beneath the lowered lances for in like manner the whole of nature only shone hitherto for man between the tossing of helmetcrests and sometimes i cannot but think of the trees of the earth as capable of a kind of sorrow in that imperfect life of theirs as they opened their innocent leaves in the warm springtime in vain for men and all along the dells of england her beeches cast their dappled shade only where the outlaw drew his bow and the king rode his careless chase and by the sweet french rivers their long ranks of poplar waved in the twilight only to show the flames of burning cities on the horizon through the tracery of their stems amidst the fair defiles of the apennines the twisted olivetrunks hid the ambushes of treachery and on their valley meadows day by day the lilies which were white at the dawn were washed with crimson at sunset  and indeed i had once purposed in this work to show what kind of evidence existed respecting the possible influence of country life on men it seeming to me then likely that here and there a reader would perceive this to be a grave question more than most which we contend about political or social and might care to follow it out with me earnestly  the day will assuredly come when men will see that it is a grave question at which period also i doubt not there will arise persons able to investigate it for the present the movements of the world seem little likely to be influenced by botanical law or by any other considerations respecting trees than the probable price of timber i shall limit myself therefore to my own simple woodmans work and try to hew this book into its final shape with the limited and humble aim that i had in beginning it namely to prove how far the idle and peaceable persons who have hitherto cared about leaves and clouds have rightly seen or faithfully reported of them     22 genesis ii 15 iii 24    23 in our own national gallery it is quaint and imperfect but   of great interest ruskin paolo uccello c 13971475 a   florentine painter of the renaissance the first of the naturalists   his real name was paolo di dono but he was called uccello from his   fondness for birds     the mountain glory  volume iv chapter 20   i have dwelt in the foregoing chapter on the sadness of the hills with the greater insistence that i feared my own excessive love for them might lead me into too favourable interpretation of their influences over the human heart or at least that the reader might accuse me of fond prejudice in the conclusions to which finally i desire to lead him concerning them for to myself mountains are the beginning and the end of all natural scenery in them and in the forms of inferior landscape that lead to them my affections are wholly bound up and though i can look with happy admiration at the lowland flowers and woods and open skies the happiness is tranquil and cold like that of examining detached flowers in a conservatory or reading a pleasant book and if the scenery be resolutely level insisting upon the declaration of its own flatness in all the detail of it as in holland or lincolnshire or central lombardy it appears to me like a prison and i cannot long endure it but the slightest rise and fall in the roada mossy bank at the side of a crag of chalk with brambles at its brow overhanging ita ripple over three or four stones in the stream by the bridgeabove all a wild bit of ferny ground under a fir or two looking as if possibly one might see a hill if one got to the other side of the trees will instantly give me intense delight because the shadow or the hope of the hills is in them  and thus although there are few districts of northern europe however apparently dull or tame in which i cannot find pleasure though the whole of northern france except champagne dull as it seems to most travellers is to me a perpetual paradise and putting lincolnshire leicestershire and one or two such other perfectly flat districts aside there is not an english county which i should not find entertainment in exploring the crossroads of foot by foot yet all my best enjoyment would be owing to the imagination of the hills colouring with their faraway memories every lowland stone and herb the pleasant french coteau green in the sunshine delights me either by what real mountain character it has in itself for in extent and succession of promontory the flanks of the french valleys have quite the sublimity of true mountain distances or by its broken ground and rugged steps among the vines and rise of the leafage above against the blue sky as it might rise at vevay or como there is not a wave of the seine but is associated in my mind with the first rise of the sandstones and forest pines of fontainebleau and with the hope of the alps as one leaves paris with the horses heads to the southwest the morning sun flashing on the bright waves at charenton if there be no hope or association of this kind and if i cannot deceive myself into fancying that perhaps at the next rise of the road there may be seen the film of a blue hill in the gleam of sky at the horizon the landscape however beautiful produces in me even a kind of sickness and pain and the whole view from richmond hill or windsor terracenay the gardens of alcinous with their perpetual summeror of the hesperides if they were flat and not close to atlas golden apples and alli would give away in an instant for one mossy granite stone a foot broad and two leaves of ladyfern24  i know that this is in great part idiosyncrasy and that i must not trust to my own feelings in this respect as representative of the modern landscape instinct yet i know it is not idiosyncrasy in so far as there may be proved to be indeed an increase of the absolute beauty of all scenery in exact proportion to its mountainous character providing that character be healthily mountainous i do not mean to take the col de bonhomme as representative of hills any more than i would take romney marsh as representative of plains but putting leicestershire or staffordshire fairly beside westmoreland and lombardy or champagne fairly beside the pays de vaud or the canton berne i find the increase in the calculable sum of elements of beauty to be steadily in proportion to the increase of mountainous character and that the best image which the world can give of paradise is in the slope of the meadows orchards and cornfields on the sides of a great alp with its purple rocks and eternal snows above this excellence not being in any wise a matter referable to feeling or individual preferences but demonstrable by calm enumeration of the number of lovely colours on the rocks the varied grouping of the trees and quantity of noble incidents in stream crag or cloud presented to the eye at any given moment  for consider first the difference produced in the whole tone of landscape colour by the introductions of purple violet and deep ultramarine blue which we owe to mountains in an ordinary lowland landscape we have the blue of the sky the green of grass which i will suppose and this is an unnecessary concession to the lowlands entirely fresh and bright the green of trees and certain elements of purple far more rich and beautiful than we generally should think in their bark and shadows bare hedges and thickets or tops of trees in subdued afternoon sunshine are nearly perfect purple and of an exquisite tone as well as in ploughed fields and dark ground in general but among mountains in addition to all this large unbroken spaces of pure violet and purple are introduced in their distances and even near by films of cloud passing over the darkness of ravines or forests blues are produced of the most subtle tenderness these azures and purples25 passing into rosecolour of otherwise wholly unattainable delicacy among the upper summits the blue of the sky being at the same time purer and deeper than in the plains nay in some sense a person who has never seen the rosecolour of the rays of dawn crossing a blue mountain twelve or fifteen miles away can hardly be said to know what tenderness in colour means at all bright tenderness he may indeed see in the sky or in a flower but this grave tenderness of the faraway hillpurples he cannot conceive  together with this great source of preeminence in mass of colour we have to estimate the influence of the finished inlaying and enamelwork of the colourjewellery on every stone and that of the continual variety in species of flower most of the mountain flowers being besides separately lovelier than the lowland ones the wood hyacinth and wild rose are indeed the only supreme flowers that the lowlands can generally show and the wild rose is also a mountaineer and more fragrant in the hills while the wood hyacinth or grape hyacinth at its best cannot match even the dark bellgentian leaving the lightblue stargentian in its uncontested queenliness and the alpine rose and highland heather wholly without similitude the violet lily of the valley crocus and wood anemone are i suppose claimable partly by the plains as well as the hills but the large orange lily and narcissus i have never seen but on hill pastures and the exquisite oxalisis preeminently a mountaineer26  to this supremacy in mosses and flowers we have next to add an inestimable gain in the continual presence and power of water neither in its clearness its colour its fantasy of motion its calmness of space depth and reflection or its wrath can water be conceived by a lowlander out of sight of sea a sea wave is far grander than any torrentbut of the sea and its influences we are not now speaking and the sea itself though it can be clear is never calm among our shores in the sense that a mountain lake can be calm the sea seems only to pause the mountain lake to sleep and to dream out of sight of the ocean a lowlander cannot be considered ever to have seen water at all the mantling of the pools in the rock shadows with the golden flakes of light sinking down through them like falling leaves the ringing of the thin currents among the shallows the flash and the cloud of the cascade the earthquake and foamfire of the cataract the long lines of alternate mirror and mist that lull the imagery of the hills reversed in the blue of morningall these things belong to those hills as their undivided inheritance  to this supremacy in wave and stream is joined a no less manifest preeminence in the character of trees it is possible among plains in the species of trees which properly belong to them the poplars of amiens for instance to obtain a serene simplicity of grace which as i said is a better help to the study of gracefulness as such than any of the wilder groupings of the hills so also there are certain conditions of symmetrical luxuriance developed in the park and avenue rarely rivalled in their way among mountains and yet the mountain superiority in foliage is on the whole nearly as complete as it is in water for exactly as there are some expressions in the broad reaches of a navigable lowland river such as the loire or thames not in their way to be matched among the rock rivers and yet for all that a lowlander cannot be said to have truly seen the element of water at all so even in the richest parks and avenues he cannot be said to have truly seen trees for the resources of trees are not developed until they have difficulty to contend with neither their tenderness of brotherly love and harmony till they are forced to choose their ways of various life where there is contracted room for them talking to each other with their restrained branches the various action of trees rooting themselves in inhospitable rocks stooping to look into ravines hiding from the search of glacier winds reaching forth to the rays of rare sunshine crowding down together to drink at sweetest streams climbing hand in hand among the difficult slopes opening in sudden dances round the mossy knolls gathering into companies at rest among the fragrant fields gliding in grave procession over the heavenward ridgesnothing of this can be conceived among the unvexed and unvaried felicities of the lowland forest while to all these direct sources of greater beauty are added first the power of redundancethe mere quantity of foliage visible in the folds and on the promontories of a single alp being greater than that of an entire lowland landscape unless a view from some cathedral tower and to this charm of redundance that of clearer visibilitytree after tree being constantly shown in successive height one behind another instead of the mere tops and flanks of masses as in the plains and the forms of multitudes of them continually defined against the clear sky near and above or against white clouds entangled among their branches instead of being confused in dimness of distance  finally to this supremacy in foliage we have to add the still less questionable supremacy in clouds there is no effect of sky possible in the lowlands which may not in equal perfection be seen among the hills but there are effects by tens of thousands for ever invisible and inconceivable to the inhabitant of the plains manifested among the hills in the course of one day the mere power of familiarity with the clouds of walking with them and above them alters and renders clear our whole conception of the baseless architecture of the sky and for the beauty of it there is more in a single wreath of early cloud pacing its way up an avenue of pines or pausing among the points of their fringes than in all the white heaps that fill the arched sky of the plains from one horizon to the other and of the nobler cloud manifestationsthe breaking of their troublous seas against the crags their black spray sparkling with lightning or the going forth of the morning27 along their pavements of moving marble levellaid between dome and dome of snowof these things there can be as little imagination or understanding in an inhabitant of the plains as of the scenery of another planet than his own  and observe all these superiorities are matters plainly measurable and calculable not in any wise to be referred to estimate of sensation of the grandeur or expression of the hills i have not spoken how far they are great or strong or terrible i do not for the moment consider because vastness and strength and terror are not to all minds subjects of desired contemplation it may make no difference to some men whether a natural object be large or small whether it be strong or feeble but loveliness of colour perfectness of form endlessness of change wonderfulness of structure are precious to all undiseased human minds and the superiority of the mountains in all these things to the lowland is i repeat as measurable as the richness of a painted window matched with a white one or the wealth of a museum compared with that of a simply furnished chamber they seem to have been built for the human race as at once their schools and cathedrals full of treasures of illuminated manuscript for the scholar kindly in simple lessons to the worker quiet in pale cloisters for the thinker glorious in holiness for the worshipper and of these great cathedrals of the earth with their gates of rock pavements of cloud choirs of stream and stone altars of snow and vaults of purple traversed by the continual starsof these as we have seen28 it was written nor long ago by one of the best of the poor human race for whom they were built wondering in himself for whom their creator could have made them and thinking to have entirely discerned the divine intent in themthey are inhabited by the beasts29  was it then indeed thus with us and so lately had mankind offered no worship in their mountain churches was all that granite sculpture and floral painting done by the angels in vain  not so it will need no prolonged thought to convince us that in the hills the purposes of their maker have indeed been accomplished in such measure as through the sin or folly of men he ever permits them to be accomplished it may not seem from the general language held concerning them or from any directly traceable results that mountains have had serious influence on human intellect but it will not i think be difficult to show that their occult influence has been both constant and essential to the progress of the race     24 in tracing the whole of the deep enjoyment to mountain   association i of course except whatever feelings are connected with   the observance of rural life or with that of architecture none of   these feelings arise out of the landscape properly so called the   pleasure with which we see a peasants garden fairly kept or a   ploughman doing his work well or a group of children playing at a   cottage door being wholly separate from that which we find in the   fields or commons around them and the beauty of architecture or the   associations connected with it in like manner often ennobling the   most tame sceneryyet not so but that we may always distinguish   between the abstract character of the unassisted landscape and the   charm which it derives from the architecture much of the majesty of   french landscape consists in its grand and grey village churches and   turreted farmhouses not to speak of its cathedrals castles and   beautifully placed cities ruskin    25 one of the principal reasons for the false supposition that   switzerland is not picturesque is the error of most sketchers and   painters in representing pine forest in middle distance as dark green   or grey green whereas its true colour is always purple at distances   of even two or three miles let any traveller coming down the   montanvert look for an aperture three or four inches wide between   the near pine branches through which standing eight or ten feet   from it he can see the opposite forests on the breven or flegère   those forests are not above two or two and a half miles from him   but he will find the aperture is filled by a tint of nearly pure   azure or purple not by green ruskin    26 the savoyards name for its flower pain du bon dieu is very

mountain at daybreak when the night mists first rise from off the plains and watch their white and lakelike fields as they float in level bays and winding gulfs about the islanded summits of the lower hills untouched yet by more than dawn colder and more quiet than a windless sea under the moon of midnight watch when the first sunbeam is sent upon the silver channels how the foam of their undulating surface parts and passes away and down under their depths the glittering city and green pasture lie like atlantis31 between the white paths of winding rivers the flakes of light falling every moment faster and broader among the starry spires as the wreathed surges break and vanish above them and the confused crests and ridges of the dark hills shorten their grey shadows upon the plain wait a little longer and you shall see those scattered mists rallying in the ravines and floating up towards you along the winding valleys till they crouch in quiet masses iridescent with the morning light32 upon the broad breasts of the higher hills whose leagues of massy undulation will melt back and back into that robe of material light until they fade away lost in its lustre to appear again above in the serene heaven like a wild bright impossible dream foundationless and inaccessible their very bases vanishing in the unsubstantial and mocking blue of the deep lake below33 wait yet a little longer and you shall see those mists gather themselves into white towers and stand like fortresses along the promontories massy and motionless only piled with every instant higher and higher into the sky and casting longer shadows athwart the rocks and out of the pale blue of the horizon you will see forming and advancing a troop of narrow dark pointed vapours which will cover the sky inch by inch with their grey network and take the light off the landscape with an eclipse which will stop the singing of the birds and the motion of the leaves together and then you will see horizontal bars of black shadow forming under them and lurid wreaths create themselves you know not how along the shoulders of the hills you never see them form but when you look back to a place which was clear an instant ago there is a cloud on it hanging by the precipices as a hawk pauses over his prey and then you will hear the sudden rush of the awakened wind and you will see those watchtowers of vapour swept away from their foundations and waving curtains of opaque rain let down to the valleys swinging from the burdened clouds in black bending fringes or pacing in pale columns along the lake level grazing its surface into foam as they go and then as the sun sinks you shall see the storm drift for an instant from off the hills leaving their broad sides smoking and loaded yet with snowwhite torn steamlike rags of capricious vapour now gone now gathered again while the smouldering sun seeming not far away but burning like a redhot ball beside you and as if you could reach it plunges through the rushing wind and rolling cloud with headlong fall as if it meant to rise no more dyeing all the air about it with blood and then you shall hear the fainting tempest die in the hollow of the night and you shall see a green halo kindling on the summit of the eastern hills brighterbrighter yet till the large white circle of the slow moon is lifted up among the barred clouds step by step line by line star after star she quenches with her kindling light setting in their stead an army of pale penetrable fleecy wreaths in the heaven to give light upon the earth which move together hand in hand company by company troop by troop so measured in their unity of motion that the whole heaven seems to roll with them and the earth to reel under them and then wait yet for one hour until the east again becomes purple and the heaving mountains rolling against it in darkness like waves of a wild sea are drowned one by one in the glory of its burning watch the white glaciers blaze in their winding paths about the mountains like mighty serpents with scales of fire watch the columnar peaks of solitary snow kindling downwards chasm by chasm each in itself a new morning their long avalanches cast down in keen streams brighter than the lightning sending each his tribute of driven snow like altarsmoke up to the heaven the roselight of their silent domes flushing that heaven about them and above them piercing with purer light through its purple lines of lifted cloud casting a new glory on every wreath as it passes by until the whole heaven one scarlet canopy is interwoven with a roof of waving flame and tossing vault beyond vault as with the drifted wings of many companies of angels and then when you can look no more for gladness and when you are bowed down with fear

when we stand with our backs to   the sun but in clouds near the sun itself irregularly and over   indefinite spaces sometimes taking place in the body of the cloud   the colours are distinct and vivid but have a kind of metallic    lustre upon them ruskin    33 lake lucerne ruskin    34 the implication is that turner has best delivered it     the grand style35  volume iii chapter i   in taking up the clue of an inquiry now intermitted for nearly ten years it may be well to do as a traveller would who had to recommence an interrupted journey in a guideless country and ascending as it were some little hill beside our road note how far we have already advanced and what pleasantest ways we may choose for farther progress  i endeavoured in the beginning of the first volume to divide the sources of pleasure open to us in art into certain groups which might conveniently be studied in succession after some preliminary discussion it was concluded that these groups were in the main three consisting first of the pleasures taken in perceiving simple resemblance to nature ideas of truth secondly of the pleasures taken in the beauty of the things chosen to be painted ideas of beauty and lastly of pleasures taken in the meanings and relations of these things ideas of relation  the first volume treating of the ideas of truth was chiefly occupied with an inquiry into the various success with which different artists had represented the facts of naturean inquiry necessarily conducted very imperfectly owing to the want of pictorial illustration  the second volume merely opened the inquiry into the nature of ideas of beauty and relation by analysing as far as i was able to do so the two faculties of the human mind which mainly seized such ideas namely the contemplative and imaginative faculties  it remains for us to examine the various success of artists especially of the great landscapepainter whose works have been throughout our principal subject in addressing these faculties of the human mind and to consider who among them has conveyed the noblest ideas of beauty and touched the deepest sources of thought  i do not intend however now to pursue the inquiry in a method so laboriously systematic for the subject may it seems to me be more usefully treated by pursuing the different questions which rise out of it just as they occur to us without too great scrupulousness in marking connections or insisting on sequences much time is wasted by human beings in general on establishment of systems and it often takes more labour to master the intricacies of an artificial connection than to remember the separate facts which are so carefully connected i suspect that systemmakers in general are not of much more use each in his own domain than in that of pomona the old women who tie cherries upon sticks for the more convenient portableness of the same to cultivate well and choose well your cherries is of some importance but if they can be had in their own wild way of clustering about their crabbed stalk it is a better connection for them than any other and if they cannot then so that they be not bruised it makes to a boy of a practical disposition not much difference whether he gets them by handfuls or in beaded symmetry on the exalting stick i purpose therefore henceforward to trouble myself little with sticks or twine but to arrange my chapters with a view to convenient reference rather than to any careful division of subjects and to follow out in any byways that may open on right hand or left whatever question it seems useful at any moment to settle  and in the outset i find myself met by one which i ought to have touched upon beforeone of especial interest in the present state of the arts i have said that the art is greatest which includes the greatest ideas but i have not endeavoured to define the nature of this greatness in the ideas themselves we speak of great truths of great beauties great thoughts what is it which makes one truth greater than another one thought greater than another this question is i repeat of peculiar importance at the present time for during a period now of some hundred and fifty years all writers on art who have pretended to eminence have insisted much on a supposed distinction between what they call the great and the low schools using the terms high art great or ideal style and other such as descriptive of a certain noble manner of painting which it was desirable that all students of art should be early led to reverence and adopt and characterizing as vulgar or low or realist another manner of painting and conceiving which it was equally necessary that all students should be taught to avoid  but lately this established teaching never very intelligible has been gravely called in question the advocates and selfsupposed practisers of high art are beginning to be looked upon with doubt and their peculiar phraseology to be treated with even a certain degree of ridicule and other forms of art are partly developed among us which do not pretend to be high but rather to be strong healthy and humble this matter of highness in art therefore deserves our most careful consideration has it been or is it a true highness a true princeliness or only a show of it consisting in courtly manners and robes of state is it rocky height or cloudy height adamant or vapour on which the sun of praise so long has risen and set it will be well at once to consider this  and first let us get as quickly as may be at the exact meaning with which the advocates of high art use that somewhat obscure and figurative term  i do not know that the principles in question are anywhere more distinctly expressed than in two papers in the idler written by sir joshua reynolds of course under the immediate sanction of johnson and which may thus be considered as the utterance of the views then held upon the subject by the artists of chief skill and critics of most sense arranged in a form so brief and clear as to admit of their being brought before the public for a mornings entertainment i cannot therefore it seems to me do better than quote these two letters or at least the important parts of them examining the exact meaning of each passage as it occurs there are in all in the idler three letters on painting nos 76 79 and 82 of these the first is directed only against the impertinences of pretended connoisseurs and is as notable for its faithfulness as for its wit in the description of the several modes of criticism in an artificial and ignorant state of society it is only therefore in the two last papers that we find the expression of the doctrines which it is our business to examine  no 79 saturday october 20 1759 begins after a short preamble with the following passage  amongst the painters and the writers on painting there is one maxim universally admitted and continually inculcated imitate nature is the invariable rule but i know none who have explained in what manner this rule is to be understood the consequence of which is that everyone takes it in the most obvious sensethat objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real it may appear strange perhaps to hear this sense of the rule disputed but it must be considered that if the excellency of a painter consisted only in this kind of imitation painting must lose its rank and be no longer considered as a liberal art and sister to poetry this imitation being merely mechanical in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best for the painter of genius cannot stoop to drudgery in which the understanding has no part and what pretence has the art to claim kindred with poetry but by its power over the imagination to this power the painter of genius directs him in this sense he studies nature and often arrives at his end even by being unnatural in the confined sense of the word  the grand style of painting requires this minute attention to be carefully avoided and must be kept as separate from it as the style of poetry from that of history poetical ornaments destroy that air of truth and plainness which ought to characterize history but the very being of poetry consists in departing from this plain narrative and adopting every ornament that will warm the imagination36 to desire to see the excellences of each style unitedto mingle the dutch with the italian school is to join contrarieties which cannot subsist together and which destroy the efficacy of each other  we find first from this interesting passage that the writer considers the dutch and italian masters as severally representative of the low and high schools next that he considers the dutch painters as excelling in a mechanical imitation in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best and thirdly that he considers the italian painters as excelling in a style which corresponds to that of imaginative poetry in literature and which has an exclusive right to be called the grand style  i wish that it were in my power entirely to concur with the writer and to enforce this opinion thus distinctly stated i have never been a zealous partisan of the dutch school and should rejoice in claiming reynoldss authority for the assertion that their manner was one in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best but before his authority can be so claimed we must observe exactly the meaning of the assertion itself and separate it from the company of some others not perhaps so admissible first i say we must observe reynoldss exact meaning for though the assertion may at first appear singular a man who uses accurate language is always more liable to misinterpretation than one who is careless in his expressions we may assume that the latter means very nearly what we at first suppose him to mean for words which have been uttered without thought may be received without examination but when a writer or speaker may be fairly supposed to have considered his expressions carefully and after having revolved a number of terms in his mind to have chosen the one which exactly means the thing he intends to say we may be assured that what costs him time to select will require from us time to understand and that we shall do him wrong unless we pause to reflect how the word which he has actually employed differs from other words which it seems he might have employed it thus constantly happens that persons themselves unaccustomed to think clearly or speak correctly misunderstand a logical and careful writer and are actually in more danger of being misled by language which is measured and precise than by that which is loose and inaccurate  now in the instance before us a person not accustomed to good writing might very rashly conclude that when reynolds spoke of the dutch school as one in which the slowest intellect was sure to succeed best he meant to say that every successful dutch painter was a fool we have no right to take his assertion in that sense he says the slowest intellect we have no right to assume that he meant the weakest for it is true that in order to succeed in the dutch style a man has need of qualities of mind eminently deliberate and sustained he must be possessed of patience rather than of power and must feel no weariness in contemplating the expression of a single thought for several months together as opposed to the changeful energies of the imagination these mental characters may be properly spoken of as under the general termslowness of intellect but it by no means follows that they are necessarily those of weak or foolish men  we observe however farther that the imitation which reynolds supposes to be characteristic of the dutch school is that which gives to objects such relief that they seem real and that he then speaks of this art of realistic imitation as corresponding to history in literature  reynolds therefore seems to class these dull works of the dutch school under a general head to which they are not commonly referredthat of historical painting while he speaks of the works of the italian school not as historical but as poetical painting his next sentence will farther manifest his meaning  the italian attends only to the invariable the great and general ideas which are fixed and inherent in universal nature the dutch on the contrary to literal truth and a minute exactness in the detail as i may say of nature modified by accident the attention to these petty peculiarities is the very cause of this naturalness so much admired in the dutch pictures which if we suppose it to be a beauty is certainly of a lower order which ought to give place to a beauty of a superior kind since one cannot be obtained but by departing from the other  if my opinion was asked concerning the works of michael angelo whether they would receive any advantage from possessing this mechanical merit i should not scruple to say they would not only receive no advantage but would lose in a great measure the effect which they now have on every mind susceptible of great and noble ideas his works may be said to be all genius and soul and why should they be loaded with heavy matter which can only counteract his purpose by retarding the progress of the imagination  examining carefully this and the preceding passage we find the authors unmistakable meaning to be that dutch painting is history attending to literal truth and minute exactness in the details of nature modified by accident that italian painting is poetry attending only to the invariable and that works which attend only to the invariable are full of genius and soul but that literal truth and exact detail are heavy matter which retards the progress of the imagination  this being then indisputably what reynolds means to tell us let us think a little whether he is in all respects right and first as he compares his two kinds of painting to history and poetry let us see how poetry and history themselves differ in their use of variable and invariable details i am writing at a window which commands a view of the head of the lake of geneva and as i look up from my paper to consider this point i see beyond it a blue breadth of softly moving water and the outline of the mountains above chillon bathed in morning mist the first verses which naturally come into my mind are      a thousand feet in depth below     the massy waters meet and flow     so far the fathom line was sent     from chillons snowwhite battlement37  let us see in what manner this poetical statement is distinguished from a historical one  it is distinguished from a truly historical statement first in being simply false the water under the castle of chillon is not a thousand feet deep nor anything like it38 herein certainly these lines fulfil reynoldss first requirement in poetry that it should be inattentive to literal truth and minute exactness in detail in order however to make our comparison more closely in other points let us assume that what is stated is indeed a fact and that it was to be recorded first historically and then poetically  historically stating it then we should say the lake was sounded from the walls of the castle of chillon and found to be a thousand feet deep  now if reynolds be right in his idea of the difference between history and poetry we shall find that byron leaves out of this statement certain unnecessary details and retains only the invariablethat is to say the points which the lake of geneva and castle of chillon have in common with all other lakes and castles  let us hear therefore      a thousand feet in depth below  below here is at all events a word added instead of anything being taken away invariable certainly in the case of lakes but not absolutely necessary      the massy waters meet and flow  massy why massy because deep water is heavy the word is a good word but it is assuredly an added detail and expresses a character not which the lake of geneva has in common with all other lakes but which it has in distinction from those which are narrow or shallow  meet and flow why meet and flow partly to make up a rhyme partly to tell us that the waters are forceful as well as massy and changeful as well as deep observe a farther addition of details and of details more or less peculiar to the spot or according to reynoldss definition of heavy matter retarding the progress of the imagination      so far the fathom line was sent  why fathom line all lines for sounding are not fathom lines if the lake was ever sounded from chillon it was probably sounded in mètres not fathoms this is an addition of another particular detail in which the only compliance with reynoldss requirement is that there is some chance of its being an inaccurate one      from chillons snowwhite battlement  why snowwhite because castle battlements are not usually snowwhite this is another added detail and a detail quite peculiar to chillon and therefore exactly the most striking word in the whole passage  battlement why battlement because all walls have not battlements and the addition of the term marks the castle to be not merely a prison but a fortress  this is a curious result instead of finding as we expected the poetry distinguished from the history by the omission of details we find it consist entirely in the addition of details and instead of being characterized by regard only of the invariable we find its whole power to consist in the clear expression of what is singular and particular  the reader may pursue the investigation for himself in other instances he will find in every case that a poetical is distinguished from a merely historical statement not by being more vague but more specific and it might therefore at first appear that our authors comparison should be simply reversed and that the dutch school should be called poetical and the italian historical but the term poetical does not appear very applicable to the generality of dutch painting and a little reflection will show us that if the italians represent only the invariable they cannot be properly compared even to historians for that which is incapable of change has no history and records which state only the invariable need not be written and could not be read  it is evident therefore that our author has entangled himself in some grave fallacy by introducing this idea of invariableness as forming a distinction between poetical and historical art what the fallacy is we shall discover as we proceed but as an invading army should not leave an untaken fortress in its rear we must not go on with our inquiry into the views of reynolds until we have settled satisfactorily the question already suggested to us in what the essence of poetical treatment really consists for though as we have seen it certainly involves the addition of specific details it cannot be simply that addition which turns the history into poetry for it is perfectly possible to add any number of details to a historical statement and to make it more prosaic with every added word as for instance the lake was sounded out of a flatbottomed boat near the crabtree at the corner of the kitchengarden and was found to be a thousand feet nine inches deep with a muddy bottom it thus appears that it is not the multiplication of details which constitutes poetry nor their subtraction which constitutes history but that there must be something either in the nature of the details themselves or the method of using them which invests them with poetical power or historical propriety  it seems to me and may seem to the reader strange that we should need to ask the question what is poetry here is a word we have been using all our lives and i suppose with a very distinct idea attached to it and when i am now called upon to give a definition of this idea i find myself at a pause what is more singular i do not at present recollect hearing the question often asked though surely it is a very natural one and i never recollect hearing it answered or even attempted to be answered in general people shelter themselves under metaphors and while we hear poetry described as an utterance of the soul an effusion of divinity or voice of nature or in other terms equally elevated and obscure we never attain anything like a definite explanation of the character which actually distinguishes it from prose  i come after some embarrassment to the conclusion that poetry is the suggestion by the imagination of noble grounds for the noble emotions39 i mean by the noble emotions those four principal sacred passionslove veneration admiration and joy this latter especially if unselfish and their oppositeshatred indignation or scorn horror and griefthis last when unselfish becoming compassion these passions in their various combinations constitute what is called poetical feeling when they are felt on noble grounds that is on great and true grounds indignation for instance is a poetical feeling if excited by serious injury but it is not a poetical feeling if entertained on being cheated out of a small sum of money it is very possible the manner of the cheat may have been such as to justify considerable indignation but the feeling is nevertheless not poetical unless the grounds of it be large as well as just in like manner energetic admiration may be excited in certain minds by a display of fireworks or a street of handsome shops but the feeling is not poetical because the grounds of it are false and therefore ignoble there is in reality nothing to deserve admiration either in the firing of packets of gunpowder or in the display of the stocks of warehouses but admiration excited by the budding of a flower is a poetical feeling because it is impossible that this manifestation of spiritual power and vital beauty can ever be enough admired  farther it is necessary to the existence of poetry that the grounds of these feelings should be furnished by the imagination poetical feeling that is to say mere noble emotion is not poetry it is happily inherent in all human nature deserving the name and is found often to be purest in the least sophisticated but the power of assembling by the help of the imagination such images as will excite these feelings is the power of the poet or literally of the maker40  now this power of exciting the emotions depends of course on the richness of the imagination and on its choice of those images which in combination will be most effective or for the particular work to be done most fit and it is altogether impossible for a writer not endowed with invention to conceive what tools a true poet will make use of or in what way he will apply them or what unexpected results he will bring out by them so that it is vain to say that the details of poetry ought to possess or ever do possess any definite character generally speaking poetry runs into finer and more delicate details than prose but the details are not poetical because they are more delicate but because they are employed so as to bring out an affecting result for instance no one but a true poet would have thought of exciting our pity for a bereaved father by describing his way of locking the door of his house      perhaps to himself at that moment he said     the key i must take for my ellen is dead     but of this in my ears not a word did he speak     and he went to the chase with a tear on his cheek41  in like manner in painting it is altogether impossible to say beforehand what details a great painter may make poetical by his use of them to excite noble emotions and we shall therefore find presently that a painting is to be classed in the great or inferior schools not according to the kind of details which it represents but according to the uses for which it employs them  it is only farther to be noticed that infinite confusion has been introduced into this subject by the careless and illogical custom of opposing painting to poetry instead of regarding poetry as consisting in a noble use whether of colours or words painting is properly to be opposed to speaking or writing but not to poetry both painting and speaking are methods of expression poetry is the employment of either for the noblest purposes  this question being thus far determined we may proceed with our paper in the idler  it is very difficult to determine the exact degree of enthusiasm that the arts of painting and poetry may admit there may perhaps be too great indulgence as well as too great a restraint of imagination if the one produces incoherent monsters the other produces what is full as bad lifeless insipidity an intimate knowledge of the passions and good sense but not common sense must at last determine its limits it has been thought and i believe with reason that michael angelo sometimes transgressed those limits and i think i have seen figures of him of which it was very difficult to determine whether they were in the highest degree sublime or extremely ridiculous such faults may be said to be the ebullitions of genius but at least he had this merit that he never was insipid and whatever passion his works may excite they will always escape contempt  what i have had under consideration is the sublimest style particularly that of michael angelo the homer of painting other kinds may admit of this naturalness which of the lowest kind is the chief merit but in painting as in poetry the highest style has the least of common nature  from this passage we gather three important indications of the supposed nature of the great style that it is the work of men in a state of enthusiasm that it is like the writing of homer and that it has as little as possible of common nature in it  first it is produced by men in a state of enthusiasm that is by men who feel strongly and nobly for we do not call a strong feeling of envy jealousy or ambition enthusiasm that is therefore by men who feel poetically this much we may admit i think with perfect safety great art is produced by men who feel acutely and nobly and it is in some sort an expression of this personal feeling we can easily conceive that there may be a sufficiently marked distinction between such art and that which is produced by men who do not feel at all but who reproduce though ever so accurately yet coldly like human mirrors the scenes which pass before their eyes  secondly great art is like the writing of homer and this chiefly because it has little of common nature in it we are not clearly informed what is meant by common nature in this passage homer seems to describe a great deal of what is commoncookery for instance very carefully in all its processes42 i suppose the passage in the iliad which on the whole has excited most admiration is that which describes a wifes sorrow at parting from her husband and a childs fright at its fathers helmet43 and i hope at least the former feeling may be considered common nature but the true greatness of homers style is doubtless held by our author to consist in his imaginations of things not only uncommon but impossible such as spirits in brazen armour or monsters with heads of men and bodies of beasts and in his occasional delineations of the human character and form in their utmost or heroic strength and beauty we gather then on the whole that a painter in the great style must be enthusiastic or full of emotion and must paint the human form in its utmost strength and beauty and perhaps certain impossible forms besides liable by persons not in an equally enthusiastic state of mind to be looked upon as in some degree absurd this i presume to be reynoldss meaning and to be all that he intends us to gather from his comparison of the great style with the writings of homer but if that comparison be a just one in all respects surely two other corollaries ought to be drawn from it namelyfirst that these heroic or impossible images are to be mingled with others very unheroic and very possible and secondly that in the representation of the heroic or impossible forms the greatest care must be taken in finishing the details so that a painter must not be satisfied with painting well the countenance and the body of his hero but ought to spend the greatest part of his time as homer the greatest number of verses in elaborating the sculptured pattern on his shield  let us however proceed with our paper  one may very safely recommend a little more enthusiasm to the modern painters too much is certainly not the vice of the present age the italians seem to have been continually declining in this respect from the time of michael angelo to that of carlo maratti44 and from thence to the very bathos of insipidity to which they are now sunk so that there is no need of remarking that where i mentioned the italian painters in opposition to the dutch i mean not the moderns but the heads of the old roman and bolognian schools nor did i mean to include in my idea of an italian painter the venetian school which may be said to be the dutch part of the italian genius i have only to add a word of advice to the paintersthat however excellent they may be in painting naturally they would not flatter themselves very much upon it and to the connoisseurs that when they see a cat or a fiddle painted so finely that as the phrase is it looks as if you could take it up they would not for that reason immediately compare the painter to raffaelle and michael angelo  in this passage there are four points chiefly to be remarked the first that in the year 1759 the italian painters were in our authors opinion sunk in the very bathos of insipidity the second that the venetian painters ie titian tintoret and veronese are in our authors opinion to be classed with the dutch that is to say are painters in a style in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best thirdly that painting naturally is not a difficult thing nor one on which a painter should pride himself and finally that connoisseurs seeing a cat or a fiddle successfully painted ought not therefore immediately to compare the painter to raphael or michael angelo  yet raphael painted fiddles very carefully in the foreground of his st ceciliaso carefully that they quite look as if they might be taken up so carefully that i never yet looked at the picture without wishing that somebody would take them up and out of the way and i am under a very strong persuasion that raphael did not think painting naturally an easy thing it will be well to examine into this point a little and for the present with the readers permission we will pass over the first two statements in this passage touching the character of italian art in 1759 and of venetian art in general and immediately examine some of the evidence existing as to the real dignity of natural paintingthat is to say of painting carried to the point at which it reaches a deceptive appearance of reality     35 the full title of this chapter is of the received opinions   touching the grand style    36 i have put this sentence in a parenthesis because it is   inconsistent with the rest of the statement and with the general   teaching of the paper since that which attends only to the   invariable cannot certainly adopt every ornament that will warm   the imagination ruskin    37 stanza 6 of byrons prisoner of chillon quoted with a slight   inaccuracy    38 messrs mallet and pictet being on the lake in front of the

into to ask for milk as i came down from the   glacier of argentière in the month of march 1764 an epidemic   dysentery had prevailed in the village and a few months before   had taken away from her her father her husband and her   brothers so that she was left alone with three children in the   cradle her face had something noble in it and its expression   bore the seal of a calm and profound sorrow after having given me   milk she asked me whence i came and what i came there to do so   early in the year when she knew that i was of geneva she said to   me she could not believe that all protestants were lost souls   that there were many honest people among us and that god was too   good and too great to condemn all without distinction then   after a moment of reflection she added in shaking her head but   that which is very strange is that of so many who have gone away   none have ever returned i she added with an expression of   grief who have so mourned my husband and my brothers who have   never ceased to think of them who every night conjure them with   beseechings to tell me where they are and in what state they are   ah surely if they lived anywhere they would not leave me thus   but perhaps she added i am not worthy of this kindness   perhaps the pure and innocent spirits of these children and she   looked at the cradle may have their presence and the joy

 in the outset of this inquiry the reader must thoroughly understand that we are not now considering what is to be painted but how far it is to be painted not whether raphael does right in representing angels playing upon violins or whether veronese does right in allowing cats and monkeys to join the company of kings but whether supposing the subjects rightly chosen they ought on the canvas to look like real angels with real violins and substantial cats looking at veritable kings or only like imaginary angels with soundless violins ideal cats and unsubstantial kings  now from the first moment when painting began to be a subject of literary inquiry and general criticism i cannot remember any writer not professedly artistical who has not more or less in one part of his book or another countenanced the idea that the great end of art is to produce a deceptive resemblance of reality it may be indeed that we shall find the writers through many pages explaining principles of ideal beauty and professing great delight in the evidences of imagination but whenever a picture is to be definitely describedwhenever the writer desires to convey to others some impression of an extraordinary excellence all praise is wound up with some such statements as these it was so exquisitely painted that you expected the figures to move and speak you approached the flowers to enjoy their smell and stretched your hand towards the fruit which had fallen from the branches you shrunk back lest the sword of the warrior should indeed descend and turned away your head that you might not witness the agonies of the expiring martyr  in a large number of instances language such as this will be found to be merely a clumsy effort to convey to others a sense of the admiration of which the writer does not understand the real cause in himself a person is attracted to a picture by the beauty of its colour interested by the liveliness of its story and touched by certain countenances or details which remind him of friends whom he loved or scenes in which he delighted he naturally supposes that what gives him so much pleasure must be a notable example of the painters skill but he is ashamed to confess or perhaps does not know that he is so much a child as to be fond of bright colours and amusing incidents and he is quite unconscious of the associations which have so secret and inevitable a power over his heart he casts about for the cause of his delight and can discover no other than that he thought the picture like reality  in another perhaps a still larger number of cases such language will be found to be that of simple ignorancethe ignorance of persons whose position in life compels them to speak of art without having any real enjoyment of it it is inexcusably required from people of the world that they should see merit in claudes45 and titians and the only merit which many persons can either see or conceive in them is that they must be like nature  in other cases the deceptive power of the art is really felt to be a source of interest and amusement this is the case with a large number of the collectors of dutch pictures they enjoy seeing what is flat made to look round exactly as a child enjoys a trick of legerdemain they rejoice in flies which the spectator vainly attempts to brush away46 and in dew which he endeavours to dry by putting the picture in the sun they take it for the greatest compliment to their treasures that they should be mistaken for windows and think the parting of abraham and hagar adequately represented if hagar seems to be really crying47  it is against critics and connoisseurs of this latter stamp of whom in the year 1759 the juries of art were for the most part composed that the essay of reynolds which we have been examining was justly directed but reynolds had not sufficiently considered that neither the men of this class nor of the two other classes above described constitute the entire body of those who praise art for its realization and that the holding of this apparently shallow and vulgar opinion cannot in all cases be attributed to the want either of penetration sincerity or sense the collectors of gerard dows and hobbimas may be passed by with a smile and the affectations of walpole and simplicities of vasari48 dismissed with contempt or with compassion but very different men from these have held precisely the same language and one amongst the rest whose authority is absolutely and in all points overwhelming  there was probably never a period in which the influence of art over the minds of men seemed to depend less on its merely imitative power than the close of the thirteenth century no painting or sculpture at that time reached more than a rude resemblance of reality its despised perspective imperfect chiaroscuro and unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination separated the artists work from nature by an interval which there was no attempt to disguise and little to diminish and yet at this very period the greatest poet of that or perhaps of any other age and the attached friend of its greatest painter49 who must over and over again have held full and free conversation with him respecting the objects of his art speaks in the following terms of painting supposed to be carried to its highest perfection    qual di pennel fu maestro e di stile     che ritraesse lombre e i tratti chi ivi     mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile   morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi     non vide me di me chi vide il vero     quant io calcai fin che chinato givi    dante purgatorio canto xii 1 64    what master of the pencil or the style   had traced the shades and lines that might have made   the subtlest workman wonder dead the dead   the living seemed alive with clearer view   his eye beheld not who beheld the truth   than mine what i did tread on while i went   low bending    cary  dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that it should bring back as in a mirror or vision the aspect of things passed or absent the scenes of which he speaks are on the pavement for ever represented by angelic power so that the souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them as if the years of the world had been rolled back and they again stood beside the actors in the moment of action nor do i think that dantes authority is absolutely necessary to compel us to admit that such art as this might indeed be the highest possible whatever delight we may have been in the habit of taking in pictures if it were but truly offered to us to remove at our will the canvas from the frame and in lieu of it to behold fixed for ever the image of some of those mighty scenes which it has been our way to make mere themes for the artists fancy if for instance we could again behold the magdalene receiving her pardon at christs feet or the disciples sitting with him at the table of emmaus and this not feebly nor fancifully but as if some silver mirror that had leaned against the wall of the chamber had been miraculously commanded to retain for ever the colours that had flashed upon it for an instantwould we not part with our picturetitians or veroneses though it might be  yes the reader answers in the instance of such scenes as these but not if the scene represented were uninteresting not indeed if it were utterly vulgar or painful but we are not yet certain that the art which represents what is vulgar or painful is itself of much value and with respect to the art whose aim is beauty even of an inferior order it seems that dantes idea of its perfection has still much evidence in its favour for among persons of native good sense and courage enough to speak their minds we shall often find a considerable degree of doubt as to the use of art in consequence of their habitual comparison of it with reality what is the use to me of the painted landscape they will ask i see more beautiful and perfect landscapes every day of my life in my forenoon walk what is the use to me of the painted effigy of hero or beauty i can see a stamp of higher heroism and light of purer beauty on the faces round me utterly inexpressible by the highest human skill now it is evident that to persons of this temper the only valuable picture would indeed be mirrors reflecting permanently the images of the things in which they took delight and of the faces that they loved nay but the reader interrupts if he is of the idealist school i deny that more beautiful things are to be seen in nature than in art on the contrary everything in nature is faulty and art represents nature as perfected be it so must therefore this perfected nature be imperfectly represented is it absolutely required of the painter who has conceived perfection that he should so paint it as to look only like a picture or is not dantes view of the matter right even here and would it not be well that the perfect conception of pallas should be so given as to look like pallas herself rather than merely like the picture of pallas50  it is not easy for us to answer this question rightly owing to the difficulty of imagining any art which should reach the perfection supposed our actual powers of imitation are so feeble that wherever deception is attempted a subject of a comparatively low or confined order must be chosen i do not enter at present into the inquiry how far the powers of imitation extend but assuredly up to the present period they have been so limited that it is hardly possible for us to conceive a deceptive art embracing a high range of subject but let the reader make the effort and consider seriously what he would give at any moment to have the power of arresting the fairest scenes those which so often rise before him only to vanish to stay the cloud in its fading the leaf in its trembling and the shadows in their changing to bid the fitful foam be fixed upon the river and the ripples be everlasting upon the lake and then to bear away with him no darkened or feeble sunstain though even that is beautiful but a counterfeit which should seem no counterfeitthe true and perfect image of life indeed or rather for the full majesty of such a power is not thus sufficiently expressed let him consider that it would be in effect nothing else than a capacity of transporting himself at any moment into any scenea gift as great as can be possessed by a disembodied spirit and suppose also this necromancy embracing not only the present but the past and enabling us seemingly to enter into the very bodily presence of men long since gathered to the dust to behold them in act as they lived butwith greater privilege than ever was granted to the companions of those transient acts of lifeto see them fastened at our will in the gesture and expression of an instant and stayed on the eve of some great deed in immortality of burning purpose conceive so far as it is possible such power as this and then say whether the art which conferred it is to be spoken lightly of or whether we should not rather reverence as half divine a gift which would go so far as to raise us into the rank and invest us with the felicities of angels  yet such would imitative art be in its perfection not by any means an easy thing as reynolds supposes it far from being easy it is so utterly beyond all human power that we have difficulty even in conceiving its nature or resultsthe best art we as yet possess comes so far short of it  but we must not rashly come to the conclusion that such art would indeed be the highest possible there is much to be considered hereafter on the other side the only conclusion we are as yet warranted in forming is that reynolds had no right to speak lightly or contemptuously of imitative art that in fact when he did so he had not conceived its entire nature but was thinking of some vulgar conditions of it which were the only ones known to him and that therefore his whole endeavour to explain the difference between great and mean art has been disappointed that he has involved himself in a crowd of theories whose issue he had not foreseen and committed himself to conclusions which he never intended there is an instinctive consciousness in his own mind of the difference between high and low art but he is utterly incapable of explaining it and every effort which he makes to do so involves him in unexpected fallacy and absurdity it is not true that poetry does not concern herself with minute details it is not true that high art seeks only the invariable it is not true that imitative art is an easy thing it is not true that the faithful rendering of nature is an employment in which the slowest intellect is likely to succeed best all these successive assertions are utterly false and untenable while the plain truth a truth lying at the very door has all the while escaped himthat which was incidentally stated in the preceding chapternamely that the difference between great and mean art lies not in definable methods of handling or styles of representation or choices of subjects but wholly in the nobleness of the end to which the effort of the painter is addressed we cannot say that a painter is great because he paints boldly or paints delicately because he generalizes or particularizes because he loves detail or because he disdains it he is great if by any of these means he has laid open noble truths or aroused noble emotions it does not matter whether he paint the petal of a rose or the chasms of a precipice so that love and admiration attend him as he labours and wait for ever upon his work it does not matter whether he toil for months upon a few inches of his canvas or cover a palace front with colour in a day so only that it be with a solemn purpose that he has filled his heart with patience or urged his hand to haste and it does not matter whether he seek for his subjects among peasants or nobles among the heroic or the simple in courts or in fields so only that he behold all things with a thirst for beauty and a hatred of meanness and vice there are indeed certain methods of representation which are usually adopted by the most active minds and certain characters of subject usually delighted in by the noblest hearts but it is quite possible quite easy to adopt the manner of painting without sharing the activity of mind and to imitate the choice of subject without possessing the nobility of spirit while on the other hand it is altogether impossible to foretell on what strange objects the strength of a great man will sometimes be concentrated or by what strange means he will sometimes express himself so that true criticism of art never can consist in the mere application of rules it can be just only when it is founded on quick sympathy with the innumerable instincts and changeful efforts of human nature chastened and guided by unchanging love of all things that god has created to be beautiful and pronounced to be good     45 claude gelée

and without originality mainly famous as author   of the lives of the painters    49 giotto    50 purgatorio 12 31     of the novelty of landscape  volume iii chapter ii   having now obtained i trust clear ideas up to a certain point of what is generally right and wrong in all art both in conception and in workmanship we have to apply these laws of right to the particular branch of art which is the subject of our present inquiry namely landscapepainting respecting which after the various meditations into which we have been led on the high duties and ideals of art it may not improbably occur to us first to askwhether it be worth inquiring about at all  that question perhaps the reader thinks should have been asked and answered before i had written or he read two volumes and a half about it so i had answered it in my own mind but it seems time now to give the grounds for this answer if indeed the reader has never suspected that landscapepainting was anything but good right and healthy work i should be sorry to put any doubt of its being so into his mind but if as seems to me more likely he living in this busy and perhaps somewhat calamitous age has some suspicion that landscapepainting is but an idle and empty business not worth all our long talk about it then perhaps he will be pleased to have such suspicion done away before troubling himself farther with these disquisitions  i should rather be glad than otherwise that he had formed some suspicion on this matter if he has at all admitted the truth of anything hitherto said respecting great art and its choices of subject it seems to me he ought by this time to be questioning with himself whether roadside weeds old cottages broken stones and such other materials be worthy matters for grave men to busy themselves in the imitation of and i should like him to probe this doubt to the deep of it and bring all his misgivings out to the broad light that we may see how we are to deal with them or ascertain if indeed they are too well founded to be dealt with  and to this end i would ask him now to imagine himself entering for the first time in his life the room of the old watercolour society51 and to suppose that he has entered it not for the sake of a quiet examination of the paintings one by one but in order to seize such ideas as it may generally suggest respecting the state and meaning of modern as compared with elder art i suppose him of course that he may be capable of such a comparison to be in some degree familiar with the different forms in which art has developed itself within the periods historically known to us but never till that moment to have seen any completely modern work so prepared and so unprepared he would as his ideas began to arrange themselves be first struck by the number of paintings representing blue mountains clear lakes and ruined castles or cathedrals and he would say to himself there is something strange in the mind of these modern people nobody ever cared about blue mountains before or tried to paint the broken stones of old walls and the more he considered the subject the more he would feel the peculiarity and as he thought over the art of greeks and romans he would still repeat with increasing certainty of conviction mountains i remember none the greeks did not seem as artists to know that such things were in the world they carved or variously represented men and horses and beasts and birds and all kinds of living creaturesyes even down to cuttlefish and trees in a sort of way but not so much as the outline of a mountain and as for lakes they merely showed they knew the difference between salt and fresh water by the fish they put into each then he would pass on to mediæval art and still he would be obliged to repeat mountains i remember none some careless and jagged arrangements of blue spires or spikes on the horizon and here and there an attempt at representing an overhanging rock with a hole through it but merely in order to divide the light behind some human figure lakes no nothing of the kindonly blue bays of sea put in to fill up the background when the painter could not think of anything else brokendown buildings no for the most part very complete and wellappointed buildings if any and never buildings at all but to give place or explanation to some circumstance of human conduct and then he would look up again to the modern pictures observing with an increasing astonishment that here the human interest had in many cases altogether disappeared that mountains instead of being used only as a blue ground for the relief of the heads of saints were themselves the exclusive subjects of reverent contemplation that their ravines and peaks and forests were all painted with an appearance of as much enthusiasm as had formerly been devoted to the dimple of beauty or the frowns of asceticism and that all the living interest which was still supposed necessary to the scene might be supplied by a traveller in a slouched hat a beggar in a scarlet cloak or in default of these even by a heron or a wild duck  and if he could entirely divest himself of his own modern habits of thought and regard the subjects in question with the feelings of a knight or monk of the middle ages it might be a question whether those feelings would not rapidly verge towards contempt what he might perhaps mutter to himself here are human beings spending the whole of their lives in making pictures of bits of stone and runlets of water withered sticks and flying fogs and actually not a picture of the gods or the heroes none of the saints or the martyrs none of the angels and demons none of councils or battles or any other single thing worth the thought of a man trees and clouds indeed as if i should not see as many trees as i cared to see and more in the first half of my days journey tomorrow or as if it mattered to any man whether the sky were clear or cloudy so long as his armour did not get too hot in the sun  there can be no question that this would have been somewhat the tone of thought with which either a lacedæmonian a soldier of rome in her strength or a knight of the thirteenth century would have been apt to regard these particular forms of our present art nor can there be any question that in many respects their judgment would have been just it is true that the indignation of the spartan or roman would have been equally excited against any appearance of luxurious industry but the mediæval knight would to the full have admitted the nobleness of art only he would have had it employed in decorating his church or his prayerbook not in imitating moors and clouds and the feelings of all the three would have agreed in thisthat their main ground of offence must have been the want of seriousness and purpose in what they saw they would all have admitted the nobleness of whatever conduced to the honour of the gods or the power of the nation but they would not have understood how the skill of human life could be wisely spent in that which did no honour either to jupiter or to the virgin and which in no wise tended apparently either to the accumulation of wealth the excitement of patriotism or the advancement of morality  and exactly so far forth their judgment would be just as the landscapepainting could indeed be shown for others as well as for them to be art of this nugatory kind and so far forth unjust as that painting could be shown to depend upon or cultivate certain sensibilities which neither the greek nor mediæval knight possessed and which have resulted from some extraordinary change in human nature since their time we have no right to assume without very accurate examination of it that this change has been an ennobling one the simple fact that we are in some strange way different from all the great races that have existed before us cannot at once be received as the proof of our own greatness nor can it be granted without any question that we have a legitimate subject of complacency in being under the influence of feelings with which neither miltiades nor the black prince neither homer nor dante neither socrates nor st francis could for an instant have sympathized  whether however this fact be one to excite our pride or not it is assuredly one to excite our deepest interest the fact itself is certain for nearly six thousand years the energies of man have pursued certain beaten paths manifesting some constancy of feeling throughout all that period and involving some fellowship at heart among the various nations who by turns succeeded or surpassed each other in the several aims of art or policy so that for these thousands of years the whole human race might be to some extent described in general terms man was a creature separated from all others by his instinctive sense of an existence superior to his own invariably manifesting this sense of the being of a god more strongly in proportion to his own perfectness of mind and body and making enormous and selfdenying efforts in order to obtain some persuasion of the immediate presence or approval of the divinity so that on the whole the best things he did were done as in the presence or for the honour of his gods and whether in statues to help him to imagine them or temples raised to their honour or acts of selfsacrifice done in the hope of their love he brought whatever was best and skilfullest in him into their service and lived in a perpetual subjection to their unseen power also he was always anxious to know something definite about them and his chief books songs and pictures were filled with legends about them or specially devoted to illustration of their lives and nature  next to these gods he was always anxious to know something about his human ancestors fond of exalting the memory and telling or painting the history of old rulers and benefactors yet full of an enthusiastic confidence in himself as having in many ways advanced beyond the best efforts of past time and eager to record his own doings for future fame he was a creature eminently warlike placing his principal pride in dominion eminently beautiful and having great delight in his own beauty setting forth this beauty by every species of invention in dress and rendering his arms and accoutrements superbly decorative of his form he took however very little interest in anything but what belonged to humanity caring in no wise for the external world except as it influenced his own destiny honouring the lightning because it could strike him the sea because it could drown him the fountains because they gave him drink and the grass because it yielded him seed but utterly incapable of feeling any special happiness in the love of such things or any earnest emotion about them considered as separate from man therefore giving no time to the study of themknowing little of herbs except only which were hurtful and which healing of stones only which would glitter brightest in a crown or last the longest in a wall of the wild beasts which were best for food and which the stoutest quarry for the hunterthus spending only on the lower creatures and inanimate things his waste energy his dullest thoughts his most languid emotions and reserving all his acuter intellect for researches into his own nature and that of the gods all his strength of will for the acquirement of political or moral power all his sense of beauty for things immediately connected with his own person and life and all his deep affections for domestic or divine companionship  such in broad light and brief terms was man for five thousand years such he is no longer let us consider what he is now comparing the descriptions clause by clause  i he was invariably sensible of the existence of gods and went about all his speculations or works holding this as an acknowledged fact making his best efforts in their service now he is capable of going through life with hardly any positive idea on this subjectdoubting fearing suspecting analyzingdoing everything in fact but believing hardly ever getting quite up to that point which hitherto was wont to be the startingpoint for all generations and human work has accordingly hardly any reference to spiritual beings but is done either from a patriotic or personal interesteither to benefit mankind or reach some selfish end not i speak of human work in the broad sense to please the gods  ii he was a beautiful creature setting forth this beauty by all means in his power and depending upon it for much of his authority over his fellows so that the ruddy cheek of david and the ivory skin of atrides and the towering presence of saul and the blue eyes of coeur de lion were among chief reasons why they should be kings and it was one of the aims of all education and of all dress to make the presence of the human form stately and lovely now it has become the task of grave philosophy partly to depreciate or conceal this bodily beauty and even by those who esteem it in their hearts it is not made one of the great ends of education man has become upon the whole an ugly animal and is not ashamed of his ugliness  iii he was eminently warlike he is now gradually becoming more and more ashamed of all the arts and aims of battle so that the desire of dominion which was once frankly confessed or boasted of as a heroic passion is now sternly reprobated or cunningly disclaimed  iv he used to take no interest in anything but what immediately concerned himself now he has deep interest in the abstract nature of things inquires as eagerly into the laws which regulate the economy of the material world as into those of his own being and manifests a passionate admiration of inanimate objects closely resembling in its elevation and tenderness the affection which he bears to those living souls with which he is brought into the nearest fellowship  it is this last change only which is to be the subject of our present inquiry but it cannot be doubted that it is closely connected with all the others and that we can only thoroughly understand its nature by considering il in this connection for regarded by itself we might perhaps too rashly assume it to be a natural consequence of the progress of the race there appears to be a diminution of selfishness in it and a more extended and heartfelt desire of understanding the manner of gods working and this the more because one of the permanent characters of this change is a greater accuracy in the statement of external facts when the eyes of men were fixed first upon themselves and upon nature solely and secondarily as bearing upon their interests it was of less consequence to them what the ultimate laws of nature were than what their immediate effects were upon human beings hence they could rest satisfied with phenomena instead of principles and accepted without scrutiny every fable which seemed sufficiently or gracefully to account for those phenomena but so far as the eyes of men are now withdrawn from themselves and turned upon the inanimate things about them the results cease to be of importance and the laws become essential  in these respects it might easily appear to us that this change was assuredly one of steady and natural advance but when we contemplate the others above noted of which it is clearly one of the branches or consequences we may suspect ourselves of overrashness in our selfcongratulation and admit the necessity of a scrupulous analysis both of the feeling itself and of its tendencies  of course a complete analysis or anything like it would involve a treatise on the whole history of the world i shall merely endeavour to note some of the leading and more interesting circumstances bearing on the subject and to show sufficient practical ground for the conclusion that landscapepainting is indeed a noble and useful art though one not long known by man i shall therefore examine as best i can the effect of landscape 1st on the classical mind 2dly on the mediæval mind and lastly on the modern mind but there is one point of some interest respecting the effect of it on any mind which must be settled first and this i will endeavour to do in the next chapter     51 the society of painters in watercolours often referred to as   the old watercolour society ruskin was elected an honorary member   in 1873     of the pathetic fallacy  volume iii chapter 12   now therefore putting these tiresome and absurd words52 quite out of our way we may go on at our ease to examine the point in questionnamely the difference between the ordinary proper and true appearances of things to us and the extraordinary or false appearances when we are under the influence of emotion or contemplative fancy false appearances i say as being entirely unconnected with any real power or character in the object and only imputed to it by us  for instance      the spendthrift crocus bursting through the mould     naked and shivering with his cup of gold53  this is very beautiful and yet very untrue the crocus is not a spendthrift but a hardy plant its yellow is not gold but saffron how is it that we enjoy so much the having it put into our heads that it is anything else than a plain crocus  it is an important question for throughout our past reasonings about art we have always found that nothing could be good or useful or ultimately pleasurable which was untrue but here is something pleasurable in written poetry which is nevertheless untrue and what is more if we think over our favourite poetry we shall find it full of this kind of fallacy and that we like it all the more for being so  it will appear also on consideration of the matter that this fallacy is of two principal kinds either as in this case of the crocus it is the fallacy of wilful fancy which involves no real expectation that it will be believed or else it is a fallacy caused by an excited state of the feelings making us for the time more or less irrational of the cheating of the fancy we shall have to speak presently but in this chapter i want to examine the nature of the other error that which the mind admits when affected strongly by emotion thus for instance in alton locke      they rowed her in across the rolling foam     the cruel crawling foam54  the foam is not cruel neither does it crawl the state of mind which attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which the reason is unhinged by grief all violent feelings have the same effect they produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of external things which i would generally characterize as the pathetic fallacy  now we are in the habit of considering this fallacy as eminently a character of poetical description and the temper of mind in which we allow it as one eminently poetical because passionate but i believe if we look well into the matter that we shall find the greatest poets do not often admit this kind of falsenessthat it is only the second order of poets who much delight in it55  thus when dante describes the spirits falling from the bank of acheron as dead leaves flutter from a bough56 he gives the most perfect image possible of their utter lightness feebleness passiveness and scattering agony of despair without however for an instant losing his own clear perception that these are souls and those are leaves he makes no confusion of one with the other but when coleridge speaks of      the one red leaf the last of its clan     that dances as often as dance it can57  he has a morbid that is to say a so far false idea about the leaf he fancies a life in it and will which there are not confuses its powerlessness with choice its fading death with merriment and the wind that shakes it with music here however there is some beauty even in the morbid passage but take an instance in homer and pope without the knowledge of ulysses elpenor his youngest follower has fallen from an upper chamber in the circean palace and has been left dead unmissed by his leader or companions in the haste of their departure they cross the sea to the cimmerian land and ulysses summons the shades from tartarus the first which appears is that of the lost elpenor ulysses amazed and in exactly the spirit of bitter and terrified lightness which is seen in hamlet58 addresses the spirit with the simple startled words  elpenor how camest thou under the shadowy darkness hast thou come faster on foot than i in my black ship59  which pope renders thus      o say what angry power elpenor led     to glide in shades and wander with the dead     how could thy soul by realms and seas disjoined     outfly the nimble sail and leave the lagging wind  i sincerely hope the reader finds no pleasure here either in the nimbleness of the sail or the laziness of the wind and yet how is it that these conceits are so painful now when they have been pleasant to us in the other instances  for a very simple reason they are not a pathetic fallacy at all for they are put into the mouth of the wrong passiona passion which never could possibly have spoken themagonized curiosity ulysses wants to know the facts of the matter and the very last thing his mind could do at the moment would be to pause or suggest in anywise what was not a fact the delay in the first three lines and conceit in the last jar upon us instantly like the most frightful discord in music no poet of true imaginative power could possibly have written the passage60  therefore we see that the spirit of truth must guide us in some sort even in our enjoyment of fallacy coleridges fallacy has no discord in it but popes has set our teeth on edge without farther questioning i will endeavour to state the main bearings of this matter  the temperament which admits the pathetic fallacy is as i said above that of a mind and body in some sort too weak to deal fully with what is before them or upon them borne away or overclouded or overdazzled by emotion and it is a more or less noble state according to the force of the emotion which has induced it for it is no credit to a man that he is not morbid or inaccurate in his perceptions when he has no strength of feeling to warp them and it is in general a sign of higher capacity and stand in the ranks of being that the emotions should be strong enough to vanquish partly the intellect and make it believe what they choose but it is still a grander condition when the intellect also rises till it is strong enough to assert its rule against or together with the utmost efforts of the passions and the whole man stands in an iron glow white hot perhaps but still strong and in no wise evaporating even if he melts losing none of his weight  so then we have the three ranks the man who perceives rightly because he does not feel and to whom the primrose is very accurately the primrose61 because he does not love it then secondly the man who perceives wrongly because he feels and to whom the primrose is anything else than a primrose a star or a sun or a fairys shield or a forsaken maiden and then lastly there is the man who perceives rightly in spite of his feelings and to whom the primrose is for ever nothing else than itselfa little flower apprehended in the very plain and leafy fact of it whatever and how many soever the associations and passions may be that crowd around it and in general these three classes may be rated in comparative order as the men who are not poets at all and the poets of the second order and the poets of the first only however great a man may be there are always some subjects which ought to throw him off his balance some by which his poor human capacity of thought should be conquered and brought into the inaccurate and vague state of perception so that the language of the highest inspiration becomes broken obscure and wild in metaphor resembling that of the weaker man overborne by weaker things  and thus in full there are four classes the men who feel nothing and therefore see truly the men who feel strongly think weakly and see untruly second order of poets the men who feel strongly think strongly and see truly first order of poets and the men who strong as human creatures can be are yet submitted to influences stronger than they and see in a sort untruly because what they see is inconceivably above them this last is the usual condition of prophetic inspiration  i separate these classes in order that their character may be clearly understood but of course they are united each to the other by imperceptible transitions and the same mind according to the influences to which it is subjected passes at different times into the various states still the difference between the great and less man is on the whole chiefly in this point of alterability that is to say the one knows too much and perceives and feels too much of the past and future and of all things beside and around that which immediately affects him to be in any wise shaken by it his mind is made up his thoughts have an accustomed current his ways are stedfast it is not this or that new sight which will at once unbalance him he is tender to impression at the surface like a rock with deep moss upon it but there is too much mass of him to be moved the smaller man with the same degree of sensibility is at once carried off his feet he wants to do something he did not want to do before he views all the universe in a new light through his tears he is gay or enthusiastic melancholy or passionate as things come and go to him therefore the high creative poet might even be thought to a great extent impassive as shallow people think dante stern receiving indeed all feelings to the full but having a great centre of reflection and knowledge in which he stands serene and watches the feeling as it were from far off  dante in his most intense moods has entire command of himself and can look around calmly at all moments for the image or the word that will best tell what he sees to the upper or lower world but keats and tennyson and the poets of the second order are generally themselves subdued by the feelings under which they write or at least write as choosing to be so and therefore admit certain expressions and modes of thought which are in some sort diseased or false  now so long as we see that the feeling is true we pardon or are even pleased by the confessed fallacy of sight which it induces we are pleased for instance with those lines of kingsleys above quoted not because they fallaciously describe foam but because they faithfully describe sorrow but the moment the mind of the speaker becomes cold that moment every such expression becomes untrue as being for ever untrue in the external facts and there is no greater baseness in literature than the habit of using these metaphorical expressions in cool blood an inspired writer in full impetuosity of passion may speak wisely and truly of raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame62 but it is only the basest writer who cannot speak of the sea without talking of raging waves remorseless floods ravenous billows etc and it is one of the signs of the highest power in a writer to check all such habits of thought and to keep his eyes fixed firmly on the pure fact out of which if any feeling conies to him or his reader he knows it must be a true one  to keep to the waves i forget who it is who represents a man in despair desiring that his body may be cast into the sea      whose changing mound and foam that passed away     might mock the eye that questioned where i lay  observe there is not a single false or even overcharged expression mound of the sea wave is perfectly simple and true changing is as familiar as may be foam that passed away strictly literal and the whole line descriptive of the reality with a degree of accuracy which i know not any other verse in the range of poetry that altogether equals for most people have not a distinct idea of the clumsiness and massiveness of a large wave the word wave is used too generally of ripples and breakers and bendings in light drapery or grass it does not by itself convey a perfect image but the word mound is heavy large dark definite there is no mistaking the kind of wave meant nor missing the sight of it then the term changing has a peculiar force also most people think of waves as rising and falling but if they look at the sea carefully they will perceive that the waves do not rise and fall they change change both place and form but they do not fall one wave goes on and on and still on now lower now higher now tossing its mane like a horse now building itself together like a wall now shaking now steady but still the same wave till at last it seems struck by something and changes one knows not howbecomes another wave  the close of the line insists on this image and paints it still more perfectlyfoam that passed away not merely melting disappearing but passing on out of sight on the career of the wave then having put the absolute ocean fact as far as he may before our eyes the poet leaves us to feel about it as we may and to trace for ourselves the opposite factthe image of the green mounds that do not change and the white and written stones that do not pass away and thence to follow out also the associated images of the calm life with the quiet grave and the despairing life with the fading foam      let no man move his bones  as for samaria her king is cut off like the foam upon the water63  but nothing of this is actually told or pointed out and the expressions as they stand are perfectly severe and accurate utterly uninfluenced by the firmly governed emotion of the writer even the word mock is hardly an exception as it may stand merely for deceive or defeat without implying any impersonation of the waves  it may be well perhaps to give one or two more instances to show the peculiar dignity possessed by all passages which thus limit their expression to the pure fact and leave the hearer to gather what he can from it here is a notable one from the iliad helen looking from the scæan gate of troy over the grecian host and telling priam the names of its captains says at last      i see all the other darkeyed greeks but two i cannot     seecastor and polluxwhom one mother bore with me have they     not followed from fair lacedæmon or have they indeed come in     their seawandering ships but now will not enter into the battle     of men fearing the shame and the scorn that is in me  then homer      so she spoke but them already the lifegiving earth possessed     there in lacedæmon in the dear fatherland64  note here the high poetical truth carried to the extreme the poet has to speak of the earth in sadness but he will not let that sadness affect or change his thoughts of it no though castor and pollux be dead yet the earth is our mother still fruitful lifegiving these are the facts of the thing i see nothing else than these make what you will of them  take another very notable instance from casimir de la vignes terrible ballad la toilette de constance i must quote a few lines out of it here and there to enable the reader who has not the book by him to understand its close          vite anna vite au miroir            plus vite anna lheure savance          et je vais au bal ce

lassurance         quon va madorer ce soir            chez lambassadeur de france      pres du foyer constance sadmirait       dieu sur sa robe il vole une étincelle     au feu courez quand lespoir

hélas et son doux rêve          adieu bal plaisir amour            on disait pauvre constance         et lon dansa jusquau jour            chez lambassadeur de france65  yes that is the fact of it right or wrong the poet does not say what you may think about it he does not know he has nothing to do with that there lie the ashes of the dead girl in her chamber there they danced till the morning at the ambassadors of france make what you will of it  if the reader will look through the ballad of which i have quoted only about the third part he will find that there is not from beginning to end of it a single poetical so called expression except in one stanza the girl speaks as simple prose as may be there is not a word she would not have actually used as she was dressing the poet stands by impassive as a statue recording her words just as they come at last the doom seizes her and in the very presence of death for an instant his own emotions conquer him he records no longer the facts only but the facts as they seem to him the fire gnaws with voluptuousnesswithout pity it is soon past the fate is fixed for ever and he retires into his pale and crystalline atmosphere of truth he closes all with the calm veracity      they said poor constance  now in this there is the exact type of the consummate poetical temperament for be it clearly and constantly remembered that the greatness of a poet depends upon the two faculties acuteness of feeling and command of it a poet is great first in proportion to the strength of his passion and then that strength being granted in proportion to his government of it there being however always a point beyond which it would be inhuman and monstrous if he pushed this government and therefore a point at which all feverish and wild fancy becomes just and true thus the destruction of the kingdom of assyria cannot be contemplated firmly by a prophet of israel the fact is too great too wonderful it overthrows him dashes him into a confused element of dreams all the world is to his stunned thought full of strange voices yea the firtrees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art gone down to the grave no feller is come up against us66 so still more the thought of the presence of deity cannot be borne without this great astonishment the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands67  but by how much this feeling is noble when it is justified by the strength of its cause by so much it is ignoble when there is not cause enough for it and beyond all other ignobleness is the mere affectation of it in hardness of heart simply bad writing may almost always as above noticed be known by its adoption of these fanciful metaphorical expressions as a sort of current coin yet there is even a worse at least a more harmful condition of writing than this in which such expressions are not ignorantly and feelinglessly caught up but by some master skilful in handling yet insincere deliberately wrought out with chill and studied fancy as if we should try to make an old lavastream look redhot again by covering it with dead leaves or whitehot with hoarfrost  when young is lost in veneration as he dwells on the character of a truly good and holy man he permits himself for a moment to be overborne by the feeling so far as to exclaim      where shall i find him angels tell me where     you know him he is near you point him out     shall i see glories beaming from his brow     or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers68  this emotion has a worthy cause and is thus true and right but now hear the coldhearted pope say to a shepherd girl      whereer you walk cool gales shall fan the glade     trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade     your praise the birds shall chant in every grove     and winds shall waft it to the powers above     but would you sing and rival orpheus strain     the wondering forests soon should dance again     the moving mountains hear the powerful call     and headlong streams hang listening in their fall69  this is not nor could it for a moment be mistaken for the language of passion it is simple falsehood uttered by hypocrisy definite absurdity rooted in affectation and coldly asserted in the teeth of nature and fact passion will indeed go far in deceiving itself but it must be a strong passion not the simple wish of a lover to tempt his mistress to sing compare a very closely parallel passage in wordsworth in which the lover has lost his mistress      three years had barbara in her grave been laid     when thus his moan he made      oh move thou cottage from behind yon oak       or let the ancient tree uprooted lie     that in some other way yon smoke       may mount into the sky     if still behind yon pinetrees ragged bough       headlong the waterfall must come       oh let it then be dumb     be anything sweet stream but that which thou art now70  here is a cottage to be moved if not a mountain and a waterfall to be silent if it is not to hang listening but with what different relation to the mind that contemplates them here in the extremity of its agony the soul cries out wildly for relief which at the same moment it partly knows to be impossible but partly believes possible in a vague impression that a miracle might be wrought to give relief even to a less sore distressthat nature is kind and god is kind and that grief is strong it knows not well what is possible to such grief to silence a stream to move a cottage wallone might think it could do as much as that  i believe these instances are enough to illustrate the main point i insist upon respecting the pathetic fallacythat so far as it is a fallacy it is always the sign of a morbid state of mind and comparatively of a weak one even in the most inspired prophet it is a sign of the incapacity of his human sight or thought to bear what has been revealed to it in ordinary poetry if it is found in the thoughts of the poet himself it is at once a sign of his belonging to the inferior school if in the thoughts of the characters imagined by him it is right or wrong according to the genuineness of the emotion from which it springs always however implying necessarily some degree of weakness in the character  take two most exquisite instances from master hands the jessy of shenstone and the ellen of wordsworth have both been betrayed and deserted jessy in the course of her most touching complaint says      if through the gardens flowery tribes i stray       where bloom the jasmines that could once allure     hope not to find delight in us they say       for we are spotless jessy we are pure71  compare with this some of the words of ellen      ah why said ellen sighing to herself     why do not words and kiss and solemn pledge     and nature that is kind in womans breast     and reason that in man is wise and good     and fear of him who is a righteous judge     why do not these prevail for human life     to keep two hearts together that began     their springtime with one love and that have need     of mutual pity and forgiveness sweet     to grant or be received while that poor bird     o come and hear him thou who hast to me     been faithless hear himthough a lowly creature     one of gods simple children that yet know not     the universal parent how he sings     as if he wished the firmament of heaven     should listen and give back to him the voice     of his triumphant constancy and love     the proclamation that he makes how far     his darkness doth transcend our fickle light72  the perfection of both these passages as far as regards truth and tenderness of imagination in the two poets is quite insuperable but of the two characters imagined jessy is weaker than ellen exactly in so far as something appears to her to be in nature which is not the flowers do not really reproach her god meant them to comfort her not to taunt her

there is not all good there is no good if they ever   hope to do better why do they trouble us now let them rather   courageously burn all they have done and wait for the better days   there are few men ordinarily educated who in moments of strong   feeling could not strike out a poetical thought and afterwards   polish it so as to be presentable but men of sense know better   than so to waste their time and those who sincerely love poetry   know the touch of the masters hand on the chords too well to   fumble among them after him nay more than this all inferior   poetry is an injury to the good inasmuch as it takes away the   freshness of rhymes blunders upon and gives a wretched commonalty   to good thoughts and in general adds to the weight of human   weariness in a most woful and culpable manner there are few   thoughts likely to come across ordinary men which have not already   been expressed by greater men in the best possible way and it is a   wiser more generous more noble

the examination of the pathetic fallacy was that whether in literature or in art he will find it eminently characteristic of the modern mind and in the landscape whether of literature or art he will also find the modern painter endeavouring to express something which he as a living creature imagines in the lifeless object while the classical and mediæval painters were content with expressing the unimaginary and actual qualities of the object itself it will be observed that according to the principle stated long ago i use the words painter and poet quite indifferently including in our inquiry the landscape of literature as well as that of painting and this the more because the spirit of classical landscape has hardly been expressed in any other way than by words  taking therefore this wide field it is surely a very notable circumstance to begin with that this pathetic fallacy is eminently characteristic of modern painting for instance keats describing a wave breaking out at sea says of it      down whose green back the shortlived foam all hoar     bursts gradual with a wayward indolence74  that is quite perfect as an example of the modern manner the idea of the peculiar action with which foam rolls down a long large wave could not have been given by any other words so well as by this wayward indolence but homer would never have written never thought of such words he could not by any possibility have lost sight of the great fact that the wave from the beginning to the end of it do what it might was still nothing else than salt water and that salt water could not be either wayward or indolent he will call the waves overroofed fullcharged monstrous compactblack darkclear violetcoloured winecoloured and so on but every one of these epithets is descriptive of pure physical nature overroofed is the term he invariably uses of anythingrock house or wavethat nods over at the brow the other terms need no explanation they are as accurate and intense in truth as words can be but they never show the slightest feeling of anything animated in the ocean black or clear monstrous or violetcoloured cold salt water it is always and nothing but that  well but the modern writer by his admission of the tinge of fallacy has given an idea of something in the action of the wave which homer could not and surely therefore has made a step in advance also there appears to be a degree of sympathy and feeling in the one writer which there is not in the other and as it has been received for a first principle that writers are great in proportion to the intensity of their feelings and homer seems to have no feelings about the sea but that it is black and deep surely in this respect also the modern writer is the greater  stay a moment homer had some feeling about the sea a faith in the animation of it much stronger than keatss but all this sense of something living in it he separates in his mind into a great abstract image of a sea power he never says the waves rage or the waves are idle but he says there is somewhat in and greater than the waves which rages and is idle and that he calls a god  i do not think we ever enough endeavour to enter into what a greeks real notion of a god was we are so accustomed to the modern mockeries of the classical religion so accustomed to hear and see the greek gods introduced as living personages or invoked for help by men who believe neither in them nor in any other gods that we seem to have infected the greek ages themselves with the breath and dimmed them with the shade of our hypocrisy and are apt to think that homer as we know that pope was merely an ingenious fabulist nay more than this that all the nations of past time were ingenious fabulists also to whom the universe was a lyrical drama and by whom whatsoever was said about it was merely a witty allegory or a graceful lie of which the entire upshot and consummation was a pretty statue in the middle of the court or at the end of the garden  this at least is one of our forms of opinion about greek faith not indeed possible altogether to any man of honesty or ordinary powers of thought but still so venomously inherent in the modern philosophy that all the pure lightning of carlyle cannot as yet quite burn it out of any of us and then side by side with this mere infidel folly stands the bitter shortsightedness of puritanism holding the classical god to be either simply an idola block of stone ignorantly though sincerely worshippedor else an actual diabolic or betraying power usurping the place of god  both these puritanical estimates of greek deity are of course to some extent true the corruption of classical worship is barren idolatry and that corruption was deepened and variously directed to their own purposes by the evil angels but this was neither the whole nor the principal part of pagan worship pallas was not in the pure greek mind merely a powerful piece of ivory in a temple at athens neither was the choice of leonidas between the alternatives granted him by the oracle of personal death or ruin to his country altogether a work of the devils prompting  what then was actually the greek god in what way were these two ideas of human form and divine power credibly associated in the ancient heart so as to become a subject of true faith irrespective equally of fable allegory superstitious trust in stone and demoniacal influence  it seems to me that the greek had exactly the same instinctive feeling about the elements that we have ourselves that to homer as much as to casimir de la vigne75 fire seemed ravenous and pitiless to homer as much as to keats the seawave appeared wayward or idle or whatever else it may be to the poetical passion but then the greek reasoned upon this sensation saying to himself i can light the fire and put it out i can dry this water up or drink it it cannot be the fire or the water that rages or that is wayward but it must be something in this fire and in the water which i cannot destroy by extinguishing the one or evaporating the other any more than i destroy myself by cutting off my finger i was in my fingersomething of me at least was i had a power over it and felt pain in it though i am still as much myself when it is gone so there may be a power in the water which is not water but to which the water is as a bodywhich can strike with it move in it suffer in it yet not be destroyed with it this something this great water spirit i must not confuse with the waves which are only its body they may flow hither and thither increase or diminish that must be invisibleimperishablea god so of fire also those rays which i can stop and in the midst of which i cast a shadow cannot be divine nor greater than i they cannot feel but there may be something in them that feelsa glorious intelligence as much nobler and more swift than mine as these rays which are its body are nobler and swifter than my fleshthe spirit of all light and truth and melody and revolving hours  it was easy to conceive farther that such spirits should be able to assume at will a human form in order to hold intercourse with men or to perform any act for which their proper body whether of fire earth or air was unfitted and it would have been to place them beneath instead of above humanity if assuming the form of man they could not also have tasted his pleasures hence the easy step to the more or less material ideas of deities which are apt at first to shock us but which are indeed only dishonourable so far as they represent the gods as false and unholy it is not the materialism but the vice which degrades the conception for the materialism itself is never positive or complete there is always some sense of exaltation in the spiritual and immortal body and of a power proceeding from the visible form through all the infinity of the element ruled by the particular god the precise nature of the idea is well seen in the passage of the iliad which describes the river scamander defending the trojans against achilles76 in order to remonstrate with the hero the god assumes a human form which nevertheless is in some way or other instantly recognized by achilles as that of the rivergod it is addressed at once as a river not as a man and its voice is the voice of a river out of the deep whirlpools77 achilles refuses to obey its commands and from the human form it returns instantly into its natural or divine one and endeavours to overwhelm him with waves vulcan defends achilles and sends fire against the river which suffers in its waterbody till it is able to bear no more at last even the nerve of the river or strength of the river note the expression feels the fire and this strength of the river addresses vulcan in supplications for respite there is in this precisely the idea of a vital part of the riverbody which acted and felt and which if the fire reached it was death just as would be the case if it touched a vital part of the human body throughout the passage the manner of conception is perfectly clear and consistent and if in other places the exact connection between the ruling spirit and the thing ruled is not so manifest it is only because it is almost impossible for the human mind to dwell long upon such subjects without falling into inconsistencies and gradually slackening its effort to grasp the entire truth until the more spiritual part of it slips from its hold and only the human form of the god is left to be conceived and described as subject to all the errors of humanity but i do not believe that the idea ever weakens itself down to mere allegory when pallas is said to attack and strike down mars it does not mean merely that wisdom at that moment prevailed against wrath it means that there are indeed two great spirits one entrusted to guide the human soul to wisdom and chastity the other to kindle wrath and prompt to battle it means that these two spirits on the spot where and at the moment when a great contest was to be decided between all that they each governed in man then and there assumed human form and human weapons and did verily and materially strike at each other until the spirit of wrath was crushed and when diana is said to hunt with her nymphs in the woods it does not mean merely as wordsworth puts it78 that the poet or shepherd saw the moon and stars glancing between the branches of the trees and wished to say so figuratively it means that there is a living spirit to which the light of the moon is a body which takes delight in glancing between the clouds and following the wild beasts as they wander through the night and that this spirit sometimes assumes a perfect human form and in this form with real arrows pursues and slays the wild beasts which with its mere arrows of moonlight it could not slay retaining nevertheless all the while its power and being in the moonlight and in all else that it rules  there is not the smallest inconsistency or unspirituality in this conception if there were it would attach equally to the appearance of the angels to jacob abraham joshua or manoah79 in all those instances the highest authority which governs our own faith requires us to conceive divine power clothed with a human form a form so real that it is recognized for superhuman only by its doing wondrously and retaining nevertheless sovereignty and omnipresence in all the world this is precisely as i understand it the heathen idea of a god and it is impossible to comprehend any single part of the greek mind until we grasp this faithfully not endeavouring to explain it away in any wise but accepting with frank decision and definition the tangible existence of its deitiesblueeyedwhitefleshed humanheartedcapable at their choice of meeting man absolutely in his own naturefeasting with himtalking with himfighting with him eye to eye or breast to breast as mars with diomed80 or else dealing with him in a more retired spirituality as apollo sending the plague upon the greeks81 when his quiver rattles at his shoulders as he moves and yet the darts sent forth of it strike not as arrows but as plague or finally retiring completely into the material universe which they properly inhabit and dealing with man through that as scamander with achilles through his waves  nor is there anything whatever in the various actions recorded of the gods however apparently ignoble to indicate weakness of belief in them very frequently things which appear to us ignoble are merely the simplicities of a pure and truthful age when juno beats diana about the ears with her own quiver82 for instance we start at first as if homer could not have believed that they were both real goddesses but what should juno have done killed diana with a look nay she neither wished to do so nor could she have done so by the very faith of dianas goddessship diana is as immortal as herself frowned diana into submission but diana has come expressly to try conclusions with her and will by no means be frowned into submission wounded her with a celestial lance that sounds more poetical but it is in reality partly more savage and partly more absurd than homer more savage for it makes juno more cruel therefore less divine and more absurd for it only seems elevated in tone because we use the word celestial which means nothing what sort of a thing is a celestial lance not a wooden one of what then of moonbeams or clouds or mist well therefore dianas arrows were of mist too and her quiver and herself and juno with her lance and all vanish into mist why not have said at once if that is all you mean that two mists met and one drove the other back that would have been rational and intelligible but not to talk of celestial lances homer had no such misty fancy he believed the two goddesses were there in true bodies with true weapons on the true earth and still i ask what should juno have done not beaten diana no for it is unladylike unenglishladylike yes but by no means ungreekladylike nor even unnaturalladylike if a modern lady does not beat her servant or her rival about the ears it is oftener because she is too weak or too proud than because she is of purer mind than homers juno she will not strike them but she will overwork the one or slander the other without pity and homer would not have thought that one whit more goddesslike than striking them with her open hand  if however the reader likes to suppose that while the two goddesses in personal presence thus fought with arrow and quiver there was also a broader and vaster contest supposed by homer between the elements they ruled and that the goddess of the heavens as she struck the goddess of the moon on the flushing cheek was at the same instant exercising omnipresent power in the heavens themselves and gathering clouds with which filled with the moons own arrows or beams she was encumbering and concealing the moon he is welcome to this out carrying of the idea provided that he does not pretend to make it an interpretation instead of a mere extension nor think to explain away my real running beautiful beaten diana into a moon behind clouds83  it is only farther to be noted that the greek conception of godhead as it was much more real than we usually suppose so it was much more bold and familiar than to a modern mind would be possible i shall have something more to observe in a little while of the danger of our modern habit of endeavouring to raise ourselves to something like comprehension of the truth of divinity instead of simply believing the words in which the deity reveals himself to us the greek erred rather on the other side making hardly any effort to conceive divine mind as above the human and no more shrinking from frank intercourse with a divine being or dreading its immediate presence than that of the simplest of mortals thus atrides enraged at his swords breaking in his hand upon the helmet of paris after he had expressly invoked the assistance of jupiter exclaims aloud as he would to a king who had betrayed him jove father there is not another god more evilminded than thou84 and helen provoked at pariss defeat and oppressed with pouting shame both for him and for herself when venus appears at her side and would lead her back to the delivered paris impatiently tells the goddess to go and take care of paris herself85  the modern mind is naturally but vulgarly and unjustly shocked by this kind of familiarity rightly understood it is not so much a sign of misunderstanding of the divine nature as of good understanding of the human the greek lived in all things a healthy and in a certain degree a perfect life he had no morbid or sickly feeling of any kind he was accustomed to face death without the slightest shrinking to undergo all kinds of bodily hardship without complaint and to do what he supposed right and honourable in most cases as a matter of course confident of his own immortality and of the power of abstract justice he expected to be dealt with in the next world as was right and left the matter much in his gods hands but being thus immortal and finding in his own soul something which it seemed quite as difficult to master as to rule the elements he did not feel that it was an appalling superiority in those gods to have bodies of water or fire instead of flesh and to have various work to do among the clouds and waves out of his human way or sometimes even in a sort of service to himself was not the nourishment of herbs and flowers a kind of ministering to his wants were not the gods in some sort his husbandmen and spiritservants their mere strength or omnipresence did not seem to him a distinction absolutely terrific it might be the nature of one being to be in two places at once and of another to be only in one but that did not seem of itself to infer any absolute lordliness of one nature above the other any more than an insect must be a nobler creature than a man because it can see on four sides of its head and the man only in front they could kill him or torture him it was true but even that not unjustly or not for ever there was a fate and a divine justice greater than they so that if they did wrong and he right he might fight it out with them and have the better of them at last in a general way they were wiser stronger and better than he and to ask counsel of them to obey them to sacrifice to them to thank them for all good this was well but to be utterly downcast before them or not to tell them his mind in plain greek if they seemed to him to be conducting themselves in an ungodly mannerthis would not be well  such being their general idea of the gods we can now easily understand the habitual tone of their feelings towards what was beautiful in nature with us observe the idea of the divinity is apt to get separated from the life of nature and imagining our god upon a cloudy throne far above the earth and not in the flowers or waters we approach those visible things with a theory that they are dead governed by physical laws and so forth but coming to them we find the theory fail that they are not dead that say what we choose about them the instinctive sense of their being alive is too strong for us and in scorn of all physical law the wilful fountain sings and the kindly flowers rejoice and then puzzled and yet happy pleased and yet ashamed of being so accepting sympathy from nature which we do not believe it gives and giving sympathy to nature which we do not believe it receivesmixing besides all manner of purposeful play and conceit with these involuntary fellowshipswe fall necessarily into the curious web of hesitating sentiment pathetic fallacy and wandering fancy which form a great part of our modern view of nature but the greek never removed his god out of nature at all never attempted for a moment to contradict his instinctive sense that god was everywhere the tree is glad said he i know it is i can cut it down no matter there was a nymph in it the water does sing said he i can dry it up but no matter there was a naiad in it but in thus clearly defining his belief observe he threw it entirely into a human form and gave his faith to nothing but the image of his own humanity what sympathy and fellowship he had were always for the spirit in the stream not for the stream always for the dryad in the wood not for the wood content with this human sympathy he approached the actual waves and woody fibres with no sympathy at all the spirit that ruled them he received as a plain fact them also ruled and material he received as plain facts they without their spirit were dead enough a rose was good for scent and a stream for sound and coolness for the rest one was no more than leaves the other no more than water he could not make anything else of them and the divine power which was involved in their existence having been all distilled away by him into an independent flora or thetis the poor leaves or waves were left in mere cold corporealness to make the most of their being discernibly red and soft clear and wet and unacknowledged in any other power whatsoever  then observe farther the greeks lived in the midst of the most beautiful nature and were as familiar with blue sea clear air and sweet outlines of mountain as we are with brick walls black smoke and level fields this perfect familiarity rendered all such scenes of natural beauty unexciting if not indifferent to them by lulling and overwearying the imagination as far as it was concerned with such things but there was another kind of beauty which they found it required effort to obtain and which when thoroughly obtained seemed more glorious than any of this wild lovelinessthe beauty of the human countenance and form this they perceived could only be reached by continual exercise of virtue and it was in heavens sight and theirs all the more beautiful because it needed this selfdenial to obtain it so they set themselves to reach this and having gained it gave it their principal thoughts and set it off with beautiful dress as best they might but making this their object they were obliged to pass their lives in simple exercise and disciplined employments living wholesomely giving themselves no fever fits either by fasting or overeating constantly in the open air and full of animal spirit and physical power they became incapable of every morbid condition of mental emotion unhappy love disappointed ambition spiritual despondency or any other disturbing sensation had little power over the wellbraced nerves and healthy flow of the blood and what bitterness might yet fasten on them was soon boxed or raced out of a boy and spun or woven out of a girl or danced out of both they had indeed their sorrows true and deep but still more like childrens sorrows than ours whether bursting into open cry of pain or hid with shuddering under the veil still passing over the soul as clouds do over heaven not sullying it not mingling with itdarkening it perhaps long or utterly but still not becoming one with it and for the most part passing away in dashing rain of tears and leaving the man unchanged in no wise affecting as our sorrow does the whole tone of his thought and imagination thenceforward  how far our melancholy may be deeper and wider than theirs in its roots and view and therefore nobler we shall consider presently but at all events they had the advantage of us in being entirely free from all those dim and feverish sensations which result from unhealthy state of the body i believe that a large amount of the dreamy and sentimental sadness tendency to reverie and general patheticalness of modern life results merely from derangement of stomach holding to the greek life the same relation that the feverish night of an adult does to a childs sleep  farther the human beauty which whether in its bodily being or in imagined divinity had become for the reasons we have seen the principal object of culture and sympathy to these greeks was in its perfection eminently orderly symmetrical and tender hence contemplating it constantly in this state they could not but feel a proportionate fear of all that was disorderly unbalanced and rugged having trained their stoutest soldiers into a strength so delicate and lovely that their white flesh with their blood upon it should look like ivory stained with purple86 and having always around them in the motion and majesty of this beauty enough for the full employment of their imagination they shrank with dread or hatred from all the ruggedness of lower naturefrom the wrinkled forest bark the jagged hillcrest and irregular inorganic storm of sky looking to these for the most part as adverse powers and taking pleasure only in such portions of the lower world as were at once conducive to the rest and health of the human frame and in harmony with the laws of its gentler beauty  thus as far as i recollect without a single exception every homeric landscape intended to be beautiful is composed of a fountain a meadow and a shady grove this ideal is very interestingly marked as intended for a perfect one in the fifth book of the odyssey when mercury himself stops for a moment though on a message to look at a landscape which even an immortal might be gladdened to behold87 this landscape consists of a cave covered with a running vine all blooming into grapes and surrounded by a grove of alder poplar and sweetsmelling cypress four fountains of white foaming water springing in succession mark the orderliness and close to one another flow away in different directions through a meadow full of violets and parsley parsley to mark its moisture being elsewhere called marshnourished and associated with the lotus88 the air is perfumed not only by these violets and by the sweet cypress but by calypsos fire of finely chopped cedarwood which sends a smoke as of incense through the island calypso herself is singing and finally upon the trees are resting or roosting owls hawks and longtongued seacrows whether these last are considered as a part of the ideal landscape as marine singing birds i know not but the approval of mercury appears to be elicited chiefly by the fountains and violet meadow  now the notable things in this description are first the evident subservience of the whole landscape to human comfort to the foot the taste or the smell and secondly that throughout the passage there is not a single figurative word expressive of the things being in any wise other than plain grass fruit or flower i have used the term spring of the fountains because without doubt homer means that they sprang forth brightly having their source at the foot of the rocks as copious fountains nearly always have but homer does not say spring he says simply flow and uses only one word for growing softly or richly of the tall trees the vine and the violets there is however some expression of sympathy with the seabirds he speaks of them in precisely the same terms as in other places of naval nations saying they have care of the works of the sea  if we glance through the references to pleasant landscape which occur in other parts of the odyssey we shall always be struck by this quiet subjection of their every feature to human service and by the excessive similarity in the scenes perhaps the spot intended after this to be most perfect may be the garden of alcinous where the principal ideas are still more definitely order symmetry and fruitfulness89 the beds being duly ranged between rows of vines which as well as the pear apple and fig trees bear fruit continually some grapes being yet sour while others are getting black there are plenty of orderly square beds of herbs chiefly leeks and two fountains one running through the garden and one under the pavement of the palace to a reservoir for the citizens ulysses pausing to contemplate this scene is described nearly in the same terms as mercury pausing to contemplate the wilder meadow and it is interesting to observe that in spite of all homers love of symmetry the gods admiration is excited by the free fountains wild violets and wandering vine but the mortals by the vines in rows the leeks in beds and the fountains in pipes  ulysses has however one touching reason for loving vines in rows his father had given him fifty rows for himself when he was a boy with corn between them just as it now grows in italy proving his identity afterwards to his father whom he finds at work in his garden with thick gloves on to keep his hands from the thorns he reminds him of these fifty rows of vines and of the thirteen peartrees and ten appletrees which he had given him and laertes faints upon his neck90  if ulysses had not been so much of a gardener it might have been received as a sign of considerable feeling for landscape beauty that intending to pay the very highest possible compliment to the princess nausicaa and having indeed the moment before gravely asked her whether she was a goddess or not he says that he feels at seeing her exactly as he did when he saw the young palm tree growing at apollos shrine at delos91 but i think the taste for trim hedges and upright trunks has its usual influence over him here also and that he merely means to tell the princess that she is delightfully tall and straight  the princess is however pleased by his address and tells him to wait outside the town till she can speak to her father about him the spot to which she directs him is another ideal piece of landscape composed of a beautiful grove of aspen poplars a fountain and a meadow92 near the roadside in fact as nearly as possible such a scene as meets the eye of the traveller every instant on the muchdespised lines of road through lowland france for instance on the railway between arras and amiensscenes to my mind quite exquisite in the various grouping and grace of their innumerable poplar avenues casting sweet tremulous shadows over their level meadows and labyrinthine streams we know that the princess means aspen poplars because soon afterwards we find her fifty maidservants at the palace all spinning and in perpetual motion compared to the leaves of the tall poplar and it is with exquisite feeling that it is made afterwards93 the chief tree in the groves of proserpine its light and quivering leafage having exactly the melancholy expression of fragility faintness and inconstancy which the ancients attributed to the disembodied spirit94 the likeness to the poplars by the streams of amiens is more marked still in the iliad where the young simois struck by ajax falls to the earth like an aspen that has grown in an irrigated meadow smoothtrunked the soft shoots springing from its top which some coachmaking man has cut down with his keen iron that he may fit a wheel of it to a fair chariot and it lies parching by the side of the stream95 it is sufficiently notable that homer living in mountainous and rocky countries dwells thus delightedly on all the flat bits and so i think invariably the inhabitants of mountain countries do but the inhabitants of the plains do not in any similar way dwell delightedly on mountains the dutch painters are perfectly contented with their flat fields and pollards96 rubens though he had seen the alps usually composes his landscapes of a hayfield or two plenty of pollards and willows a distant spire a dutch house with a moat about it a windmill and a ditch the flemish sacred painters are the only ones who introduce mountains in the distance as we shall see presently but rather in a formal way than with any appearance of enjoyment so shakspere never speaks of mountains with the slightest joy but only of lowland flowers flat fields and warwickshire streams and if we talk to the mountaineer he will usually characterize his own country to us as a pays affreux or in some equivalent perhaps even more violent german term but the lowland peasant does not think his country frightful he either will have no ideas beyond it or about it or will think it a very perfect country and be apt to regard any deviation from its general principle of flatness with extreme disfavour as the lincolnshire farmer in alton locke ill shaw ee someat like a field o beans i woolnone o this here darned ups and downs o hills to shake a bodys victuals out of his inwardsall so vlat as a barns vloor for vorty mile on endtheres the country to live in97  i do not say whether this be altogether right though certainly not wholly wrong but it seems to me that there must be in the simple freshness and fruitfulness of level land in its pale upright trees and gentle lapse of silent streams enough for the satisfaction of the human mind in general and i so far agree with homer that if i had to educate an artist to the full perception of the meaning of the word gracefulness in landscape i should send him neither to italy nor to greece but simply to those poplar groves between arras and amiens  but to return more definitely to our homeric landscape when it is perfect we have as in the above instances the foliage and meadows together when imperfect it is always either the foliage or the meadow preeminently the meadow or arable field thus meadows of asphodel are prepared for the happier dead and even orion a hunter among the mountains in his lifetime pursues the ghosts of beasts in these asphodel meadows after death98 so the sirens sing in a meadow 99 and throughout the odyssey there is a general tendency to the depreciation of poor ithaca because it is rocky and only fit for goats and has no meadows100 for which reason telemachus refuses atridess present of horses congratulating the spartan king at the same time on ruling over a plain which has plenty of lotus in it and rushes with corn and barley note this constant dwelling on the marsh plants or at least those which grow in flat and wellirrigated land or beside streams when scamander for instance is restrained by vulcan homer says very sorrowfully that all his lotus and reeds and rushes were burnt101 and thus ulysses after being shipwrecked and nearly drowned and beaten about the sea for many days and nights on raft and mast at last getting ashore at the mouth of a large river casts himself down first upon its rushes and then in thankfulness kisses the corngiving land as most opposed in his heart to the fruitless and devouring sea102  in this same passage also we find some peculiar expressions of the delight which the greeks had in trees for when ulysses first comes in sight of land which gladdens him as the reviving of a father from his sickness gladdens his children it is not merely the sight of the land itself which gives him such pleasure but of the land and wood homer never throws away any words at least in such a place as this and what in another poet would have been merely the filling up of the deficient line with an otherwise useless word is in him the expression of the general greek sense that land of any kind was in no wise grateful or acceptable till there was wood upon it or corn but the corn in the flats could not be seen so far as the black masses of forest on the hill sides and that as in being rushy and corngiving the low land so in being woody the high land was most grateful to the mind of the man who for days and nights had been wearied on the engulphing sea and this general idea of wood and corn as the types of the fatness of the whole earth is beautifully marked in another place of the odyssey103 where the sailors in a desert island having no flour of corn to offer as a meat offering with their sacrifices take the leaves of the trees and scatter them over the burnt offering instead  but still every expression of the pleasure which ulysses has in this landing and resting contains uninterruptedly the reference to the utility and sensible pleasantness of all things not to their beauty after his first grateful kiss given to the corngrowing land he considers immediately how he is to pass the night for some minutes hesitating whether it will be best to expose himself to the misty chill from the river or run the risk of wild beasts in the wood he decides for the wood and finds in it a bower formed by a sweet and a wild olive tree interlacing their branches orperhaps more accurately translating homers intensely graphic expressionchanging their branches with each other it is very curious how often in an entanglement of wood one supposes the branches to belong to the wrong trees and forming a roof penetrated by neither rain sun nor wind under this bower ulysses collects the vain or frustrate outpouring of the dead leavesanother exquisite expression used elsewhere of useless grief or shedding of tearsand having got enough together makes his bed of them and goes to sleep having covered himself up with them as embers are covered up with ashes104  nothing can possibly be more intensely possessive of the facts than this whole passage the sense of utter deadness and emptiness and frustrate fall in the leaves of dormant life in the human bodythe fire and heroism and strength of it lulled under the dead brown heap as embers under ashes and the knitting of interchanged and close strength of living boughs above but there is not the smallest apparent sense of there being beauty elsewhere than in the human being the wreathed wood is admired simply as being a perfect roof for it the fallen leaves only as being a perfect bed for it and there is literally no more excitement of emotion in homer as he describes them nor does he expect us to be more excited or touched by hearing about them than if he had been telling us how the chambermaid at the bull aired the fourposter and put on two extra blankets  now exactly this same contemplation of subservience to human use makes the greek take some pleasure in rocks when they assume one particular form but one onlythat of a cave they are evidently quite frightful things to him under any other condition and most of all if they are rough and jagged but if smooth looking sculptured like the sides of a ship and forming a cave or shelter for him he begins to think them endurable hence associating the ideas of rich and sheltering wood sea becalmed and made useful as a port by protecting promontories of rock and smoothed caves or grottoes in the rocks themselves we get the pleasantest idea which the greek could form of a landscape next to a marsh with poplars in it not indeed if possible ever to be without these last thus in commending the cyclops country as one possessed of every perfection homer erst says they have soft marshy meadows near the sea and good rich crumbling ploughingland giving fine deep crops and vines always giving fruit then a port so quiet that they have no need of cables in it and at the head of the port a beautiful clear spring just under a cave and aspen poplars all round it105  this it will be seen is very nearly homers usual ideal but going into the middle of the island ulysses comes on a rougher and less agreeable bit though still fulfilling certain required conditions of endurableness a cave shaded with laurels106 which having no poplars about it is however meant to be somewhat frightful and only fit to be inhabited by a cyclops so in the country of the læstrygons homer preparing his reader gradually for something very disagreeable represents the rocks as bare and exposed to the sun107 only with some smooth and slippery roads over them by which the trucks bring down wood from the higher hills any one familiar with swiss slopes of hills must remember how often he has descended sometimes faster than was altogether intentional by these same slippery woodmans truck roads  and thus in general whenever the landscape is intended to be lovely it verges towards the ploughed lands and poplars or at worst to woody rocks but if intended to be painful the rocks are bare and sharp this last epithet constantly used by homer for mountains does not altogether correspond in greek to the english term nor is it intended merely to characterize the sharp mountain summits for it never would be applied simply to the edge or point of a sword but signifies rather harsh bitter or painful being applied habitually to fate death and in odyssey xi 333 to a halter and as expressive of general objectionableness and unpleasantness to all high dangerous or peaked mountains as the maleian promontory a muchdreaded one the crest of parnassus the tereian mountain and a grim or untoward though by keeping off the force of the sea protective rock at the mouth of the jardanus as well as habitually to inaccessible or impregnable fortresses built on heights  in all this i cannot too strongly mark the utter absence of any trace of the feeling for what we call the picturesque and the constant dwelling of the writers mind on what was available pleasant or useful his ideas respecting all landscape being not uncharacteristially summed finally by pallas herself when meeting ulysses who after his long wandering does not recognize his own country and meaning to describe it as politely and soothingly as possible she says108this ithaca of ours is indeed a rough country enough and not good for driving in but still things might be worse it has plenty of corn and good wine and always rain and soft nourishing dew and it has good feeding for goats and oxen and all manner of wood and springs fit to drink at all the year round  we shall see presently how the blundering pseudopicturesque pseudoclassical minds of claude and the renaissance landscapepainters wholly missing homers practical common sense and equally incapable of feeling the quiet natural grace and sweetness of his asphodel meadows tender aspen poplars or running vinesfastened on his ports and caves as the only available features of his scenery and appointed the type of classical landscape thenceforward to consist in a bay of insipid sea and a rock with a hole through it109  it may indeed be thought that i am assuming too hastily that this was the general view of the greeks respecting landscape because it was homers but i believe the true mind of a nation at any period is always best ascertainable by examining that of its greatest men and that simpler and truer results will be attainable for us by simply comparing homer dante and walter scott than by attempting what my limits must have rendered absurdly inadequate and in which also both my time and knowledge must have failed me an analysis of the landscape in the range of contemporary literature all that i can do is to state the general impression which has been made upon me by my desultory reading and to mark accurately the grounds for this impression in the works of the greatest men now it is quite true that in others of the greeks especially in Æschylus and aristophanes there is infinitely more of modern feeling of pathetic fallacy love of picturesque or beautiful form and other such elements than there is in homer but then these appear to me just the parts of them which were not greek the elements of their minds by which as one division of the human race always must be with subsequent ones they are connected with the mediævals and moderns and without doubt in his influence over future mankind homer is eminently the greek of greeks if i were to associate any one with him it would be herodotus and i believe all i have said of the homeric landscape will be found equally true of the herodotean as assuredly it will be of the platonicthe contempt which plato sometimes expresses by the mouth of socrates for the country in general except so far as it is shady and has cicadas and running streams to make pleasant noises in it being almost ludicrous but homer is the great type and the more notable one because of his influence on virgil and through him on dante and all the after ages and in like manner if we can get the abstract of mediæval landscape out of dante it will serve us as well as if we had read all the songs of the troubadours and help us to the farther changes in derivative temper down to all modern time  i think therefore the reader may safely accept the conclusions about greek landscape which i have got for him out of homer and in these he will certainly perceive something very different from the usual imaginations we form of greek feelings we think of the greeks as poetical ideal imaginative in the way that a modern poet or novelist is supposing that their thoughts about their mythology and world were as visionary and artificial as ours are but i think the passages i have quoted show that it was not so although it may be difficult for us to apprehend the strange minglings in them of the elements of faith which in our days have been blended with other parts of human nature in a totally different guise perhaps the greek mind may be best imagined by taking as its groundwork that of a good conscientious but illiterate scotch presbyterian border farmer of a century or two back having perfect faith in the bodily appearances of satan and his imps and in all kelpies brownies and fairies substitute for the indignant terrors in this mans mind a general persuasion of the divinity more or less beneficent yet faultful of all these beings that is to say take away his belief in the demoniacal malignity of the fallen spiritual world and lower in the same degree his conceptions of the angelical retaining for him the same firm faith in both keep his ideas about flowers and beautiful scenery much as they arehis delight in regular ploughed land and meadows and a neat garden only with rows of gooseberry bushes instead of vines being in all probability about accurately representative of the feelings of ulysses then let the military spirit that is in him glowing against the border forager or the foe of old flodden and chevychase110 be made more principal with a higher sense of nobleness in soldiership not as a careless excitement but a knightly duty and increased by high cultivation of every personal quality not of mere shaggy strength but graceful strength aided by a softer climate and educated in all proper harmony of sight and sound finally instead of an informed christian suppose him to have only the patriarchal jewish knowledge of the deity and even this obscured by tradition but still thoroughly solemn and faithful requiring his continual service as a priest of burnt sacrifice and meat offering and i think we shall get a pretty close approximation to the vital being of a true old greek some slight difference still existing in a feeling which the scotch farmer would have of a pleasantness in blue hills and running streams wholly wanting in the greek mind and perhaps also some difference of views on the subjects of truth and honesty but the main points the easy athletic strongly logical and argumentative yet fanciful and credulous characters of mind would be very similar in both and the most serious change in the substance of the stuff among the modifications above suggested as necessary to turn the scot into the greek is that effect of softer climate and surrounding luxury inducing the practice of various forms of polished artthe more polished because the practical and realistic tendency of the hellenic mind if my interpretation of it be right would quite prevent it from taking pleasure in any irregularities of form or imitations of the weeds and wildnesses of that mountain nature with which it thought itself born to contend in its utmost refinement of work it sought eminently for orderliness carried the principle of the leeks in squares and fountains in pipes perfectly out in its streets and temples formalized whatever decoration it put into its minor architectural mouldings and reserved its whole heart and power to represent the action of living men or gods though not unconscious meanwhile of      the simple the sincere delight     the habitual scene of hill and dale     the rural herds the vernal gale     the tangled vetches purple bloom     the fragrance of the beans perfume     theirs theirs alone who cultivate the soil     and drink the cup of thirst and eat the bread of toil111     74 endymion 2 349350    75 see p 68    76

we turn our eyes therefore as boldly and as quickly as may be from these serene fields and skies of mediæval art to the most characteristic examples of modern landscape and i believe the first thing that will strike us or that ought to strike us is their cloudiness  out of perfect light and motionless air we find ourselves on a sudden brought under sombre skies and into drifting wind and with fickle sunbeams flashing in our face or utterly drenched with sweep of rain we are reduced to track the changes of the shadows on the grass or watch the rents of twilight through angry cloud and we find that whereas all the pleasure of the mediæval was in stability definiteness and luminousness we are expected to rejoice in darkness and triumph in mutability to lay the foundation of happiness in things which momentarily change or fade and to expect the utmost satisfaction and instruction from what it is impossible to arrest and difficult to comprehend  we find however together with this general delight in breeze and darkness much attention to the real form of clouds and careful drawing of effects of mist so that the appearance of objects as seen through it becomes a subject of science with us and the faithful representation of that appearance is made of primal importance under the name of aërial perspective the aspects of sunset and sunrise with all their attendant phenomena of cloud and mist are watchfully delineated and in ordinary daylight landscape the sky is considered of so much importance that a principal mass of foliage or a whole foreground is unhesitatingly thrown into shade merely to bring out the form of a white cloud so that if a general and characteristic name were needed for modern landscape art none better could be invented than the service of clouds  and this name would unfortunately be characteristic of our art in more ways than one in the last chapter i said that all the greeks spoke kindly about the clouds except aristophanes and he i am sorry to say since his report is so unfavourable is the only greek who had studied them attentively he tells us first that they are great goddesses to idle men then that they are mistresses of disputings and logic and monstrosities and noisy chattering declares that whoso believes in their divinity must first disbelieve in jupiter and place supreme power in the hands of an unknown god whirlwind and finally he displays their influence over the mind of one of their disciples in his sudden desire to speak ingeniously concerning smoke112  there is i fear an infinite truth in this aristophanic judgment applied to our modern cloudworship assuredly much of the love of mystery in our romances our poetry our art and above all in our metaphysics must come under that definition so long ago given by the great greek speaking ingeniously concerning smoke and much of the instinct which partially developed in painting may be now seen throughout every mode of exertion of mindthe easily encouraged doubt easily excited curiosity habitual agitation and delight in the changing and the marvellous as opposed to the old quiet serenity of social custom and religious faithis again deeply defined in those few words the dethroning of jupiter the coronation of the whirlwind  nor of whirlwind merely but also of darkness or ignorance respecting all stable facts that darkening of the foreground to bring out the white cloud is in one aspect of it a type of the subjection of all plain and positive fact to what is uncertain and unintelligible and as we examine farther into the matter we shall be struck by another great difference between the old and modern landscape namely that in the old no one ever thought of drawing anything but as well as he could that might not be well as we have seen in the case of rocks but it was as well as he could and always distinctly leaf or stone or animal or man it was equally drawn with care and clearness and its essential characters shown if it was an oak tree the acorns were drawn if a flint pebble its veins were drawn if an arm of the sea its fish were drawn if a group of figures their faces and dresses were drawnto the very last subtlety of expression and end of thread that could be got into the space far off or near but now our ingenuity is all concerning smoke nothing is truly drawn but that all else is vague slight imperfect got with as little pains as possible you examine your closest foreground and find no leaves your largest oak and find no acorns your human figure and find a spot of red paint instead of a face and in all this again and again the aristophanic words come true and the clouds seem to be great goddesses to idle men  the next thing that will strike us after this love of clouds is the love of liberty whereas the mediæval was always shutting himself into castles and behind fosses and drawing brickwork neatly and beds of flowers primly our painters delight in getting to the open fields and moors abhor all hedges and moats never paint anything but freegrowing trees and rivers gliding at their own sweet will eschew formality down to the smallest detail break and displace the brickwork which the mediæval would have carefully cemented leave unpruned the thickets he would have delicately trimmed and carrying the love of liberty even to license and the love of wildness even to ruin take pleasure at last in every aspect of age and desolation which emancipates the objects of nature from the government of menon the castle wall displacing its tapestry with ivy and spreading through the garden the bramble for the rose  connected with this love of liberty we find a singular manifestation of love of mountains and see our painters traversing the wildest places of the globe in order to obtain subjects with craggy foregrounds and purple distances some few of them remain content with pollards and flat land but these are always men of thirdrate order and the leading masters while they do not reject the beauty of the low grounds reserve their highest powers to paint alpine peaks or italian promontories and it is eminently noticeable also that this pleasure in the mountains is never mingled with fear or tempered by a spirit of meditation as with the mediæval but it is always free and fearless brightly exhilarating and wholly unreflective so that the painter feels that his mountain foreground may be more consistently animated by a sportsman than a hermit and our modern society in general goes to the mountains not to fast but to feast and leaves their glaciers covered with chickenbones and eggshells  connected with this want of any sense of solemnity in mountain scenery is a general profanity of temper in regarding all the rest of nature that is to say a total absence of faith in the presence of any deity therein whereas the mediæval never painted a cloud but with the purpose of placing an angel in it and a greek never entered a wood without expecting to meet a god in it we should think the appearance of an angel in the cloud wholly unnatural and should be seriously surprised by meeting a god anywhere our chief ideas about the wood are connected with poaching we have no belief that the clouds contain more than so many inches of rain or hail and from our ponds and ditches expect nothing more divine than ducks and watercresses  finally connected with this profanity of temper is a strong tendency to deny the sacred element of colour and make our boast in blackness for though occasionally glaring or violent modern colour is on the whole eminently sombre tending continually to grey or brown and by many of our best painters consistently falsified with a confessed pride in what they call chaste or subdued tints so that whereas a mediæval paints his sky bright blue and his foreground bright green gilds the towers of his castles and clothes his figures with purple and white we paint our sky grey our foreground black and our foliage brown and think that enough is sacrificed to the sun in admitting the dangerous brightness of a scarlet cloak or a blue jacket  these i believe are the principal points which would strike us instantly if we were to be brought suddenly into an exhibition of modern landscapes out of a room filled with mediæval work it is evident that there are both evil and good in this change but how much evil or how much good we can only estimate by considering as in the former divisions of our inquiry what are the real roots of the habits of mind which have caused them  and first it is evident that the title dark ages given to the mediæval centuries is respecting art wholly inapplicable they were on the contrary the bright ages ours are the dark ones i do not mean metaphysically but literally they were the ages of gold ours are the ages of umber  this is partly mere mistake in us we build brown brick walls and wear brown coats because we have been blunderingly taught to do so and go on doing so mechanically there is however also some cause for the change in our own tempers on the whole these are much sadder ages than the early ones not sadder in a noble and deep way but in a dim wearied waythe way of ennui and jaded intellect and uncomfortableness of soul and body the middle ages had their wars and agonies but also intense delights their gold was dashed with blood but ours is sprinkled with dust their life was inwoven with white and purple ours is one seamless stuff of brown not that we are without apparent festivity but festivity more or less forced mistaken embittered incompletenot of the heart how wonderfully since shaksperes time have we lost the power of laughing at bad jests the very finish of our wit belies our gaiety  the profoundest reason of this darkness of heart is i believe our want of faith there never yet was a generation of men savage or civilized who taken as a body so wofully fulfilled the words having no hope and without god in the world113 as the present civilized european race a red indian or otaheitan savage has more sense of a divine existence round him or government over him than the plurality of refined londoners and parisians and those among us who may in some sense be said to believe are divided almost without exception into two broad classes romanist and puritan who but for the interference of the unbelieving portions of society would either of them reduce the other sect as speedily as possible to ashes the romanist having always done so whenever he could from the beginning of their separation and the puritan at this time holding himself in complacent expectation of the destruction of rome by volcanic fire such division as this between persons nominally of one religion that is to say believing in the same god and the same revelation cannot but become a stumblingblock of the gravest kind to all thoughtful and farsighted mena stumblingblock which they can only surmount under the most favourable circumstances of early education hence nearly all our powerful men in this age of the world are unbelievers the best of them in doubt and misery the worst in reckless defiance the plurality in plodding hesitation doing as well as they can what practical work lies ready to their hands most of our scientific men are in this last class our popular authors either set themselves definitely against all religious form pleading for simple truth and benevolence thackeray dickens or give themselves up to bitter and fruitless statement of facts de balzac or surfacepainting scott or careless blasphemy sad or smiling byron béranger our earnest poets and deepest thinkers are doubtful and indignant tennyson carlyle one or two anchored indeed but anxious or weeping wordsworth mrs browning and of these two the first is not so sure of his anchor but that now and then it drags with him even to make him cry out                    great god i had rather be     a pagan suckled in some creed outworn       so might i standing on this pleasant lea     have glimpses that would make me less forlorn114  in politics religion is now a name in art a hypocrisy or affectation over german religious pictures the inscription see how pious i am can be read at a glance by any clearsighted person over french and english religious pictures the inscription see how impious i am is equally legible all sincere and modest art is among us profane115  this faithlessness operates among us according to our tempers producing either sadness or levity and being the ultimate root alike of our discontents and of our wantonnesses it is marvellous how full of contradiction it makes us we are first dull and seek for wild and lonely places because we have no heart for the garden presently we recover our spirits and build an assembly room among the mountains because we have no reverence for the desert i do not know if there be game on sinai but i am always expecting to hear of some ones shooting over it  there is however another and a more innocent root of our delight in wild scenery  all the renaissance principles of art tended as i have before often explained to the setting beauty above truth and seeking for it always at the expense of truth and the proper punishment of such pursuitthe punishment which all the laws of the universe rendered inevitablewas that those who thus pursued beauty should wholly lose sight of beauty all the thinkers of the age as we saw previously declared that it did not exist the age seconded their efforts and banished beauty so far as human effort could succeed in doing so from the face of the earth and the form of man to powder the hair to patch the cheek to hoop the body to buckle the foot were all part and parcel of the same system which reduced streets to brick walls and pictures to brown stains one desert of ugliness was extended before the eyes of mankind and their pursuit of the beautiful so recklessly continued received unexpected consummation in highheeled shoes and periwigsgower street and gaspar poussin116  reaction from this state was inevitable if any true life was left in the races of mankind and accordingly though still forced by rule and fashion to the producing and wearing all that is ugly men steal out halfashamed of themselves for doing so to the fields and mountains and finding among these the colour and liberty and variety and power which are for ever grateful to them delight in these to an extent never before known rejoice in all the wildest shattering of the mountain side as an opposition to gower street gaze in a rapt manner at sunsets and sunrises to see there the blue and gold and purple which glow for them no longer on knights armour or temple porch and gather with care out of the fields into their blotted herbaria the flowers which the five orders of architecture have banished from their doors and casements  the absence of care for personal beauty which is another great characteristic of the age adds to this feeling in a twofold way first by turning all reverent thoughts away from human nature and making us think of men as ridiculous or ugly creatures getting through the world as well as they can and spoiling it in doing so not ruling it in a kingly way and crowning all its loveliness in the middle ages hardly anything but vice could be caricatured because virtue was always visibly and personally noble now virtue itself is apt to inhabit such poor human bodies that no aspect of it is invulnerable to jest and for all fairness we have to seek to the flowers for all sublimity to the hills  the same want of care operates in another way by lowering the standard of health increasing the susceptibility to nervous or sentimental impressions and thus adding to the other powers of nature over us whatever charm may be felt in her fostering the melancholy fancies of brooding idleness  it is not however only to existing inanimate nature that our want of beauty in person and dress has driven us the imagination of it as it was seen in our ancestors haunts us continually and while we yield to the present fashions or act in accordance with the dullest modern principles of economy and utility we look fondly back to the manners of the ages of chivalry and delight in painting to the fancy the fashions we pretend to despise and the splendours we think it wise to abandon the furniture and personages of our romance are sought when the writer desires to please most easily in the centuries which we profess to have surpassed in everything the art which takes us into the present times is considered as both daring and degraded and while the weakest words please us and are regarded as poetry which recall the manners of our forefathers or of strangers it is only as familiar and vulgar that we accept the description of our own  in this we are wholly different from all the races that preceded us all other nations have regarded their ancestors with reverence as saints or heroes but have nevertheless thought their own deeds and ways of life the fitting subjects for their arts of painting or of verse we on the contrary regard our ancestors as foolish and wicked but yet find our chief artistic pleasures in descriptions of their ways of life  the greeks and mediævals honoured but did not imitate their forefathers we imitate but do not honour  with this romantic love of beauty forced to seek in history and in external nature the satisfaction it cannot find in ordinary life we mingle a more rational passion the due and just result of newly awakened powers of attention whatever may first lead us to the scrutiny of natural objects that scrutiny never fails of its reward unquestionably they are intended to be regarded by us with both reverence and delight and every hour we give to them renders their beauty more apparent and their interest more engrossing natural sciencewhich can hardly be considered to have existed before modern timesrendering our knowledge fruitful in accumulation and exquisite in accuracy has acted for good or evil according to the temper of the mind which received it and though it has hardened the faithlessness of the dull and proud has shown new grounds for reverence to hearts which were thoughtful and humble the neglect of the art of war while it has somewhat weakened and deformed the body117 has given us leisure and opportunity for studies to which before time and space were equally wanting lives which once were early wasted on the battlefield are now passed usefully in the study nations which exhausted themselves in annual warfare now dispute with each other the discovery of new planets and the serene philosopher dissects the plants and analyzes the dust of lands which were of old only traversed by the knight in hasty march or by the borderer in heedless rapine  the elements of progress and decline being thus strangely mingled in the modern mind we might beforehand anticipate that one of the notable characters of our art would be its inconsistency that efforts would be made in every direction and arrested by every conceivable cause and manner of failure that in all we did it would become next to impossible to distinguish accurately the grounds for praise or for regret that all previous canons of practice and methods of thought would be gradually overthrown and criticism continually defied by successes which no one had expected and sentiments which no one could define  accordingly while in our inquiries into greek and mediæval art i was able to describe in general terms what all men did or felt i find now many characters in many men some it seems to me founded on the inferior and evanescent principles of modernism on its recklessness impatience or faithlessness others founded on its science its new affection for nature its love of openness and liberty and among all these characters good or evil i see that some remaining to us from old or transitional periods do not properly belong to us and will soon fade away and others though not yet distinctly developed are yet properly our own and likely to grow forward into greater strength  for instance our reprobation of bright colour is i think for the most part mere affectation and must soon be done away with vulgarity dulness or impiety will indeed always express themselves through art in brown and grey as in rembrandt caravaggio and salvator but we are not wholly vulgar dull or impious nor as moderns are we necessarily obliged to continue so in any wise our greatest men whether sad or gay still delight like the great men of all ages in brilliant hues the colouring of scott and byron is full and pure that of keats and tennyson rich even to excess our practical failures in colouring are merely the necessary consequences of our prolonged want of practice during the periods of renaissance affectation and ignorance and the only durable difference between old and modern colouring is the acceptance of certain hues by the modern which please him by expressing that melancholy peculiar to his more reflective or sentimental character and the greater variety of them necessary to express his greater science  again if we ever become wise enough to dress consistently and gracefully to make health a principal object in education and to render our streets beautiful with art the external charm of past history will in great measure disappear there is no essential reason because we live after the fatal seventeenth century that we should never again be able to confess interest in sculpture or see brightness in embroidery nor because now we choose to make the night deadly with our pleasures and the day with our labours prolonging the dance till dawn and the toil to twilight that we should never again learn how rightly to employ the sacred trusts of strength beauty and time whatever external charm attaches itself to the past would then be seen in proper subordination to the brightness of present life and the elements of romance would exist in the earlier ages only in the attraction which must generally belong to whatever is unfamiliar in the reverence which a noble nation always pays to its ancestors and in the enchanted light which races like individuals must perceive in looking back to the days of their childhood  again the peculiar levity with which natural scenery is regarded by a large number of modern minds cannot be considered as entirely characteristic of the age inasmuch as it never can belong to its greatest intellects men of any high mental power must be serious whether in ancient or modern days a certain degree of reverence for fair scenery is found in all our great writers without exceptioneven the one who has made us laugh oftenest taking us to the valley of chamouni and to the sea beach there to give peace after suffering and change revenge into pity118 it is only the dull the uneducated or the worldly whom it is painful to meet on the hillsides and levity as a ruling character cannot be ascribed to the whole nation but only to its holidaymaking apprentices and its house of commons  we need not therefore expect to find any single poet or painter representing the entire group of powers weaknesses and inconsistent instincts which govern or confuse our modern life but we may expect that in the man who seems to be given by providence as the type of the age as homer and dante were given as the types of classical and mediæval mind we shall find whatever is fruitful and substantial to be completely present together with those of our weaknesses which are indeed nationally characteristic and compatible with general greatness of mind just as the weak love of fences and dislike of mountains were found compatible with dantes greatness in other respects  farther as the admiration of mankind is found in our times to have in great part passed from men to mountains and from human emotion to natural phenomena we may anticipate that the great strength of art will also be warped in this direction with this notable result for us that whereas the greatest painters or painter of classical and mediæval periods being wholly devoted to the representation of humanity furnished us with but little to examine in landscape the greatest painters or painter of modern times will in all probability be devoted to landscape principally and farther because in representing human emotion words surpass painting but in representing natural scenery painting surpasses words we may anticipate also that the painter and poet for convenience sake i here use the words in opposition will somewhat change their relations of rank in illustrating the mind of the age that the painter will become of more importance the poet of less and that the relations between the men who are the types and firstfruits of the age in word and worknamely scott and turnerwill be in many curious respects different from those between homer and phidias or dante and giotto119     112 clouds 316318 380 ff 320321    113 ephesians ii 12    114 wordsworths the world is too much with us    115 preraphaelitism of course

onfair searching eyes of youth what a world of mighty life from those mountain roots to the shoreof loveliest life when he went down yet so young to the marble cityand became himself as a fiery heart to it  a city of marble did i say nay rather a golden city paved with emerald for truly every pinnacle and turret glanced or glowed overlaid with gold or bossed with jasper beneath the unsullied sea drew in deep breathing to and fro its eddies of green wave deephearted majestic terrible as the seathe men of venice moved in sway of power and war pure as her pillars of alabaster stood her mothers and maidens from foot to brow all noble walked her knights the low bronzed gleaming of searusted armour shot angrily under their bloodred mantlefolds fearless faithful patient impenetrable implacableevery word a fatesate her senate in hope and honour lulled by flowing of wave around their isles of sacred sand each with his name written and the cross graved at his side lay her dead a wonderful piece of world rather itself a world it lay along the face of the waters no larger as its captains saw it from their masts at evening than a bar of sunset that could not pass away but for its power it must have seemed to them as if they were sailing in the expanse of heaven and this a great planet whose orient edge widened through ether a world from which all ignoble care and petty thoughts were banished with all the common and poor elements of life no foulness nor tumult in those tremulous streets that filled or fell beneath the moon but rippled music of majestic change or thrilling silence no weak walls could rise above them no lowroofed cottage nor strawbuilt shed only the strength as of rock and the finished setting of stones most precious and around them far as the eye could reach still the soft moving of stainless waters proudly pure as not the flower so neither the thorn nor the thistle could grow in the glancing fields ethereal strength of alps dreamlike

balm from the south and the stars of the evening and morning clear in the limitless light of arched heaven and circling sea  such was giorgiones schoolsuch titians home  near the southwest corner of covent garden a square brick pit or well is formed by a closeset block of houses to the back windows of which it admits a few rays of light access to the bottom of it is obtained out of maiden lane through a low archway and an iron gate and if you stand long enough under the archway to accustom your eyes to the darkness you may see on the left hand a narrow door which formerly gave quiet access to a respectable barbers shop of which the front window looking into maiden lane is still extant filled in this year 1860 with a row of bottles connected in some defunct manner with a brewers business a more fashionable neighbourhood it is said eighty years ago than nownever certainly a cheerful onewherein a boy being born on st georges day 1775 began soon after to take interest in the world of covent garden and put to service such spectacles of life as it afforded  no knights to be seen there nor i imagine many beautiful ladies their costume at least disadvantageous depending much on incumbency of hat and feather and short waists the majesty of men founded similarly on shoebuckles and wigsimpressive enough when reynolds will do his best for it but not suggestive of much ideal delight to a boy  bello ovile dov io dormii agnello121 of things beautiful besides men and women dusty sunbeams up or down the street on summer mornings deep furrowed cabbageleaves at the greengrocers magnificence of oranges in wheelbarrows round the corner and thames shore within three minutes race  none of these things very glorious the best however that england it seems was then able to provide for a boy of gift who such as they are loves themnever indeed forgets them the short waists modify to the last his visions of greek ideal his foregrounds had always a succulent cluster or two of greengrocery at the corners enchanted oranges gleam in covent gardens of the hesperides and great ships go to pieces in order to scatter chests of them on the waves122 that mist of early sunbeams in the london dawn crosses many and many a time the clearness of italian air and by thames shore with its stranded barges and glidings of red sail dearer to us than lucerne lake or venetian lagoonby thames shore we will die  with such circumstance round him in youth let us note what necessary effects followed upon the boy i assume him to have had giorgiones sensibility and more than giorgiones if that be possible to colour and form i tell you farther and this fact you may receive trustfully that his sensibility to human affection and distress was no less keen than even his sense for natural beautyheartsight deep as eyesight  consequently he attaches himself with the faithfullest childlove to everything that bears an image of the place he was born in no matter how ugly it ishas it anything about it like maiden lane or like thames shore if so it shall be painted for their sake hence to the very close of life turner could endure ugliness which no one else of the same sensibility would have borne with for an instant dead brick walls blank square windows old clothes marketwomanly types of humanityanything fishy and muddy like billingsgate or hungerford market had great attraction for him black barges patched sails and every possible condition of fog  you will find these tolerations and affections guiding or sustaining him to the last hour of his life the notablest of all such endurances being that of dirt no venetian ever draws anything foul but turner devoted picture after picture to the illustration of effects of dinginess smoke soot dust and dusty texture old sides of boats weedy roadside vegetation dunghills strawyards and all the soilings and stains of every common labour  and more than this he not only could endure but enjoyed and looked for litter like covent garden wreck after the market his pictures are often full of it from side to side their foregrounds differ from all others in the natural way that things have of lying about in them even his richest vegetation in ideal work is confused and he delights in shingle debris and heaps of fallen stones the last words he ever spoke to me about a picture were in gentle exultation about his st gothard that litter of stones which i endeavoured to represent  the second great result of this covent garden training was understanding of and regard for the poor whom the venetians we saw despised whom contrarily turner loved and more than lovedunderstood he got no romantic sight of them but an infallible one as he prowled about the end of his lane watching night effects in the wintry streets nor sight of the poor alone but of the poor in direct relations with the rich he knew in good and evil what both classes thought of and how they dwelt with each other  reynolds and gainsborough bred in country villages learned there the country boys reverential theory of the squire and kept it they painted the squire and the squires lady as centres of the movements of the universe to the end of their lives but turner perceived the younger squire in other aspects about his lane occurring prominently in its night scenery as a dark figure or one of two against the moonlight he saw also the working of city commerce from endless warehouse towering over thames to the back shop in the lane with its stale herringshighly interesting these last one of his fathers best friends whom he often afterwards visited affectionately at bristol being a fishmonger and glueboiler which gives us a friendly turn of mind towards herringfishing whaling calais poissardes and many other of our choicest subjects in after life all this being connected with that mysterious forest below london bridge on one sideand on the other with these masses of human power and national wealth which weigh upon us at covent garden here with strange compression and crush us into narrow hand court  that mysterious forest below london bridgebetter for the boy than wood of pine or grove of myrtle how he must have tormented the watermen beseeching them to let him crouch anywhere in the bows quiet as a log so only that he might get floated down there among the ships and round and round the ships and with the ships and by the ships and under the ships staring and clamberingthese the only quite beautiful things he can see in all the world except the sky but these when the sun is on their sails filling or falling endlessly disordered by sway of tide and stress of anchorage beautiful unspeakably which ships also are inhabited by glorious creaturesredfaced sailors with pipes appearing over the gunwales true knights over their castle parapetsthe most angelic beings in the whole compass of london world and trafalgar happening long before we can draw ships we nevertheless coax all current stories out of the wounded sailors do our best at present to show nelsons funeral streaming up the thames and vow that trafalgar shall have its tribute of memory some day which accordingly is accomplishedonce with all our might for its death twice with all our might for its victory thrice in pensive farewell to the old téméraire and with it to that order of things123  now this fond companying with sailors must have divided his time it appears to me pretty equally between covent garden and wapping allowing for incidental excursions to chelsea on one side and greenwich on the other which time he would spend pleasantly but not magnificently being limited in pocketmoney and leading a kind of poorjack life on the river  in some respects no life could be better for a lad but it was not calculated to make his ear fine to the niceties of language nor form his moralities on an entirely regular standard picking up his first scraps of vigorous english chiefly at deptford and in the markets and his first ideas of female tenderness and beauty among nymphs of the barge and the barrowanother boy might perhaps have become what people usually term vulgar but the original make and frame of turners mind being not vulgar but as nearly as possible a combination of the minds of keats and dante joining capricious waywardness and intense openness to every fine pleasure of sense and hot defiance of formal precedent with a quite infinite tenderness generosity and desire of justice and truththis kind of mind did not become vulgar but very tolerant of vulgarity even fond of it in some forms and on the outside visibly infected by it deeply enough the curious result in its combination of elements being to most people wholly incomprehensible it was as if a cable had been woven of bloodcrimson silk and then tarred on the outside people handled it and the tar came off on their hands red gleams were seen through the black underneath at the places where it had been strained was it ochresaid the worldor red lead  schooled thus in manners literature and general moral principles at chelsea and wapping we have finally to inquire concerning the most important point of all we have seen the principal differences between this boy and giorgione as respects sight of the beautiful understanding of poverty of commerce and of order of battle then follows another cause of difference in our trainingnot slightthe aspect of religion namely in the neighbourhood of covent garden i say the aspect for that was all the lad could judge by disposed for the most part to learn chiefly by his eyes in this special matter he finds there is really no other way of learning his father had taught him to lay one penny upon another of mothers teaching we hear of none of parish pastoral teaching the reader may guess how much  i chose giorgione rather than veronese to help me in carrying out this parallel because i do not find in giorgiones work any of the early venetian monarchist element he seems to me to have belonged more to an abstract contemplative school i may be wrong in this it is no mattersuppose it were so and that he came down to venice somewhat recusant or insentient concerning the usual priestly doctrines of his dayhow would the venetian religion from an outer intellectual standingpoint have looked to him  he would have seen it to be a religion indisputably powerful in human affairs often very harmfully so sometimes devouring widows houses124 and consuming the strongest and fairest from among the young freezing into merciless bigotry the policy of the old also on the other hand animating national courage and raising souls otherwise sordid into heroism on the whole always a real and great power served with daily sacrifice of gold time and thought putting forth its claims if hypocritically at least in bold hypocrisy not waiving any atom of them in doubt or fear and assuredly in large measure sincere believing in itself and believed a goodly system moreover in aspect gorgeous harmonious mysteriousa thing which had either to be obeyed or combated but could not be scorned a religion towering over all the citymanybuttressedluminous in marble stateliness as the dome of our lady of safety125 shines over the sea manyvoiced also giving over all the eastern seas to the sentinel his watchword to the soldier his warcry and on the lips of all who died for venice shaping the whisper of death  i suppose the boy turner to have regarded the religion of his city also from an external intellectual standingpoint  what did he see in maiden lane  let not the reader be offended with me i am willing to let him describe at his own pleasure what turner saw there but to me it seems to have been this a religion maintained occasionally even the whole length of the lane at point of constables staff but at other times placed under the custody of the beadle within certain black and unstately iron railings of st pauls covent garden among the wheelbarrows and over the vegetables no perceptible dominance of religion in the narrow disquieted streets none in the tongues deeds daily ways of maiden lane little some honesty indeed and english industry and kindness of heart and general idea of justice but faith of any national kind shut up from one sunday to the next not artistically beautiful even in those sabbatical exhibitions its paraphernalia being chiefly of high pews heavy elocution and cold grimness of behaviour  what chiaroscuro belongs to itdependent mostly on candlelightwe will however draw considerately no goodliness of escutcheon nor other respectability being omitted and the best of their results confessed a meek old woman and a child being let into a pew for whom the reading by candlelight will be beneficial126  for the rest this religion seems to him discreditablediscreditednot believing in itself putting forth its authority in a cowardly way watching how far it might be tolerated continually shrinking disclaiming fencing finessing divided against itself not by stormy rents but by thin fissures and splittings of plaster from the walls not to be either obeyed or combated by an ignorant yet clearsighted youth only to be scorned and scorned not one whit the less though also the dome dedicated to it looms high over distant winding of the thames as st marks campanile rose for goodly landmark over mirage of lagoon for st mark ruled over life the saint of london over death st mark over st marks place but st paul over st pauls churchyard  under these influences pass away the first reflective hours of life with such conclusion as they can reach in consequence of a fit of illness he was takeni cannot ascertain in what year127to live with an aunt at brentford and here i believe received some schooling which he seems to have snatched vigorously getting knowledge at least by translation of the more picturesque classical authors which he turned presently to use as we shall see hence also walks about putney and twickenham in the summer time acquainted him with the look of english meadowground in its restricted states of paddock and park and with some roundheaded appearances of trees and stately entrances to houses of mark the avenue at bushy and the iron gates and carved pillars of hampton128 impressing him apparently with great awe and admiration so that in after life his little country house isof all places in the worldat twickenham of swans and reedy shores he now learns the soft motion and the green mystery in a way not to be forgotten  and at last fortune wills that the lads true life shall begin and one summers evening after various wonderful stagecoach experiences on the north road which gave him a love of stagecoaches ever after he finds himself sitting alone among the yorkshire hills129 for the first time the silence of nature round him her freedom sealed to him her glory opened to him peace at last no roll of cartwheel nor mutter of sullen voices in the back shop but curlewcry in space of heaven and welling of belltoned streamlet by its shadowy rock freedom at last deadwall dark railing fenced field gated garden all passed away like the dream of a prisoner and behold far as foot or eye can race or range the moor and cloud loveliness at last it is here then among these deserted vales not among men those pale povertystruck or cruel facesthat multitudinous marred humanityare not the only things that god has made here is something he has made which no one has marred pride of purple rocks and river pools of blue and tender wilderness of glittering trees and misty lights of evening on immeasurable hills  beauty and freedom and peace and yet another teacher graver than these sound preaching at last here in kirkstall crypt concerning fate and life here where the dark pool reflects the chancel pillars and the cattle lie in unhindered rest the soft sunshine on their dappled bodies instead of priests vestments their white furry hair ruffled a little fitfully by the evening wind deepscented from the meadow thyme  consider deeply the import to him of this his first sight of ruin and compare it with the effect of the architecture that was around giorgione there were indeed aged buildings at venice in his time but none in decay all ruin was removed and its place filled as quickly as in our london but filled always by architecture loftier and more wonderful than that whose place it took the boy himself happy to work upon the walls of it so that the idea of the passing away of the strength of men and beauty of their works never could occur to him sternly brighter and brighter the cities of italy had been rising and broadening on hill and plain for three hundred years he saw only strength and immortality could not but paint both conceived the form of man as deathless calm with power and fiery with life  turner saw the exact reverse of this in the present work of men meanness aimlessness unsightliness thinwalled lathdivided narrowgarreted houses of clay booths of a darksome vanity fair busily base  but on whitby hill and by bolton brook130 remained traces of other handiwork men who could build had been there and who also had wrought not merely for their own days but to what purpose strong faith and steady hands and patient soulscan this then be all you have left this the sum of your doing on the eartha nest whence the nightowl may whimper to the brook and a ribbed skeleton of consumed arches looming above the bleak banks of mist from its cliff to the sea  as the strength of men to giorgione to turner their weakness and vileness were alone visible they themselves unworthy or ephemeral their work despicable or decayed in the venetians eyes all beauty depended on mans presence and pride in turners on the solitude he had left and the humiliation he had suffered  and thus the fate and issue of all his work were determined at once he must be a painter of the strength of nature there was no beauty elsewhere than in that he must paint also the labour and sorrow and passing away of men this was the great human truth visible to him  their labour their sorrow and their death mark the three labour by sea and land in field and city at forge and furnace helm and plough no pastoral indolence nor classic pride shall stand between him and the troubling of the world still less between him and the toil of his countryblind tormented unwearied marvellous england  also their sorrow ruin of all their glorious work passing away of their thoughts and their honour mirage of pleasure fallacy of hope gathering of weed on temple step gaining of wave on deserted strand weeping of the mother for the children desolate by her breathless firstborn in the streets of the city131 desolate by her last sons slain among the beasts of the field132  and their death that old greek question againyet unanswered the unconquerable spectre still flitting among the forest trees at twilight rising ribbed out of the seasandwhite a strange aphroditeout of the seafoam stretching its grey cloven wings among the clouds turning the light of their sunsets into blood this has to be looked upon and in a more terrible shape than ever salvator or dürer saw it133 the wreck of one guilty country does not infer the ruin of all countries and need not cause general terror respecting the laws of the universe neither did the orderly and narrow succession of domestic joy and sorrow in a small german community bring the question in its breadth or in any unresolvable shape before the mind of dürer but the english deaththe european death of the nineteenth centurywas of another range and power more terrible a thousandfold in its merely physical grasp and grief more terrible incalculably in its mystery and shame what were the robbers casual pang or the range of the flying skirmish compared to the work of the axe and the sword and the famine which was done during this mans youth on all the hills and plains of the christian earth from moscow to gibraltar he was eighteen years old when napoleon came down on arcola look on the map of europe and count the bloodstains on it between arcola and waterloo134  not alone those bloodstains on the alpine snow and the blue of the lombard plain the english death was before his eyes also no decent calculable consoled dying no passing to rest like that of the aged burghers of nuremberg town no gentle processions to churchyards among the fields the bronze crests bossed deep on the memorial tablets and the skylark singing above them from among the corn but the life trampled out in the slime of the street crushed to dust amidst the roaring of the wheel tossed countlessly away into howling winter wind along five hundred leagues of rockfanged shore or worst of all rotted down to forgotten graves through years of ignorant patience and vain seeking for help from man for hope in godinfirm imperfect yearning as of motherless infants starving at the dawn oppressed royalties of captive thought vague aguefits of bleak amazed despair  a goodly landscape this for the lad to paint and under a goodly light wide enough the light was and clear no more salvators lurid chasm on jagged horizon nor dürers spotted rest of sunny gleam on hedgerow and field but light over all the world full shone now its awful globe one pallid charnelhousea ball strewn bright with human ashes glaring in poised sway beneath the sun all blindingwhite with death from pole to poledeath not of myriads of poor bodies only but of will and mercy and conscience death not once inflicted on the flesh but daily fastening on the spirit death not silent or patient waiting his appointed hour but voiceful venomous death with the taunting word and burning grasp and infixed sting  put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe135 the word is spoken in our ears continually to other reapers than the angelsto the busy skeletons that never tire for stooping when the measure of iniquity is full and it seems that another day might bring repentance and redemptionput ye in the sickle when the young life has been wasted all away and the eyes are just opening upon the tracks of ruin and faint resolution rising in the heart for nobler thingsput ye in the sickle when the roughest blows of fortune have been borne long and bravely and the hand is just stretched to

pale reapers and pour hemlock for your feast of harvest home  this was the sight which opened on the young eyes this the watchword sounding within the heart of turner in his youth  so taught and prepared for his lifes labour sate the boy at last alone among his fair english hills and began to paint with cautious toil the rocks and fields and trickling brooks and soft white clouds of heaven

entry in ruskins diary about to enter on the true beginning of the second part of my venetian work may god help me to finish itto his glory and mans good the main part of the volume was composed at venice in the winter of 185152 though it did not appear until the end of july 1853 his work on architecture including the seven lamps it will be noted intervenes between the composition of the second and third volumes of modern painters and ruskin himself always looked upon the work as an interlude almost as an interruption but he also came to believe that this digression had really led back to the heart of the truth for all art its main theme as in the seven lamps of architecture is its illustration of the principle that architecture expresses certain states in the moral temper of the people by and for whom it is produced it may surprise us today to know that when ruskin wrote of the glories of venetian architecture the common professional opinion was that st marks and the ducal palace were as ugly and repulsive as they were contrary to rule and order in a private letter gibbon writes of the square of st marks as a large square decorated with the worst architecture i ever saw the architects of his own time regarded ruskins opinions as dictated by wild caprice and almost evincing an unbalanced mind probably the core of all this architectural work is to be found in his chapter on the nature of gothic in the main reproduced in this volume and we find here again a point of fundamental significancethat his artistic analysis led him inevitably on to social inquiries he proved to himself that the main virtue of gothic lay in the unrestricted play of the individual imagination that the best results were produced when every artist was a workman and every workman an artist twenty years after the publication of this book he wrote in a private letter that his main purpose was to show the dependence of architectural beauty on the happiness and fancy of the workman and to show also that no architect could claim the title to authority of magister unless he himself wrought at the head of his men captain of manual skill as the best knight is captain of armies he himself called the chapter precisely and accurately the most important in the whole book mr frederic harrison says that in it is the creed if it be not the origin of a new industrial school of thought

quiet village where he was to rest scattered among the meadows beside its valley stream or from the long hoped for turn in the dusty perspective of the causeway saw for the first time the towers of some famed city faint in the rays of sunsethours of peaceful and thoughtful pleasure for which the rush of the arrival in the railway station is perhaps not always or to all men an equivalentin those days i say when there was something more to be anticipated and remembered in the first aspect of each successive haltingplace than a new arrangement of glass roofing and iron girder there were few moments of which the recollection was more fondly cherished by the traveller than that which as i endeavoured to describe in the close of the last chapter brought him within sight of venice as his gondola shot into the open lagoon from the canal of mestre not but that the aspect of the city itself was generally the source of some slight disappointment for seen in this direction its buildings are far less characteristic than those of the other great towns of italy but this inferiority was partly disguised by distance and more than atoned for by the strange rising of its walls and towers out of the midst as it seemed of the deep sea for it was impossible that the mind or the eye could at once comprehend the shallowness of the vast sheet of water which stretched away in leagues of rippling lustre to the north and south or trace the narrow line of islets bounding it to the east the salt breeze the white moaning seabirds the masses of black weed separating and disappearing gradually in knots of heaving shoal under the advance of the steady tide all proclaimed it to be indeed the ocean on whose bosom the great city rested so calmly not such blue soft lakelike ocean as bathes the neapolitan promontories or sleeps beneath the marble rocks of genoa but a sea with the bleak power of our own northern waves yet subdued into a strange spacious rest and changed from its angry pallor into a field of burnished gold as the sun declined behind the belfry tower of the lonely island church fitly named st george of the seaweed as the boat drew nearer to the city the coast which the traveller had just left sank behind him into one long low sadcoloured line tufted irregularly with brushwood and willows but at what seemed its northern extremity the hills of arqua rose in a dark cluster of purple pyramids balanced on the bright mirage of the lagoon two or three smooth surges of inferior hill extended themselves about their roots and beyond these beginning with the craggy peaks above vicenza the chain of the alps girded the whole horizon to the northa wall of jagged blue here and there showing through its clefts a wilderness of misty precipices fading far back into the recesses of cadore and itself rising and breaking away eastward where the sun struck opposite upon its snow into mighty fragments of peaked light standing up behind the barred clouds of evening one after another countless the crown of the adrian sea until the eye turned back from pursuing them to rest upon the nearer burning of the campaniles of murano and on the great city where it magnified itself along the waves as the quick silent pacing of the gondola drew nearer and nearer and at last when its walls were reached and the outmost of its untrodden streets was entered not through towered gate or guarded rampart but as a deep inlet between two rocks of coral in the indian sea when first upon the travellers sight opened the long ranges of columned palaceseach with its black boat moored at the portaleach with its image cast down beneath its feet upon that green pavement which every breeze broke into new fantasies of rich tessellation when first at the extremity of the bright vista the shadowy rialto threw its colossal curve slowly forth from behind the palace of the camerlenghi136 that strange curve so delicate so adamantine strong as a mountain cavern graceful as a bow just bent when first before its moonlike circumference was all risen the gondoliers cry ah stalì137 struck sharp upon the ear and the prow turned aside under the mighty cornices that half met over the narrow canal where the splash of the water followed close and loud ringing along the marble by the boats side and when at last that boat darted forth upon the breadth of silver sea across which the front of the ducal palace flushed with its sanguine veins looks to the snowy dome of our lady of salvation138 it was no marvel that the mind should be so deeply entranced by the visionary charm of a scene so beautiful and so strange as to forget the darker truths of its history and its being well might it seem that such a city had owed her existence rather to the rod of the enchanter than the fear of the fugitive that the waters which encircled her had been chosen for the mirror of her state rather than the shelter of her nakedness and that all which in nature was wild or mercilesstime and decay as well as the waves and tempestshad been won to adorn her instead of to destroy and might still spare for ages to come that beauty which seemed to have fixed for its throne the sands of the hourglass as well as of the sea  and although the last few eventful years fraught with change to the face of the whole earth have been more fatal in their influence on venice than the five hundred that preceded them though the noble landscape of approach to her can now be seen no more or seen only by a glance as the engine slackens its rushing on the iron line and though many of her palaces are for ever defaced and many in desecrated ruins there is still so much of magic in her aspect that the hurried traveller who must leave her before the wonder of that first aspect has been worn away may still be led to forget the humility of her origin and to shut his eyes to the depth of her desolation they at least are little to be envied in whose hearts the great charities of the imagination lie dead and for whom the fancy has no power to repress the importunity of painful impressions or to raise what is ignoble and disguise what is discordant in a scene so rich in its remembrances so surpassing in its beauty but for this work of the imagination there must be no permission during the task which is before us the impotent feelings of romance so singularly characteristic of this century may indeed gild but never save the remains of those mightier ages to which they are attached like climbing flowers and they must be torn away from the magnificent fragments if we would see them as they stood in their own strength those feelings always as fruitless as they are fond are in venice not only incapable of protecting but even of discerning the objects to which they ought to have been attached the venice of modern fiction and drama is a thing of yesterday a mere efflorescence of decay a stage dream which the first ray of daylight must dissipate into dust no prisoner whose name is worth remembering or whose sorrow deserved sympathy ever crossed that bridge of sighs which is the centre of the byronic ideal of venice139 no great merchant of venice ever saw that rialto under which the traveller now passes with breathless interest the statue which byron makes faliero address as of one of his great ancestors was erected to a soldier of fortune a hundred and fifty years after falieros death140 and the most conspicuous parts of the city have been so entirely altered in the course of the last three centuries that if henry dandolo or francis foscari141 could be summoned from their tombs and stood each on the deck of his galley at the entrance of the grand canal that renowned entrance the painters favourite subject the novelists favourite scene where the water first narrows by the steps of the church of la salutethe mighty doges would not know in what part of the world they stood would literally not recognize one stone of the great city for whose sake and by whose ingratitude their grey hairs had been brought down with bitterness to the grave the remains of their venice lie hidden behind the cumbrous masses which were the delight of the nation in its dotage hidden in many a grassgrown court and silent pathway and lightless canal where the slow waves have sapped their foundations for five hundred years and must soon prevail over them for ever it must be our task to glean and gather them forth and restore out of them some faint image of the lost city more gorgeous a thousandfold than that which now exists yet not created in the daydream of the prince nor by the ostentation of the noble but built by iron hands and patient hearts contending against the adversity of nature and the fury of man so that its wonderfulness cannot be grasped by the indolence of imagination but only after frank inquiry into the true nature of that wild and solitary scene whose restless tides and trembling sands did indeed shelter the birth of the city but long denied her dominion  when the eye falls casually on a map of europe there is no feature by which it is more likely to be arrested than the strange sweeping loop formed by the junction of the alps and apennines and enclosing the great basin of lombardy this return of the mountain chain upon itself causes a vast difference in the character of the distribution of its debris on its opposite sides the rock fragments and sediment which the torrents on the other side of the alps bear into the plains are distributed over a vast extent of country and though here and there lodged in beds of enormous thickness soon permit the firm substrata to appear from underneath them but all the torrents which descend from the southern side of the high alps and from the northern slope of the apennines meet concentrically in the recess or mountain bay which the two ridges enclose every fragment which thunder breaks out of their battlements and every grain of dust which the summer rain washes from their pastures is at last laid at rest in the blue sweep of the lombardic plain and that plain must have risen within its rocky barriers as a cup fills with wine but for two contrary influences which continually depress or disperse from its surface the accumulation of the ruins of ages  i will not tax the readers faith in modern science by insisting on the singular depression of the surface of lombardy which appears for many centuries to have taken place steadily and continually the main fact with which we have to do is the gradual transport by the po and its great collateral rivers of vast masses of the finer sediment to the sea the character of the lombardic plains is most strikingly expressed by the ancient walls of its cities composed for the most part of large rounded alpine pebbles alternating with narrow courses of brick and was curiously illustrated in 1848 by the ramparts of these same pebbles thrown up four or five feet high round every field to check the austrian cavalry in the battle under the walls of verona142 the finer dust among which these pebbles are dispersed is taken up by the rivers fed into continual strength by the alpine snow so that however pure their waters may be when they issue from the lakes at the foot of the great chain they become of the colour and opacity of clay before they reach the adriatic the sediment which they bear is at once thrown down as they enter the sea forming a vast belt of low land along the eastern coast of italy the powerful stream of the po of course builds forward the fastest on each side of it north and south there is a tract of marsh fed by more feeble streams and less liable to rapid change than the delta of the central river in one of these tracts is built ravenna and in the other venice  what circumstances directed the peculiar arrangement of this great belt of sediment in the earliest times it is not here the place to inquire it is enough for us to know that from the mouths of the adige to those of the piave there stretches at a variable distance of from three to five miles from the actual shore a bank of sand divided into long islands by narrow channels of sea the space between this bank and the true shore consists of the sedimentary deposits from these and other rivers a great plain of calcareous mud covered in the neighbourhood of venice by the sea at high water to the depth in most places of a foot or a foot and a half and nearly everywhere exposed at low tide but divided by an intricate network of narrow and winding channels from which the sea never retires in some places according to the run of the currents the land has risen into marshy islets consolidated some by art and some by time into ground firm enough to be built upon or fruitful enough to be cultivated in others on the contrary it has not reached the sea level so that at the average low water shallow lakelets glitter among its irregularly exposed fields of seaweed in the midst of the largest of these increased in importance by the confluence of several large river channels towards one of the openings in the sea bank the city of venice itself is built on a crowded cluster of islands the various plots of higher ground which appear to the north and south of this central cluster have at different periods been also thickly inhabited and now bear according to their size the remains of cities villages or isolated convents and churches scattered among spaces of open ground partly waste and encumbered by ruins partly under cultivation for the supply of the metropolis  the average rise and fall of the tide is about three feet varying considerably with the seasons but this fall on so flat a shore is enough to cause continual movement in the waters and in the main canals to produce a reflux which frequently runs like a mill stream at high water no land is visible for many miles to the north or south of venice except in the form of small islands crowned with towers or gleaming with villages there is a channel some three miles wide between the city and the mainland and some mile and a half wide between it and the sandy breakwater called the lido which divides the lagoon from the adriatic but which is so low as hardly to disturb the impression of the citys having been built in the midst of the ocean although the secret of its true position is partly yet not painfully betrayed by the clusters of piles set to mark the deepwater channels which undulate far away in spotty chains like the studded backs of huge seasnakes and by the quick glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker and dance before the strong winds upon the uplifted level of the shallow sea but the scene is widely different at low tide a fall of eighteen or twenty inches is enough to show ground over the greater part of the lagoon and at the complete ebb the city is seen standing in the midst of a dark plain of seaweed of gloomy green except only where the larger branches of the brenta and its associated streams converge towards the port of the lido through this salt and sombre plain the gondola and the fishingboat advance by tortuous channels seldom more than four or five feet deep and often so choked with slime that the heavier keels furrow the bottom till their crossing tracks are seen through the clear sea water like the ruts upon a wintry road and the oar leaves blue gashes upon the ground at every stroke or is entangled among the thick weed that fringes the banks with the weight of its sullen waves leaning to and fro upon the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide the scene is often profoundly oppressive even at this day when every plot of higher ground bears some fragment of fair building but in order to know what it was once let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the windings of some unfrequented channel far into the midst of the melancholy plain let him remove in his imagination the brightness of the great city that still extends itself in the distance and the walls and towers from the islands that are near and so wait until the bright investiture and sweet warmth of the sunset are withdrawn from the waters and the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath the night pathless comfortless infirm lost in dark languor and fearful silence except where the salt runlets plash into the tideless pools or the seabirds flit from their margins with a questioning cry and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently chosen by man for his habitation they little thought who first drove the stakes into the sand and strewed the ocean reeds for their rest that their children were to be the princes of that ocean and their palaces its pride and yet in the great natural laws that rule that sorrowful wilderness let it be remembered what strange preparation had been made for the things which no human imagination could have foretold and how the whole existence and fortune of the venetian nation were anticipated or compelled by the setting of those bars and doors to the rivers and the sea had deeper currents divided their islands hostile navies would again and again have reduced the rising city into servitude had stronger surges beaten their shores all the richness and refinement of the venetian architecture must have been exchanged for the walls and bulwarks of an ordinary seaport had there been no tide as in other parts of the mediterranean the narrow canals of the city would have become noisome and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous had the tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in its rise the wateraccess to the doors of the palaces would have been impossible even as it is there is sometimes a little difficulty at the ebb in landing without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps and the highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards and overflow the entrance halls eighteen inches more of difference between the level of the flood and ebb would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace at low water a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets and the entire system of watercarriage for the higher classes in their easy and daily intercourse must have been done away with the streets of the city would have been widened its network of canals filled up and all the peculiar character of the place and the people destroyed  the reader may perhaps have felt some pain in the contrast between this faithful view of the site of the venetian throne and the romantic conception of it which we ordinarily form but this pain if he have felt it ought to be more than counterbalanced by the value of the instance thus afforded to us at once of the inscrutableness and the wisdom of the ways of god if two thousand years ago we had been permitted to watch the slow settling of the slime of those turbid rivers into the polluted sea and the gaining upon its deep and fresh waters of the lifeless impassable unvoyageable plain how little could we have understood the purpose with which those islands were shaped out of the void and the torpid waters enclosed with their desolate walls of sand how little could we have known any more than of what now seems to us most distressful dark and objectless the glorious aim which was then in the mind of him in whose hand are all the corners of the earth how little imagined that in the laws which were stretching forth the gloomy margins of those fruitless banks and feeding the bitter grass among their shallows there was indeed a preparation and the only preparation possible for the founding of a city which was to be set like a golden clasp on the girdle of the earth to write her history on the white scrolls of the seasurges and to word it in their thunder and to gather and give forth in worldwide pulsation the glory of the west and of the east from the burning heart of her fortitude and splendour     136 the palace of the camerlenghi beside the rialto is a   graceful work of the early renaissance 1525 passing into roman   renaissance adapted from ruskin    137 signifying approximately keep to the right

custozza 1848 the austrians defeated the   piedmontese     st marks  volume ii chapter 4   and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus if as the shores of asia lessened upon his sight the spirit of prophecy had entered into the heart of the weak disciple who had turned back when his hand was on the plough and who had been judged by the chiefest of christs captains unworthy thenceforward to go forth with him to the work143 how wonderful would he have thought it that by the lion symbol in future ages he was to be represented among men how woful that the warcry of his name should so often reanimate the rage of the soldier on those very plains where he himself had failed in the courage of the christian and so often dye with fruitless blood that very cypriot sea over whose waves in repentance and shame he was following the son of consolation  that the venetians possessed themselves of his body in the ninth century there appears no sufficient reason to doubt nor that it was principally in consequence of their having done so that they chose him for their patron saint there exists however a tradition that before he went into egypt he had founded the church at aquileia and was thus in some sort the first bishop of the venetian isles and people i believe that this tradition stands on nearly as good grounds as that of st peter having been the first bishop of rome144 but as usual it is enriched by various later additions and embellishments much resembling the stories told respecting the church of murano thus we find it recorded by the santo padre who compiled the vife de santi spettanti alle chiese di venezia145 that st mark having seen the people of aquileia well grounded in religion and being called to rome by st peter before setting off took with him the holy bishop hermagoras and went in a small boat to the marshes of venice there were at that period some houses built upon a certain high bank called rialto and the boat being driven by the wind was anchored in a marshy place when st mark snatched into ecstasy heard the voice of an angel saying to him peace be to thee mark here shall thy body rest the angel goes on to foretell the building of una stupenda ne più veduta città146 but the fable is hardly ingenious enough to deserve farther relation  but whether st mark was first bishop of aquileia or not st theodore was the first patron of the city nor can he yet be considered as having entirely abdicated his early right as his statue standing on a crocodile still companions the winged lion on the opposing pillar of the piazzetta a church erected to this saint is said to have occupied before the ninth century the site of st marks and the traveller dazzled by the brilliancy of the great square ought not to leave it without endeavouring to imagine its aspect in that early time when it was a green field cloisterlike and quiet147 divided by a small canal with a line of trees on each side and extending between the two churches of st theodore and st gemanium as the little piazza of torcello lies between its palazzo and cathedral  but in the year 813 when the seat of government was finally removed to the rialto a ducal palace built on the spot where the present one stands with a ducal chapel beside it148 gave a very different character to the square of st mark and fifteen years later the acquisition of the body of the saint and its deposition in the ducal chapel perhaps not yet completed occasioned the investiture of that chapel with all possible splendour st theodore was deposed from his patronship and his church destroyed to make room for the aggrandizement of the one attached to the ducal palace and thenceforward known as st marks149  this first church was however destroyed by fire when the ducal palace was burned in the revolt against candiano in 976 it was partly rebuilt by his successor pietro orseolo on a larger scale and with the assistance of byzantine architects the fabric was carried on under successive doges for nearly a hundred years the main building being completed in 1071 but its incrustation with marble not till considerably later it was consecrated on the 8th of october 1085150 according to sansovino and the author of the chiesa ducale di s marco in 1094 according to lazari but certainly between 1084 and 1096 those years being the limits of the reign of vital falier i incline to the supposition that it was soon after his accession to the throne in 1085 though sansovino writes by mistake ordelafo instead of vital falier but at all events before the close of the eleventh century the great consecration of the church took place it was again injured by fire in 1106 but repaired and from that time to the fall of venice there was probably no doge who did not in some slight degree embellish or alter the fabric so that few parts of it can be pronounced boldly to be of any given date two periods of interference are however notable above the rest the first that in which the gothic school had superseded the byzantine towards the close of the fourteenth century when the pinnacles upper archivolts and window traceries were added to the exterior and the great screen with various chapels and tabernaclework to the interior the second when the renaissance school superseded the gothic and the pupils of titian and tintoret substituted over one half of the church their own compositions for the greek mosaics with which it was originally decorated151 happily though with no good will having left enough to enable us to imagine and lament what they destroyed of this irreparable loss we shall have more to say hereafter meantime i wish only to fix in the readers mind the succession of periods of alterations as firmly and simply as possible  we have seen that the main body of the church may be broadly stated to be of the eleventh century the gothic additions of the fourteenth and the restored mosaics of the seventeenth there is no difficulty in distinguishing at a glance the gothic portions from the byzantine but there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining how long during the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries additions were made to the byzantine church which cannot be easily distinguished from the work of the eleventh century being purposely executed in the same manner two of the most important pieces of evidence on this point are a mosaic in the south transept and another over the northern door of the façade the first representing the interior the second the exterior of the ancient church  it has just been stated that the existing building was consecrated by the doge vital falier a peculiar solemnity was given to that act of consecration in the minds of the venetian people by what appears to have been one of the best arranged and most successful impostures ever attempted by the clergy of the romish church the body of st mark had without doubt perished in the conflagration of 976 but the revenues of the church depended too much upon the devotion excited by these relics to permit the confession of their loss the following is the account given by corner and believed to this day by the venetians of the pretended miracle by which it was concealed  after the repairs undertaken by the doge orseolo the place in which the body of the holy evangelist rested had been altogether forgotten so that the doge vital falier was entirely ignorant of the place of the venerable deposit this was no light affliction not only to the pious doge but to all the citizens and people so that at last moved by confidence in the divine mercy they determined to implore with prayer and fasting the manifestation of so great a treasure which did not now depend upon any human effort a general fast being therefore proclaimed and a solemn procession appointed for the 25th day of june while the people assembled in the church interceded with god in fervent prayers for the desired boon they beheld with as much amazement as joy a slight shaking in the marbles of a pillar near the place where the altar of the cross is now which presently falling to the earth exposed to the view of the rejoicing people the chest of bronze in which the body of the evangelist was laid  of the main facts of this tale there is no doubt they were embellished afterwards as usual by many fanciful traditions as for instance that when the sarcophagus was discovered st mark extended his hand out of it with a gold ring on one of the fingers which he permitted a noble of the dolfin family to remove and a quaint and delightful story was further invented of this ring which i shall not repeat here as it is now as well known as any tale of the arabian nights but the fast and the discovery of the coffin by whatever means effected are facts and they are recorded in one of the bestpreserved mosaics of the north152 transept executed very certainly not long after the event had taken place closely resembling in its treatment that of the bayeux tapestry and showing in a conventional manner the interior of the church as it then was filled by the people first in prayer then in thanksgiving the pillar standing open before them and the doge in the midst of them distinguished by his crimson bonnet embroidered with gold but more unmistakably by the inscription dux over his head as uniformly is the case in the bayeux tapestry and most other pictorial works of the period the church is of course rudely represented and the two upper stories of it reduced to a small scale in order to form a background to the figures one of those bold pieces of picture history which we in our pride of perspective and a thousand things besides never dare attempt we should have put in a column or two of the real or perspective size and subdued it into a vague background the old workman crushed the church together that he might get it all in up to the cupolas and has therefore left us some useful notes of its ancient form though any one who is familiar with the method of drawing employed at the period will not push the evidence too far the two pulpits are there however as they are at this day and the fringe of mosaic flowerwork which then encompassed the whole church but which modern restorers have destroyed all but one fragment still left in the south aisle there is no attempt to represent the other mosaics on the roof the scale being too small to admit of their being represented with any success but some at least of those mosaics had been executed at that period and their absence in the representation of the entire church is especially to be observed in order to show that we must not trust to any negative evidence in such works m lazari has rashly concluded that the central archivolt of st marks must be posterior to the year 1205 because it does not appear in the representation of the exterior of the church over the northern door153 but he justly observes that this mosaic which is the other piece of evidence we possess respecting the ancient form of the building cannot itself be earlier than 1205 since it represents the bronze horses which were brought from constantinople in that year and this one fact renders it very difficult to speak with confidence respecting the date of any part of the exterior of st marks for we have above seen that it was consecrated in the eleventh century and yet here is one of its most important exterior decorations assuredly retouched if not entirely added in the thirteenth although its style would have led us to suppose it had been an original part of the fabric however for all our purposes it will be enough for the reader to remember that the earliest parts of the building belong to the eleventh twelfth and first part of the thirteenth century the gothic portions to the fourteenth some of the altars and embellishments to the fifteenth and sixteenth and the modern portion of the mosaics to the seventeenth  this however i only wish him to recollect in order that i may speak generally of the byzantine architecture of st marks without leading him to suppose the whole church to have been built and decorated by greek artists its later portions with the single exception of the seventeenthcentury mosaics have been so dexterously accommodated to the original fabric that the general effect is still that of a byzantine building and i shall not except when it is absolutely necessary direct attention to the discordant points or weary the reader with anatomical criticism whatever in st marks arrests the eye or affects the feelings is either byzantine or has been modified by byzantine influence and our inquiry into its architectural merits need not therefore be disturbed by the anxieties of antiquarianism or arrested by the obscurities of chronology  and now i wish that the reader before i bring him into st marks place would imagine himself for a little time in a quiet english cathedral town and walk with me to the west front of its cathedral let us go together up the more retired street at the end of which we can see the pinnacles of one of the towers and then through the low grey gateway with its battlemented top and small latticed window in the centre into the inner privatelooking road or close where nothing goes in but the carts of the tradesmen who supply the bishop and the chapter and where there are little shaven grassplots fenced in by neat rails before oldfashioned groups of somewhat diminutive and excessively trim houses with little oriel and bay windows jutting out here and there and deep wooden cornices and eaves painted cream colour and white and small porches to their doors in the shape of cockleshells or little crooked thick indescribable wooden gables warped a little on one side and so forward till we come to larger houses also oldfashioned but of red brick and with gardens behind them and fruit walls which show here and there among the nectarines the vestiges of an old cloister arch or shaft and looking in front on the cathedral square itself laid out in rigid divisions of smooth grass and gravel walk yet not uncheerful especially on the sunny side where the canons children are walking with their nurserymaids and so taking care not to tread on the grass we will go along the straight walk to the west front and there stand for a time looking up at its deeppointed porches and the dark places between their pillars where there were statues once and where the fragments here and there of a stately figure are still left which has in it the likeness of a king perhaps indeed a king on earth perhaps a saintly king long ago in heaven and so higher and higher up to the great mouldering wall of rugged sculpture and confused arcades shattered and grey and grisly with heads of dragons and mocking fiends worn by the rain and swirling winds into yet unseemlier shape and coloured on their stony scales by the deep russetorange lichen melancholy gold and so higher still to the bleak towers so far above that the eye loses itself among the bosses of their traceries though they are rude and strong and only sees like a drift of eddying black points now closing now scattering and now settling suddenly into invisible places among the bosses and flowers the crowd of restless birds that fill the whole square with that strange clangour of theirs so harsh and yet so soothing like the cries of birds on a solitary coast between the cliffs and sea  think for a little while of that scene and the meaning of all its small formalisms mixed with its serene sublimity estimate its secluded continuous drowsy felicities and its evidence of the sense and steady performance of such kind of duties as can be regulated by the cathedral clock and weigh the influence of those dark towers on all who have passed through the lonely square at their feet for centuries and on all who have seen them rising far away over the wooded plain or catching on their square masses the last rays of the sunset when the city at their feet was indicated only by the mist at the bend of the river and then let us quickly recollect that we are in venice and land at the extremity of the calla lunga san moisè which may be considered as there answering to the secluded street that led us to our english cathedral gateway  we find ourselves in a paved alley some seven feet wide where it is widest full of people and resonant with cries of itinerant salesmena shriek in their beginning and dying away into a kind of brazen ringing all the worse for its confinement between the high houses of the passage along which we have to make our way overhead an inextricable confusion of rugged shutters and iron balconies and chimney flues pushed out on brackets to save room and arched windows with projecting sills of istrian stone and gleams of green leaves here and there where a figtree branch escapes over a lower wall from some inner cortile leading the eye up to the narrow stream of blue sky high over all on each side a row of shops as densely set as may be occupying in fact intervals between the square stone shafts about eight feet high which carry the first floors intervals of which one is narrow and serves as a door the other is in the more respectable shops wainscotted to the height of the counter and glazed above but in those of the poorer tradesmen left open to the ground and the wares laid on benches and tables in the open air the light in all cases entering at the front only and fading away in a few feet from the threshold into a gloom which the eye from without cannot penetrate but which is generally broken by a ray or two from a feeble lamp at the back of the shop suspended before a print of the virgin the less pious shopkeeper sometimes leaves his lamp unlighted and is contented with a penny print the more religious one has his print coloured and set in a little shrine with a gilded or figured fringe with perhaps a faded flower or two on each side and his lamp burning brilliantly here at the fruiterers where the darkgreen watermelons are heaped upon the counter like cannon balls the madonna has a tabernacle of fresh laurel leaves but the pewterer next door has let his lamp out and there is nothing to be seen in his shop but the dull gleam of the studded patterns on the copper pans hanging from his roof in the darkness next comes a vendita frittole e liquori154 where the virgin enthroned in a very humble manner beside a tallow candle on a back shelf presides over certain ambrosial morsels of a nature too ambiguous to be defined or enumerated but a few steps farther on at the regular wineshop of the calle where we are offered vino nostrani a soldi 2832 the madonna is in great glory enthroned above ten or a dozen large red casks of threeyearold vintage and flanked by goodly ranks of bottles of maraschino and two crimson lamps and for the evening when the gondoliers will come to drink out under her auspices the money they have gained during the day she will have a whole chandelier  a yard or two farther we pass the hostelry of the black eagle and glancing as we pass through the square door of marble deeply moulded in the outer wall we see the shadows of its pergola of vines resting on an ancient well with a pointed shield carved on its side and so presently emerge on the bridge and campo san moisè whence to the entrance into st marks place called the bocca di piazza mouth of the square the venetian character is nearly destroyed first by the frightful facade of san moisè which we will pause at another time to examine and then by the modernizing of the shops as they near the piazza and the mingling with the lower venetian populace of lounging groups of english and austrians we will push fast through them into the shadow of the pillars at the end of the bocca di piazza and then we forget them all for between those pillars there opens a great light and in the midst of it as we advance slowly the vast tower of st mark seems to lift itself visibly forth from the level field of chequered stones and on each side the countless arches prolong themselves into ranged symmetry as if the rugged and irregular houses that pressed together above us in the dark alley had been struck back into sudden obedience and lovely order and all their rude casements and broken walls had been transformed into arches charged with goodly sculpture and fluted shafts of delicate stone  and well may they fall back for beyond those troops of ordered arches there rises a vision out of the earth and all the great square seems to have opened from it in a kind of awe that we may see it far awaya multitude of pillars and white domes clustered into a long low pyramid of coloured light a treasureheap it seems partly of gold and partly of opal and motherofpearl hollowed beneath into five great vaulted porches ceiled with fair mosaic and beset with sculpture of alabaster clear as amber and delicate as ivorysculpture fantastic and involved of palm leaves and lilies and grapes and pomegranates and birds clinging and fluttering among the branches all twined together into an endless network of buds and plumes and in the midst of it the solemn forms of angels sceptred and robed to the feet and leaning to each other across the gates their figures indistinct among the gleaming of the golden ground through the leaves beside them interrupted and dim like the morning light as it faded back among the branches of eden when first its gates were angelguarded long ago and round the walls of the porches there are set pillars of variegated stones jasper and porphyry and deepgreen serpentine spotted with flakes of snow and marbles that half refuse and half yield to the sunshine cleopatralike their bluest veins to kiss155the shadow as it steals back from them revealing line after line of azure undulation as a receding tide leaves the waved sand their capitals rich with interwoven tracery rooted knots of herbage and drifting leaves of acanthus and vine and mystical signs all beginning and ending in the cross and above them in the broad archivolts a continuous chain of language and of lifeangels and the signs of heaven and the labours of men each in its appointed season upon the earth and above these another range of glittering pinnacles mixed with white arches edged with scarlet flowersa confusion of delight amidst which the breasts of the greek horses are seen blazing in their breadth of golden strength and the st marks lion lifted on a blue field covered with stars until at last as if in ecstasy the crests of the arches break into a marble foam and toss themselves far into the blue sky in flashes and wreaths of sculptured spray as if the breakers on the lido shore had been frostbound before they fell and the seanymphs had inlaid them with coral and amethyst  between that grim cathedral of england and this what an interval there is a type of it in the very birds that haunt them for instead of the restless crowd hoarsevoiced and sablewinged drifting on the bleak upper air the st marks porches are full of doves that nestle among the marble foliage and mingle the soft iridescence of their living plumes changing at every motion with the tints hardly less lovely that have stood unchanged for seven hundred years  and what effect has this splendour on those who pass beneath it you may walk from sunrise to sunset to and fro before the gateway of st marks and you will not see an eye lifted to it nor a countenance brightened by it priest and layman soldier and civilian rich and poor pass by it alike regardlessly up to the very recesses of the porches the meanest tradesmen of the city push their counters nay the foundations of its pillars are themselves the seatsnot of them that sell doves156 for sacrifice but of the vendors of toys and caricatures round the whole square in front of the church there is almost a continuous line of cafés where the idle venetians of the middle classes lounge and read empty journals in its centre the austrian bands play during the time of vespers their martial music jarring with the organ notesthe march drowning the miserere and the sullen crowd thickening round thema crowd which if it had its will would stiletto every soldier that pipes to it and in the recesses of the porches all day long knots of men of the lowest classes unemployed

believe then that the characteristic or moral elements of gothic are the following placed in the order of their importance    1 savageness   2 changefulness   3 naturalism   4 grotesqueness   5 rigidity   6 redundance  these characters are here expressed as belonging to the building as belonging to the builder they would be expressed thus1 savageness or rudeness 2 love of change 3 love of nature 4 disturbed imagination 5 obstinacy 6 generosity and i repeat that the withdrawal of any one or any two will not at once destroy the gothic character of a building but the removal of a majority of them will i shall proceed to examine them in their order  1 savageness i am not sure when the word gothic was first generically applied to the architecture of the north but i presume that whatever the date of its original usage it was intended to imply reproach and express the barbaric character of the nations among whom that architecture arose it never implied that they were literally of gothic lineage far less that their architecture had been originally invented by the goths themselves but it did imply that they and their buildings together exhibited a degree of sternness and rudeness which in contradistinction to the character of southern and eastern nations appeared like a perpetual reflection of the contrast between the goth and the roman in their first encounter and when that fallen roman in the utmost impotence of his luxury and insolence of his guilt became the model for the imitation of civilized europe at the close of the socalled dark ages the word gothic became a term of unmitigated contempt not unmixed with aversion from that contempt by the exertion of the antiquaries and architects of this century gothic architecture has been sufficiently vindicated and perhaps some among us in our admiration of the magnificent science of its structure and sacredness of its expression might desire that the term of ancient reproach should be withdrawn and some other of more apparent honourableness adopted in its place there is no chance as there is no need of such a substitution as far as the epithet was used scornfully it was used falsely but there is no reproach in the word rightly understood on the contrary there is a profound truth which the instinct of mankind almost unconsciously recognizes it is true greatly and deeply true that the architecture of the north is rude and wild but it is not true that for this reason we are to condemn it or despise far otherwise i believe it is in this very character that it deserves our profoundest reverence  the charts of the world which have been drawn up by modern science have thrown into a narrow space the expression of a vast amount of knowledge but i have never yet seen any one pictorial enough to enable the spectator to imagine the kind of contrast in physical character which exists between northern and southern countries we know the differences in detail but we have not that broad glance and grasp which would enable us to feel them in their fulness we know that gentians grow on the alps and olives on the apennines but we do not enough conceive for ourselves that variegated mosaic of the worlds surface which a bird sees in its migration that difference between the district of the gentian and of the olive which the stork and the swallow see far off as they lean upon the sirocco wind let us for a moment try to raise ourselves even above the level of their flight and imagine the mediterranean lying beneath us like an irregular lake and all its ancient promontories sleeping in the sun here and there an angry spot of thunder a grey stain of storm moving upon the burning field and here and there a fixed wreath of white volcano smoke surrounded by its circle of ashes but for the most part a great peacefulness of light syria and greece italy and spain laid like pieces of a golden pavement into the seablue chased as we stoop nearer to them with bossy beaten work of mountain chains and glowing softly with terraced gardens and flowers heavy with frankincense mixed among masses of laurel and orange and plumy palm that abate with their greygreen shadows the burning of the marble rocks and of the ledges of porphyry sloping under lucent sand then let us pass farther towards the north until we see the orient colours change gradually into a vast belt of rainy green where the pastures of switzerland and poplar valleys of france and dark forests of the danube and carpathians stretch from the mouths of the loire to those of the volga seen through clefts in grey swirls of raincloud and flaky veils of the mist of the brooks spreading low along the pasture lands and then farther north still to see the earth heave into mighty masses of leaden rock and heathy moor bordering with a broad waste of gloomy purple that belt of field and wood and splintering into irregular and grisly islands amidst the northern seas beaten by storm and chilled by icedrift and tormented by furious pulses of contending tide until the roots of the last forests fail from among the hill ravines and the hunger of the north wind bites their peaks into barrenness and at last the wall of ice durable like iron sets deathlike its white teeth against us out of the polar twilight and having once traversed in thought this gradation of the zoned iris of the earth in all its material vastness let us go down nearer to it and watch the parallel change in the belt of animal life the multitudes of swift and brilliant creatures that glance in the air and sea or tread the sands of the southern zone striped zebras and spotted leopards glistening serpents and birds arrayed in purple and scarlet let us contrast their delicacy and brilliancy of colour and swiftness of motion with the frostcramped strength and shaggy covering and dusky plumage of the northern tribes contrast the arabian horse with the shetland the tiger and leopard with the wolf and bear the antelope with the elk the bird of paradise with the osprey and then submissively acknowledging the great laws by which the earth and all that it bears are ruled throughout their being let us not condemn but rejoice in the expression by man of his own rest in the statutes of the lands that gave him birth let us watch him with reverence as he sets side by side the burning gems and smooths with soft sculpture the jasper pillars that are to reflect a ceaseless sunshine and rise into a cloudless sky but not with less reverence let us stand by him when with rough strength and hurried stroke he smites an uncouth animation out of the rocks which he has torn from among the moss of the moorland and heaves into the darkened air the pile of iron buttress and rugged wall instinct with work of an imagination as wild and wayward as the northern sea creations of ungainly shape and rigid limb but full of wolfish life fierce as the winds that beat and changeful as the clouds that shade them  there is i repeat no degradation no reproach in this but all dignity and honourableness and we should err grievously in refusing either to recognize as an essential character of the existing architecture of the north or to admit as a desirable character in that which it yet may be this wildness of thought and roughness of work this look of mountain brotherhood between the cathedral and the alp this magnificence of sturdy power put forth only the more energetically because the fine fingertouch was chilled away by the frosty wind and the eye dimmed by the moormist or blinded by the hail this outspeaking of the strong spirit of men who may not gather redundant fruitage from the earth nor bask in dreamy benignity of sunshine but must break the rock for bread and cleave the forest for fire and show even in what they did for their delight some of the hard habits of the arm and heart that grew on them as they swung the axe or pressed the plough  if however the savageness of gothic architecture merely as an expression of its origin among northern nations may be considered in some sort a noble character it possesses a higher nobility still when considered as an index not of climate but of religious principle  in the 13th and 14th paragraphs of chapter xxl of the first volume of this work it was noticed that the systems of architectural ornament properly so called might be divided into three1 servile ornament in which the execution or power of the inferior workman is entirely subjected to the intellect of the higher2 constitutional ornament in which the executive inferior power is to a certain point emancipated and independent having a will of its own yet confessing its inferiority and rendering obedience to higher powersand 3 revolutionary ornament in which no executive inferiority is admitted at all i must here explain the nature of these divisions at somewhat greater length  of servile ornament the principal schools are the greek ninevite and egyptian but their servility is of different kinds the greek masterworkman was far advanced in knowledge and power above the assyrian or egyptian neither he nor those for whom he worked could endure the appearance of imperfection in anything and therefore what ornament he appointed to be done by those beneath him was composed of mere geometrical formsballs ridges and perfectly symmetrical foliagewhich could be executed with absolute precision by line and rule and were as perfect in their way when completed as his own figure sculpture the assyrian and egyptian on the contrary less cognizant of accurate form in anything were content to allow their figure sculpture to be executed by inferior workmen but lowered the method of its treatment to a standard which every workman could reach and then trained him by discipline so rigid that there was no chance of his falling beneath the standard appointed the greek gave to the lower workman no subject which he could not perfectly execute the assyrian gave him subjects which he could only execute imperfectly but fixed a legal standard for his imperfection the workman was in both systems a slave157  but in the mediæval or especially christian system of ornament this slavery is done away with altogether christianity having recognized in small things as well as great the individual value of every soul but it not only recognizes its value it confesses its imperfection in only bestowing dignity upon the acknowledgment of unworthiness that admission of lost power and fallen nature which the greek or ninevite felt to be intensely painful and as far as might be altogether refused the christian makes daily and hourly contemplating the fact of it without fear as tending in the end to gods greater glory therefore to every spirit which christianity summons to her service her exhortation is do what you can and confess frankly what you are unable to do neither let your effort be shortened for fear of failure nor your confession silenced for fear of shame and it is perhaps the principal admirableness of the gothic schools of architecture that they thus receive the results of the labour of inferior minds and out of fragments full of imperfection and betraying that imperfection in every touch indulgently raise up a stately and unaccusable whole  but the modern english mind has this much in common with that of the greek that it intensely desires in all things the utmost completion or perfection compatible with their nature this is a noble character in the abstract but becomes ignoble when it causes us to forget the relative dignities of that nature itself and to prefer the perfectness of the lower nature to the imperfection of the higher not considering that as judged by such a rule all the brute animals would be preferable to man because more perfect in their functions and kind and yet are always held inferior to him so also in the works of man those which are more perfect in their kind are always inferior to those which are in their nature liable to more faults and shortcomings for the finer the nature the more flaws it will show through the clearness of it and it is a law of this universe that the best things shall be seldomest seen in their best form the wild grass grows well and strongly one year with another but the wheat is according to the greater nobleness of its nature liable to the bitterer blight and therefore while in all things that we see or do we are to desire perfection and strive for it we are nevertheless not to set the meaner thing in its narrow accomplishment above the nobler thing in its mighty progress not to esteem smooth minuteness above shattered majesty not to prefer mean victory to honourable defeat not to lower the level of our aim that we may the more surely enjoy the complacency of success but above all in our dealings with the souls of other men we are to take care how we check by severe requirement or narrow caution efforts which might otherwise lead to a noble issue and still more how we withhold our admiration from great excellencies because they are mingled with rough faults now in the make and nature of every man however rude or simple whom we employ in manual labour there are some powers for better things some tardy imagination torpid capacity of emotion tottering steps of thought there are even at the worst and in most cases it is all our own fault that they are tardy or torpid but they cannot be strengthened unless we are content to take them in their feebleness and unless we prize and honour them in their imperfection above the best and most perfect manual skill and this is what we have to do with all our labourers to look for the thoughtful part of them and get that out of them whatever we lose for it whatever faults and errors we are obliged to take with it for the best that is in them cannot manifest itself but in company with much error understand this clearly you can teach a man to draw a straight line and to cut one to strike a curved line and to carve it and to copy and carve any number of given lines or forms with admirable speed and perfect precision and you find his work perfect of its kind but if you ask him to think about any of those forms to consider if he cannot find any better in his own head he stops his execution becomes hesitating he thinks and ten to one he thinks wrong ten to one he makes a mistake in the first touch he gives to his work as a thinking being but you have made a man of him for all that he was only a machine before an animated tool  and observe you are put to stern choice in this matter you must either make a tool of the creature or a man of him you cannot make both men were not intended to work with the accuracy of tools to be precise and perfect in all their actions if you will have that precision out of them and make their fingers measure degrees like cogwheels and their arms strike curves like compasses you must unhumanize them all the energy of their spirits must be given to make cogs and compasses of themselves all their attention and strength must go to the accomplishment of the mean act the eye of the soul must be bent upon the fingerpoint and the souls force must fill all the invisible nerves that guide it ten hours a day that it may not err from its steely precision and so soul and sight be worn away and the whole human being be lost at lasta heap of sawdust so far as its intellectual work in this world is concerned saved only by its heart which cannot go into the form of cogs and compasses but expands after the ten hours are over into fireside humanity on the other hand if you will make a man of the working creature you cannot make a tool let him but begin to imagine to think to try to do anything worth doing and the engineturned precision is lost at once out come all his roughness all his dulness all his incapability shame upon shame failure upon failure pause after pause but out comes the whole majesty of him also and we know the height of it only when we see the clouds settling upon him and whether the clouds be bright or dark there will be transfiguration behind and within them  and now reader look round this english room of yours about which you have been proud so often because the work of it was so good and strong and the ornaments of it so finished examine again all those accurate mouldings and perfect polishings and unerring adjustments of the seasoned wood and tempered steel many a time you have exulted over them and thought how great england was because her slightest work was done so thoroughly alas if read rightly these perfectnesses are signs of a slavery in our england a thousand times more bitter and more degrading than that of the scourged african or helot greek men may be beaten chained tormented yoked like cattle slaughtered like summer flies and yet remain in one sense and the best sense free but to smother their souls within them to blight and hew into rotting pollards the suckling branches of their human intelligence to make the flesh and skin which after the worms work on it is to see god158 into leathern thongs to yoke machinery withthis it is to be slavemasters indeed and there might be more freedom in england though her feudal lords lightest words were worth mens lives and though the blood of the vexed husbandman dropped in the furrows of her fields than there is while the animation of her multitudes is sent like fuel to feed the factory smoke and the strength of them is given daily to be wasted into the fineness of a web or racked into the exactness of a line  and on the other hand go forth again to gaze upon the old cathedral front where you have smiled so often at the fantastic ignorance of the old sculptors examine once more those ugly goblins and formless monsters and stern statues anatomiless and rigid but do not mock at them for they are signs of the life and liberty of every workman who struck the stone a freedom of thought and rank in scale of being such as no laws no charters no charities can secure but which it must be the first aim of all europe at this day to regain for her children  let me not be thought to speak wildly or extravagantly it is verily this degradation of the operative into a machine which more than any other evil of the times is leading the mass of the nations everywhere into vain incoherent destructive struggling for a freedom of which they cannot explain the nature to themselves their universal outcry against wealth and against nobility is not forced from them either by the pressure of famine or the sting of mortified pride these do much and have done much in all ages but the foundations of society were never yet shaken as they are at this day it is not that men are ill fed but that they have no pleasure in the work by which they make their bread and therefore look to wealth as the only means of pleasure it is not that men are pained by the scorn of the upper classes but they cannot endure their own for they feel that the kind of labour to which they are condemned is verily a degrading one and makes them less than men never had the upper classes so much sympathy with the lower or charity for them as they have at this day and yet never were they so much hated by them for of old the separation between the noble and the poor was merely a wall built by law now it is a veritable difference in level of standing a precipice between upper and lower grounds in the field of humanity and there is pestilential air at the bottom of it i know not if a day is ever to come when the nature of right freedom will be understood and when men will see that to obey another man to labour for him yield reverence to him or to his place is not slavery it is often the best kind of libertyliberty from care the man who says to one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh159 has in most cases more sense of restraint and difficulty than the man who obeys him the movements of the one are hindered by the burden on his shoulder of the other by the bridle on his lips there is no way by which the burden may be lightened but we need not suffer from the bridle if we do not champ at it to yield reverence to another to hold ourselves and our lives at his disposal is not slavery often it is the noblest state in which a man can live in this world there is indeed a reverence which is servile that is to say irrational or selfish but there is also noble reverence that is to say reasonable and loving and a man is never so noble as when he is reverent in this kind nay even if the feeling pass the bounds of mere reason so that it be loving a man is raised by it which had in reality most of the serf nature in himthe irish peasant who was lying in wait yesterday for his landlord with his musket muzzle thrust through the ragged hedge or that old mountain servant who 200 years ago at inverkeithing gave up his own life and the lives of his seven sons for his chiefas each fell calling forth his brother to the death another for hector160 and therefore in all ages and all countries reverence has been paid and sacrifice made by men to each other not only without complaint but rejoicingly and famine and peril and sword and all evil and all shame have been borne willingly in the causes of masters and kings for all these gifts of the heart ennobled the men who gave not less than the men who received them and nature prompted and god rewarded the sacrifice but to feel their souls withering within them unthanked to find their whole being sunk into an unrecognized abyss to be counted off into a heap of mechanism numbered with its wheels and weighed with its hammer strokesthis nature bade notthis god blesses notthis humanity for no long time is able to endure  we have much studied and much perfected of late the great civilized invention of the division of labour only we give it a false name it is not truly speaking the labour that is divided but the mendivided into mere segments of menbroken into small fragments and crumbs of life so that all the little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not enough to make a pin or a nail but exhausts itself in making the point of a pin or the head of a nail now it is a good and desirable thing truly to make many pins in a day but if we could only see with what crystal sand their points were polishedsand of human soul much to be magnified before it can be discerned for what it iswe should think there might be some loss in it also and the great cry that rises from all our manufacturing cities louder than their furnace blast is all in very deed for thisthat we manufacture everything there except men we blanch cotton and strengthen steel and refine sugar and shape pottery but to brighten to strengthen to refine or to form a single living spirit never enters into our estimate of advantages and all the evil to which that cry is urging our myriads can be met only in one way not by teaching nor preaching for to teach them is but to show them their misery and to preach to them if we do nothing more than preach is to mock at it it can be met only by a right understanding on the part of all classes of what kinds of labour are good for men raising them and making them happy by a determined sacrifice of such convenience or beauty or cheapness as is to be got only by the degradation of the workman and by equally determined demand for the products and results of healthy and ennobling labour  and how it will be asked are these products to be recognized and this demand to be regulated easily by the observance of three broad and simple rules    1 never encourage the manufacture of any article not absolutely   necessary in the production of which invention has no share    2 never demand an exact finish for its own sake but only for some   practical or noble end    3 never encourage imitation or copying of any kind except for the   sake of preserving record of great works  the second of these principles is the only one which directly rises out of the consideration of our immediate subject but i shall briefly explain the meaning and extent of the first also reserving the enforcement of the third for another place    1 never encourage the manufacture of anything not necessary in the   production of which invention has no share  for instance glass beads are utterly unnecessary and there is no design or thought employed in their manufacture they are formed by first drawing out the glass into rods these rods are chopped up into fragments of the size of beads by the human hand and the fragments are then rounded in the furnace the men who chop up the rods sit at their work all day their hands vibrating with a perpetual and exquisitely timed palsy and the beads dropping beneath their vibration like hail neither they nor the men who draw out the rods or fuse the fragments have the smallest occasion for the use of any single human faculty and every young lady therefore who buys glass beads is engaged in the slavetrade and in a much more cruel one than that which we have so long been endeavouring to put down  but glass cups and vessels may become the subjects of exquisite invention and if in buying these we pay for the invention that is to say for the beautiful form or colour or engraving and not for mere finish of execution we are doing good to humanity  so again the cutting of precious stones in all ordinary cases requires little exertion of any mental faculty some tact and judgment in avoiding flaws and so on but nothing to bring out the whole mind every person who wears cut jewels merely for the sake of their value is therefore a slavedriver  but the working of the goldsmith and the various designing of grouped jewellery and enamelwork may become the subject of the most noble human intelligence therefore money spent in the purchase of welldesigned plate of precious engraved vases cameos or enamels does good to humanity and in work of this kind jewels may be employed to heighten its splendour and their cutting is then a price paid for the attainment of a noble end and thus perfectly allowable  i shall perhaps press this law farther elsewhere but our immediate concern is chiefly with the second namely never to demand an exact finish when it does not lead to a noble end for observe i have only dwelt upon the rudeness of gothic or any other kind of imperfectness as admirable where it was impossible to get design or thought without it if you are to have the thought of a rough and untaught man you must have it in a rough and untaught way but from an educated man who can without effort express his thoughts in an educated way take the graceful expression and be thankful only get the thought and do not silence the peasant because he cannot speak good grammar or until you have taught him his grammar grammar and refinement are good things both only be sure of the better thing first and thus in art delicate finish is desirable from the greatest masters and is always given by them in some places michael angelo leonardo phidias perugino turner all finished with the most exquisite care and the finish they give always leads to the fuller accomplishment of their noble purpose but lower men than these cannot finish for it requires consummate knowledge to finish consummately and then we must take their thoughts as they are able to give them so the rule is simple always look for invention first and after that for such execution as will help the invention and as the inventor is capable of without painful effort and no more above all demand no refinement of execution where there is no thought for that is slaves work unredeemed rather choose rough work than smooth work so only that the practical purpose be answered and never imagine there is reason to be proud of anything that may be accomplished by patience and sandpaper  i shall only give one example which however will show the reader what i mean from the manufacture already alluded to that of glass our modern glass is exquisitely clear in its substance true in its form accurate in its cutting we are proud of this we ought to be ashamed of it the old venice glass was muddy inaccurate in all its forms and clumsily cut if at all and the old venetian was justly proud of it for there is this difference between the english and venetian workman that the former thinks only of accurately matching his patterns and getting his curves perfectly true and his edges perfectly sharp and becomes a mere machine for rounding curves and sharpening edges while the old venetian cared not a whit whether his edges were sharp or not but he invented a new design for every glass that he made and never moulded a handle or a lip without a new fancy in it and therefore though some venetian glass is ugly and clumsy enough when made by clumsy and uninventive workmen other venetian glass is so lovely in its forms that no price is too great for it and we never see the same form in it twice now you cannot have the finish and the varied form too if the workman is thinking about his edges he cannot be thinking of his design if of his design he cannot think of his edges choose whether you will pay for the lovely form or the perfect finish and choose at the same moment whether you will make the worker a man or a grindstone  nay but the reader interrupts meif the workman can design beautifully i would not have him kept at the furnace let him be taken away and made a gentleman and have a studio and design his glass there and i will have it blown and cut for him by common workmen and so i will have my design and my finish too  all ideas of this kind are founded upon two mistaken suppositions the first that one mans thoughts can be or ought to be executed by another mans hands the second that manual labour is a degradation when it is governed by intellect  on a large scale and in work determinable by line and rule it is indeed both possible and necessary that the thoughts of one man should be carried out by the labour of others in this sense i have already defined the best architecture to be the expression of the mind of manhood by the hands of childhood but on a smaller scale and in a design which cannot be mathematically defined one mans thoughts can never be expressed by another and the difference between the spirit of touch of the man who is inventing and of the man who is obeying directions is often all the difference between a great and a common work of art how wide the separation is between original and secondhand execution i shall endeavour to show elsewhere it is not so much to our purpose here as to mark the other and more fatal error of despising manual labour when governed by intellect for it is no less fatal an error to despise it when thus regulated by intellect than to value it for its own sake we are always in these days endeavouring to separate the two we want one man to be always thinking and another to be always working and we call one a gentleman and the other an operative whereas the workman ought often to be thinking and the thinker often to be working and both should be gentlemen in the best sense as it is we make both ungentle the one envying the other despising his brother and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy and only by thought that labour can be made happy and the two cannot be separated with impunity it would be well if all of us were good handicraftsmen in some kind and the dishonour of manual labour done away with altogether so that though there should still be a trenchant distinction of race between nobles and commoners there should not among the latter be a trenchant distinction of employment as between idle and working men or between men of liberal and illiberal professions all professions should be liberal and there should be less pride felt in peculiarity of employment and more in excellence of achievement and yet more in each several profession no master should be too proud to do its hardest work the painter should grind his own colours the architect work in the masons yard with his men the mastermanufacturer be himself a more skilful operative than any man in his mills and the distinction between one man and another be only in experience and skill and the authority and wealth which these must naturally and justly obtain  i should be led far from the matter in hand if i were to pursue this interesting subject enough i trust has been said to show the reader that the rudeness or imperfection which at first rendered the term gothic one of reproach is indeed when rightly understood one of the most noble characters of christian architecture and not only a noble but an essential one it seems a fantastic paradox but it is nevertheless a most important truth that no architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect and this is easily demonstrable for since the architect whom we will suppose capable of doing all in perfection cannot execute the whole with his own hands he must either make slaves of his workmen in the old greek and present english fashion and level his work to a slaves capacities which is to degrade it or else he must take his workmen as he finds them and let them show their weaknesses together with their strength which will involve the gothic imperfection but render the whole work as noble as the intellect of the age can make it  but the principle may be stated more broadly still i have confined the illustration of it to architecture but i must not leave it as if true of architecture only hitherto i have used the words imperfect and perfect merely to distinguish between work grossly unskilful and work executed with average precision and science and i have been pleading that any degree of unskilfulness should be admitted so only that the labourers mind had room for expression but accurately speaking no good work whatever can be perfect and the demand for perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of art  this for two reasons both based on everlasting laws the first that no great man ever stops working till he has reached his point of failure that is to say his mind is always far in advance of his powers of execution and the latter will now and then give way in trying to follow it besides that he will always give to the inferior portions of his work only such inferior attention as they require and according to his greatness he becomes so accustomed to the feeling of dissatisfaction with the best he can do that in moments of lassitude or anger with himself he will not care though the beholder be dissatisfied also i believe there has only been one man who would not acknowledge this necessity and strove always to reach perfection leonardo the end of his vain effort being merely that he would take ten years to a picture and leave it unfinished and therefore if we are to have great men working at all or less men doing their best the work will be imperfect however beautiful of human work none but what is bad can be perfect in its own bad way161  the second reason is that imperfection is in some sort essential to all that we know of life it is the sign of life in a mortal body that is to say of a state of progress and change nothing that lives is or can be rigidly perfect part of it is decaying part nascent the foxglove blossoma third part bud a third part past a third part in full bloomis a type of the life of this world and in all things that live there are certain irregularities and deficiencies which are not only signs of life but sources of beauty no human face is exactly the same in its lines on each side no leaf perfect in its lobes no branch in its symmetry all admit irregularity as they imply change and to banish imperfection is to destroy expression to check exertion to paralyze vitality all things are literally better lovelier and more beloved for the imperfections which have been divinely appointed that the law of human life may be effort and the law of human judgment mercy  accept this then for a universal law that neither architecture nor any other noble work of man can be good unless it be imperfect and let us be prepared for the otherwise strange fact which we shall discern clearly as we approach the period of the renaissance that the first cause of the fall of the arts of europe was a relentless requirement of perfection incapable alike either of being silenced by veneration for greatness or softened into forgiveness of simplicity  thus far then of the rudeness or savageness which is the first mental element of gothic architecture it is an element in many other healthy architectures also as in byzantine and romanesque but true gothic cannot exist without it  the second mental element above named was changefulness or variety  i have already enforced the allowing independent operation to the inferior workman simply as a duty to him and as ennobling the architecture by rendering it more christian we have now to consider what reward we obtain for the performance of this duty namely the perpetual variety of every feature of the building  wherever the workman is utterly enslaved the parts of the building must of course be absolutely like each other for the perfection of his execution can only be reached by exercising him in doing one thing and giving him nothing else to do the degree in which the workman is degraded may be thus known at a glance by observing whether the several parts of the building are similar or not and if as in greek work all the capitals are alike and all the mouldings unvaried then the degradation is complete if as in egyptian or ninevite work though the manner of executing certain figures is always the same the order of design is perpetually varied the degradation is less total if as in gothic work there is perpetual change both in design and execution the workman must have been altogether set free  how much the beholder gains from the liberty of the labourer may perhaps be questioned in england where one of the strongest instincts in nearly every mind is that love of order which makes us desire that our house windows should pair like our carriage horses and allows us to yield our faith unhesitatingly to architectural theories which fix a form for everything and forbid variation from it i would not impeach love of order it is one of the most useful elements of the english mind it helps us in our commerce and in all purely practical matters and it is in many cases one of the foundation stones of morality only do not let us suppose that love of order is love of art it is true that order in its highest sense is one of the necessities of art just as time is a necessity of music but love of order has no more to do with our right enjoyment of architecture or painting than love of punctuality with the appreciation of an opera experience i fear teaches us that accurate and methodical habits in daily life are seldom characteristic of those who either quickly perceive or richly possess the creative powers of art there is however nothing inconsistent between the two instincts and nothing to hinder us from retaining our business habits and yet fully allowing and enjoying the noblest gifts of invention we already do so in every other branch of art except architecture and we only do not so there because we have been taught that it would be wrong our architects gravely inform us that as there are four rules of arithmetic there are five orders of architecture we in our simplicity think that this sounds consistent and believe them they inform us also that there is one proper form for corinthian capitals another for doric and another for ionic we considering that there is also a proper form for the letters a b and c think that this also sounds consistent and accept the proposition understanding therefore that one form of the said capitals is proper and no other and having a conscientious horror of all impropriety we allow the architect to provide us with the said capitals of the proper form in such and such a quantity and in all other points to take care that the legal forms are observed which having done we rest in forced confidence that we are well housed  but our higher instincts are not deceived we take no pleasure in the building provided for us resembling that which we take in a new book or a new picture we may be proud of its size complacent in its correctness and happy in its convenience we may take the same pleasure in its symmetry and workmanship as in a wellordered room or a skilful piece of manufacture and this we suppose to be all the pleasure that architecture was ever intended to give us the idea of reading a building as we would read milton or dante and getting the same kind of delight out of the stones as out of the stanzas never enters our minds for a moment and for good reasonthere is indeed rhythm in the verses quite as strict as the symmetries or rhythm of the architecture and a thousand times more beautiful but there is something else than rhythm the verses were neither made to order nor to match as the capitals were and we have therefore a kind of pleasure in them other than a sense of propriety but it requires a strong effort of common sense to shake ourselves quit of all that we have been taught for the last two centuries and wake to the perception of a truth just as simple and certain as it is new that great art whether expressing itself in words colours or stones does not say the same thing over and over again that the merit of architectural as of every other art consists in its saying new and different things that to repeat itself is no more a characteristic of genius in marble than it is of genius in print and that we may without offending any laws of good taste require of an architect as we do of a novelist that he should be not only correct but entertaining  yet all this is true and selfevident only hidden from us as many other selfevident things are by false teaching nothing is a great work of art for the production of which either rules or models can be given exactly so far as architecture works on known rules and from given models it is not an art but a manufacture and it is of the two procedures rather less rational because more easy to copy capitals or mouldings from phidias and call ourselves architects than to copy heads and hands from titian and call ourselves painters  let us then understand at once that change or variety is as much a necessity to the human heart and brain in buildings as in books that there is no merit though there is some occasional use in monotony and that we must no more expect to derive either pleasure or profit from an architecture whose ornaments are of one pattern and whose pillars are of one proportion than we should out of a universe in which the clouds were all of one shape and the trees all of one size  and this we confess in deeds though not in words all the pleasure which the people of the nineteenth century take in art is in pictures sculpture minor objects of virtù or mediæval architecture which we enjoy under the term picturesque no pleasure is taken anywhere in modern buildings and we find all men of true feeling delighting to escape out of modern cities into natural scenery hence as i shall hereafter show that peculiar love of landscape which is characteristic of the age it would be well if in all other matters we were as ready to put up with what we dislike for the sake of compliance with established law as we are in architecture  how so debased a law ever came to be established we shall see when we come to describe the renaissance schools here we have only to note as the second most essential element of the gothic spirit that it broke through that law wherever it found it in existence it not only dared but delighted in the infringement of every servile principle and invented a series of forms of which the merit was not merely that they were new but that they were capable of perpetual novelty the pointed arch was not merely a bold variation from the round but it admitted of millions of variations in itself for the proportions of a pointed arch are changeable to infinity while a circular arch is always the same the grouped shaft was not merely a bold variation from the single one but it admitted of millions of variations in its grouping and in the proportions resultant from its grouping the introduction of tracery was not only a startling change in the treatment of window lights but admitted endless changes in the interlacement of the tracery bars themselves so that while in all living christian architecture the love of variety exists the gothic schools exhibited that love in culminating energy and their influence wherever it extended itself may be sooner and farther traced by this character than by any other the tendency to the adoption of gothic types being always first shown by greater irregularity and richer variation in the forms of the architecture it is about to supersede long before the appearance of the pointed arch or of any other recognizable outward sign of the gothic mind  we must however herein note carefully what distinction there is between a healthy and a diseased love of change for as it was in healthy love of change that the gothic architecture rose it was partly in consequence of diseased love of change that it was destroyed in order to understand this clearly it will be necessary to consider the different ways in which change and monotony are presented to us in nature both having their use like darkness and light and the one incapable of being enjoyed without the other change being most delightful after some prolongation of monotony as light appears most brilliant after the eyes have been for some time closed  i believe that the true relations of monotony and change may be most simply understood by observing them in music we may therein notice first that there is a sublimity and majesty in monotony which there is not in rapid or frequent variation this is true throughout all nature the greater part of the sublimity of the sea depends on its monotony so also that of desolate moor and mountain scenery and especially the sublimity of motion as in the quiet unchanged fall and rise of an engine beam so also there is sublimity in darkness which there is not in light  again monotony after a certain time or beyond a certain degree becomes either uninteresting or intolerable and the musician is obliged to break it in one or two ways either while the air or passage is perpetually repeated its notes are variously enriched and harmonized or else after a certain number of repeated passages an entirely new passage is introduced which is more or less delightful according to the length of the previous monotony nature of course uses both these kinds of variation perpetually the seawaves resembling each other in general mass but none like its brother in minor divisions and curves are a monotony of the first kind the great plain broken by an emergent rock or clump of trees is a monotony of the second  farther in order to the enjoyment of the change in either case a certain degree of patience is required from the hearer or observer in the first case he must be satisfied to endure with patience the recurrence of the great masses of sound or form and to seek for entertainment in a careful watchfulness of the minor details in the second case he must bear patiently the infliction of the monotony for some moments in order to feel the full refreshment of the change this is true even of the shortest musical passage in which the element of monotony is employed in cases of more majestic monotony the patience required is so considerable that it becomes a kind of paina price paid for the future pleasure  again the talent of the composer is not in the monotony but in the changes he may show feeling and taste by his use of monotony in certain places or degrees that is to say by his various employment of it but it is always in the new arrangement or invention that his intellect is shown and not in the monotony which relieves it  lastly if the pleasure of change be too often repeated it ceases to be delightful for then change itself becomes monotonous and we are driven to seek delight in extreme and fantastic degrees of it this is the diseased love of change of which we have above spoken  from these facts we may gather generally that monotony is and ought to be in itself painful to us just as darkness is that an architecture which is altogether monotonous is a dark or dead architecture and of those who love it it may be truly said they love darkness rather than light but monotony in certain measure used in order to give value to change and above all that transparent monotony which like the shadows of a great painter suffers all manner of dimly suggested form to be seen through the body of it is an essential in architectural as in all other composition and the endurance of monotony has about the same place in a healthy mind that the endurance of darkness has that is to say as a strong intellect will have pleasure in the solemnities of storm and twilight and in the broken and mysterious lights that gleam among them rather than in mere brilliancy and glare while a frivolous mind will dread the shadow and the storm and as a great man will be ready to endure much darkness of fortune in order to reach greater eminence of power or felicity while an inferior man will not pay the price exactly in like manner a great mind will accept or even delight in monotony which would be wearisome to an inferior intellect because it has more patience and power of expectation and is ready to pay the full price for the great future pleasure of change but in all cases it is not that the noble nature loves monotony anymore than it loves darkness or pain but it can bear with it and receives a high pleasure in the endurance or patience a pleasure necessary to the wellbeing of this world while those who will not submit to the temporary sameness but rush from one change to another gradually dull the edge of change itself and bring a shadow and weariness over the whole world from which there is no more escape  from these general uses of variety in the economy of the world we may at once understand its use and abuse in architecture the variety of the gothic schools is the more healthy and beautiful because in many cases it is entirely unstudied and results not from the mere love of change but from practical necessities for in one point of view gothic is not only the best but the only rational architecture as being that which can fit itself most easily to all services vulgar or noble undefined in its slope of roof height of shaft breadth of arch or disposition of ground plan it can shrink into a turret expand into a hall coil into a staircase or spring into a spire with undegraded grace and unexhausted energy and whenever it finds occasion for change in its form or purpose it submits to it without the slightest sense of loss either to its unity or majestysubtle and flexible like a fiery serpent but ever attentive to the voice of the charmer and it is one of the chief virtues of the gothic builders that they never suffered ideas of outside symmetries and consistencies to interfere with the real use and value of what they did if they wanted a window they opened one a room they added one a buttress they built one utterly regardless of any established conventionalities of external appearance knowing as indeed it always happened that such daring interruptions of the formal plan would rather give additional interest to its symmetry than injure it so that in the best times of gothic a useless window would rather have been opened in an unexpected place for the sake of the surprise than a useful one forbidden for the sake of symmetry every successive architect employed upon a great work built the pieces he added in his own way utterly regardless of the style adopted by his predecessors and if two towers were raised in nominal correspondence at the sides of a cathedral front one was nearly sure to be different from the other and in each the style at the top to be different from the style at the bottom  these marked variations were however only permitted as part of the great system of perpetual change which ran through every member of gothic design and rendered it as endless a field for the beholders inquiry as for the builders imagination change which in the best schools is subtle and delicate and rendered more delightful by intermingling of a noble monotony in the more barbaric schools is somewhat fantastic and redundant but in all a necessary and constant condition of the life of the school sometimes the variety is in one feature sometimes in another it may be in the capitals or crockets in the niches or the traceries or in all together but in some one or other of the features it will be found always if the mouldings are constant the surface sculpture will change if the capitals are of a fixed design the traceries will change if the traceries are monotonous the capitals will change and if even as in some fine schools the early english for example there is the slightest approximation to an unvarying type of mouldings capitals and floral decoration the variety is found in the disposition of the masses and in the figure sculpture  i must now refer for a moment before we quit the consideration of this the second mental element of gothic to the opening of the third chapter of the seven lamps of architecture in which the distinction was drawn § 2 between man gathering and man governing between his acceptance of the sources of delight from nature and his development of authoritative or imaginative power in their arrangement for the two mental elements not only of gothic but of all good architecture which we have just been examining belong to it and are admirable in it chiefly as it is more than any other subject of art the work of man and the expression of the average power of man a picture or poem is often little more than a feeble utterance of mans admiration of something out of himself but architecture approaches more to a creation of his own born of his necessities and expressive of his nature it is also in some sort the work of the whole race while the picture or statue are the work of one only in most cases more highly gifted than his fellows and therefore we may expect that the first two elements of good architecture should be expressive of some great truths commonly belonging to the whole race and necessary to be understood or felt by them in all their work that they do under the sun and observe what they are the confession of imperfection and the confession of desire of change the building of the bird and the bee needs not express anything like this it is perfect and unchanging but just because we are something better than birds or bees our building must confess that we have not reached the perfection we can imagine and cannot rest in the condition we have attained if we pretend to have reached either perfection or satisfaction we have degraded ourselves and our work gods work only may express that but ours may never have that sentence written upon itand behold it was very good and observe again it is not merely as it renders the edifice a book of various knowledge or a mine of precious thought that variety is essential to its nobleness the vital principle is not the love of knowledge but the love of change it is that strange disquietude of the gothic spirit that is its greatness that restlessness of the dreaming mind that wanders hither and thither among the niches and flickers feverishly around the pinnacles and frets and fades in labyrinthine knots and shadows along wall and roof and yet is not satisfied nor shall be satisfied the greek could stay in his triglyph furrow and be at peace but the work of the gothic heart is fretwork still and it can neither rest in nor from its labour but must pass on sleeplessly until its love of change shall be pacified for ever in the change that must come alike on them that wake and them that sleep  last because the least essential of the constituent elements of this noble school was placed that of redundancethe uncalculating bestowal of the wealth of its labour there is indeed much gothic and that of the best period in which this element is hardly traceable and which depends for its effect almost exclusively on loveliness of simple design and grace of uninvolved proportion still in the most characteristic buildings a certain portion of their effect depends upon accumulation of ornament and many of those which have most influence on the minds of men have attained it by means of this attribute alone and although by careful study of the school it is possible to arrive at a condition of taste which shall be better contented by a few perfect lines than by a whole façade covered with fretwork the building which only satisfies such a taste is not to be considered the best for the very first requirement of gothic architecture being as we saw above that it shall both admit the aid and appeal to the admiration of the rudest as well as the most refined minds the richness of the work is paradoxical as the statement may appear a part of its humility no architecture is so haughty as that which is simple which refuses to address the eye except in a few clear and forceful lines which implies in offering so little to our regards that all it has offered is perfect and disdains either by the complexity of the attractiveness of its features to embarrass our investigation or betray us into delight that humility which is the very life of the gothic school is shown not only in the imperfection but in the accumulation of ornament the inferior rank of the workman is often shown as much in the richness as the roughness of his work and if the cooperation of every hand and the sympathy of every heart are to be received we must be content to allow the redundance which disguises the failure of the feeble and wins the regard of the inattentive there are however far nobler interests mingling in the gothic heart with the rude love of decorative accumulation a magnificent enthusiasm which feels as if it never could do enough to reach the fulness of its ideal an unselfishness of sacrifice which would rather cast fruitless labour before the altar than stand idle in the market and finally a profound sympathy with the fulness and wealth of the material universe rising out of that naturalism whose operation we have already endeavoured to define the sculptor who sought for his models among the forest leaves could not but quickly and deeply feel that complexity need not involve the loss of grace nor richness that of repose and every hour which he spent in the study of the minute and various work of nature made him feel more forcibly the barrenness of what was best in that of man nor is it to be wondered at that seeing her perfect and exquisite creations poured forth in a profusion which conception could not grasp nor calculation sum he should think that it ill became him to be niggardly of his own rude craftsmanship and where he saw throughout the universe a faultless beauty lavished on measureless spaces of broidered field and blooming mountain to grudge his poor and imperfect labour to the few stones that he had raised one upon another for habitation or memorial the years of his life passed away before his task was accomplished but generation succeeded generation with unwearied enthusiasm and the cathedral front was at last lost in the tapestry of its traceries like a rock among the thickets and herbage of spring     157 the third kind of ornament the renaissance is that in which   the inferior detail becomes principal the executor of every minor   portion being required to exhibit skill and possess knowledge as   great as that which is possessed by the master of the design and   in the endeavour to endow him with this skill and knowledge his   own original power is overwhelmed and the whole building becomes a   wearisome exhibition of welleducated imbecility we must fully   inquire into the nature of this form of error when we arrive at   the examination of the renaissance schools ruskin    158 job xix 26    159 matthew viii 9    160 vide preface to fair maid of perth

ruskins mind as early as 1846     he actually wrote it in the six months between november 1848 and     april 1849 it is the first of five illustrated volumes embodying     the results of seven years devoted to the study of the principles     and ideals of gothic architecture the other volumes being the     stones of venice and examples of the architecture of venice     1851 in the first edition of the seven lamps the plates were     not only all drawn but also etched by his own hand ruskin at a     later time wrote that the purpose of the seven lamps was to     show that certain right states of temper and moral feeling were     the magic powers by which all good architecture had been     produced he is really applying here the same tests of truth and     sincerity that he employed in modern painters chronologically     this volume and the others treating of architecture come between     the composition of volumes ii and iii of modern painters     professor charles eliot norton writes that the seven lamps is     the first treatise in english to teach the real significance of     architecture as the most trustworthy record of the life and faith     of nations the following selections form the closing chapters of     the volume and have a peculiar interest as anticipating the     social and political ideas which came to colour all his later     work     the lamp of memory   among the hours of his life to which the writer looks back with peculiar gratitude as having been marked by more than ordinary fulness of joy or clearness of teaching is one passed now some years ago near time of sunset among the broken masses of pine forest which skirt the course of the ain above the village of champagnole in the jura it is a spot which has all the solemnity with none of the savageness of the alps where there is a sense of a great power beginning to be manifested in the earth and of a deep and majestic concord in the rise of the long low lines of piny hills the first utterance of those mighty mountain symphonies soon to be more loudly lifted and wildly broken along the battlements of the alps but their strength is as yet restrained and the far reaching ridges of pastoral mountain succeed each other like the long and sighing swell which moves over quiet waters from some far off stormy sea and there is a deep tenderness pervading that vast monotony the destructive forces and the stern expression of the central ranges are alike withdrawn no frostploughed dustencumbered paths of ancient glacier fret the soft jura pastures no splintered heaps of ruin break the fair ranks of her forest no pale defiled or furious rivers rend their rude and changeful ways among her rocks patiently eddy by eddy the clear green streams wind along their wellknown beds and under the dark quietness of the undisturbed pines there spring up year by year such company of joyful flowers as i know not the like of among all the blessings of the earth it was spring time too and all were coming forth in clusters crowded for very love there was room enough for all but they crushed their leaves into all manner of strange shapes only to be nearer each other there was the wood anemone star after star closing every now and then into nebulae and there was the oxalis troop by troop like virginal processions of the mois de marie162 the dark vertical clefts in the limestone choked up with them as with heavy snow and touched with ivy on the edgesivy as light and lovely as the vine and ever and anon a blue gush of violets and cowslip bells in sunny places and in the more open ground the vetch and comfrey and mezereon and the small sapphire buds of the polygala alpina and the wild strawberry just a blossom or two all showered amidst the golden softness of deep warm ambercoloured moss i came out presently on the edge of the ravine the solemn murmur of its waters rose suddenly from beneath mixed with the singing of the thrushes among the pine boughs and on the opposite side of the valley walled all along as it was by grey cliffs of limestone there was a hawk sailing slowly off their brow touching them nearly with his wings and with the shadows of the pines flickering upon his plumage from above but with the fall of a hundred fathoms under his breast and the curling pools of the green river gliding and glittering dizzily beneath him their foam globes moving with him as he flew it would be difficult to conceive a scene less dependent upon any other interest than that of its own secluded and serious beauty but the writer well remembers the sudden blankness and chill which were cast upon it when he endeavoured in order more strictly to arrive at the sources of its impressiveness to imagine it for a moment a scene in some aboriginal forest of the new continent the flowers in an instant lost their light the river its music the hills became oppressively desolate a heaviness in the boughs of the darkened forest showed how much of their former power had been dependent upon a life which was not theirs how much of the glory of the imperishable or continually renewed creation is reflected from things more precious in their memories than it in its renewing those ever springing flowers and ever flowing streams had been dyed by the deep colours of human endurance valour and virtue and the crests of the sable hills that rose against the evening sky received a deeper worship because their far shadows fell eastward over the iron wall of joux and the foursquare keep of granson  it is as the centralization and protectress of this sacred influence that architecture is to be regarded by us with the most serious thought we may live without her and worship without her but we cannot remember without her how cold is all history how lifeless all imagery compared to that which the living nation writes and the uncorrupted marble bearshow many pages of doubtful record might we not often spare for a few stones left one upon another the ambition of the old babel builders was well directed for this world163 there are but two strong conquerors of the forgetfulness of men poetry and architecture and the latter in some sort includes the former and is mightier in its reality it is well to have not only what men have thought and felt but what their hands have handled and their strength wrought and their eyes beheld all the days of their life the age of homer is surrounded with darkness his very personality with doubt not so that of pericles and the day is coming when we shall confess that we have learned more of greece out of the crumbled fragments of her sculpture than even from her sweet singers or soldier historians and if indeed there be any profit in our knowledge of the past or any joy in the thought of being remembered hereafter which can give strength to present exertion or patience to present endurance there are two duties respecting national architecture whose importance it is impossible to overrate the first to render the architecture of the day historical and the second to preserve as the most precious of inheritances that of past ages  it is in the first of these two directions that memory may truly be said to be the sixth lamp of architecture for it is in becoming memorial or monumental that a true perfection is attained by civil and domestic buildings and this partly as they are with such a view built in a more stable manner and partly as their decorations are consequently animated by a metaphorical or historical meaning  as regards domestic buildings there must always be a certain limitation to views of this kind in the power as well as in the hearts of men still i cannot but think it an evil sign of a people when their houses are built to last for one generation only there is a sanctity in a good mans house which cannot be renewed in every tenement that rises on its ruins and i believe that good men would generally feel this and that having spent their lives happily and honourably they would be grieved at the close of them to think that the place of their earthly abode which had seen and seemed almost to sympathize in all their honour their gladness or their sufferingthat this with all the record it bare of them and of all material things that they had loved and ruled over and set the stamp of themselves uponwas to be swept away as soon as there was room made for them in the grave that no respect was to be shown to it no affection felt for it no good to be drawn from it by their children that though there was a monument in the church there was no warm monument in the hearth and house to them that all that they ever treasured was despised and the places that had sheltered and comforted them were dragged down to the dust i say that a good man would fear this and that far more a good son a noble descendant would fear doing it to his fathers house i say that if men lived like men indeed their houses would be templestemples which we should hardly dare to injure and in which it would make us holy to be permitted to live and there must be a strange dissolution of natural affection a strange unthankfulness for all that homes have given and parents taught a strange consciousness that we have been unfaithful to our fathers honour or that our own lives are not such as would make our dwellings sacred to our children when each man would fain build to himself and build for the little revolution of his own life only and i look upon those pitiful concretions of lime and clay which spring up in mildewed forwardness out of the kneaded fields about our capitalupon those thin tottering foundationless shells of splintered wood and imitated stoneupon those gloomy rows of formalized minuteness alike without difference and without fellowship as solitary as similarnot merely with the careless disgust of an offended eye not merely with sorrow for a desecrated landscape but with a painful foreboding that the roots of our national greatness must be deeply cankered when they are thus loosely struck in their native ground that those comfortless and unhonoured dwellings are the signs of a great and spreading spirit of popular discontent that they mark the time when every mans aim is to be in some more elevated sphere than his natural one and every mans past life is his habitual scorn when men build in the hope of leaving the places they have built and live in the hope of forgetting the years that they have lived when the comfort the peace the religion of home have ceased to be felt and the crowded tenements of a struggling and restless population differ only from the tents of the arab or the gipsy by their less healthy openness to the air of heaven and less happy choice of their spot of earth by their sacrifice of liberty without the gain of rest and of stability without the luxury of change  this is no slight no consequenceless evil it is ominous infectious and fecund of other fault and misfortune when men do not love their hearths nor reverence their thresholds it is a sign that they have dishonoured both and that they have never acknowledged the true universality of that christian worship which was indeed to supersede the idolatry but not the piety of the pagan our god is a household god as well as a heavenly one he has an altar in every mans dwelling let men look to it when they rend it lightly and pour out its ashes it is not a question of mere ocular delight it is no question of intellectual pride or of cultivated and critical fancy how and with what aspect of durability and of completeness the domestic buildings of a nation shall be raised it is one of those moral duties not with more impunity to be neglected because the perception of them depends on a finely toned and balanced conscientiousness to build our dwellings with care and patience and fondness and diligent completion and with a view to their duration at least for such a period as in the ordinary course of national revolutions might be supposed likely to extend to the entire alteration of the direction of local interests this at the least but it would be better if in every possible instance men built their own houses on a scale commensurate rather with their condition at the commencement than their attainments at the termination of their worldly career and built them to stand as long as human work at its strongest can be hoped to stand recording to their children what they had been and from what if so it had been permitted them they had risen and when houses are thus built we may have that true domestic architecture the beginning of all other which does not disdain to treat with respect and thoughtfulness the small habitation as well as the large and which invests with the dignity of contented manhood the narrowness of worldly circumstance  i look to this spirit of honourable proud peaceful selfpossession this abiding wisdom of contented life as probably one of the chief sources of great intellectual power in all ages and beyond dispute as the very primal source of the great architecture of old italy and france to this day the interest of their fairest cities depends not on the isolated richness of palaces but on the cherished and exquisite decoration of even the smallest tenements of their proud periods the most elaborate piece of architecture in venice is a small house at the head of the grand canal consisting of a ground floor with two storeys above three windows in the first and two in the second many of the most exquisite buildings are on the narrower canals and of no larger dimensions one of the most interesting pieces of fifteenthcentury architecture in north italy is a small house in a back street behind the marketplace of vicenza it bears date 1481 and the motto il nest rose sans épine it has also only a ground floor and two storeys with three windows in each separated by rich flowerwork and with balconies supported the central one by an eagle with open wings the lateral ones by winged griffins standing on cornucopiæ the idea that a house must be large in order to be well built is altogether of modern growth and is parallel with the idea that no picture can be historical except of a size admitting figures larger than life  i would have then our ordinary dwellinghouses built to last and built to be lovely as rich and full of pleasantness as may be within and without with what degree of likeness to each other in style and manner i will say presently under another head164 but at all events with such differences as might suit and express each mans character and occupation and partly his history this right over the house i conceive belongs to its first builder and is to be respected by his children and it would be well that blank stones should be left in places to be inscribed with a summary of his life and of its experience raising thus the habitation into a kind of monument and developing into more systematic instructiveness that good custom which was of old universal and which still remains among some of the swiss and germans of acknowledging the grace of gods permission to build and possess a quiet restingplace in such sweet words as may well close our speaking of these things i have taken them from the front of a cottage lately built among the green pastures which descend from the village of grindelwald to the lower glacier      mit herzlichem vertrauen     hat johannes mooter und maria rubi     dieses haus bauen lassen     der liebe gott woll uns bewahren     vor allem unglück und gefahren     und es in segen lassen stehn     auf der reise durch diese jammerzeit     nach dem himmlischen paradiese     wo alle frommen wohnen     da wird gott sie belohnen     mil der friedenskrone         zu alle ewigkeit165  in public buildings the historical purpose should be still more definite it is one of the advantages of gothic architecturei use the word gothic in the most extended sense as broadly opposed to classicalthat it admits of a richness of record altogether unlimited its minute and multitudinous sculptural decorations afford means of expressing either symbolically or literally all that need be known of national feeling or achievement more decoration will indeed be usually required than can take so elevated a character and much even in the most thoughtful periods has been left to the freedom of fancy or suffered to consist of mere repetitions of some national bearing or symbol it is however generally unwise even in mere surface ornament to surrender the power and privilege of variety which the spirit of gothic architecture admits much more in important featurescapitals of columns or bosses and stringcourses as of course in all confessed hasreliefs better the rudest work that tells a story or records a fact than the richest without meaning there should not be a single ornament put upon great civic buildings without some intellectual intention actual representation of history has in modern times been checked by a difficulty mean indeed but steadfast that of unmanageable costume nevertheless by a sufficiently bold imaginative treatment and frank use of symbols all such obstacles may be vanquished not perhaps in the degree necessary to produce sculpture in itself satisfactory but at all events so as to enable it to become a grand and expressive element of architectural composition take for example the management of the capitals of the ducal palace at venice history as such was indeed entrusted to the painters of its interior but every capital of its arcades was filled with meaning the large one the corner stone of the whole next the entrance was devoted to the symbolization of abstract justice above it is a sculpture of the judgment of solomon remarkable for a beautiful subjection in its treatment to its decorative purpose the figures if the subject had been entirely composed of them would have awkwardly interrupted the line of the angle and diminished its apparent strength and therefore in the midst of them entirely without relation to them and indeed actually between the executioner and interceding mother there rises the ribbed trunk of a massy tree which supports and continues the shaft of the angle and whose leaves above overshadow and enrich the whole the capital below bears among its leafage a throned figure of justice trajan doing justice to the widow aristotle che die legge and one or two other subjects now unintelligible from decay the capitals next in order represent the virtues and vices in succession as preservative or destructive of national peace and power concluding with faith with the inscription fides optima in deo est a figure is seen on the opposite side of the capital worshipping the sun after these one or two capitals are fancifully decorated with birds and then come a series representing first the various fruits then the national costumes and then the animals of the various countries subject to venetian rule  now not to speak of any more important public building let us imagine our own india house adorned in this way by historical or symbolical sculpture massively built in the first place then chased with hasreliefs of our indian battles and fretted with carvings of oriental foliage or inlaid with oriental stones and the more important members of its decoration composed of groups of indian life and landscape and prominently expressing the phantasms of hindoo worship in their subjection to the cross would not one such work be better than a thousand histories if however we have not the invention necessary for such efforts or if which is probably one of the most noble excuses we can offer for our deficiency in such matters we have less pleasure in talking about ourselves even in marble than the continental nations at least we have no excuse for any want of care in the points which insure the buildings endurance and as this question is one of great interest in its relations to the choice of various modes of decoration it will be necessary to enter into it at some length  the benevolent regards and purposes of men in masses seldom can be supposed to extend beyond their own generation they may look to posterity as an audience may hope for its attention and labour for its praise they may trust to its recognition of unacknowledged merit and demand its justice for contemporary wrong but all this is mere selfishness and does not involve the slightest regard to or consideration of the interest of those by whose numbers we would fain swell the circle of our flatterers and by whose authority we would gladly support our presently disputed claims the idea of selfdenial for the sake of posterity of practising present economy for the sake of debtors yet unborn of planting forests that our descendants may live under their shade or of raising cities for future nations to inhabit never i suppose efficiently takes place among publicly recognized motives of exertion yet these are not the less our duties nor is our part fitly sustained upon the earth unless the range of our intended and deliberate usefulness include not only the companions but the successors of our pilgrimage god has lent us the earth for our life it is a great entail it belongs as much to those who are to come after us and whose names are already written in the book of creation as to us and we have no right by anything that we do or neglect to involve them in unnecessary penalties or deprive them of benefits which it was in our power to bequeath and this the more because it is one of the appointed conditions of the labour of men that in proportion to the time between the seedsowing and the harvest is the fulness of the fruit and that generally therefore the farther off we place our aim and the less we desire to be ourselves the witnesses of what we have laboured for the more wide and rich will be the measure of our success men cannot benefit those that are with them as they can benefit those who come after them and of all the pulpits from which human voice is ever sent forth there is none from which it reaches so far as from the grave  nor is there indeed any present loss in such respect for futurity every human action gains in honour in grace in all true magnificence by its regard to things that are to come it is the far sight the quiet and confident patience that above all other attributes separate man from man and near him to his maker and there is no action nor art whose majesty we may not measure by this test therefore when we build let us think that we build for ever let it not be for present delight nor for present use alone let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for and let us think as we lay stone on stone that a time is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them and that men will say as they look upon the labour and wrought substance of them see this our fathers did for us for indeed the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones nor in its gold its glory is in its age and in that deep sense of voicefulness of stern watching of mysterious sympathy nay even of approval or condemnation which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity it is in their lasting witness against men in their quiet contrast with the transitional character of all things in the strength which through the lapse of seasons and times and the decline and birth of dynasties and the changing of the face of the earth and of the limits of the sea maintains its sculptured shapeliness for a time insuperable connects forgotten and following ages with each other and half constitutes the identity as it concentrates the sympathy of nations it is in that golden stain of time that we are to look for the real light and colour and preciousness of architecture and it is not until a building has assumed this character till it has been entrusted with the fame and hallowed by the deeds of men till its walls have been witnesses of suffering and its pillars rise out of the shadows of death that its existence more lasting as it is than that of the natural objects of the world around it can be gifted with even so much as these possess of language and of life  for that period then we must build not indeed refusing to ourselves the delight of present completion nor hesitating to follow such portions of character as may depend upon delicacy of execution to the highest perfection of which they are capable even although we may know that in the course of years such details must perish but taking care that for work of this kind we sacrifice no enduring quality and that the building shall not depend for its impressiveness upon anything that is perishable this would indeed be the law of good composition under any circumstances the arrangement of the larger masses being always a matter of greater importance than the treatment of the smaller but in architecture there is much in that very treatment which is skilful or otherwise in proportion to its just regard to the probable effects of time and which is still more to be considered there is a beauty in those effects themselves which nothing else can replace and which it is our wisdom to consult and to desire for though hitherto we have been speaking of the sentiment of age only there is an actual beauty in the marks of it such and so great as to have become not unfrequently the subject of especial choice among certain schools of art and to have impressed upon those schools the character usually and loosely expressed by the term picturesque  now to return to our immediate subject it so happens that in architecture the superinduced and accidental beauty is most commonly inconsistent with the preservation of original character and the picturesque is therefore sought in ruin and supposed to consist in decay whereas even when so sought it consists in the mere sublimity of the rents or fractures or stains or vegetation which assimilate the architecture with the work of nature and bestow upon it those circumstances of colour and form which are universally beloved by the eye of man so far as this is done to the extinction of the true characters of the architecture it is picturesque and the artist who looks to the stem of the ivy instead of the shaft of the pillar is carrying out in more daring freedom the debased sculptors choice of the hair instead of the countenance but so far as it can be rendered consistent with the inherent character the picturesque or extraneous sublimity of architecture has just this of nobler function in it than that of any other object whatsoever that it is an exponent of age of that in which as has been said the greatest glory of the building consists and therefore the external signs of this glory having power and purpose greater than any belonging to their mere sensible beauty may be considered as taking rank among pure and essential characters so essential to my mind that i think a building cannot be considered as in its prime until four or five centuries have passed over it and that the entire choice and arrangement of its details should have reference to their appearance after that period so that none should be admitted which would suffer material injury either by the weatherstaining or the mechanical degradation which the lapse of such a period would necessitate  it is not my purpose to enter into any of the questions which the application of this principle involves they are of too great interest and complexity to be even touched upon within my present limits but this is broadly to be noticed that those styles of architecture which are picturesque in the sense above explained with respect to sculpture that is to say whose decoration depends on the arrangement of points of shade rather than on purity of outline do not suffer but commonly gain in richness of effect when their details are partly worn away hence such styles preeminently that of french gothic should always be adopted when the materials to be employed are liable to degradation as brick sandstone or soft limestone and styles in any degree dependent on purity of line as the italian gothic must be practised altogether in hard and undecomposing materials granite serpentine or crystalline marbles there can be no doubt that the nature of the accessible materials influenced the formation of both styles and it should still more authoritatively determine our choice of either  it does not belong to my present plan to consider at length the second head of duty of which i have above spoken the preservation of the architecture we possess but a few words may be forgiven as especially necessary in modern times neither by the public nor by those who have the care of public monuments is the true meaning of the word restoration understood it means the most total destruction which a building can suffer a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter it is impossible as impossible as to raise the dead to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture that which i have above insisted upon as the life of the whole that spirit which is given only by the hand and eye of the workman never can be recalled another spirit may be given by another time and it is then a new building but the spirit of the dead workman cannot be summoned up and commanded to direct other hands and other thoughts and as for direct and simple copying it is palpably impossible what copying can there be of surfaces that have been worn half an inch down the whole finish of the work was in the half inch that is gone if you attempt to restore that finish you do it conjecturally if you copy what is left granting fidelity to be possible and what care or watchfulness or cost can secure it how is the new work better than the old there was yet in the old some life some mysterious suggestion of what it had been and of what it had lost some sweetness in the gentle lines which rain and sun had wrought there can be none in the brute hardness of the new carving look at the animals which i have given in plate xiv as an instance of living work and suppose the markings of the scales and hair once worn away or the wrinkles of the brows and who shall ever restore them the first step to restoration i have seen it and that again and againseen it on the baptistery of pisa seen it on the casa doro at venice seen it on the cathedral of lisieux is to dash the old work to pieces the second is usually to put up the cheapest and basest imitation which can escape detection but in all cases however careful and however laboured an imitation still a cold model of such parts as can be modelled with conjectural supplements and my experience has as yet furnished me with only one instance that of the palais de justice at rouen in which even this the utmost degree of fidelity which is possible has been attained or even attempted166  do not let us talk then of restoration the thing is a lie from beginning to end you may make a model of a building as you may of a corpse and your model may have the shell of the old walls within it as your cast might have the skeleton with what advantage i neither see nor care but the old building is destroyed and that more totally and mercilessly than if it had sunk into a heap of dust or melted into a mass of clay more has been gleaned out of desolated nineveh than ever will be out of rebuilt milan but it is said there may come a necessity for restoration granted look the necessity full in the face and understand it on its own terms it is a necessity for destruction accept it as such pull the building down throw its stones into neglected corners make ballast of them or mortar if you will but do it honestly and do not set up a lie in their place and look that necessity in the face before it comes and you may prevent it the principle of modern times a principle which i believe at least in france to be systematically acted on by the masons in order to find themselves work as the abbey of st ouen was pulled down by the magistrates of the town by way of giving work to some vagrants is to neglect buildings first and restore them afterwards take proper care of your monuments and you will not need to restore them a few sheets of lead put in time upon the roof a few dead leaves and sticks swept in time out of a watercourse will save both roof and walls from ruin watch an old building with an anxious care guard it as best you may and at any cost from every influence of dilapidation count its stones as you would jewels of a crown set watches about it as if at the gates of a besieged city bind it together with iron where it loosens stay it with timber where it declines do not care about the unsightliness of the aid better a crutch than a lost limb and do this tenderly and reverently and continually and many a generation will still be born and pass away beneath its shadow its evil day must come at last but let it come declaredly and openly and let no dishonouring and false substitute deprive it of the funeral offices of memory  of more wanton or ignorant ravage it is vain to speak my words will not reach those who commit them and yet be it heard or not i must not leave the truth unstated that it is again no question of expediency or feeling whether we shall preserve the buildings of past times or not we have no right whatever to touch them they are not ours they belong partly to those who built them and partly to all the generations of mankind who are to follow us the dead have still their right in them that which they laboured for the praise of achievement or the expression of religious feeling or whatsoever else it might be which in those buildings they intended to be permanent we have no right to obliterate what we have ourselves built we are at liberty to throw down but what other men gave their strength and wealth and life to accomplish their right over does not pass away with their death still less is the right to the use of what they have left vested in us only it belongs to all their successors it may hereafter be a subject of sorrow or a cause of injury to millions that we have consulted our present convenience by casting down such buildings as we choose to dispense with that sorrow that loss we have no right to inflict did the cathedral of avranches167 belong to the mob who destroyed it any more than it did to us who walk in sorrow to and fro over its foundation neither does any building whatever belong to those mobs who do violence to it for a mob it is and must be always it matters not whether enraged or in deliberate folly whether countless or sitting in committees the people who destroy anything causelessly are a mob and architecture is always destroyed causelessly a fair building is necessarily worth the ground it stands upon and will be so until central africa and america shall have become as populous as middlesex nor is any cause whatever valid as a ground for its destruction if ever valid certainly not now when the place both of the past and future is too much usurped in our minds by the restless and discontented present the very quietness of nature is gradually withdrawn from us thousands who once in their necessarily prolonged travel were subjected to an influence from the silent sky and slumbering fields more effectual than known or confessed now bear with them even there the ceaseless fever of their life and along the iron veins that traverse the frame of our country beat and flow the fiery pulses of its exertion hotter and faster every hour all vitality is concentrated through those throbbing arteries into the central cities the country is passed over like a green sea by narrow bridges and we are thrown back in continually closer crowds upon the city gates the only influence which can in any wise there take the place of that of the woods and fields is the power of ancient architecture do not part with it for the sake of the formal square or of the fenced and planted walk nor of the goodly street nor opened quay the pride of a city is not in these leave them to the crowd but remember that there will surely be some within the circuit of the disquieted walls who would ask for some other spots than these wherein to walk for some other forms to meet their sight familiarly like him168 who sat so often where the sun struck from the west to watch the lines of the dome of florence drawn on the deep sky or like those his hosts who could bear daily to behold from their palace chambers the places where their fathers lay at rest at the meeting of the dark streets of verona     162 mayday processions in honour of the virgin    163 genesis xi 4    164

has been my endeavour to show in the preceding pages how every form of noble architecture is in some sort the embodiment of the polity life history and religious faith of nations once or twice in doing this i have named a principle to which i would now assign a definite place among those which direct that embodiment the last place not only as that to which its own humility would incline but rather as belonging to it in the aspect of the crowning grace of all the rest that principle i mean to which polity owes its stability life its happiness faith its acceptance creation its continuanceobedience  nor is it the least among the sources of more serious satisfaction which i have found in the pursuit of a subject that at first appeared to bear but slightly on the grave interests of mankind that the conditions of material perfection which it leads me in conclusion to consider furnish a strange proof how false is the conception how frantic the pursuit of that treacherous phantom which men call liberty most treacherous indeed of all phantoms for the feeblest ray of reason might surely show us that not only its attainment but its being was impossible there is no such thing in the universe there can never be the stars have it not the earth has it not the sea has it not and we men have the mockery and semblance of it only for our heaviest punishment  in one of the noblest poems169 for its imagery and its music belonging to the recent school of our literature the writer has sought in the aspect of inanimate nature the expression of that liberty which having once loved he had seen among men in its true dyes of darkness but with what strange fallacy of interpretation since in one noble line of his invocation he has contradicted the assumptions of the rest and acknowledged the presence of a subjection surely not less severe because eternal how could he otherwise since if there be any one principle more widely than another confessed by every utterance or more sternly than another imprinted on every atom of the visible creation that principle is not liberty but law  the enthusiast would reply that by liberty he meant the law of liberty then why use the single and misunderstood word if by liberty you mean chastisement of the passions discipline of the intellect subjection of the will if you mean the fear of inflicting the shame of committing a wrong if you mean respect for all who are in authority and consideration for all who are in dependence veneration for the good mercy to the evil sympathy with the weak if you mean watchfulness over all thoughts temperance in all pleasures and perseverance in all toils if you mean in a word that service which is defined in the liturgy of the english church to be perfect freedom why do you name this by the same word by which the luxurious mean license and the reckless mean change by which the rogue means rapine and the fool equality by which the proud mean anarchy and the malignant mean violence call it by any name rather than this but its best and truest is obedience obedience is indeed founded on a kind of freedom else it would become mere subjugation but that freedom is only granted that obedience may be more perfect and thus while a measure of license is necessary to exhibit the individual energies of things the fairness and pleasantness and perfection of them all consist in their restraint compare a river that has burst its banks with one that is bound by them and the clouds that are scattered over the face of the whole heaven with those that are marshalled into ranks and orders by its winds so that though restraint utter and unrelaxing can never be comely this is not because it is in itself an evil but only because when too great it overpowers the nature of the thing restrained and so counteracts the other laws of which that nature is itself composed and the balance wherein consists the fairness of creation is between the laws of life and being in the things governed and the laws of general sway to which they are subjected and the suspension or infringement of either kind of law or literally disorder is equivalent to and synonymous with disease while the increase of both honour and beauty is habitually on the side of restraint or the action of superior law rather than of character or the action of inherent law the noblest word in the catalogue of social virtue is loyalty and the sweetest which men have learned in the pastures of the wilderness is fold  nor is this all but we may observe that exactly in proportion to the majesty of things in the scale of being is the completeness of their obedience to the laws that are set over them gravitation is less quietly less instantly obeyed by a grain of dust than it is by the sun and moon and the ocean falls and flows under influences which the lake and river do not recognize so also in estimating the dignity of any action or occupation of men there is perhaps no better test than the question are its laws strait for their severity will probably be commensurate with the greatness of the numbers whose labour it concentrates or whose interest it concerns  this severity must be singular therefore in the case of that art above all others whose productions are the most vast and the most common which requires for its practice the cooperation of bodies of men and for its perfection the perseverance of successive generations and taking into account also what we have before so often observed of architecture her continual influence over the emotions of daily life and her realism as opposed to the two sister arts which are in comparison but the picturing of stories and of dreams we might beforehand expect that we should find her healthy state and action dependent on far more severe laws than theirs that the license which they extend to the workings of individual mind would be withdrawn by her and that in assertion of the relations which she holds with all that is universally important to man she would set forth by her own majestic subjection some likeness of that on which mans social happiness and power depend we might therefore without the light of experience conclude that architecture never could flourish except when it was subjected to a national law as strict and as minutely authoritative as the laws which regulate religion policy and social relations nay even more authoritative than these because both capable of more enforcement as over more passive matter and needing more enforcement as the purest type not of one law nor of another but of the common authority of all but in this matter experience speaks more loudly than reason if there be any one condition which in watching the progress of architecture we see distinct and general if amidst the counterevidence of success attending opposite accidents of character and circumstance any one conclusion may be constantly and indisputably drawn it is this that the architecture of a nation is great only when it is as universal and as established as its language and when provincial differences of style are nothing more than so many dialects other necessities are matters of doubt nations have been alike successful in their architecture in times of poverty and of wealth in times of war and of peace in times of barbarism and of refinement under governments the most liberal or the most arbitrary but this one condition has been constant this one requirement clear in all places and at all times that the work shall be that of a school that no individual caprice shall dispense with or materially vary accepted types and customary decorations and that from the cottage to the palace and from the chapel to the basilica and from the garden fence to the fortress wall every member and feature of the architecture of the nation shall be as commonly current as frankly accepted as its language or its coin  a day never passes without our hearing our english architects called upon to be original and to invent a new style about as sensible and necessary an exhortation as to ask of a man who has never had rags enough on his back to keep out cold to invent a new mode of cutting a coat give him a whole coat first and let him concern himself about the fashion of it afterwards we want no new style of architecture who wants a new style of painting or sculpture but we want some style it is of marvellously little importance if we have a code of laws and they be good laws whether they be new or old foreign or native roman or saxon or norman or english laws but it is of considerable importance that we should have a code of laws of one kind or another and that code accepted and enforced from one side of the island to another and not one law made ground of judgment at york and another in exeter and in like manner it does not matter one marble splinter whether we have an old or new architecture but it matters everything whether we have an architecture truly so called or not that is whether an architecture whose laws might be taught at our schools from cornwall to northumberland as we teach english spelling and english grammar or an architecture which is to be invented fresh every time we build a workhouse or a parish school there seems to me to be a wonderful misunderstanding among the majority of architects at the present day as to the very nature and meaning of originality and of all wherein it consists originality in expression does not depend on invention of new words nor originality in poetry on invention of new measures nor in painting on invention of new colours or new modes of using them the chords of music the harmonies of colour the general principles of the arrangement of sculptural masses have been determined long ago and in all probability cannot be added to any more than they can be altered granting that they may be such additions or alterations are much more the work of time and of multitudes than of individual inventors we may have one van eyck170 who will be known as the introducer of a new style once in ten centuries but he himself will trace his invention to some accidental byplay or pursuit and the use of that invention will depend altogether on the popular necessities or instincts of the period originality depends on nothing of the kind a man who has the gift will take up any style that is going the style of his day and will work in that and be great in that and make everything that he does in it look as fresh as if every thought of it had just come down from heaven i do not say that he will not take liberties with his materials or with his rules i do not say that strange changes will not sometimes be wrought by his efforts or his fancies in both but those changes will be instructive natural facile though sometimes marvellous they will never be sought after as things necessary to his dignity or to his independence and those liberties will be like the liberties that a great speaker takes with the language not a defiance of its rules for the sake of singularity but inevitable uncalculated and brilliant consequences of an effort to express what the language without such infraction could not there may be times when as i have above described the life of an art is manifested in its changes and in its refusal of ancient limitations so there are in the life of an insect and there is great interest in the state of both the art and the insect at those periods when by their natural progress and constitutional power such changes are about to be wrought but as that would be both an uncomfortable and foolish caterpillar which instead of being contented with a caterpillars life and feeding on caterpillars food was always striving to turn itself into a chrysalis and as that would be an unhappy chrysalis which should lie awake at night and roll restlessly in its cocoon in efforts to turn itself prematurely into a moth so will that art be unhappy and unprosperous which instead of supporting itself on the food and contenting itself with the customs which have been enough for the support and guidance of other arts before it and like it is struggling and fretting under the natural limitations of its existence and striving to become something other than it is and though it is the nobility of the highest creatures to look forward to and partly to understand the changes which are appointed for them preparing for them beforehand and if as is usual with appointed changes they be into a higher state even desiring them and rejoicing in the hope of them yet it is the strength of every creature be it changeful or not to rest for the time being contented with the conditions of its existence and striving only to bring about the changes which it desires by fulfilling to the uttermost the duties for which its present state is appointed and continued  neither originality therefore nor change good though both may be and this is commonly a most merciful and enthusiastic supposition with respect to either is ever to be sought in itself or can ever be healthily obtained by any struggle or rebellion against common laws we want neither the one nor the other the forms of architecture already known are good enough for us and for far better than any of us and it will be time enough to think of changing them for better when we can use them as they are but there are some things which we not only want but cannot do without and which all the struggling and raving in the world nay more which all the real talent and resolution in england will never enable us to do without and these are obedience unity fellowship and order and all our schools of design and committees of taste all our academies and lectures and journalisms and essays all the sacrifices which we are beginning to make all the truth which there is in our english nature all the power of our english will and the life of our english intellect will in this matter be as useless as efforts and emotions in a dream unless we are contented to submit architecture and all art like other things to english law  i say architecture and all art for i believe architecture must be the beginning of arts and that the others must follow her in their time and order and i think the prosperity of our schools of painting and sculpture in which no one will deny the life though many the health depends upon that of our architecture i think that all will languish until that takes the lead and this i do not think but i proclaim as confidently as i would assert the necessity for the safety of society of an understood and strongly administered legal government our architecture will languish and that in the very dust until the first principle of common sense be manfully obeyed and an universal system of form and workmanship be everywhere adopted and enforced it may be said that this is impossible it may be soi fear it is so i have nothing to do with the possibility or impossibility of it i simply know and assert the necessity of it if it be impossible english art is impossible give it up at once you are wasting time and money and energy upon it and though you exhaust centuries and treasures and break hearts for it you will never raise it above the merest dilettanteism think not of it it is a dangerous vanity a mere gulph in which genius after genius will be swallowed up and it will not close and so it will continue to be unless the one bold and broad step be taken at the beginning we shall not manufacture art out of pottery and printed stuffs we shall not reason out art by our philosophy we shall not stumble upon art by our experiments nor create it by our fancies i do not say that we can even build it out of brick and stone but there is a chance for us in these and there is none else and that chance rests on the bare possibility of obtaining the consent both of architects and of the public to choose a style and to use it universally  how surely its principles ought at first to be limited we may easily determine by the consideration of the necessary modes of teaching any other branch of general knowledge when we begin to teach children writing we force them to absolute copyism and require absolute accuracy in the formation of the letters as they obtain command of the received modes of literal expression we cannot prevent their falling into such variations as are consistent with their feeling their circumstances or their characters so when a boy is first taught to write latin an authority is required of him for every expression he uses as he becomes master of the language he may take a license and feel his right to do so without any authority and yet write better latin than when he borrowed every separate expression in the same way our architects would have to be taught to write the accepted style we must first determine what buildings are to be considered augustan in their authority their modes of construction and laws of proportion are to be studied with the most penetrating care then the different forms and uses of their decorations are to be classed and catalogued as a german grammarian classes the powers of prepositions and under this absolute irrefragable authority we are to begin to work admitting not so much as an alteration in the depth of a cavetto171 or the breadth of a fillet then when our sight is once accustomed to the grammatical forms and arrangements and our thoughts familiar with the expression of them all when we can speak this dead language naturally and apply it to whatever ideas we have to render that is to say to every practical purpose of life then and not till then a license might be permitted and individual authority allowed to change or to add to the received forms always within certain limits the decorations especially might be made subjects of variable fancy and enriched with ideas either original or taken from other schools and thus in process of time and by a great national movement it might come to pass that a new style should arise as language itself changes we might perhaps come to speak italian instead of latin or to speak modern instead of old english but this would be a matter of entire indifference and a matter besides which no determination or desire could either hasten or prevent that alone which it is in our power to obtain and which it is our duty to desire is an unanimous style of some kind and such comprehension and practice of it as would enable us to adapt its features to the peculiar character of every

selections from lectures on art       ruskin was first elected to the slade professorship of fine art in     oxford in 1869 and held the chair continuously until 1878 when     he resigned because of illhealth and again from 1883 to 1885     the lectures on art were announced in the oxford university     gazette of january 28 1870 the general subject of the course     being the limits and elementary practice of art with leonardos     trattato della pittura as the textbook the lectures were     delivered between february 8 and march 23 1870 they appeared in     book form in july of the same year these lectures contain much of     his best and most mature thought of his most painstaking research     and keenest analysis talking with a friend in later years he     said i have taken more pains with the oxford lectures than with     anything else i have ever done and in the preface to the edition     of 1887 he began the following lectures were the most important     piece of my literary work done with unabated power best motive     and happiest concurrence of circumstance ruskin took his     professorship very seriously he spent almost infinite labour in     composing his more formal lectures and during the eight years     in which he held the chair he published six volumes of them not     to mention three italian guidebooks which came under his     interpretation of his professional dutiesthe real duty     involved in my oxford professorship cannot be completely done by     giving lectures in oxford only but  i ought also to give what     guidance i may to travellers in italy not only by lecturing and     writing did he fill the chair but he taught individuals founded     and endowed a drawing mastership and presented elaborately     catalogued collections to illustrate his subject his lecture     classes were always large and his work had a marked influence in     the university    inaugural   we see lately a most powerful impulse given to the production of costly works of art by the various causes which promote the sudden accumulation of wealth in the hands of private persons we have thus a vast and new patronage which in its present agency is injurious to our schools but which is nevertheless in a great degree earnest and conscientious and far from being influenced chiefly by motives of ostentation most of our rich men would be glad to promote the true interests of art in this country and even those who buy for vanity found their vanity on the possession of what they suppose to be best  it is therefore in a great measure the fault of artists themselves if they suffer from this partly unintelligent but thoroughly wellintended patronage if they seek to attract it by eccentricity to deceive it by superficial qualities or take advantage of it by thoughtless and facile production they necessarily degrade themselves and it together and have no right to complain afterwards that it will not acknowledge bettergrounded claims but if every painter of real power would do only what he knew to be worthy of himself and refuse to be involved in the contention for undeserved or accidental success there is indeed whatever may have been thought or said to the contrary true instinct enough in the public mind to follow such firm guidance it is one of the facts which the experience of thirty years enables me to assert without qualification that a really good picture is ultimately always approved and bought unless it is wilfully rendered offensive to the public by faults which the artist has been either too proud to abandon or too weak to correct  the development of whatever is healthful and serviceable in the two modes of impulse which we have been considering depends however ultimately on the direction taken by the true interest in art which has lately been aroused by the great and active genius of many of our living or but lately lost painters sculptors and architects it may perhaps surprise but i think it will please you to hear me or if you will forgive me in my own oxford the presumption of fancying that some may recognize me by an old name to hear the author of modern painters say that his chief error in earlier days was not in overestimating but in too slightly acknowledging the merit of living men the great painter whose power while he was yet among us i was able to perceive172 was the first to reprove me for my disregard of the skill of his fellowartists and with this inauguration of the study of the art of all timea study which can only by true modesty end in wise admirationit is surely well that i connect the record of these words of his spoken then too truly to myself and true always more or less for all who are untrained in that toilyou dont know how difficult it is  you will not expect me within the compass of this lecture to give you any analysis of the many kinds of excellent art in all the three great divisions which the complex demands of modern life and yet more varied instincts of modern genius have developed for pleasure or service it must be my endeavour in conjunction with my colleagues in other universities hereafter to enable you to appreciate these worthily in the hope that also the members of the royal academy and those of the institute of british architects may be induced to assist and guide the efforts of the universities by organizing such a system of art education for their own students as shall in future prevent the waste of genius in any mistaken endeavours especially removing doubt as to the proper substance and use of materials and requiring compliance with certain elementary principles of right in every picture and design exhibited with their sanction it is not indeed possible for talent so varied as that of english artists to be compelled into the formalities of a determined school but it must certainly be the function of every academical body to see that their younger students are guarded from what must in every school be error and that they are practised in the best methods of work hitherto known before their ingenuity is directed to the invention of others  i need scarcely refer except for the sake of completeness in my statement to one form of demand for art which is wholly unenlightened and powerful only for evilnamely the demand of the classes occupied solely in the pursuit of pleasure for objects and modes of art that can amuse indolence or excite passion there is no need for any discussion of these requirements or of their forms of influence though they are very deadly at present in their operation on sculpture and on jewellers work they cannot be checked by blame nor guided by instruction they are merely the necessary results of whatever defects exist in the temper and principles of a luxurious society and it is only by moral changes not by artcriticism that their action can be modified  lastly there is a continually increasing demand for popular art multipliable by the printingpress illustrative of daily events of general literature and of natural science admirable skill and some of the best talent of modern times are occupied in supplying this want and there is no limit to the good which may be effected by rightly taking advantage of the powers we now possess of placing good and lovely art within the reach of the poorest classes much has been already accomplished but great harm has been done alsofirst by forms of art definitely addressed to depraved tastes and secondly in a more subtle way by really beautiful and useful engravings which are yet not good enough to retain their influence on the public mindwhich weary it by redundant quantity of monotonous average excellence and diminish or destroy its power of accurate attention to work of a higher order  especially this is to be regretted in the effect produced on the schools of line engraving which had reached in england an executive skill of a kind before unexampled and which of late have lost much of their more sterling and legitimate methods still i have seen plates produced quite recently more beautiful i think in some qualities than anything ever before attained by the burin173 and i have not the slightest fear that photography or any other adverse or competitive operation will in the least ultimately diminishi believe they will on the contrary stimulate and exaltthe grand old powers of the wood and the steel  such are i think briefly the present conditions of art with which we have to deal and i conceive it to be the function of this professorship with respect to them to establish both a practical and critical school of fine art for english gentlemen practical so that if they draw at all they may draw rightly and critical so that being first directed to such works of existing art as will best reward their study they may afterwards make their patronage of living artists delightful to themselves in their consciousness of its justice and to the utmost beneficial to their country by being given only to the men who deserve it in the early period of their lives when they both need it most and can be influenced by it to the best advantage  and especially with reference to this function of patronage i believe myself justified in taking into account future probabilities as to the character and range of art in england and i shall endeavour at once to organize with you a system of study calculated to develope chiefly the knowledge of those branches in which the english schools have shown and are likely to show peculiar excellence  now in asking your sanction both for the nature of the general plans i wish to adopt and for what i conceive to be necessary limitations of them i wish you to be fully aware of my reasons for both and i will therefore risk the burdening of your patience while i state the directions of effort in which i think english artists are liable to failure and those also in which past experience has shown they are secure of success  i referred but now to the effort we are making to improve the designs of our manufactures within certain limits i believe this improvement may indeed take effect so that we may no more humour momentary fashions by ugly results of chance instead of design and may produce both good tissues of harmonious colours and good forms and substance of pottery and glass but we shall never excel in decorative design such design is usually produced by people of great natural powers of mind who have no variety of subjects to employ themselves on no oppressive anxieties and are in circumstances either of natural scenery or of daily life which cause pleasurable excitement we cannot design because we have too much to think of and we think of it too anxiously it has long been observed how little real anxiety exists in the minds of the partly savage races which excel in decorative art and we must not suppose that the temper of the middle ages was a troubled one because every day brought its dangers or its changes the very eventfulness of the life rendered it careless as generally is still the case with soldiers and sailors now when there are great powers of thought and little to think of all the waste energy and fancy are thrown into the manual work and you have as much intellect as would direct the affairs of a large mercantile concern for a day spent all at once quite unconsciously in drawing an ingenious spiral  also powers of doing fine ornamental work are only to be reached by a perpetual discipline of the hand as well as of the fancy discipline as attentive and painful as that which a juggler has to put himself through to overcome the more palpable difficulties of his profession the execution of the best artists is always a splendid tourdeforce and much that in painting is supposed to be dependent on material is indeed only a lovely and quite inimitable legerdemain now when powers of fancy stimulated by this triumphant precision of manual dexterity descend uninterruptedly from generation to generation you have at last what is not so much a trained artist as a new species of animal with whose instinctive gifts you have no chance of contending and thus all our imitations of other peoples work are futile we must learn first to make honest english wares and afterward to decorate them as may please the then approving graces  secondlyand this is an incapacity of a graver kind yet having its own good in it alsowe shall never be successful in the highest fields of ideal or theological art  for there is one strange but quite essential character in usever since the conquest if not earliera delight in the forms of burlesque which are connected in some degree with the foulness in evil i think the most perfect type of a true english mind in its best possible temper is that of chaucer and you will find that while it is for the most part full of thoughts of beauty pure and wild like that of an april morning there are even in the midst of this sometimes momentarily jesting passages which stoop to play with evilwhile the power of listening to and enjoying the jesting of entirely gross persons whatever the feeling may be which permits it afterwards degenerates into forms of humour which render some of quite the greatest wisest and most moral of english writers now almost useless for our youth and yet you will find that whenever englishmen are wholly without this instinct their genius is comparatively weak and restricted  now the first necessity for the doing of any great work in ideal art is the looking upon all foulness with horror as a contemptible though dreadful enemy you may easily understand what i mean by comparing the feelings with which dante regards any form of obscenity or of base jest with the temper in which the same things are regarded by shakspere and this strange earthly instinct of ours coupled as it is in our good men with great simplicity and common sense renders them shrewd and perfect observers and delineators of actual nature low or high but precludes them from that speciality of art which is properly called sublime if ever we try anything in the manner of michael angelo or of dante we catch a fall even in literature as milton in the battle of the angels spoiled from hesiod174 while in art every attempt in this style has hitherto been the sign either of the presumptuous egotism of persons who had never really learned to be workmen or it has been connected with very tragic forms of the contemplation of deathit has always been partly insane and never once wholly successful  but we need not feel any discomfort in these limitations of our capacity we can do much that others cannot and more than we have ever yet ourselves completely done our first great gift is in the portraiture of living peoplea power already so accomplished in both reynolds and gainsborough that nothing is left for future masters but to add the calm of perfect workmanship to their vigour and felicity of perception and of what value a true school of portraiture may become in the future when worthy men will desire only to be known and others will not fear to know them for what they truly were we cannot from any past records of art influence yet conceive but in my next address it will be partly my endeavour to show you how much more useful because more humble the labour of great masters might have been had they been content to bear record of the souls that were dwelling with them on earth instead of striving to give a deceptive glory to those they dreamed of in heaven  secondly we have an intense power of invention and expression in domestic drama king lear and hamlet being essentially domestic in their strongest motives of interest there is a tendency at this moment towards a noble development of our art in this direction checked by many adverse conditions which may be summed in onethe insufficiency of generous civic or patriotic passion in the heart of the english people a fault which makes its domestic affections selfish contracted and therefore frivolous  thirdly in connection with our simplicity and goodhumour and partly with that very love of the grotesque which debases our ideal we have a sympathy with the lower animals which is peculiarly our own and which though it has already found some exquisite expression in the works of bewick and landseer is yet quite undeveloped this sympathy with the aid of our now authoritative science of physiology and in association with our british love of adventure will i hope enable us to give to the future inhabitants of the globe an almost perfect record of the present forms of animal life upon it of which many are on the point of being extinguished  while i myself hold this professorship i shall direct you in these exercises very definitely to natural history and to landscape not only because in these two branches i am probably able to show you truths which might be despised by my successors but because i think the vital and joyful study of natural history quite the principal element requiring introduction not only into university but into national education from highest to lowest and i even will risk incurring your ridicule by confessing one of my fondest dreams that i may succeed in making some of you english youths like better to look at a bird than to shoot it and even desire to make wild creatures tame instead of tame creatures wild and for the study of landscape it is i think now calculated to be of use in deeper if not more important modes than that of natural science for reasons which i will ask you to let me state at some length  observe firstno race of men which is entirety bred in wild country far from cities ever enjoys landscape they may enjoy the beauty of animals but scarcely even that a true peasant cannot see the beauty of cattle but only the qualities expressive of their serviceableness i waive discussion of this today permit my assertion of it under my confident guarantee of future proof landscape can only be enjoyed by cultivated persons and it is only by music literature and painting that cultivation can be given also the faculties which are thus received are hereditary so that the child of an educated race has an innate instinct for beauty derived from arts practised hundreds of years before its birth now farther note this one of the loveliest things in human nature in the children of noble races trained by surrounding art and at the same time in the practice of great deeds there is an intense delight in the landscape of their country as memorial a sense not taught to them nor teachable to any others but in them innate and the seal and reward of persistence in great national lifethe obedience and the peace of ages having extended gradually the glory of the revered ancestors also to the ancestral land until the motherhood of the dust the mystery of the demeter from whose bosom we came and to whose bosom we return surrounds and inspires everywhere the local awe of field and fountain the sacredness of landmark that none may remove and of wave that none may pollute while records of proud days and of dear persons make every rock monumental with ghostly inscription and every path lovely with noble desolateness  now however checked by lightness of temperament the instinctive love of landscape in us has this deep root which in your minds i will pray you to disencumber from whatever may oppress or mortify it and to strive to feel with all the strength of your youth that a nation is only worthy of the soil and the scenes that it has inherited when by all its acts and arts it is making them more lovely for its children  but if either our work or our inquiries are to be indeed successful in their own field they must be connected with others of a sterner character now listen to me if i have in these past details lost or burdened your attention for this is what i have chiefly to say to you the art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues i will show you that it is so in some detail in the second of my subsequent course of lectures meantime accept this as one of the things and the most important of all things i can positively declare to you the art or general productive and formative energy of any country is an exact exponent of its ethical life you can have noble art only from noble persons associated under laws fitted to their time and circumstances and the best skill that any teacher of art could spend here in your help would not end in enabling you even so much as rightly to draw the waterlilies in the cherwell and though it did the work when done would not be worth the lilies themselves unless both he and you were seeking as i trust we shall together seek in the laws which regulate the finest industries the clue to the laws which regulate all industries and in better obedience to which we shall actually have henceforward to live not merely in compliance with our own sense of what is right but under the weight of quite literal necessity for the trades by which the british people has believed it to be the highest of destinies to maintain itself cannot now long remain undisputed in its hands its unemployed poor are daily becoming more violently criminal and a certain distress in the middle classes arising partly from their vanity in living always up to their incomes and partly from their folly in imagining that they can subsist in idleness upon usury will at last compel the sons and daughters of english families to acquaint themselves with the principles of providential economy and to learn that food can only be got out of the ground and competence only secured by frugality and that although it is not possible for all to be occupied in the highest arts nor for any guiltlessly to pass their days in a succession of pleasures the most perfect mental culture possible to men is founded on their useful energies and their best arts and brightest happiness are consistent and consistent only with their virtue  this i repeat gentlemen will soon become manifest to those among us and there are yet many who are honesthearted and the future fate of england depends upon the position they then take and on their courage in maintaining it  there is a destiny now possible to usthe highest ever set before a nation to be accepted or refused we are still undegenerate in race a race mingled of the best northern blood we are not yet dissolute in temper but still have the firmness to govern and the grace to obey we have been taught a religion of pure mercy which we must either now betray or learn to defend by fulfilling and we are rich in an inheritance of honour bequeathed to us through a thousand years of noble history which it should be our daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice so that englishmen if it be a sin to covet honour should be the most offending souls alive175 within the last few years we have had the laws of natural science opened to us with a rapidity which has been blinding by its brightness and means of transit and communication given to us which have made but one kingdom of the habitable globe one kingdombut who is to be its king is there to be no king in it think you and every man to do that which is right in his own eyes or only kings of terror and the obscene empires of mammon and belial or will you youths of england make your country again a royal throne of kings a sceptred isle for all the world a source of light a centre of peace mistress of learning and of the artsfaithful guardian of great memories in the midst of irreverent and ephemeral visionsfaithful servant of timetried principles under temptation from fond experiments and licentious desires and amidst the cruel and clamorous jealousies of the nations worshipped in her strange valour of goodwill toward men176  vexilla regis prodeunt177 yes but of which king there are the two oriflammes which shall we plant on the farthest islandsthe one that floats in heavenly fire or that hangs heavy with foul tissue of terrestrial gold there is indeed a course of beneficent glory open to us such as never was yet offered to any poor group of mortal souls but it must beit is with us now reign or die and if it shall be said of this country fece per viltate il gran rifiuto178 that refusal of the crown will be of all yet recorded in history the shamefullest and most untimely  and this is what she must either do or perish she must found colonies as fast and as far as she is able formed of her most energetic and worthiest menseizing every piece of fruitful waste ground she can set her foot on and there teaching these her colonists that their chief virtue is to be fidelity to their country and that their first aim is to be to advance the power of england by land and sea and that though they live on a distant plot of ground they are no more to consider themselves therefore disfranchised from their native land than the sailors of her fleets do because they float on distant waves so that literally these colonies must be fastened fleets and every man of them must be under authority of captains and officers whose better command is to be over fields and streets instead of ships of the line and england in these her motionless navies or in the true and mightiest sense motionless churches ruled by pilots on the galilean lake179 of all the world is to expect every man to do his duty180 recognizing that duty is indeed possible no less in peace than war and that if we can get men for little pay to cast themselves against cannonmouths for love of england we may find men also who will plough and sow for her who will behave kindly and righteously for her who will bring up their children to love her and who will gladden themselves in the brightness of her glory more than in all the light of tropic skies  but that they may be able to do this she must make her own majesty stainless she must give them thoughts of their home of which they can be proud the england who is to be mistress of half the earth cannot remain herself a heap of cinders trampled by contending and miserable crowds she must yet again become the england she was once and in all beautiful waysmore so happy so secluded and so pure that in her skypolluted by no unholy cloudsshe may be able to spell rightly of every star that heaven doth show and in her fields ordered and wide and fair of every herb that sips the dew181 and under the green avenues of her enchanted garden a sacred circe true daughter of the sun she must guide the human arts and gather the divine knowledge of distant nations transformed from savageness to manhood and redeemed from despairing into peace  you think that an impossible ideal be it so refuse to accept it if you will but see that you form your own in its stead all that i ask of you is to have a fixed purpose of some kind for your country and yourselves no matter how restricted so that it be fixed and unselfish i know what stout hearts are in you to answer acknowledged need but it is the fatallest form of error in english youth to hide their hardihood till it fades for lack of sunshine and to act in disdain of purpose till all purpose is vain it is not by deliberate but by careless selfishness not by compromise with evil but by dull following of good that the weight of national evil increases upon us daily break through at least this pretence of existence determine what you will be and what you would win you will not decide wrongly if you resolve to decide at all were even the choice between lawless pleasure and loyal suffering you would not i believe choose basely but your trial is not so sharp it is between drifting in confused wreck among the castaways of fortune who condemns to assured ruin those who know not either how to resist her or obey between this i say and the taking of your appointed part in the heroism of rest the resolving to share in the victory which is to the weak rather than the strong and the binding yourselves by that law which thought on through lingering night and labouring day makes a mans life to be as a tree planted by the waterside that bringeth forth his fruit in his season      et folium ejus non defluet     et omnia quÆcunque faciet prosperabuntur182     172 turner    173 the tool of the engraver on copper    174

same i shall have more difficulty in proving my assertion because very few of us are as cognizant of the merit of painting as we are of that of language and i can only show you whence that merit springs after having thoroughly shown you in what it consists but in the meantime i have simply to tell you that the manual arts are as accurate exponents of ethical state as other modes of expression first with absolute precision of that of the workman and then with precision disguised by many distorting influences of that of the nation to which it belongs  and first they are a perfect exponent of the mind of the workman but being so remember if the mind be great or complex the art is not an easy book to read for we must ourselves possess all the mental characters of which we are to read the signs no man can read the evidence of labour who is not himself laborious for he does not know what the work cost nor can he read the evidence of true passion if he is not passionate nor of gentleness if he is not gentle and the most subtle signs of fault and weakness of character he can only judge by having had the same faults to fight with i myself for instance know impatient work and tired work better than most critics because i am myself always impatient and often tiredso also the patient and indefatigable touch of a mighty master becomes more wonderful to me than to others yet wonderful in no mean measure it will be to you all when i make it manifestand as soon as we begin our real work and you have learned what it is to draw a true line i shall be able to make manifest to youand undisputably sothat the days work of a man like mantegna or paul veronese consists of an unfaltering uninterrupted succession of movements of the hand more precise than those of the finest fencer the pencil leaving one point and arriving at another not only with unerring precision at the extremity of the line but with an unerring and yet varied coursesometimes over spaces a foot or more in extentyet a course so determined everywhere that either of these men could and veronese often does draw a finished profile or any other portion of the contour of the face with one line not afterwards changed try first to realize to yourselves the muscular precision of that action and the intellectual strain of it for the movement of a fencer is perfect in practised monotony but the movement of the hand of a great painter is at every instant governed by direct and new intention then imagine that muscular firmness and subtlety and the instantaneously selective and ordinant energy of the brain sustained all day long not only without fatigue but with a visible joy in the exertion like that which an eagle seems to take in the wave of his wings and this all life long and through long life not only without failure of power but with visible increase of it until the actually organic changes of old age and then consider so far as you know anything of physiology what sort of an ethical state of body and mind that meansethic through ages past what fineness of race there must be to get it what exquisite balance and symmetry of the vital powers and then finally determine for yourselves whether a manhood like that is consistent with any viciousness of soul with any mean anxiety any gnawing lust any wretchedness of spite or remorse any consciousness of rebellion against law of god or man or any actual though unconscious violation of even the least law to which obedience is essential for the glory of life and the pleasing of its giver  it is of course true that many of the strong masters had deep faults of character but their faults always show in their work it is true that some could not govern their passions if so they died young or they painted ill when old but the greater part of our misapprehension in the whole matter is from our not having well known who the great painters were and taking delight in the petty skill that was bred in the fumes of the taverns of the north instead of theirs who breathed empyreal air sons of the morning under the woods of assisi and the crags of cadore  it is true however also as i have pointed out long ago that the strong masters fall into two great divisions one leading simple and natural lives the other restrained in a puritanism of the worship of beauty and these two manners of life you may recognize in a moment by their work generally the naturalists are the strongest but there are two of the puritans whose work if i can succeed in making clearly understandable to you during my three years183 here it is all i need care to do but of these two puritans one i cannot name to you and the other i at present will not one i cannot for no one knows his name except the baptismal one bernard or dear little bernardbernardino called from his birthplace luino on the lago maggiore bernard of luino the other is a venetian of whom many of you probably have never heard and of whom through me you shall not hear until i have tried to get some picture by him over to england  observe then this puritanism in the worship of beauty though sometimes weak is always honourable and amiable and the exact reverse of the false puritanism which consists in the dread or disdain of beauty and in order to treat my subject rightly i ought to proceed from the skill of art to the choice of its subject and show you how the moral temper of the workman is shown by his seeking lovely forms and thoughts to express as well as by the force of his hand in expression but i need not now urge this part of the proof on you because you are already i believe sufficiently conscious of the truth in this matter and also i have already said enough of it in my writings whereas i have not at all said enough of the infallibleness of fine technical work as a proof of every other good power and indeed it was long before i myself understood the true meaning of the pride of the greatest men in their mere execution shown for a permanent lesson to us in the stories which whether true or not indicate with absolute accuracy the general conviction of great artiststhe stories of the contest of apelles and protogenes184 in a line only of which i can promise you you shall know the meaning to some purpose in a little whilethe story of the circle of giotto185 and especially which you may perhaps not have observed the expression of dürer in his inscription on the drawings sent him by raphael these figures he says raphael drew and sent to albert dürer in nurnberg to show himwhat not his invention nor his beauty of expression but sein hand zu weisen to show him his hand and you will find as you examine farther that all inferior artists are continually trying to escape from the necessity of sound work and either indulging themselves in their delights in subject or pluming themselves on their noble motives for attempting what they cannot perform and observe by the way that a great deal of what is mistaken for conscientious motive is nothing but a very pestilent because very subtle condition of vanity whereas the great men always understand at once that the first morality of a painter as of everybody else is to know his business and so earnest are they in this that many whose lives you would think by the results of their work had been passed in strong emotion have in reality subdued themselves though capable of the very strongest passions into a calm as absolute as that of a deeply sheltered mountain lake which reflects every agitation of the clouds in the sky and every change of the shadows on the hills but as itself motionless  finally you must remember that great obscurity has been brought upon the truth in this matter by the want of integrity and simplicity in our modern life i mean integrity in the latin sense wholeness everything is broken up and mingled in confusion both in our habits and thoughts besides being in great part imitative so that you not only cannot tell what a man is but sometimes you cannot tell whether he is at allwhether you have indeed to do with a spirit or only with an echo and thus the same inconsistencies appear now between the work of artists of merit and their personal characters as those which you find continually disappointing expectation in the lives of men of modern literary powerthe same conditions of society having obscured or misdirected the best qualities of the imagination both in our literature and art thus there is no serious question with any of us as to the personal character of dante and giotto of shakespeare and holbein but we pause timidly in the attempt to analyze the moral laws of the art skill in recent poets novelists and painters  let me assure you once for all that as you grow older if you enable yourselves to distinguish by the truth of your own lives what is true in those of other men you will gradually perceive that all good has its origin in good never in evil that the fact of either literature or painting being truly fine of their kind whatever their mistaken aim or partial error is proof of their noble origin and that if there is indeed sterling value in the thing done it has come of a sterling worth in the soul that did it however alloyed or defiled by conditions of sin which are sometimes more appalling or more strange than those which all may detect in their own hearts because they are part of a personality altogether larger than ours and as far beyond our judgment in its darkness as beyond our following in its light and it is sufficient warning against what some might dread as the probable effect of such a conviction on your own minds namely that you might permit yourselves in the weaknesses which you imagined to be allied to genius when they took the form of personal temptationsit is surely i say sufficient warning against so mean a folly to discern as you may with little pains that of all human existences the lives of men of that distorted and tainted nobility of intellect are probably the most miserable  i pass to the second and for us the more practically important question what is the effect of noble art upon other men what has it done for national morality in time past and what effect is the extended knowledge or possession of it likely to have upon us now and here we are at once met by the facts which are as gloomy as indisputable that while many peasant populations among whom scarcely the rudest practice of art has ever been attempted have lived in comparative innocence honour and happiness the worst foulness and cruelty of savage tribes have been frequently associated with fine ingenuities of decorative design also that no people has ever attained the higher stages of art skill except at a period of its civilization which was sullied by frequent violent and even monstrous crime and lastly that the attaining of perfection in art power has been hitherto in every nation the accurate signal of the beginning of its ruin  respecting which phenomena observe first that although good never springs out of evil it is developed to its highest by contention with evil there are some groups of peasantry in faraway nooks of christian countries who are nearly as innocent as lambs but the morality which gives power to art is the morality of men not of cattle  secondly the virtues of the inhabitants of many country districts are apparent not real their lives are indeed artless but not innocent and it is only the monotony of circumstances and the absence of temptation which prevent the exhibition of evil passions not less real because often dormant nor less foul because shown only in petty faults or inactive malignities  but you will observe also that absolute artlessness to men in any kind of moral health is impossible they have always at least the art by which they liveagriculture or seamanship and in these industries skilfully practised you will find the law of their moral training while whatever the adversity of circumstances every rightlyminded peasantry such as that of sweden denmark bavaria or switzerland has associated with its needful industry a quite studied school of pleasurable art in dress and generally also in song and simple domestic architecture  again i need not repeat to you here what i endeavoured to explain in the first lecture in the book i called the two paths respecting the arts of savage races but i may now note briefly that such arts are the result of an intellectual activity which has found no room to expand and which the tyranny of nature or of man has condemned to disease through arrested growth and where neither christianity nor any other religion conveying some moral help has reached the animal energy of such races necessarily flames into ghastly conditions of evil and the grotesque or frightful forms assumed by their art are precisely indicative of their distorted moral nature  but the truly great nations nearly always begin from a race possessing this imaginative power and for some time their progress is very slow and their state not one of innocence but of feverish and faultful animal energy this is gradually subdued and exalted into bright human life the art instinct purifying itself with the rest of the nature until social perfectness is nearly reached and then comes the period when conscience and intellect are so highly developed that new forms of error begin in the inability to fulfil the demands of the one or to answer the doubts of the other then the wholeness of the people is lost all kinds of hypocrisies and oppositions of science develope themselves their faith is questioned on one side and compromised with on the other wealth commonly increases at the same period to a destructive extent luxury follows and the ruin of the nation is then certain while the arts all this time are simply as i said at first the exponents of each phase of its moral state and no more control it in its political career than the gleam of the firefly guides its oscillation it is true that their most splendid results are usually obtained in the swiftness of the power which is hurrying to the precipice but to lay the charge of the catastrophe to the art by which it is illumined is to find a cause for the cataract in the hues of its iris it is true that the colossal vices belonging to periods of great national wealth for wealth you will find is the real root of all evil186 can turn every good gift and skill of nature or of man to evil purpose if in such times fair pictures have been misused how much more fair realities and if miranda is immoral to caliban is that mirandas fault     183 as slade professor ruskin held a three years appointment at   oxford    184 this story comes from pliny natural history 35

vol 1 p 61 giotto was asked by a   messenger of the pope for a specimen of his work and sent a perfect   circle drawn free hand    186 timothy vi 10    the relation of art to use   our subject of inquiry today you will remember is the mode in which fine art is founded upon or may contribute to the practical requirements of human life  its offices in this respect are mainly twofold it gives form to knowledge and grace to utility that is to say it makes permanently visible to us things which otherwise could neither be described by our science nor retained by our memory and it gives delightfulness and worth to the implements of daily use and materials of dress furniture and lodging in the first of these offices it gives precision and charm to truth in the second it gives precision and charm to service for the moment we make anything useful thoroughly it is a law of nature that we shall be pleased with ourselves and with the thing we have made and become desirous therefore to adorn or complete it in some dainty way with finer art expressive of our pleasure  and the point i wish chiefly to bring before you today is this close and healthy connection of the fine arts with material use but i must first try briefly to put in clear light the function of art in giving form to truth  much that i have hitherto tried to teach has been disputed on the ground that i have attached too much importance to art as representing natural facts and too little to it as a source of pleasure and i wish in the close of these four prefatory lectures strongly to assert to you and so far as i can in the time convince you that the entire vitality of art depends upon its being either full of truth or full of use and that however pleasant wonderful or impressive it may be in itself it must yet be of inferior kind and tend to deeper inferiority unless it has clearly one of these main objectseither to state a true thing or to adorn a serviceable one it must never exist alonenever for itself it exists rightly only when it is the means of knowledge or the grace of agency for life  now i pray you to observefor though i have said this often before i have never yet said it clearly enoughevery good piece of art to whichever of these ends it may be directed involves first essentially the evidence of human skill and the formation of an actually beautiful thing by it  skill and beauty always then and beyond these the formative arts have always one or other of the two objects which i have just defined to youtruth or serviceableness and without these aims neither the skill nor their beauty will avail only by these can either legitimately reign all the graphic arts begin in keeping the outline of shadow that we have loved and they end in giving to it the aspect of life and all the architectural arts begin in the shaping of the cup and the platter and they end in a glorified roof  therefore you see in the graphic arts you have skill beauty and likeness and in the architectural arts skill beauty and use and you must have the three in each group balanced and coordinate and all the chief errors of art consist in losing or exaggerating one of these elements  for instance almost the whole system and hope of modern life are founded on the notion that you may substitute mechanism for skill photograph for picture castiron for sculpture that is your main nineteenthcentury faith or infidelity you think you can get everything by grindingmusic literature and painting you will find it grievously not so you can get nothing but dust by mere grinding even to have the barleymeal out of it you must have the barley first and that comes by growth not grinding but essentially we have lost our delight in skill in that majesty of it which i was trying to make clear to you in my last address and which long ago187 i tried to express under the head of ideas of power the entire sense of that we have lost because we ourselves do not take pains enough to do right and have no conception of what the right costs so that all the joy and reverence we ought to feel in looking at a strong mans work have ceased in us we keep them yet a little in looking at a honeycomb or a birdsnest we understand that these differ by divinity of skill from a lump of wax or a cluster of sticks but a picture which is a much more wonderful thing than a honeycomb or a birdsnesthave we not known people and sensible people too who expected to be taught to produce that in six lessons  well you must have the skill you must have the beauty which is the highest moral element and then lastly you must have the verity or utility which is not the moral but the vital element and this desire for verity and use is the one aim of the three that always leads in great schools and in the minds of great masters without any exception they will permit themselves in awkwardness they will permit themselves in uglinessbut they will never permit themselves in uselessness or in unveracity  and farther as their skill increases and as their grace so much more their desire for truth it is impossible to find the three motives in fairer balance and harmony than in our own reynolds he rejoices in showing you his skill and those of you who succeed in learning what painters work really is will one day rejoice also even to laughterthat highest laughter which springs of pure delight in watching the fortitude and the fire of a hand which strikes forth its will upon the canvas as easily as the wind strikes it on the sea he rejoices in all abstract beauty and rhythm and melody of design he will never give you a colour that is not lovely nor a shade that is unnecessary nor a line that is ungraceful but all his power and all his invention are held by him subordinateand the more obediently because of their noblenessto his true leading purpose of setting before you such likeness of the living presence of an english gentleman or an english lady as shall be worthy of being looked upon for ever  but farther you remember i hopefor i said it in a way that i thought would shock you a little that you might remember itmy statement that art had never done more than this never more than given the likeness of a noble human being not only so but it very seldom does so much as this and the best pictures that exist of the great schools are all portraits or groups of portraits often of very simple and nowise noble persons you may have much more brilliant and impressive qualities in imaginative pictures you may have figures scattered like clouds or garlanded like flowers you may have light and shade as of a tempest and colour as of the rainbow but all that is childs play to the great men though it is astonishment to us their real strength is tried to the utmost and as far as i know it is never elsewhere brought out so thoroughly as in painting one man or woman and the soul that was in them nor that always the highest soul but often only a thwarted one that was capable of height or perhaps not even that but faultful and poor yet seen through to the poor best of it by the masterful sight so that in order to put before you in your standard series the best art possible i am obliged even from the very strongest men to take the portraits before i take the idealism nay whatever is best in the great compositions themselves has depended on portraiture and the study necessary to enable you to understand invention will also convince you that the mind of man never invented a greater thing than the form of man animated by faithful life every attempt to refine or exalt such healthy humanity has weakened or caricatured it or else consists only in giving it to please our fancy the wings of birds or the eyes of antelopes whatever is truly great in either greek or christian art is also restrictedly human and even the raptures of the redeemed souls who enter celestemente ballando188 the gate of angelicos paradise were seen first in the terrestrial yet most pure mirth of florentine maidens  i am aware that this cannot but at present appear gravely questionable to those of my audience who are strictly cognizant of the phases of greek art for they know that the moment of its decline is accurately marked by its turning from abstract form to portraiture but the reason of this is simple the progressive course of greek art was in subduing monstrous conceptions to natural ones it did this by general laws it reached absolute truth of generic human form and if its ethical force had remained would have advanced into healthy portraiture but at the moment of change the national life ended in greece and portraiture there meant insult to her religion and flattery to her tyrants and her skill perished not because she became true in sight but because she became vile in heart  but i have told you enough it seems to me at least today of this function of art in recording fact let me now finally and with all distinctness possible to me state to you its main business of allits service in the actual uses of daily life  you are surprised perhaps to hear me call this its main business that is indeed so however the giving brightness to picture is much but the giving brightness to life more and remember were it as patterns only you cannot without the realities have the pictures you cannot have a landscape by turner without a country for him to paint you cannot have a portrait by titian without a man to be pourtrayed i need not prove that to you i suppose in these short terms but in the outcome i can get no soul to believe that the beginning of art is in getting our country clean and our people beautiful i have been ten years trying to get this very plain certaintyi do not say believedbut even thought of as anything but a monstrous proposition to get your country clean and your people lovelyi assure you that is a necessary work of art to begin with there has indeed been art in countries where people lived in dirt to serve god but never in countries where they lived in dirt to serve the devil there has indeed been art where the people were not all lovelywhere even their lips were thickand their skins black because the sun had looked upon them189 but never in a country where the people were pale with miserable toil and deadly shade and where the lips of youth instead of being full with blood were pinched by famine or warped with poison and now therefore note this well the gist of all these long prefatory talks i said that the two great moral instincts were those of order and kindness now all the arts are founded on agriculture by the hand and on the graces and kindness of feeding and dressing and lodging your people greek art begins in the gardens of alcinousperfect order leeks in beds and fountains in pipes190 and christian art as it arose out of chivalry was only possible so far as chivalry compelled both kings and knights to care for the right personal training of their people it perished utterly when those kings and knights became greek daemoboroi devourers of the people and it will become possible again only when literally the sword is beaten into the ploughshare191 when your st george of england shall justify his name192 and christian art shall be known as its master was in breaking of bread193  now look at the working out of this broad principle in minor detail observe how from highest to lowest health of art has first depended on reference to industrial use there is first the need of cup and platter especially of cup for you can put your meat on the harpies194 or any other tables but you must have your cup to drink from and to hold it conveniently you must put a handle to it and to fill it when it is empty you must have a large pitcher of some sort and to carry the pitcher you may most advisably have two handles modify the forms of these needful possessions according to the various requirements of drinking largely and drinking delicately of pouring easily out or of keeping for years the perfume in of storing in cellars or bearing from fountains of sacrificial libation of panathenaic treasure of oil and sepulchral treasure of ashesand you have a resultant series of beautiful form and decoration from the rude amphora of red earth up to cellinis vases of gems and crystal in which series but especially in the more simple conditions of it are developed the most beautiful lines and most perfect types of severe composition which have yet been attained by art  but again that you may fill your cup with pure water you must go to the well or spring you need a fence round the well you need some tube or trough or other means of confining the stream at the spring for the conveyance of the current to any distance you must build either enclosed or open aqueduct and in the hot square of the city where you set it free you find it good for health and pleasantness to let it leap into a fountain on these several needs you have a school of sculpture founded in the decoration of the walls of wells in level countries and of the sources of springs in mountainous ones and chiefly of all where the women of household or market meet at the city fountain  there is however a farther reason for the use of art here than in any other material service so far as we may by art express our reverence or thankfulness whenever a nation is in its right mind it always has a deep sense of divinity in the gift of rain from heaven filling its heart with food and gladness195 and all the more when that gift becomes gentle and perennial in the flowing of springs it literally is not possible that any fruitful power of the muses should be put forth upon a people which disdains their helicon still less is it possible that any christian nation should grow up tanquam lignum quod plantatum est secus decursus aquarum196 which cannot recognize the lesson meant in their being told of the places where rebekah was metwhere rachelwhere zipporahand she who was asked for water under mount gerizim by a stranger weary who had nothing to draw with197  and truly when our mountain springs are set apart in vale or craggy glen or glade of wood green through the drought of summer far from cities then it is best let them stay in their own happy peace but if near towns and liable therefore to be defiled by common usage we could not use the loveliest art more worthily than by sheltering the spring and its first pools with precious marbles nor ought anything to be esteemed more important as a means of healthy education than the care to keep the streams of it afterwards to as great a distance as possible pure full of fish and easily accessible to children there used to be thirty years ago a little rivulet of the wandel about an inch deep which ran over the carriageroad and under a footbridge just under the last chalk hill near croydon alas men came and went and itdid not go on for ever it has long since been bricked over by the parish authorities but there was more education in that stream with its minnows than you could get out of a thousand pounds spent yearly in the parish schools even though you were to spend every farthing of it in teaching the nature of oxygen and hydrogen and the names and rate per minute of all the rivers in asia and america  well the gist of this matter lies here then suppose we want a school of pottery again in england all we poor artists are ready to do the best we can to show you how pretty a line may be that is twisted first to one side and then to the other and how a plain householdblue will make a pattern on white and how ideal art may be got out of the spaniels colours of black and tan but i tell you beforehand all that we can do will be utterly useless unless you teach your peasant to say grace not only before meat but before drink and having provided him with greek cups and platters provide him also with something that is not poisoned to put into them  there cannot be any need that i should trace for you the conditions of art that are directly founded on serviceableness of dress and of armour but it is my duty to affirm to you in the most positive manner that after recovering for the poor wholesomeness of food your next step toward founding schools of art in england must be in recovering for the poor decency and wholesomeness of dress thoroughly good in substance fitted for their daily work becoming to their rank in life and worn with order and dignity and this order and dignity must be taught them by the women of the upper and middle classes whose minds can be in nothing right as long as they are so wrong in this matter us to endure the squalor of the poor while they themselves dress gaily and on the proper pride and comfort of both poor and rich in dress must be founded the true arts of dress carried on by masters of manufacture no less careful of the perfectness and beauty of their tissues and of all that in substance and in design can be bestowed upon them than ever the armourers of milan and damascus were careful of their steel  then in the third place having recovered some wholesome habits of life as to food and dress we must recover them as to lodging i said just now that the best architecture was but a glorified roof think of it the dome of the vatican the porches of rheims or chartres the vaults and arches of their aisles the canopy of the tomb and the spire of the belfry are all forms resulting from the mere requirement that a certain space shall be strongly covered from heat and rain more than thatas i have tried all through the stones of venice to showthe lovely forms of these were every one of them developed in civil and domestic building and only after their invention employed ecclesiastically on the grandest scale i think you cannot but have noticed here in oxford as elsewhere that our modern architects never seem to know what to do with their roofs be assured until the roofs are right nothing else will be and there are just two ways of keeping them right never build them of iron but only of wood or stone and secondly take care that in every town the little roofs are built before the large ones and that everybody who wants one has got one and we must try also to make everybody want one that is to say at some not very advanced period of life men should desire to have a home which they do not wish to quit any more suited to their habits of life and likely to be more and more suitable to them until their death and men must desire to have these their dwellingplaces built as strongly as possible and furnished and decorated daintily and set in pleasant places in bright light and good air being able to choose for themselves that at least as well as swallows and when the houses are grouped together in cities men must have so much civic fellowship as to subject their architecture to a common law and so much civic pride as to desire that the whole gathered group of human dwellings should be a lovely thing not a frightful one on the face of the earth not many weeks ago an english clergyman198 a master of this university a man not given to sentiment but of middle age and great practical sense told me by accident and wholly without reference to the subject now before us that he never could enter london from his country parsonage but with closed eyes lest the sight of the blocks of houses which the railroad intersected in the suburbs should unfit him by the horror of it for his days work  now it is not possibleand i repeat to you only in more deliberate assertion what i wrote just twentytwo years ago in the last chapter of the seven lamps of architectureit is not possible to have any right morality happiness or art in any country where the cities are thus built or thus let me rather say clotted and coagulated spots of a dreadful mildew spreading by patches and blotches over the country they consume you must have lovely cities crystallized not coagulated into form limited in size and not casting out the scum and scurf of them into an encircling eruption of shame but girded each with its sacred pomoerium and with garlands of gardens full of blossoming trees and softly guided streams     187 in modern painters vol 1    188 the quotation is from vasaris account of angelicos last   judgment now in the accademia

heart the first     lecture is the only one which keeps to the title of the book in     the others the legend is used merely as a startingpoint for the     expression of various pregnant ideas on social and historical     problems the book as a whole abounds in flashes of inspiration     and insight and is a favourite with many readers of ruskin     carlyle in a letter to froude wrote passages of that last     book queen of the air went into my heart like arrows  in different places of my writings and through many years of endeavour to define the laws of art i have insisted on this tightness in work and on its connection with virtue of character in so many partial ways that the impression left on the readers mindif indeed it was ever impressed at allhas been confused and uncertain in beginning the series of my corrected works i wish this principle in my own mind the foundation of every other to be made plain if nothing else is and will try therefore to make it so so far as by any effort i can put it into unmistakable words and first here is a very simple statement of it given lately in a lecture on the architecture of the valley of the somme199 which will be better read in this place than in its incidental connection with my account of the porches of abbeville  i had used in a preceding part of the lecture the expression by what faults this gothic architecture fell we continually speak thus of works of art we talk of their faults and merits as of virtues and vices what do we mean by talking of the faults of a picture or the merits of a piece of stone  the faults of a work of art are the faults of its workman and its virtues his virtues  great art is the expression of the mind of a great man and mean art that of the want of mind of a weak man a foolish person builds foolishly and a wise one sensibly a virtuous one beautifully and a vicious one basely if stone work is well put together it means that a thoughtful man planned it and a careful man cut it and an honest man cemented it if it has too much ornament it means that its carver was too greedy of pleasure if too little that he was rude or insensitive or stupid and the like so that when once you have learned how to spell these most precious of all legendspictures and buildingsyou may read the characters of men and of nations in their art as in a mirrornay as in a microscope and magnified a hundredfold for the character becomes passionate in the art and intensifies itself in all its noblest or meanest delights nay not only as in a microscope but as under a scalpel and in dissection for a man may hide himself from you or misrepresent himself to you every other way but he cannot in his work there be sure you have him to the inmost all that he likes all that he seesall that he can dohis imagination his affections his perseverance his impatience his clumsiness cleverness everything is there if the work is a cobweb you know it was made by a spider if a honeycomb by a bee a wormcast is thrown up by a worm and a nest wreathed by a bird and a house built by a man worthily if he is worthy and ignobly if he is ignoble  and always from the least to the greatest as the made thing is good or bad so is the maker of it  you all use this faculty of judgment more or less whether you theoretically admit the principle or not take that floral gable200 you dont suppose the man who built stonehenge could have built that or that the man who built that would have built stonehenge do you think an old roman would have liked such a piece of filigree work or that michael angelo would have spent his time in twisting these stems of roses in and out or of modern handicraftsmen do you think a burglar or a brute or a pickpocket could have carved it could bill sykes have done it or the dodger dexterous with finger and tool you will find in the end that no man could have done it but exactly the man who did it and by looking close at it you may if you know your letters read precisely the manner of man he was  now i must insist on this matter for a grave reason of all facts concerning art this is the one most necessary to be known that while manufacture is the work of hands only art is the work of the whole spirit of man and as that spirit is so is the deed of it and by whatever power of vice or virtue any art is produced the same vice or virtue it reproduces and teaches that which is born of evil begets evil and that which is born of valour and honour teaches valour and honour al art is either infection or education it must be one or other of these  this i repeat of all truths respecting art is the one of which understanding is the most precious and denial the most deadly and i assert it the more because it has of late been repeatedly expressly and with contumely denied and that by high authority and i hold it one of the most sorrowful facts connected with the decline of the arts among us that english gentlemen of high standing as scholars and artists should have been blinded into the acceptance and betrayed into the assertion of a fallacy which only authority such as theirs could have rendered for an instant credible for the contrary of it is written in the history of all great nations it is the one sentence always inscribed on the steps of their thrones the one concordant voice in which they speak to us out of their dust  all such nations first manifest themselves as a pure and beautiful animal race with intense energy and imagination they live lives of hardship by choice and by grand instinct of manly discipline they become fierce and irresistible soldiers the nation is always its own army and their king or chief head of government is always their first soldier pharaoh or david or leonidas or valerius or barbarossa or coeur de lion or st louis or dandolo or frederick the greategyptian jew greek roman german english french venetianthat is inviolable law for them all their king must be their first soldier or they cannot be in progressive power then after their great military period comes the domestic period in which without betraying the discipline of war they add to their great soldiership the delights and possessions of a delicate and tender homelife and then for all nations is the time of their perfect art which is the fruit the evidence the reward of their national ideal of character developed by the finished care of the occupations of peace that is the history of all true art that ever was or can be palpably the history of itunmistakablywritten on the forehead of it in letters of lightin tongues of fire by which the seal of virtue is branded as deep as ever iron burnt into a convicts flesh the seal of crime but always hitherto after the great period has followed the day of luxury and pursuit of the arts for pleasure only and all has so ended  thus far of abbeville building now i have here asserted two thingsfirst the foundation of art in moral character next the foundation of moral character in war i must make both these assertions clearer and prove them  first of the foundation of art in moral character of course artgift and amiability of disposition are two different things a good man is not necessarily a painter nor does an eye for colour necessarily imply an honest mind but great art implies the union of both powers it is the expression by an artgift of a pure soul if the gift is not there we can have no art at all and if the souland a right soul toois not there the art is bad however dexterous  but also remember that the artgift itself is only the result of the moral character of generations a bad woman may have a sweet voice but that sweetness of voice comes of the past morality of her race that she can sing with it at all she owes to the determination of laws of music by the morality of the past every act every impulse of virtue and vice affects in any creature face voice nervous power and vigour and harmony of invention at once perseverance in rightness of human conduct renders after a certain number of generations human art possible every sin clouds it be it ever so little a one and persistent vicious living and following of pleasure render after a certain number of generations all art impossible men are deceived by the longsuffering of the laws of nature and mistake in a nation the reward of the virtue of its sires for the issue of its own sins the time of their visitation will come and that inevitably for it is always true that if the fathers have eaten sour grapes the childrens teeth are set on edge201 and for the individual as soon as you have learned to read you may as i have said know him to the hearts core through his art let his artgift be never so great and cultivated to the height by the schools of a great race of men and it is still but a tapestry thrown over his own being and inner soul and the bearing of it will show infallibly whether it hangs on a man or on a skeleton if you are dimeyed you may not see the difference in the fall of the folds at first but learn how to look and the folds themselves will become transparent and you shall see through them the deaths shape or the divine one making the tissue above it as a cloud of light or as a windingsheet  then farther observe i have said and you will find it true and that to the uttermost that as all lovely art is rooted in virtue so it bears fruit of virtue and is didactic in its own nature it is often didactic also in actually expressed thought as giottos michael angelos dürers and hundreds more but that is not its special functionit is didactic chiefly by being beautiful but beautiful with haunting thought no less than with form and full of myths that can be read only with the heart  for instance at this moment there is open beside me as i write a page of persian manuscript wrought with wreathed azure and geld and soft green and violet and ruby and scarlet into one field of pure resplendence it is wrought to delight the eyes only and does delight them and the man who did it assuredly had eyes in his head but not much more it is not didactic art but its author was happy and it will do the good and the harm that mere pleasure can do but opposite me is an early turner drawing of the lake of geneva taken about two miles from geneva on the lausanne road with mont blanc in the distance the old city is seen lying beyond the waveless waters veiled with a sweet misty veil of athenas weaving a faint light of morning peaceful exceedingly and almost colourless shed from behind the voirons increases into soft amber along the slope of the salève and is just seen and no more on the fair warm fields of its summit between the folds of a white cloud that rests upon the grass but rises high and towerlike into the zenith of dawn above  there is not as much colour in that low amber light upon the hillside as there is in the palest dead leaf the lake is not blue but grey in mist passing into deep shadow beneath the voirons pines a few dark clusters of leaves a single white flowerscarcely seenare all the gladness given to the rocks of the shore one of the ruby spots of the eastern manuscript would give colour enough for all the red that is in turners entire drawing for the mere pleasure of the eye there is not so much in all those lines of his throughout the entire landscape as in half an inch square of the persians page what made him take pleasure in the low colour that is only like the brown of a dead leaf in the cold grey of dawnin the one white flower among the rocksin theseand no more than these  he took pleasure in them because he had been bred among english fields and hills because the gentleness of a great race was in his heart and its power of thought in his brain because he knew the stories of the alps and of the cities at their feet because he had read the homeric legends of the clouds and beheld the gods of dawn and the givers of dew to the fields because he knew the faces of the crags and the imagery of the passionate mountains as a man knows the face of his friend because he had in him the wonder and sorrow concerning life and death which are the inheritance of the gothic soul from the days of its first sea kings and also the compassion and the joy that are woven into the innermost fabric of every great imaginative spirit born now in countries that have lived by the christian faith with any courage or truth and the picture contains also for us just this which its maker had in him to give and can convey it to us just so far as we are of the temper in which it must be received it is didactic if we are worthy to be taught no otherwise the pure heart it will make more pure the thoughtful more thoughtful it has in it no words for the reckless or the base     199 the flamboyant architecture of the valley of the somme a   lecture delivered at the royal institution january 29 1869    200 the elaborate pediment above the central porch at the west   end of rouen cathedral pierced into a transparent web of tracery   and enriched with a border of twisted eglantine ruskin    201 jeremiah xxxi 29     traffic       traffic is the second of the three lectures published may 1866     in the volume entitled the crown of wild olive all these     lectures were delivered in the years 1864 and 1865 but the one     here printed was earliest the occasion on which ruskin addressed     the people of bradford is made sufficiently clear from the opening     sentences the lecture is important as emphasizing in a popular     way some of his most characteristic economic theories    traffic202   my good yorkshire friends you asked me down here among your hills that i might talk to you about this exchange you are going to build but earnestly and seriously asking you to pardon me i am going to do nothing of the kind i cannot talk or at least can say very little about this same exchange i must talk of quite other things though not willinglyi could not deserve your pardon if when you invited me to speak on one subject i wilfully spoke on another but i cannot speak to purpose of anything about which i do not care and most simply and sorrowfully i have to tell you in the outset that i do not care about this exchange of yours  if however when you sent me your invitation i had answered i wont come i dont care about the exchange of bradford you would have been justly offended with me not knowing the reasons of so blunt a carelessness so i have come down hoping that you will patiently let me tell you why on this and many other such occasions i now remain silent when formerly i should have caught at the opportunity of speaking to a gracious audience  in a word then i do not care about this exchangebecause you dont and because you know perfectly well i cannot make you look at the essential conditions of the case which you as business men know perfectly well though perhaps you think i forget them you are going to spend £30000 which to you collectively is nothing the buying a new coat is as to the cost of it a much more important matter of consideration to me than building a new exchange is to you but you think you may as well have the right thing for your money you know there are a great many odd styles of architecture about you dont want to do anything ridiculous you hear of me among others as a respectable architectural manmilliner and you send for me that i may tell you the leading fashion and what is in our shops for the moment the newest and sweetest thing in pinnacles  now pardon me for telling you frankly you cannot have good architecture merely by asking peoples advice on occasion all good architecture is the expression of national life and character and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste or desire for beauty and i want you to think a little of the deep significance of this word taste for no statement of mine has been more earnestly or oftener controverted than that good taste is essentially a moral quality no say many of my antagonists taste is one thing morality is another tell us what is pretty we shall be glad to know that but we need no sermonseven were you able to preach them which may be doubted  permit me therefore to fortify this old dogma of mine somewhat taste is not only a part and an index of moralityit is the only morality the first and last and closest trial question to any living creature is what do you like tell me what you like and ill tell you what you are go out into the street and ask the first man or woman you meet what their taste is and if they answer candidly you know them body and soul you my friend in the rags with the unsteady gait what do you like a pipe and a quartern of gin i know you you good woman with the quick step and tidy bonnet what do you like a swept hearth and a clean teatable and my husband opposite me and a baby at my breast good i know you also you little girl with the golden hair and the soft eyes what do you like my canary and a run among the wood hyacinths you little boy with the dirty hands and the low forehead what do you like a shy at the sparrows and a game at pitch farthing good we know them all now what more need we ask  nay perhaps you answer we need rather to ask what these people and children do than what they like if they do right it is no matter that they like what is wrong and if they do wrong it is no matter that they like what is right doing is the great thing and it does not matter that the man likes drinking so that he does not drink nor that the little girl likes to be kind to her canary if she will not learn her lessons nor that the little boy likes throwing stones at the sparrows if he goes to the sunday school indeed for a short time and in a provisional sense this is true for if resolutely people do what is right in time they come to like doing it but they only are in a right moral state when they have come to like doing it and as long as they dont like it they are still in a vicious state the man is not in health of body who is always thinking of the bottle in the cupboard though he bravely bears his thirst but the man who heartily enjoys water in the morning and wine in the evening each in its proper quantity and time and the entire object of true education is to make people not merely do the right things but enjoy the right thingsnot merely industrious but to love industrynot merely learned but to love knowledgenot merely pure but to love puritynot merely just but to hunger and thirst after justice203  but you may answer or think is the liking for outside ornamentsfor pictures or statues or furniture or architecturea moral quality yes most surely if a rightly set liking taste for any pictures or statues is not a moral quality but taste for good ones is only here again we have to define the word good i dont mean by good cleveror learnedor difficult in the doing take a picture by teniers of sots quarrelling over their dice it is an entirely clever picture so clever that nothing in its kind has ever been done equal to it but it is also an entirely base and evil picture it is an expression of delight in the prolonged contemplation of a vile thing and delight in that is an unmannered or immoral quality it is bad taste in the profoundest senseit is the taste of the devils on the other hand a picture of titians or a greek statue or a greek coin or a turner landscape expresses delight in the perpetual contemplation of a good and perfect thing that is an entirely moral qualityit is the taste of the angels and all delight in art and all love of it resolve themselves into simple love of that which deserves love that deserving is the quality which we call lovelinesswe ought to have an opposite word hateliness to be said of the things which deserve to be hated and it is not an indifferent nor optional thing whether we love this or that but it is just the vital function of all our being what we like determines what we are and is the sign of what we are and to teach taste is inevitably to form character  as i was thinking over this in walking up fleet street the other day my eye caught the title of a book standing open in a booksellers window it wason the necessity of the diffusion of taste among all classes ah i thought to myself my classifying friend when you have diffused your taste where will your classes be the man who likes what you like belongs to the same class with you i think inevitably so you may put him to other work if you choose but by the condition you have brought him into he will dislike the other work as much as you would yourself you get hold of a scavenger or a costermonger who enjoyed the newgate calendar for literature and pop goes the weasel for music you think you can make him like dante and beethoven i wish you joy of your lessons but if you do you have made a gentleman of himhe wont like to go back to his costermongering  and so completely and unexceptionally is this so that if i had time tonight i could show you that a nation cannot be affected by any vice or weakness without expressing it legibly and for ever either in bad art or by want of art and that there is no national virtue small or great which is not manifestly expressed in all the art which circumstances enable the people possessing that virtue to produce take for instance your great english virtue of enduring and patient courage you have at present in england only one art of any consequencethat is ironworking you know thoroughly well how to cast and hammer iron now do you think in those masses of lava which you build volcanic cones to melt and which you forge at the mouths of the infernos you have created do you think on those iron plates your courage and endurance are not written for evernot merely with an iron pen but on iron parchment and take also your great english viceeuropean vicevice of all the worldvice of all other worlds that roll or shine in heaven bearing with them yet the atmosphere of hellthe vice of jealousy which brings competition into your commerce treachery into your councils and dishonour into your warsthat vice which has rendered for you and for your next neighbouring nation the daily occupations of existence no longer possible but with the mail upon your breasts and the sword loose in its sheath so that at last you have realized for all the multitudes of the two great peoples who lead the socalled civilization of the earthyou have realized for them all i say in person and in policy what was once true only of the rough border riders of your cheviot hills      they carved at the meal     with gloves of steel  and they drank the red wine through the helmet barrd204 do you think that this national shame and dastardliness of heart are not written as legibly on every rivet of your iron armour as the strength of the right hands that forged it  friends i know not whether this thing be the more ludicrous or the more melancholy it is quite unspeakably both suppose instead of being now sent for by you i had been sent for by some private gentleman living in a suburban house with his garden separated only by a fruit wall from his next door neighbours and he had called me to consult with him on the furnishing of his drawingroom i begin looking about me and find the walls rather bare i think such and such a paper might be desirableperhaps a little fresco here and there on the ceilinga damask curtain or so at the windows ah says my employer damask curtains indeed thats all very fine but you know i cant afford that kind of thing just now yet the world credits you with a splendid income ah yes says my friend but do you know at present i am obliged to spend it nearly all in steeltraps steeltraps for whom why for that fellow on the other side the wall you know were very good friends capital friends but we are obliged to keep our traps set on both sides of the wall we could not possibly keep on friendly terms without them and our spring guns the worst of it is we are both clever fellows enough and theres never a day passes that we dont find out a new trap or a new gunbarrel or something we spend about fifteen millions a year each in our traps take it altogether and i dont see how were to do with less a highly comic state of life for two private gentlemen but for two nations it seems to me not wholly comic bedlam would be comic perhaps if there were only one madman in it and your christmas pantomime is comic when there is only one clown in it but when the whole world turns clown and paints itself red with its own hearts blood instead of vermilion it is something else than comic i think  mind i know a great deal of this is play and willingly allow for that you dont know what to do with yourselves for a sensation foxhunting and cricketing will not carry you through the whole of this unendurably long mortal life you liked popguns when you were schoolboys and rifles and armstrongs are only the same things better made but then the worst of it is that what was play to you when boys was not play to the sparrows and what is play to you now is not play to the small birds of state neither and for the black eagles you are somewhat shy of taking shots at them if i mistake not205  i must get back to the matter in hand however believe me without further instance i could show you in all time that every nations vice or virtue was written in its art the soldiership of early greece the sensuality of late italy the visionary religion of tuscany the splendid human energy and beauty of venice i have no time to do this tonight i have done it elsewhere before now206 but i proceed to apply the principle to ourselves in a more searching manner  i notice that among all the new buildings that cover your once wild hills churches and schools are mixed in due that is to say in large proportion with your mills and mansions and i notice also that the churches and schools are almost always gothic and the mansions and mills are never gothic will you allow me to ask precisely the meaning of this for remember it is peculiarly a modern phenomenon when gothic was invented houses were gothic as well as churches and when the italian style superseded the gothic churches were italian as well as houses if there is a gothic spire to the cathedral of antwerp there is a gothic belfry to the hotel de ville at brussels if inigo jones builds an italian whitehall sir christopher wren builds an italian st pauls207 but now you live under one school of architecture and worship under another what do you mean by doing this am i to understand that you are thinking of changing your architecture back to gothic and that you treat your churches experimentally because it does not matter what mistakes you make in a church or am i to understand that you consider gothic a preeminently sacred and beautiful mode of building which you think like the fine frankincense should be mixed for the tabernacle only and reserved for your religious services for if this be the feeling though it may seem at first as if it were graceful and reverent you will find that at the root of the matter it signifies neither more nor less than that you have separated your religion from your life  for consider what a wide significance this fact has and remember that it is not you only but all the people of england who are behaving thus just now  you have all got into the habit of calling the church the house of god i have seen over the doors of many churches the legend actually carved this is the house of god and this is the gate of heaven208 now note where that legend comes from and of what place it was first spoken a boy leaves his fathers house to go on a long journey on foot to visit his uncle he has to cross a wild hilldesert just as if one of your own boys had to cross the wolds to visit an uncle at carlisle the second or third day your boy finds himself somewhere between hawes and brough in the midst of the moors at sunset it is stony ground and boggy he cannot go one foot further that night down he lies to sleep on wharnside where best he may gathering a few of the stones together to put under his headso wild the place is he cannot get anything but stones and there lying under the broad night he has a dream and he sees a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reaches to heaven and the angels of god are ascending and descending upon it and when he wakes out of his sleep he says how dreadful is this place surely this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven this place observe not this church not this city not this stone even which he puts up for a memorialthe piece of flint on which his head has lain but this place this windy slope of wharnside this moorland hollow torrentbitten snowblighted this any place where god lets down the ladder and how are you to know where that will be or how are you to determine where it may be but by being ready for it always do you know where the lightning is to fall next you do know that partly you can guide the lightning but you cannot guide the going forth of the spirit which is that lightning when it shines from the east to the west209  but the perpetual and insolent warping of that strong verse to serve a merely ecclesiastical purpose is only one of the thousand instances in which we sink back into gross judaism we call our churches temples now you know perfectly well they are not temples they have never had never can have anything whatever to do with temples they are synagoguesgathering placeswhere you gather yourselves together as an assembly and by not calling them so you again miss the force of another mighty textthou when thou prayest shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the churches we should translate it that they may be seen of men but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy fatherwhich is not in chancel nor in aisle but in secret210  now you feel as i say this to youi know you feelas if i were trying to take away the honour of your churches not so i am trying to prove to you the honour of your houses and your hills not that the church is not sacredbut that the whole earth is i would have you feel what careless what constant what infectious sin there is in all modes of thought whereby in calling your churches only holy you call your hearths and homes profane and have separated yourselves from the heathen by casting all your household gods to the ground instead of recognizing in the place of their many and feeble lares the presence of your one and mighty lord and lar  but what has all this to do with our exchange you ask me impatiently my dear friends it has just everything to do with it on these inner and great questions depend all the outer and little ones and if you have asked me down here to speak to you because you had before been interested in anything i have written you must know that all i have yet said about architecture was to show this the book i called the seven lamps was to show that certain right states of temper and moral feeling were the magic powers by which all good architecture without exception had been produced the stones of venice had from beginning to end no other aim than to show that the gothic architecture of venice had arisen out of and indicated in all its features a state of pure national faith and of domestic virtue and that its renaissance architecture had arisen out of and in all its features indicated a state of concealed national infidelity and of domestic corruption and now you ask me what style is best to build in and how can i answer knowing the meaning of the two styles but by another questiondo you mean to build as christians or as infidels and still moredo you mean to build as honest christians or as honest infidels as thoroughly and confessedly either one or the other you dont like to be asked such rude questions i cannot help it they are of much more importance than this exchange business and if they can be at once answered the exchange business settles itself in a moment but before i press them farther i must ask leave to explain one point clearly  in all my past work my endeavour has been to show that good architecture is essentially religiousthe production of a faithful and virtuous not of an infidel and corrupted people but in the course of doing this i have had also to show that good architecture is not ecclesiastical people are so apt to look upon religion as the business of the clergy not their own that the moment they hear of anything depending on religion they think it must also have depended on the priesthood and i have had to take what place was to be occupied between these two errors and fight both often with seeming contradiction good architecture is the work of good and believing men therefore you say at least some people say good architecture must essentially have been the work of the clergy not of the laity noa thousand times no good architecture211 has always been the work of the commonalty not of the clergy what you say those glorious cathedralsthe pride of europedid their builders not form gothic architecture no they corrupted gothic architecture gothic was formed in the barons castle and the burghers street it was formed by the thoughts and hands and powers of labouring citizens and warrior kings by the monk it was used as an instrument for the aid of his superstition when that superstition became a beautiful madness and the best hearts of europe vainly dreamed and pined in the cloister and vainly raged and perished in the crusadethrough that fury of perverted faith and wasted war the gothic rose also to its loveliest most fantastic and finally most foolish dreams and in those dreams was lost  i hope now that there is no risk of your misunderstanding me when i come to the gist of what i want to say tonightwhen i repeat that every great national architecture has been the result and exponent of a great national religion you cant have bits of it here bits thereyou must have it everywhere or nowhere it is not the monopoly of a clerical companyit is not the exponent of a theological dogmait is not the hieroglyphic writing of an initiated priesthood it is the manly language of a people inspired by resolute and common purpose and rendering resolute and common fidelity to the legible laws of an undoubted god  now there have as yet been three distinct schools of european architecture i say european because asiatic and african architectures belong so entirely to other races and climates that there is no question of them here only in passing i will simply assure you that whatever is good or great in egypt and syria and india is just good or great for the same reasons as the buildings on our side of the bosphorus we europeans then have had three great religions the greek which was the worship of the god of wisdom and power the mediæval which was the worship of the god of judgment and consolation the renaissance which was the worship of the god of pride and beauty these three we have hadthey are pastand now at last we english have got a fourth religion and a god of our own about which i want to ask you but i must explain these three old ones first  i repeat first the greeks essentially worshipped the god of wisdom so that whatever contended against their religionto the jews a stumblingblockwas to the greeksfoolishness212  the first greek idea of deity was that expressed in the word of which we keep the remnant in our words diurnal and divinethe god of day jupiter the revealer athena is his daughter but especially daughter of the intellect springing armed from the head we are only with the help of recent investigation beginning to penetrate the depth of meaning couched under the athenaic symbols but i may note rapidly that her ægis the mantle with the serpent fringes in which she often in the best statues is represented as folding up her left hand for better guard and the gorgon on her shield are both representative mainly of the chilling horror and sadness turning men to stone as it were of the outmost and superficial spheres of knowledgethat knowledge which separates in bitterness hardness and sorrow the heart of the fullgrown man from the heart of the child for out of imperfect knowledge spring terror dissension danger and disdain but from perfect knowledge given by the fullrevealed athena strength and peace in sign of which she is crowned with the olive spray and bears the resistless spear213  this then was the greek conception of purest deity and every habit of life and every form of his art developed themselves from the seeking this bright serene resistless wisdom and setting himself as a man to do things evermore rightly and strongly214 not with any ardent affection or ultimate hope but with a resolute and continent energy of will as knowing that for failure there was no consolation and for sin there was no remission and the greek architecture rose unerring bright clearly defined and selfcontained  next followed in europe the great christian faith which was essentially the religion of comfort its great doctrine is the remission of sins for which cause it happens too often in certain phases of christianity that sin and sickness themselves are partly glorified as if the more you had to be healed of the more divine was the healing the practical result of this doctrine in art is a continual contemplation of sin and disease and of imaginary states of purification from them thus we have an architecture conceived in a mingled sentiment of melancholy and aspiration partly severe partly luxuriant which will bend itself to every one of our needs and every one of our fancies and be strong or weak with us as we are strong or weak ourselves it is of all architecture the basest when base people build itof all the noblest when built by the noble  and now note that both these religionsgreek and mediævalperished by falsehood in their own main purpose the greek religion of wisdom perished in a false philosophyoppositions of science falsely so called the mediæval religion of consolation perished in false comfort in remission of sins given lyingly it was the selling of absolution that ended the mediæval faith and i can tell you more it is the selling of absolution which to the end of time will mark false christianity pure christianity gives her remission of sins only by ending them but false christianity gets her remission of sins by compounding for them and there are many ways of compounding for them we english have beautiful little quiet ways of buying absolution whether in low church or high far more cunning than any of tetzels trading215  then thirdly there followed the religion of pleasure in which all europe gave itself to luxury ending in death first bals masqués in every saloon and then guillotines in every square and all these three worships issue in vast temple building your greek worshipped wisdom and built you the parthenonthe virgins temple the mediæval worshipped consolation and built you virgin temples alsobut to our lady of salvation then the revivalist worshipped beauty of a sort and built you versailles and the vatican now lastly will you tell me what we worship and what we build  you know we are speaking always of the real active continual national worship that by which men act while they live not that which they talk of when they die now we have indeed a nominal religion to which we pay tithes of property and sevenths of time but we have also a practical and earnest religion to which we devote ninetenths of our property and sixthsevenths of our time and we dispute a great deal about the nominal religion but we are all unanimous about this practical one of which i think you will admit that the ruling goddess may be best generally described as the goddess of gettingon or britannia of the market the athenians had an athena agoraia or athena of the market but she was a subordinate type of their goddess while our britannia agoraia is the principal type of ours and all your great architectural works are of course built to her it is long since you built a great cathedral and how you would laugh at me if i proposed building a cathedral on the top of one of these hills of yours taking it for an acropolis but your railroad mounds vaster than the walls of babylon your railroad stations vaster than the temple of ephesus and innumerable your chimneys how much more mighty and costly than cathedral spires your harbourpiers your warehouses your exchangesall these are built to your great goddess of gettingon and she has formed and will continue to form your architecture as long as you worship her and it is quite vain to ask me to tell you how to build to her you know far better than i  there might indeed on some theories be a conceivably good architecture for exchangesthat is to say if there were any heroism in the fact or deed of exchange which might be typically carved on the outside of your building for you know all beautiful architecture must be adorned with sculpture or painting and for sculpture or painting you must have a subject and hitherto it has been a received opinion among the nations of the world that the only right subjects for either were heroisms of some sort even on his pots and his flagons the greek put a hercules slaying lions or an apollo slaying serpents or bacchus slaying melancholy giants and earthborn despondencies on his temples the greek put contests of great warriors in founding states or of gods with evil spirits on his houses and temples alike the christian put carvings of angels conquering devils or of heromartyrs exchanging this world for another subject inappropriate i think to our manner of exchange here and the master of christians not only left his followers without any orders as to the sculpture of affairs of exchange on the outside of buildings but gave some strong evidence of his dislike of affairs of exchange within them216 and yet there might surely be a heroism in such affairs and all commerce become a kind of selling of doves not impious the wonder has always been great to me that heroism has never been supposed to be in any wise consistent with the practice of supplying people with food or clothes but rather with that of quartering ones self upon them for food and stripping them of their clothes spoiling of armour is an heroic deed in all ages but the selling of clothes old or new has never taken any colour of magnanimity yet one does not see why feeding the hungry and clothing the naked should ever become base businesses even when engaged in on a large scale if one could contrive to attach the notion of conquest to them anyhow so that supposing there were anywhere an obstinate race who refused to be comforted one might take some pride in giving them compulsory comfort and as it were occupying a country with ones gifts instead of ones armies if one could only consider it as much a victory to get a barren field sown as to get an eared field stripped and contend who should build villages instead of who should carry them are not all forms of heroism conceivable in doing these serviceable deeds you doubt who is strongest it might be ascertained by push of spade as well as push of sword who is wisest there are witty things to be thought of in planning other business than campaigns who is bravest there are always the elements to fight with stronger than men and nearly as merciless  the only absolutely and unapproachably heroic element in the soldiers work seems to bethat he is paid little for itand regularly while you traffickers and exchangers and others occupied in presumably benevolent business like to be paid much for itand by chance i never can make out how it is that a knighterrant does not expect to be paid for his trouble but a pedlarerrant always doesthat people are willing to take hard knocks for nothing but never to sell ribands cheap that they are ready to go on fervent crusades to recover the tomb of a buried god but never on any travels to fulfil the orders of a living onethat they will go anywhere barefoot to preach their faith but must be well bribed to practise it and are perfectly ready to give the gospel gratis but never the loaves and fishes  if you chose to take the matter up on any such soldierly principle to do your commerce and your feeding of nations for fixed salaries and to be as particular about giving people the best food and the best cloth as soldiers are about giving them the best gunpowder i could carve something for you on your exchange worth looking at but i can only at present suggest decorating its frieze with pendant purses and making its pillars broad at the base for the sticking of bills and in the innermost chambers of it there might be a statue of britannia of the market who may have perhaps advisably a partridge for her crest typical at once of her courage in fighting for noble ideas and of her interest in game and round its neck the inscription in golden letters perdix fovit quæ non peperit217 then for her spear she might have a weavers beam and on her shield instead of st georges cross the milanese boar semifleeced with the town of gennesaret proper in the field and the legend in the best market218 and her corslet of leather folded over her heart in the shape of a purse with thirty slits in it for a piece of money to go in at on each day of the month and i doubt not but that people would come to see your exchange and its goddess with applause  nevertheless i want to point out to you certain strange characters in this goddess of yours she differs from the great greek and mediæval deities essentially in two thingsfirst as to the continuance of her presumed power secondly as to the extent of it  1st as to the continuance  the greek goddess of wisdom gave continual increase of wisdom as the christian spirit of comfort or comforter continual increase of comfort there was no question with these of any limit or cessation of function but with your agora goddess that is just the most important question getting onbut where to gathering togetherbut how much do you mean to gather alwaysnever to spend if so i wish you joy of your goddess for i am just as well off as you without the trouble of worshipping her at all but if you do not spend somebody else willsomebody else must and it is because of this among many other such errors that i have fearlessly declared your socalled science of political economy to be no science because namely it has omitted the study of exactly the most important branch of the businessthe study of spending for spend you must and as much as you make ultimately you gather cornwill you bury england under a heap of grain or will you when you have gathered finally eat you gather goldwill you make your houseroofs of it or pave your streets with it that is still one way of spending it but if you keep it that you may get more ill give you more ill give you all the gold you wantall you can imagineif you can tell me what youll do with it you shall have thousands of goldpiecesthousands of thousandsmillionsmountains of gold where will you keep them will you put an olympus of silver upon a golden pelionmake ossa like a wart219 do you think the rain and dew would then come down to you in the streams from such mountains more blessedly than they will down the mountains which god has made for you of moss and whinstone but it is not gold that you want to gather what is it greenbacks no not those neither what is it thenis it ciphers after a capital i cannot you practise writing ciphers and write as many as you want write ciphers for an hour every morning in a big book and say every evening i am worth all those noughts more than i was yesterday wont that do well what in the name of plutus is it you want not gold not greenbacks not ciphers after a capital i you will have to answer after all no we want somehow or other moneys worth well what is that let your goddess of gettingon discover it and let her learn to stay therein  2d but there is yet another question to be asked respecting this goddess of gettingon the first was of the continuance of her power the second is of its extent  pallas and the madonna were supposed to be all the worlds pallas and all the worlds madonna they could teach all men and they could comfort all men but look strictly into the nature of the power of your goddess of gettingon and you will find she is the goddessnot of everybodys getting onbut only of somebodys getting on this is a vital or rather deathful distinction examine it in your own ideal of the state of national life which this goddess is to evoke and maintain i asked you what it was when i was last hereyou have never told me220 now shall i try to tell you  your ideal of human life then is i think that it should be passed in a pleasant undulating world with iron and coal everywhere underneath it on each pleasant bank of this world is to be a beautiful mansion with two wings and stables and coachhouses a moderatelysized park a large garden and hothouses and pleasant carriage drives through the shrubberies in this mansion are to live the favoured votaries of the goddess the english gentleman with his gracious wife and his beautiful family always able to have the boudoir and the jewels for the wife and the beautiful ball dresses for the daughters and hunters for the sons and a shooting in the highlands for himself at the bottom of the bank is to be the mill not less than a quarter of a mile long with a steam engine at each end and two in the middle and a chimney three hundred feet high in this mill are to be in constant employment from eight hundred to a thousand workers who never drink never strike always go to church on sunday and always express themselves in respectful language  is not that broadly and in the main features the kind of thing you propose to yourselves it is very pretty indeed seen from above not at all so pretty seen from below for observe while to one family this deity is indeed the goddess of gettingon to a thousand families she is the goddess of not gettingon nay you say they have all their chance yes so has every one in a lottery but there must always be the same number of blanks ah but in a lottery it is not skill and intelligence which take the lead but blind chance what then do you think the old practice that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can221 is less iniquitous when the power has become power of brains instead of fist and that though we may not take advantage of a childs or a womans weakness we may of a mans foolishness nay but finally work must be done and some one must be at the top some one at the bottom granted my friends work must always be and captains of work must always be and if you in the least remember the tone of any of my writings you must know that they are thought unfit for this age because they are always insisting on need of government and speaking with scorn of liberty but i beg you to observe that there is a wide difference between being captains or governors of work and taking the profits of it it does not follow because you are general of an army that you are to take all the treasure or land it wins if it fight for treasure or land neither because you are king of a nation that you are to consume all the profits of the nations work real kings on the contrary are known invariably by their doing quite the reverse of thisby their taking the least possible quantity of the nations work for themselves there is no test of real kinghood so infallible as that does the crowned creature live simply bravely unostentatiously probably he is a king does he cover his body with jewels and his table with delicates in all probability he is not a king it is possible he may be as solomon was but that is when the nation shares his splendour with him solomon made gold not only to be in his own palace as stones but to be in jerusalem as stones222 but even so for the most part these splendid kinghoods expire in ruin and only the true kinghoods live which are of royal labourers governing loyal labourers who both leading rough lives establish the true dynasties conclusively you will find that because you are king of a nation it does not follow that you are to gather for yourself all the wealth of that nation neither because you are king of a small part of the nation and lord over the means of its maintenanceover field or mill or mineare you to take all the produce of that piece of the foundation of national existence for yourself  you will tell me i need not preach against these things for i cannot mend them no good friends i cannot but you can and you will or something else can and will even good things have no abiding powerand shall these evil things persist in victorious evil all history shows on the contrary that to be the exact thing they never can do change must come but it is ours to determine whether change of growth or change of death shall the parthenon be in ruins on its rock and bolton priory223 in its meadow but these mills of yours be the consummation of the buildings of the earth and their wheels be as the wheels of eternity think you that men may come and men may go butmillsgo on for ever224 not so out of these better or worse shall come and it is for you to choose which  i know that none of this wrong is done with deliberate purpose i know on the contrary that you wish your workmen well that you do much for them and that you desire to do more for them if you saw your way to such benevolence safely i know that even all this wrong and misery are brought about by a warped sense of duty each of you striving to do his best but unhappily not knowing for whom this best should be done and all our hearts have been betrayed by the plausible impiety of the modern economist telling us that to do the best for ourselves is finally to do the best for others friends our great master said not so and most absolutely we shall find this world is not made so indeed to do the best for others is finally to do the best for ourselves but it will not do to have our eyes fixed on that issue the pagans had got beyond that hear what a pagan says of this matter hear what were perhaps the last written words of platoif not the last actually written for this we cannot know yet assuredly in fact and power his parting wordsin which endeavouring to give full crowning and harmonious close to all his thoughts and to speak the sum of them by the imagined sentence of the great spirit his strength and his heart fail him and the words cease broken off for ever they are at the close of the dialogue called critias in which he describes partly from real tradition partly in ideal dream the early state of athens and the genesis and order and religion of the fabled isle of atlantis in which genesis he conceives the same first perfection and final degeneracy of man which in our own scriptural tradition is expressed by saying that the sons of god intermarried with the daughters of men225 for he supposes the earliest race to have been indeed the children of god and to have corrupted themselves until their spot was not the spot of his children226 and this he says was the end that indeed through many generations so long as the gods nature in them yet was full they were submissive to the sacred laws and carried themselves lovingly to all that had kindred with them in divineness for their uttermost spirit was faithful and true and in every wise great so that in all meekness of wisdom they dealt with each other and took all the chances of life and despising all things except virtue they cared little what happened day by day and bore lightly the burden of gold and of possessions for they saw that if only their common love and virtue increased all these things would be increased together with them but to set their esteem and ardent pursuit upon material possession would be to lose that first and their virtue and affection together with it and by such reasoning and what of the divine nature remained in them they gained all this greatness of which we have already told but when the gods part of them faded and became extinct being mixed again and again and effaced by the prevalent mortality and the human nature at last exceeded they then became unable to endure the courses of fortune and fell into shapelessness of life and baseness in the sight of him who could see having lost everything that was fairest of their honour while to the blind hearts which could not discern the true life tending to happiness it seemed that they were then chiefly noble and happy being filled with an iniquity of inordinate possession and power whereupon the god of gods whose kinghood is in laws beholding a once just nation thus cast into misery and desiring to lay such punishment upon them as might make them repent into restraining gathered together all the gods into his dwellingplace which from heavens centre overlooks whatever has part in creation and having assembled them he said   the rest is silence last words of the chief wisdom of the heathen spoken of this idol of riches this idol of yours this golden image high by measureless cubits set up where your green fields of england are furnaceburnt into the likeness of the plain of dura227 this idol forbidden to us first of all idols by our own master and faith forbidden to us also by every human lip that has ever in any age or people been accounted of as able to speak according to the purposes of god continue to make that forbidden deity your principal one and soon no more art no more science no more pleasure will be possible catastrophe will come or worse than catastrophe slow mouldering and withering into hades but if you can fix some conception of a true human state of life to be striven forlife good for all men as for yourselves if you can determine some honest and simple order of existence following those trodden ways of wisdom which are pleasantness228 and seeking her quiet and withdrawn paths which are peacethen and so sanctifying wealth into commonwealth all your art your literature your daily labours your domestic affection and citizens duty will join and increase into one magnificent harmony you will know then how to build well enough you will build with stone well but with flesh better temples not made with hands229 but riveted of hearts and that kind of marble crimsonveined is indeed eternal     202 delivered in the town hall

lectures on various subjects     religion excepted arranged by some of the foremost residents in     dublin the latter half of the lecture is included in the present     volume of selections the first publication of the lecture was as     an additional part to a revised edition of sesame and lilies in     1871 ruskin took exceptional care in writing the mystery of     life he once said in conversation i put into it all that i     know and in the preface to it when published he tells us that     certain passages of it contain the best expression i have yet     been able to put in words of what so far as is within my power i     mean henceforward both to do myself and to plead with all over     whom i have any influence to do according to their means sir     leslie stephen says this is to my mind the most perfect of his     essays in later editions of sesame and lilies this lecture was     withdrawn at the time the lecture was delivered its tone was     characteristic of ruskins own thought and of the attitude he then     took toward the public  we have sat at the feet of the poets who sang of heaven and they have told us their dreams we have listened to the poets who sang of earth and they have chanted to us dirges and words of despair but there is one class of men moremen not capable of vision nor sensitive to sorrow but firm of purposepractised in business learned in all that can be by handling known men whose hearts and hopes are wholly in this present world from whom therefore we may surely learn at least how at present conveniently to live in it what will they say to us or show us by example these kingsthese councillorsthese statesmen and builders of kingdomsthese capitalists and men of business who weigh the earth and the dust of it in a balance230 they know the world surely and what is the mystery of life to us is none to them they can surely show us how to live while we live and to gather out of the present world what is best  i think i can best tell you their answer by telling you a dream i had once for though i am no poet i have dreams sometimesi dreamed i was at a childs mayday party in which every means of entertainment had been provided for them by a wise and kind host it was in a stately house with beautiful gardens attached to it and the children had been set free in the rooms and gardens with no care whatever but how to pass their afternoon rejoicingly they did not indeed know much about what was to happen next day and some of them i thought were a little frightened because there was a chance of their being sent to a new school where there were examinations but they kept the thoughts of that out of their heads as well as they could and resolved to enjoy themselves the house i said was in a beautiful garden and in the garden were all kinds of flowers sweet grassy banks for rest and smooth lawns for play and pleasant streams and woods and rocky places for climbing and the children were happy for a little while but presently they separated themselves into parties and then each party declared it would have a piece of the garden for its own and that none of the others should have anything to do with that piece next they quarrelled violently which pieces they would have and at last the boys took up the thing as boys should do practically and fought in the flowerbeds till there was hardly a flower left standing then they trampled down each others bits of the garden out of spite and the girls cried till they could cry no more and so they all lay down at last breathless in the ruin and waited for the time when they were to be taken home in the evening231  meanwhile the children in the house had been making themselves happy also in their manner for them there had been provided every kind of indoor pleasure there was music for them to dance to and the library was open with all manner of amusing books and there was a museum full of the most curious shells and animals and birds and there was a workshop with lathes and carpenters tools for the ingenious boys and there were pretty fantastic dresses for the girls to dress in and there were microscopes and kaleidoscopes and whatever toys a child could fancy and a table in the diningroom loaded with everything nice to eat  but in the midst of all this it struck two or three of the more practical children that they would like some of the brassheaded nails that studded the chairs and so they set to work to pull them out presently the others who were reading or looking at shells took a fancy to do the like and in a little while all the children nearly were spraining their fingers in pulling out brassheaded nails with all that they could pull out they were not satisfied and then everybody wanted some of somebody elses and at last the really practical and sensible ones declared that nothing was of any real consequence that afternoon except to get plenty of brassheaded nails and that the books and the cakes and the microscopes were of no use at all in themselves but only if they could be exchanged for nailheads and at last they began to fight for nailheads as the others fought for the bits of garden only here and there a despised one shrank away into a corner and tried to get a little quiet with a book in the midst of the noise but all the practical ones thought of nothing else but counting nailheads all the afternooneven though they knew they would not be allowed to carry so much as one brass knob away with them but noit waswho has most nails i have a hundred and you have fifty or i have a thousand and you have two i must have as many as you before i leave the house or i cannot possibly go home in peace at last they made so much noise that i awoke and thought to myself what a false dream that is of children the child is the father of the man232 and wiser children never do such foolish things only men do  but there is yet one last class of persons to be interrogated the wise religious men we have asked in vain the wise contemplative men in vain the wise worldly men in vain but there is another group yet in the midst of this vanity of empty religionof tragic contemplationof wrathful and wretched ambition and dispute for dust there is yet one great group of persons by whom all these disputers livethe persons who have determined or have had it by a beneficent providence determined for them that they will do something useful that whatever may be prepared for them hereafter or happen to them here they will at least deserve the food that god gives them by winning it honourably and that however fallen from the purity or far from the peace of eden they will carry out the duty of human dominion though they have lost its felicity and dress and keep the wilderness233 though they no more can dress or keep the garden  thesehewers of wood and drawers of water234these bent under burdens or torn of scourgesthese that dig and weavethat plant and build workers in wood and in marble and in ironby whom all food clothing habitation furniture and means of delight are produced for themselves and for all men beside men whose deeds are good though their words may be few men whose lives are serviceable be they never so short and worthy of honour be they never so humblefrom these surely at least we may receive some clear message of teaching and pierce for an instant into the mystery of life and of its arts  yes from these at last we do receive a lesson but i grieve to say or ratherfor that is the deeper truth of the matteri rejoice to saythis message of theirs can only be received by joining themnot by thinking about them  you sent for me to talk to you of art and i have obeyed you in coming but the main thing i have to tell you isthat art must not be talked about the fact that there is talk about it at all signifies that it is ill done or cannot be done no true painter ever speaks or ever has spoken much of his art the greatest speak nothing even reynolds is no exception for he wrote of all that he could not himself do235 and was utterly silent respecting all that he himself did  the moment a man can really do his work he becomes speechless about it all words become idle to himall theories  does a bird need to theorize about building its nest or boast of it when built all good work is essentially done that waywithout hesitation without difficulty without boasting and in the doers of the best there is an inner and involuntary power which approximates literally to the instinct of an animalnay i am certain that in the most perfect human artists reason does not supersede instinct but is added to an instinct as much more divine than that of the lower animals as the human body is more beautiful than theirs that a great singer sings not with less instinct than the nightingale but with moreonly more various applicable and governable that a great architect does not build with less instinct than the beaver or the bee but with morewith an innate cunning of proportion that embraces all beauty and a divine ingenuity of skill that improvises all construction but be that as it maybe the instinct less or more than that of inferior animalslike or unlike theirs still the human art is dependent on that first and then upon an amount of practice of scienceand of imagination disciplined by thought which the true possessor of it knows to be incommunicable and the true critic of it inexplicable except through long process of laborious years that journey of lifes conquest in which hills over hills and alps on alps arose and sankdo you think you can make another trace it painlessly by talking why you cannot even carry us up an alp by talking you can guide us up it step by step no otherwiseeven so best silently you girls who have been among the hills know how the bad guide chatters and gesticulates and it is put your foot here and mind how you balance yourself there but the good guide walks on quietly without a word only with his eyes on you when need is and his arm like an iron bar if need be  in that slow way also art can be taughtif you have faith in your guide and will let his arm be to you as an iron bar when need is but in what teacher of art have you such faith certainly not in me for as i told you at first i know well enough it is only because you think i can talk not because you think i know my business that you let me speak to you at all if i were to tell you anything that seemed to you strange you would not believe it and yet it would only be in telling you strange things that i could be of use to you i could be of great use to youinfinite usewith brief saying if you would believe it but you would not just because the thing that would be of real use would displease you you are all wild for instance with admiration of gustave doré well suppose i were to tell you in the strongest terms i could use that gustave dorés art was badbad not in weaknessnot in failurebut bad with dreadful powerthe power of the furies and the harpies mingled enraging and polluting that so long as you looked at it no perception of pure or beautiful art was possible for you suppose i were to tell you that what would be the use would you look at gustave doré less rather more i fancy on the other hand i could soon put you into good humour with me if i chose i know well enough what you like and how to praise it to your better liking i could talk to you about moonlight and twilight and spring flowers and autumn leaves and the madonnas of raphaelhow motherly and the sibyls of michael angelohow majestic and the saints of angelicohow pious and the cherubs of correggiohow delicious old as i am i could play you a tune on the harp yet that you would dance to but neither you nor i should be a bit the better or wiser or if we were our increased wisdom could be of no practical effect for indeed the arts as regards teachableness differ from the sciences also in this that their power is founded not merely on facts which can be communicated but on dispositions which require to be created art is neither to be achieved by effort of thinking nor explained by accuracy of speaking it is the instinctive and necessary result of power which can only be developed through the mind of successive generations and which finally burst into life under social conditions as slow of growth as the faculties they regulate whole æras of mighty history are summed and the passions of dead myriads are concentrated in the existence of a noble art and if that noble art were among us we should feel it and rejoice not caring in the least to hear lectures on it and since it is not among us be assured we have to go back to the root of it or at least to the place where the stock of it is yet alive and the branches began to die  and now may i have your pardon for pointing out partly with reference to matters which are at this time of greater moment than the artsthat if we undertook such recession to the vital germ of national arts that have decayed we should find a more singular arrest of their power in ireland than in any other european country for in the eighth century ireland possessed a school of art in her manuscripts and sculpture which in many of its qualitiesapparently in all essential qualities of decorative inventionwas quite without rival seeming as if it might have advanced to the highest triumphs in architecture and in painting but there was one fatal flaw in its nature by which it was stayed and stayed with a conspicuousness of pause to which there is no parallel so that long ago in tracing the progress of european schools from infancy to strength i chose for the students of kensington in a lecture since published two characteristic examples of early art of equal skill but in the one case skill which was progressivein the other skill which was at pause in the one case it was work receptive of correctionhungry for correction and in the other work which inherently rejected correction i chose for them a corrigible eve and an incorrigible angel and i grieve to say236 that the incorrigible angel was also an irish angel  and the fatal difference lay wholly in this in both pieces of art there was an equal falling short of the needs of fact but the lombardic eve knew she was in the wrong and the irish angel thought himself all right the eager lombardic sculptor though firmly insisting on his childish idea yet showed in the irregular broken touches of the features and the imperfect struggle for softer lines in the form a perception of beauty and law that he could not render there was the strain of effort under conscious imperfection in every line but the irish missalpainter had drawn his angel with no sense of failure in happy complacency and put red dots into the palms of each hand and rounded the eyes into perfect circles and i regret to say left the mouth out altogether with perfect satisfaction to himself  may i without offence ask you to consider whether this mode of arrest in ancient irish art may not be indicative of points of character which even yet in some measure arrest your national power i have seen much of irish character and have watched it closely for i have also much loved it and i think the form of failure to which it is most liable is thisthat being generoushearted and wholly intending always to do right it does not attend to the external laws of right but thinks it must necessarily do right because it means to do so and therefore does wrong without finding it out and then when the consequences of its wrong come upon it or upon others connected with it it cannot conceive that the wrong is in any wise of its causing or of its doing but flies into wrath and a strange agony of desire for justice as feeling itself wholly innocent which leads it farther astray until there is nothing that it is not capable of doing with a good conscience  but mind i do not mean to say that in past or present relations between ireland and england you have been wrong and we right far from that i believe that in all great questions of principle and in all details of administration of law you have been usually right and we wrong sometimes in misunderstanding you sometimes in resolute iniquity to you nevertheless in all disputes between states though the strongest is nearly always mainly in the wrong the weaker is often so in a minor degree and i think we sometimes admit the possibility of our being in error and you never do237  and now returning to the broader question what these arts and labours of life have to teach us of its mystery this is the first of their lessonsthat the more beautiful the art the more it is essentially the work of people who feel themselves wrongwho are striving for the fulfilment of a law and the grasp of a loveliness which they have not yet attained which they feel even farther and farther from attaining the more they strive for it and yet in still deeper sense it is the work of people who know also that they are right the very sense of inevitable error from their purpose marks the perfectness of that purpose and the continued sense of failure arises from the continued opening of the eyes more clearly to all the sacredest laws of truth  this is one lesson the second is a very plain and greatly precious one namelythat whenever the arts and labours of life are fulfilled in this spirit of striving against misrule and doing whatever we have to do honourably and perfectly they invariably bring happiness as much as seems possible to the nature of man in all other paths by which that happiness is pursued there is disappointment or destruction for ambition and for passion there is no restno fruition the fairest pleasures of youth perish in a darkness greater than their past light and the loftiest and purest love too often does but inflame the cloud of life with endless fire of pain but ascending from lowest to highest through every scale of human industry that industry worthily followed gives peace ask the labourer in the field at the forge or in the mine ask the patient delicatefingered artisan or the strongarmed fieryhearted worker in bronze and in marble and in the colours of light and none of these who are true workmen will ever tell you that they have found the law of heaven an unkind onethat in the sweat of their face they should eat bread till they return to the ground238 nor that they ever found it an unrewarded obedience if indeed it was rendered faithfully to the commandwhatsoever thy hand findeth to dodo it with thy might239  these are the two great and constant lessons which our labourers teach us of the mystery of life but there is another and a sadder one which they cannot teach us which we must read on their tombstones  do it with thy might there have been myriads upon myriads of human creatures who have obeyed this lawwho have put every breath and nerve of their being into its toilwho have devoted every hour and exhausted every facultywho have bequeathed their unaccomplished thoughts at deathwho being dead have yet spoken240 by majesty of memory and strength of example and at last what has all this might of humanity accomplished in six thousand years of labour and sorrow what has it done take the three chief occupations and arts of men one by one and count their achievements begin with the firstthe lord of them allagriculture six thousand years have passed since we were sent to till the ground from which we were taken how much of it is tilled how much of that which is wisely or well in the very centre and chief garden of europewhere the two forms of parent christianity have had their fortresseswhere the noble catholics of the forest cantons and the noble protestants of the vaudois valleys have maintained for dateless ages their faiths and libertiesthere the unchecked alpine rivers yet run wild in devastation and the marshes which a few hundred men could redeem with a years labour still blast their helpless inhabitants into fevered idiotism that is so in the centre of europe while on the near coast of africa once the garden of the hesperides an arab woman but a few sunsets since ate her child for famine and with all the treasures of the east at our feet we in our own dominion could not find a few grains of rice for a people that asked of us no more but stood by and saw five hundred thousand of them perish of hunger241  then after agriculture the art of kings take the next head of human artsweaving the art of queens honoured of all noble heathen women in the person of their virgin goddess242honoured of all hebrew women by the word of their wisest kingshe layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretcheth out her hand to the poor she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself covering of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant243 what have we done in all these thousands of years with this bright art of greek maid and christian matron six thousand years of weaving and have we learned to weave might not every naked wall have been purple with tapestry and every feeble breast fenced with sweet colours from the cold what have we done our fingers are too few it seems to twist together some poor covering for our bodies we set our streams to work for us and choke the air with fire to turn our pinningwheelsandare we yet clothed are not the streets of the capitals of europe foul with the sale of cast clouts and rotten rags244 is not the beauty of your sweet children left in wretchedness of disgrace while with better honour nature clothes the brood of the bird in its nest and the suckling of the wolf in her den and does not every winters snow robe what you have not robed and shroud what you have not shrouded and every winters wind bear up to heaven its wasted souls to witness against you hereafter by the voice of their christi was naked and ye clothed me not245  lastlytake the art of buildingthe strongestproudestmost orderlymost enduring of the arts of man that of which the produce is in the surest manner accumulative and need not perish or be replaced but if once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced rocksmore prevalently than the crumbling hills the art which is associated with all civic pride and sacred principle with which men record their powersatisfy their enthusiasmmake sure their defencedefine and make dear their habitation and in six thousand years of building what have we done of the greater part of all that skill and strength no vestige is left but fallen stones that encumber the fields and impede the streams but from this waste of disorder and of time and of rage what is left to us constructive and progressive creatures that we are with ruling brains and forming hands capable of fellowship and thirsting for fame can we not contend in comfort with the insects of the forest or in achievement with the worm of the sea the white surf rages in vain against the ramparts built by poor atoms of scarcely nascent life but only ridges of formless ruin mark the places where once dwelt our noblest multitudes the ant and the moth have cells for each of their young but our little ones lie in festering heaps in homes that consume them like graves and night by night from the corners of our streets rises up the cry of the homelessi was a stranger and ye took me not in246  must it be always thus is our life for ever to be without profitwithout possession shall the strength of its generations be as barren as death or cast away their labour as the wild figtree casts her untimely figs247 is it all a dream thenthe desire of the eyes and the pride of lifeor if it be might we not live in nobler dream than this the poets and prophets the wise men and the scribes though they have told us nothing about a life to come have told us much about the life that is now they have hadthey alsotheir dreams and we have laughed at them they have dreamed of mercy and of justice they have dreamed of peace and goodwill they have dreamed of labour undisappointed and of rest undisturbed they have dreamed of fulness in harvest and overflowing in store they have dreamed of wisdom in council and of providence in law of gladness of parents and strength of children and glory of grey hairs and at these visions of theirs we have mocked and held them for idle and vain unreal and unaccomplishable what have we accomplished with our realities is this what has come of our worldly wisdom tried against their folly this our mightiest possible against their impotent ideal or have we only wandered among the spectra of a baser felicity and chased phantoms of the tombs instead of visions of the almighty and walked after the imaginations of our evil hearts248 instead of after the counsels of eternity until our livesnot in the likeness of the cloud of heaven but of the smoke of hellhave become as a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away249  does it vanish then are you sure of thatsure that the nothingness of the grave will be a rest from this troubled nothingness and that the coiling shadow which disquiets itself in vain cannot change into the smoke of the torment that ascends for ever250 will any answer that they are sure of it and that there is no fear nor hope nor desire nor labour whither they go251 be it so will you not then make as sure of the life that now is as you are of the death that is to come your hearts are wholly in this worldwill you not give them to it wisely as well as perfectly and see first of all that you have hearts and sound hearts too to give because you have no heaven to look for is that any reason that you should remain ignorant of this wonderful and infinite earth which is firmly and instantly given you in possession although your days are numbered and the following darkness sure is it necessary that you should share the degradation of the brute because you are condemned to its mortality or live the life of the moth and of the worm because you are to companion them in the dust not so we may have but a few thousands of days to spend perhaps hundreds onlyperhaps tens nay the longest of our time and best looked back on will be but as a moment as the twinkling of an eye still we are men not insects we are living spirits not passing clouds he maketh the winds his messengers the momentary fire his minister252 and shall we do less than these let us do the work of men while we bear the form of them and as we snatch our narrow portion of time out of eternity snatch also our narrow inheritance of passion out of immortalityeven though our lives be as a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away  but there are some of you who believe not thiswho think this cloud of life has no such closethat it is to float revealed and illumined upon the floor of heaven in the day when he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him253 some day you believe within these five or ten or twenty years for every one of us the judgment will be set and the books opened254 if that be true far more than that must be true is there but one day of judgment why for us every day is a day of judgmentevery day is a dies iræ255 and writes its irrevocable verdict in the flame of its west think you that judgment waits till the doors of the grave are opened it waits at the doors of your housesit waits at the corners of your streets we are in the midst of judgmentthe insects that we crush are our judgesthe moments that we fret away are our judgesthe elements that feed us judge as they ministerand the pleasures that deceive us judge as they indulge let us for our lives do the work of men while we bear the form of them if indeed those lives are not as a vapour and do not vanish away  the work of menand what is that well we may any of us know very quickly on the condition of being wholly ready to do it but many of us are for the most part thinking not of what we are to do but of what we are to get and the best of us are sunk into the sin of ananias256 and it is a mortal onewe want to keep back part of the price and we continually talk of taking up our cross as if the only harm in a cross was the weight of itas if it was only a thing to be carried instead of to becrucified upon they that are his have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts257 does that mean think you that in time of national distress of religious trial of crisis for every interest and hope of humanitynone of us will cease jesting none cease idling none put themselves to any wholesome work none take so much as a tag of lace off their footmens coats to save the world or does it rather mean that they are ready to leave houses lands and kindredsyes and life if need be lifesome of us are ready enough to throw that away joyless as we have made it but station in lifehow many of us are ready to quit that is it not always the great objection where there is question of finding something useful to dowe cannot leave our stations in life  those of us who really cannotthat is to say who can only maintain themselves by continuing in some business or salaried office have already something to do and all that they have to see to is that they do it honestly and with all their might but with most people who use that apology remaining in the station of life to which providence has called them means keeping all the carriages and all the footmen and large houses they can possibly pay for and once for all i say that if ever providence did put them into stations of that sortwhich is not at all a matter of certaintyprovidence is just now very distinctly calling them out again levis station in life was the receipt of custom and peters the shore of galilee and pauls the antechambers of the high priestwhich station in life each had to leave with brief notice  and whatever our station in life may be at this crisis those of us who mean to fulfil our duty ought first to live on as little as we can and secondly to do all the wholesome work for it we can and to spend all we can spare in doing all the sure good we can  and sure good is first in feeding people then in dressing people then in lodging people and lastly in rightly pleasing people with arts or sciences or any other subject of thought  i say first in feeding and once for all do not let yourselves be deceived by any of the common talk of indiscriminate charity the order to us is not to feed the deserving hungry nor the industrious hungry nor the amiable and wellintentioned hungry but simply to feed the hungry258 it is quite true infallibly true that if any man will not work neither should he eat259think of that and every time you sit down to your dinner ladies and gentlemen say solemnly before you ask a blessing how much work have i done today for my dinner but the proper way to enforce that order on those below you as well as on yourselves is not to leave vagabonds and honest people to starve together but very distinctly to discern and seize your vagabond and shut your vagabond up out of honest peoples way and very sternly then see that until he has worked he does not eat but the first thing is to be sure you have the food to give and therefore to enforce the organization of vast activities in agriculture and in commerce for the production of the wholesomest food and proper storing and distribution of it so that no famine shall any more be possible among civilized beings there is plenty of work in this business alone and at once for any number of people who like to engage in it  secondly dressing peoplethat is to say urging every one within reach of your influence to be always neat and clean and giving them means of being so in so far as they absolutely refuse you must give up the effort with respect to them only taking care that no children within your sphere of influence shall any more be brought up with such habits and that every person who is willing to dress with propriety shall have encouragement to do so and the first absolutely necessary step towards this is the gradual adoption of a consistent dress for different ranks of persons so that their rank shall be known by their dress and the restriction of the changes of fashion within certain limits all which appears for the present quite impossible but it is only so far even difficult as it is difficult to conquer our vanity frivolity and desire to appear what we are not and it is not nor ever shall be creed of mine that these mean and shallow vices are unconquerable by christian women  and then thirdly lodging people which you may think should have been put first but i put it third because we must feed and clothe people where we find them and lodge them afterwards and providing lodgment for them means a great deal of vigorous legislation and cutting down of vested interests that stand in the way and after that or before that so far as we can get it thorough sanitary and remedial action in the houses that we have and then the building of more strongly beautifully and in groups of limited extent kept in proportion to their streams and walled round so that there may be no festering and wretched suburb anywhere but clean and busy street within and the open country without with a belt of beautiful garden and orchard round the walls so that from any part of the city perfectly fresh air and grass and the sight of far horizon might be reachable in a few minutes walk this is the final aim but in immediate action every minor and possible good to be instantly done when and as we can roofs mended that have holes in themfences patched that have gaps in themwalls buttressed that totterand floors propped that shake cleanliness and order enforced with our own hands and eyes till we are breathless every day and all the fine arts will healthily follow i myself have washed a flight of stone stairs all down with bucket and broom in a savoy inn where they hadnt washed their stairs since they first went up them and i never made a better sketch than that afternoon  these then are the three first needs of civilized life and the law for every christian man and woman is that they shall be in direct service towards one of these three needs as far as is consistent with their own special occupation and if they have no special business then wholly in one of these services and out of such exertion in plain duty all other good will come for in this direct contention with material evil you will find out the real nature of all evil you will discern by the various kinds of resistance what is really the fault and main antagonism to good also you will find the most unexpected helps and profound lessons given and truths will come thus down to us which the speculation of all our lives would never have raised us up to you will find nearly every educational problem solved as soon as you truly want to do something everybody will become of use in their own fittest way and will learn what is best for them to know in that use competitive examination will then and not till then be wholesome because it will be daily and calm and in practice and on these familiar arts and minute but certain and serviceable knowledges will be surely edified and sustained the greater arts and splendid theoretical sciences  but much more than this on such holy and simple practice will be founded indeed at last an infallible religion the greatest of all the mysteries of life and the most terrible is the corruption of even the sincerest religion which is not daily founded on rational effective humble and helpful action helpful action observe for there is just one law which obeyed keeps all religions pureforgotten makes them all false whenever in any religious faith dark or bright we allow our minds to dwell upon the points in which we differ from other people we are wrong and in the devils power that is the essence of the pharisees thanksgivinglord i thank thee that i am not as other men are260 at every moment of our lives we should be trying to find out not in what we differ with other people but in what we agree with them and the moment we find we can agree as to anything that should be done kind or good and who but fools couldnt then do it push at it together you cant quarrel in a sidebyside push but the moment that even the best men stop pushing and begin talking they mistake their pugnacity for piety and ifs all over i will not speak of the crimes which in past times have been committed in the name of christ nor of the follies which are at this hour held to be consistent with obedience to him but i will speak of the morbid corruption and waste of vital power in religious sentiment by which the pure strength of that which should be the guiding soul of every nation the splendour of its youthful manhood and spotless light of its maidenhood is averted or cast away you may see continually girls who have never been taught to do a single useful thing thoroughly who cannot sew who cannot cook who cannot cast an account nor prepare a medicine whose whole life has been passed either in play or in pride you will find girls like these when they are earnesthearted cast all their innate passion of religious spirit which was meant by god to support them through the irksomeness of daily toil into grievous and vain meditation over the meaning of the great book of which no syllable was ever yet to be understood but through a deed all the instinctive wisdom and mercy of their womanhood made vain and the glory of their pure consciences warped into fruitless agony concerning questions which the laws of common serviceable life would have either solved for them in an instant or kept out of their way give such a girl any true work that will make her active in the dawn and weary at night with the consciousness that her fellowcreatures have indeed been the better for her day and the powerless sorrow of her enthusiasm will transform itself into a majesty of radiant and beneficent peace  so with our youths we once taught them to make latin verses and called them educated now we teach them to leap and to row to hit a ball with a bat and call them educated can they plough can they sow can they plant at the right time or build with a steady hand is it the effort of their lives to be chaste knightly faithful holy in thought lovely in word and deed indeed it is with some nay with many and the strength of england is in them and the hope but we have to turn their courage from the toil of war to the toil of mercy and their intellect from dispute of words to discernment of things and their knighthood from the errantry of adventure to the state and fidelity of a kingly power and then indeed shall abide for them and for us an incorruptible felicity and an infallible religion shall abide for us faith no more to be assailed by temptation no more to be defended by wrath and by fearshall abide with us hope no more to be quenched by the years that overwhelm or made ashamed by the shadows that betrayshall abide for us and with us the greatest of these the abiding will the abiding name of our father for the greatest of these is charity261     230 isaiah xl 12    231 i have sometimes been asked what this
