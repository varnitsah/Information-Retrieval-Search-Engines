  1898    w d howellss works    in cloth binding    copyright 1898 by w d howells    electrotyped by j a howells  co jefferson ohio     the story of a play     i   the young actor who thought he saw his part in maxwells play had so far made his way upward on the pacific coast that he felt justified in taking the road with a combination of his own he met the author at a dinner of the papyrus club in boston where they were introduced with a facile flourish of praise from the journalist who brought them together as the very men who were looking for each other and who ought to be able to give the american public a real american drama the actor who believed he had an ideal of this drama professed an immediate interest in the kind of thing maxwell told him he was trying to do and asked him to come the next day if he did not mind its being sunday and talk the play over with him  he was at breakfast when maxwell came at about the hour people were getting home from church and he asked the author to join him but maxwell had already breakfasted and he hid his impatience of the actors politeness as well as he could and began at the first moment possible the idea of my play is biblical were still a very biblical people he had thought of the fact in seeing so many worshippers swarming out of the churches  that is true said the actor  its the old idea of the wages of sin i should like to call it that  the name has been used hasnt it  i shouldnt mind for i want to get a new effect from the old notion and it would be all the stronger from familiar association with the name i want to show that the wages of sin is more sinning which is the very body of death  well  well i take a successful man at the acme of his success and study him in a succession of scenes that bring out the fact of his prosperity in a way to strike the imagination of the audience even the groundlings and of course i have to deal with success of the most appreciable sorta material success that is gross and palpable i have to use a large canvas as big as shakespeares in fact and i put in a great many figures  thats right said the actor you want to keep the stage full with people coming and going  theres a lot of coming and going and a lot of incidents to keep the spectator interested and on the lookout for whats to happen next the whole of the first act is working up to something that ive wanted to see put on the stage for a good while or ever since ive thought of writing for the stage and that is a large dinner one of the public kind  capital said the actor  ive seen a good deal of that sort of thing as a reporter you know they put us at a table off to one side and we see the whole thing a great deal better than the diners themselves do its a banquet given by a certain number of my mans friends in honor of his fiftieth birthday and you see the men gathering in the hotel parlorwell you can imagine it in almost any hoteland haxard is in the foreground haxard is the heros name you know  its a good name the actor mused aloud it has a strong sound  do you like it well haxard maxwell continued is there in the foreground from the first moment the curtain rises receiving his friends and shaking hands right and left and joking and laughing with everybodya very small joke makes a very large laugh on occasions like that and i shall try to give some notion of the comparative size of the joke and the laughand receiving congratulations that give a notion of what the dinner is for and the kind of man he is and how universally respected and all that till everybody has come and then the doors between the parlor and the diningroom are rolled back and every man goes out with his own wife or his sister or his cousin or his aunt if he hasnt got a wife i saw them do that once at a big commercial dinner i reported  ah i was afraid it was to be exclusively a mans dinner the actor interrupted  oh no maxwell answered with a shade of vexation that wouldnt do you couldnt have a scene or at least not a whole act without women of course i understand that even if you could keep the attention of the audience without them through the importance of the intrigue still you would have to have them for the sake of the stagepicture the drama is literature that makes a double appeal it appeals to the sense as well as the intellect and the stage is half the time merely a pictureframe i had to think that out pretty early  the actor nodded you couldnt too soon  it wouldnt do to have nothing but a crowd of black coats and white shirtfronts on the stage through a whole act you want color and a lot of it and you can only get it in our day with the womens costumes besides they give movement and life after the dinner begins theyre supposed to sparkle all through ive imagined the table set down the depth of the stage with haxard and the nominal host at the head fronting the audience and the people talking back and forth on each side and i let the ladies do most of the talking of course i mean to have the dinner served through all the courses and the waiters coming and going the events will have to be hurried and the eating merely sketched at times but i should keep the thing in pretty perfect form till it came to the speaking i shall have to cut that a good deal but i think i can give a pretty fair notion of how they butter the object of their hospitality on such occasions ive seen it and heard it done often enough i think perhaps i shall have the dinner an act by itself there are only four acts in the play now and ill have to make five i want to give haxards speech as fully as possible for thats what i study the man in and make my confidences to the audience about him i shall make him butter himself but all with the utmost humility and brag of everything that he disclaims the merit of  the actor rose and reached across the table for the sugar thats a capital notion thats new that would make a hitthe speech would  do you think so returned the author i thought so i believe that in the hands of a good actor the speech could be made tremendously telling i wouldnt have a word to give away his character his nature except the words of his own mouth but i would have them do it so effectually that when he gets through the audience will be fairly onto him dont you know  magnificent said the actor pouring himself some more cocoa  maxwell continued in the third actfor i see that i shall have to make it the third nowthe scene will be in haxards library after he gets home from the complimentary dinner at midnight and he finds a man waiting for him therea man that the butler tells him has called several times and was so anxious to see him that mrs haxard has given orders to let him wait oh i ought to go back a little and explain  yes do the actor stirred his cocoa with mounting interest yes dont leave anything out  i merely meant to say that in the talk in the scene or the act before the dinneri shall have two acts but with no wait between them just let down the curtain and raise it againit will come out that haxard is not a bostonian by birth but has come here since the war from the southwest where he went from maine to grow up with the country and is understood to have been a sort of quiescent union man there its thought to be rather a fine thing the way hes taken on boston and shown so much local patriotism and public spirit and philanthropy in the way hes brought himself forward here people dont know a great deal about his past but its understood to have been very creditable i shall have to recast that part a little and lengthen the delay before he comes on and let the guests or the hostsfor theyre giving him the dinnerhave time to talk about him and free their minds in honor of him behind his back before they begin to his face  never bring your principal character on at once the actor interjected  no maxwell consented i see that wouldnt have done he went on well as soon as haxard turns up the light in his library the man rises from the lounge where he has been sitting and haxard sees who it is he sees that it is a man whom he used to be in partnership with in texas where they were engaged in some very shady transactions they get caught in one of themi havent decided yet just what sort of transaction it was and i shall have to look that point up ill get some lawstudent to help meand haxard who wasnt haxard then pulls out and leaves his partner to suffer the penalty haxard comes north and after trying it in various places he settles here and marries and starts in business and prospers on while the other fellow takes their joint punishment in the penitentiary by the way it just occurs to me i think ill have it that haxard has killed a man a man whom he has injured he doesnt mean to kill him but he has to and this fellow is knowing to the homicide but has been prevented from getting onto haxards trail by the consequences of his own misdemeanors that will probably be the best way out of course it all has to transpire all these facts in the course of the dialogue which the two men have with each other in haxards library after a good deal of fighting away from the inevitable identification on haxards part after the first few preliminary words with the butler at the door before he goes in to find the other manhis name is greenshaw  thats a good name too said the actor  yes isnt it it has a sort of probable sound and yet its a madeup name well i was going to say  and im glad you have it a homicide that haxard is guilty of instead of a business crime of some sort that sort of crime never tells with an audience the actor observed  no said maxwell homicide is decidedly better its more melodramatic and i dont like that but it will be more appreciable as a real sin to most of the audience we steal and cheat so much and we kill comparatively so little in the north well i was going to say that i shall have this whole act to consist entirely of the passage between the two men i shall let it begin with a kind of shiver creeping over the spectator when he recognizes the relation between them and i hope i shall be able to make it end with a shudder for haxard must see from the first moment and he must let the audience see at last that the only way for him to save himself from his old crime is to commit a new one he must kill the man who saw him kill a man  thats good the actor thoughtfully murmured as if tasting a pleasant morsel to try its flavor excellent  maxwell laughed for pleasure and went on he arranges to meet the man again at a certain time and place and that is the last of greenshaw he leaves the house alone and the body of an unknown man is found floating up and down with the tide under the long bridge there are no marks of violence he must have fallen off the bridge in the dark and been drowned it could very easily happen well then comes the most difficult part of the whole thing i have got to connect the casualty with haxard in the most unmistakable way unmistakable to the audience that is and i have got to have it brought home to him in a supreme moment of his life i dont want to have him feel remorse for it that isnt the modern theory of the criminal but i do want him to be anxious to hide his connection with it and to escape the consequences i dont know but i shall try another dinnerscene though i am afraid it would be a risk  the actor said i dont know it might be the very thing the audience likes a recurrence to a distinctive feature its like going back to an effective strain in music  yes maxwell resumed slightly varied i might have a private dinner this time perhaps a dinner that haxard himself is giving towards the end the talk might turn on the case of the unknown man and the guests might discuss it philosophically together haxard would combat the notion of a murder and even of a suicide he would contend for an accident pure and simple all the fellows would take a turn at the theory but the summingup opinion i shall leave to a legal mind perhaps the man who had made the great complimentary speech at the public dinner to haxard in the first act i should have him warm to his work and lay it down to haxard in good round fashion against his theory of accident he could prove to the satisfaction of everybody that the man who was last seen with the drowned manor was supposed to have been seen with himaccording to some very sketchy evidence at the inquest which never amounted to anythingwas the man who pushed him off the bridge he could gradually work up his case and end the argument with a semijocular semiserious appeal to haxard himself like why suppose it was your own case and so forth and so forth and so forth and then suddenly stop at something he notices queer in haxard who is trying to get to his feet the rest applaud thats right haxard has the floor and so on and then haxard slips back into his chair and his head falls forward i dont like deathscenes on the stage theyre usually failures but if this was managed simply i think it would be effective  the actor left the table and began to walk about the room i shall want that play i can see my part in haxard i know just how i could make up for him and the play is so native so american that it will go like wildfire  the author heard these words with a swelling heart he did not speak for he could not he sat still watching the actor as he paced to and fro histrionically rapt in his representation of an actor who had just taken a piece from a young dramatist if you can realize that part as youve sketched it to me he said finally i will play it exclusively as jefferson does rip van winkle there are immense capabilities in the piece yes sir that thing will run for years  of course maxwell found voice to say there is one great defect in it from the conventional point of view the actor stopped and looked at him theres no lovebusiness  we must have that but you can easily bring it in  by the head and shoulders yes but i hate lovemaking on the stage almost as much as i do dying i never see a pair of lovers beyond the footlights without wanting to kill them the actor remained looking at him over his folded arms and maxwell continued with something like a personal rancor against lovemaking while he gave a little bitter laugh i might have it somehow that haxard had killed a pair of stagelovers and this was what greenshaw had seen him do but that would have been justifiable homicide  the actors gaze darkened into a frowning stare as if he did not quite make out this kind of fooling all the world loves a lover he said tentatively  i dont believe it does said maxwell except as its stupid and loves anything that makes it laugh it loves a comic lover and in the same way it loves a droll drunkard or an amusing madman  we shall have to have some sort of lovebusiness the actor returned with an effect of leaving the right interpretation of maxwells peculiar humor for some other time the public wants it no play would go without it you can have it subordinate if you like but you have got to have it how old did you say haxard was  about fifty too old for a lover unless you could make him in love with some one elses wife as he has one of his own already but that wouldnt do  the actor looked as if he did not know why it would not do but he said he could have a daughter  yes and his daughter could have a lover i had thought of something of that kind and of bringing in their illfated passion as an element of the tragedy we could have his disgrace break their hearts and kill two birds with one stone and avenge a longsuffering race of playwrights upon stagelovers  the actor laughed like a man of small humor mellowly but hollowly no no we must have the loveaffair end happily you can manage that somehow have you got the play roughed out at all  not in manuscript ive only got it roughed out in my mind  well i want that play thats settled i cant do anything with it this winter but i should like to open with it next fall do you think you could have it ready by the end of july     ii   they sat down and began to talk times and terms they parted with a perfect understanding and maxwell was almost as much deceived as the actor himself he went home full of gay hopes to begin work on the play at once and to realize the character of haxard with the personality of the actor in his eye he heard nothing from him till the following spring when the actor wrote with all the ardor of their parting moment to say that he was coming east for the summer and meant to settle down in the region of boston somewhere so that they could meet constantly and make the play what they both wanted he said nothing to account for his long silence and he seemed so little aware of it that maxwell might very well have taken it for a simple fidelity to the understanding between them too unconscious to protest itself he answered discreetly and said that he expected to pass the summer on the coast somewhere but was not yet quite certain where he should be that he had not forgotten their interview and should still be glad to let him have the play if he fancied it between this time and the time when the actor appeared in person he sent maxwell several short notes and two or three telegrams sufficiently relevant but not very necessary and when his engagement ended in the west a fortnight after maxwell was married he telegraphed again and then came through without a stop from denver where the combination broke up to manchesterbythesea he joined the little colony of actors which summers there and began to play tennis and golf and to fish and to sail almost without a moments delay he was not very fond of any of these things and in fact he was fond only of one thing in the world which was the stage but he had a theory that they were recreation and that if he went in for them he was building himself up for the season which began early in september he had appropriate costumes for all of them and no one dressed the part more perfectly in tennis or golf or sailing or fishing he believed that he ought to read up in the summer too and he had the very best of the recent books in fiction and criticism and the new drama he had all of the translations of ibsen and several of mæterlincks plays in french he read a good deal in his books and he lent them about in the hotel even more among the ladies there he had the repute of a very modern intellect and of a person you would never take for an actor from his tastes what his tastes would have been if you had taken him for an actor they could not have said perhaps but probably something vicious and he had not a vice he did not smoke and he did not so much as drink tea or coffee he had cocoa for breakfast and at lunch a glass of milk with water at dinner he had a tint like the rose and when he smiled or laughed which was often from a constitutional amiability and a perfect digestion his teeth showed white and regular and an innocent dimple punctured either cheek his name was godolphin for he had instinctively felt that in choosing a name he might as well take a handsome one while he was about it and that if he became godolphin there was no reason why he should not become launcelot too he did not put on these splendors from any foible but from a professional sense of their value in the bills and he was not personally characterized by them as launcelot godolphin he was simpler than he would have been with a simpler name and it was his ideal to be modest in everything that personally belonged to him he studied an unprofessional walk and a very colloquial tone in speaking he was of course cleanshaven but during the summer he let his mustache grow though he was aware that he looked better without it he was tall and he carried himself with the vigor of his perfect health but on the stage he looked less than his real size like a perfectly proportioned edifice  godolphin wanted the maxwells to come to his hotel in manchester but there were several reasons for their not doing this the one maxwell alleged was that they could not afford it they had settled for the summer when they got home after their brief wedding journey at a much cheaper house in magnolia and the actor and the author were then only three miles apart which mrs maxwell thought was quite near enough as it is she said im only afraid hell be with you every moment with his suggestions and wont let you have any chance to work out your own conceptions  godolphin had not failed to notify the public through the press that mr brice maxwell had severed his connection with the boston abstract for the purpose of devoting himself to a new play for mr launcelot godolphin and he thought it would have been an effective touch if it could have been truthfully reported that mr godolphin and mr maxwell might be seen almost any day swinging over the roads together in the neighborhood of manchester blind and deaf to all the passing in their discussion of the play which they might almost be said to be collaborating but failing maxwells consent to anything of the sort godolphin did the swinging over the roads himself so far as the roads lay between manchester and magnolia he began by coming in the forenoon when he broke maxwell up fearfully but he was retarded by a waning of his own ideal in the matter and finally got to arriving at that hour in the afternoon when maxwell could be found revising his mornings work or lying at his wifes feet on the rocks and now and then irrelevantly bringing up a knotty point in the character or action for her criticism for these excursions godolphin had equipped himself with a gray corduroy sack and knickerbockers and a stick which he cut from the alder thicket he wore russet shoes of ample tread and very thickribbed stockings which became his stalwart calves  nothing could be handsomer than the whole effect he made in this costume and his honest face was a pleasure to look at though its intelligence was of a kind so wholly different from the intelligence of maxwells face that mrs maxwell always had a struggle with herself before she could allow that it was intelligence at all he was very polite to her he always brought her flowers and he opened doors and put down windows and leaped to his feet for every imaginable occasion of hers in a way that maxwell never did and somehow a way that the polite men of her world did not either she had to school herself to believe him a gentleman and she would not accept a certain vivid cleanliness he had as at all aristocratic she said it was too fresh and he ought to have carried a warning placard of paint she found that godolphin had one great and constant merit he believed in maxwells genius as devoutly as she did herself this did not prevent him from coming every day with proposals for changes in the play more or less structural at one time he wished the action laid in some other country and epoch so as to bring in more costume and give the carpenter something to do he feared that the severity of the mise en scène would ruin the piece at another time he wanted lines taken out of the speeches of the inferior characters and put into his own to fatten the part as he explained at other times he wished to have paraphrases of passages that he had brought down the house with in other plays written into this or scenes transposed so that he would make a more effective entrance here or there there was no end to his inventions for spoiling the simplicity and truthfulness of maxwells piece which he yet respected for the virtues in it and hoped the greatest things from  one afternoon he arrived with a scheme for a very uptodate scene in the last act have it a supper instead of a dinner and then have a skirtdancer introduced as society people had been having carmencita when haxard dies you know he explained it would be tremendously effective to have the woman catch him in her arms and she would be a splendid piece of color in the picture with haxards head lying in her lap as the curtain comes down with a run  at this suggestion mrs maxwell was too indignant to speak her husband merely said with his cold smile yes but i dont see what it would have to do with the rest of the play  you could have it said godolphin that he was married to a mexican during his texas episode and this girl was their daughter maxwell still smiled and godolphin deferred to his wife but perhaps mrs maxwell would object to the skirtdance  oh no she answered ironically i shouldnt mind having it with carmencita in society for a precedent but she added the incident seems so out of keeping with the action and the temperament of the play and everything if i were to see such a thing on the stage merely as an impartial spectator i should feel insulted  godolphin flushed i dont see where the insult would come in you mightnt like it but it would be like anything else in a play that you were not personally concerned in  no excuse me mr godolphin i think the audience is as much concerned in the play as the actor or the author and if either of these fails in the ideal or does a bit of claptrap when they have wrought the audience up in expectation of something noble then they insult the audienceor all the better part of it  the better part of the audience never fills the house said the actor  very well i hope my husband will never write for the worse part  and i hope i shall never play to it godolphin returned and he looked hurt at the insinuation of her words  it isnt a question of all that maxwell interposed with a worried glance at his wife mr godolphin has merely suggested something that can be taken into the general account we neednt decide it now by the way he said to the actor have you thought over that point about changing haxards crime or the quality of it i think it had better not be an intentional murder that would kill the audiences sympathy with him from the start dont you think we had better have it what they call a rencontre down there where two gentlemen propose to kill each other on sight greenshaws hold on him would be that he was the only witness of the fight and that he could testify to a wilful murder if he chose haxards real crime must be the killing of greenshaw  yes said godolphin and he entered into the discussion of the effect this point would have with the play mrs maxwell was too much vexed to forgive him for making the suggestion which he had already dropped and she left the room for fear she should not be able to govern herself at the sight of her husband condescending to temporize with him she thought that maxwells willingness to temporize even when it involved no insincerity was a defect in his character she had always thought that and it was one of the things that she meant to guard him against with all the strength of her zeal for his better self when godolphin was gone at last she lost no time in coming back to maxwell where he sat with the manuscript of his play before him apparently lost in some tangle of it she told him abruptly that she did not understand how if he respected himself if he respected his own genius he could consider such an idea as godolphins skirtdance for an instant  did i consider it he asked  you made him think so  well returned maxwell and at her reproachful look he added godolphin never thought i was considering it he has too much sense and he would be astonished and disgusted if i took him in earnest and did what he wanted a lot of actors get round him over there and they fill him up with all sorts of stage notions and what he wants of me is that i shall empty him of them and yet not put him to shame about them but if you keep on in that way you took with him hell throw me over  well let him cried mrs maxwell there are twenty other actors who would jump at the chance to get such a play  dont you believe it my dear actors dont jump at plays and godolphin is the one man for me hes young and has the friendly regard from the public that a young artist has and yet he isnt identified with any part in particular and he will throw all his force into creating this as he calls it  i cant bear to have him use that word brice you created it  the word doesnt matter its merely a technical phrase i shouldnt know where to turn if he gave it up  pshaw you could go to a manager  thank you i prefer an actor now louise you must not be so abrupt with godolphin when he comes out with those things  i cant help it dearest they are insulting to you and insulting to commonsense its a kindness to let him know how they would strike the public i dont pretend to be more than the average public  he doesnt feel it a kindness the way you put it  then you dont like me to be sincere with him perhaps you dont like me to be sincere with you about your play  be as sincere with me as you like but thisthis is a matter of business and id rather you wouldnt  rather i wouldnt say anything at all demanded louise  i didnt say so and you know i didnt but if you cant get on without ruffling godolphin why perhaps  very well then ill leave the room the next time he comes that will be perfectly simple and it will be perfectly simple to do as most other people wouldnot concern myself with the play in any way from this out i dare say you would prefer that too though i didnt quite expect it to come to that before our honeymoon was out  oh now my dear  you know its so but i can do it i might have expected it from a man who was so perfectly selfcentred and absorbed but i was such a fool her tears came and her words stopped  maxwell leaned forward with his thin face between his hands this made him miserable personally but he was not so miserable but his artistic consciousness could take note of the situation as a very good one and one that might be used effectively on the stage he analyzed it perfectly in that unhappy moment she was jealous of his work which she had tolerated only while she could share it and if she could not share it while some other was suffered to do so it would be cruel for her but he knew that he could not offer any open concession now without making bad worse and he must wait till the right time for it came he had so far divined her without formulating her that he knew she would be humiliated by anything immediate or explicit but would later accept a tacit repentance from him and he instinctively forebore     iii   for the present in her resentment of his willingness to abase his genius before godolphin or even to hold it in abeyance mrs maxwell would not walk to supper with her husband in the usual way touching his shoulder with hers from time to time and making herself seem a little lower in stature by taking the downward slope of the path leading from their cottage to the hotel but the necessity of appearing before the people at their table on as perfect terms with him as ever had the effect that conduct often has on feeling and she took his arm in going back to their cottage and leaned tenderly upon him  their cottage was one of the farthest from the hotel and the smallest and quietest in fact there was yet no one in it but themselves and they dwelt there in an image of home with the sole use of the veranda and the parlor where maxwell had his manuscripts spread about on the table as if he owned the place a chambermaid came over from the hotel in the morning to put the cottage in order and then they could be quite alone there for the rest of the day  shall i light the lamp for you brice his wife asked as they mounted the veranda steps  no he said let us sit out here and they took the armchairs that stood on the porch and swung to and fro in silence for a little while the sea came and went among the rocks below marking its course in the deepening twilight with a white rope of foam and raving huskily to itself with now and then the long plunge of some heavier surge against the bowlders and a hoarse shout the portland boat swam by in the offing a glitter of irregular lights and the lamps on the different points of the cape blinked as they revolved in their towers this is the kind of thing you can get only in a novel said maxwell musingly you couldnt possibly give the feeling of it in a play  couldnt you give the feeling of the people looking at it suggested his wife and she put out her hand to lay it on his  yes you could do that he assented with pleasure in her notion and that would be better i suppose that is what would be aimed at in a description of the scene which would be tiresome if it didnt give the feeling of the spectator  and godolphin would say that if you let the carpenter have something to do he would give the scene itself and you could have the effect of it at first hand  maxwell laughed i wonder how much they believe in those contrivances of the carpenter themselves they have really so little to do with the dramatic intention but they have been multiplied so since the stage began to make the plays that the actors are always wanting them in i believe the time will come when the dramatist will avoid the occasion or the pretext for them  that will be after godolphins time said mrs maxwell  well i dont know returned maxwell if godolphin should happen to imagine doing without them he would go all lengths  or if you imagined it and let him suppose he had he never imagines anything of himself  no he doesnt and yet how perfectly he grasps the notion of the thing when it is done it is very different from literature acting is and yet literature is only the representation of life  well acting is the representation of life at secondhand then and it ought to be willing to subordinate itself what i cant bear in godolphin is his setting himself up to be your artistic equal he is no more an artist than the canvas is that the artist paints a picture on  maxwell laughed dont tell him so he wont like it  i will tell him so some day whether he likes it or not  no you mustnt for it isnt true hes just as much an artist in his way as i am in mine and so far as the public is concerned he has given more proofs  oh his public  it wont do to despise any public even the theatregoing public maxwell added the last words with a faint sigh  its always secondrate said his wife passionately thirdrate fourthrate godolphin was quite right about that i wish you were writing a novel brice instead of a play then you would be really addressing refined people  it kills me to have you say that louise  well i wont but dont you see then that you must stand up for art all the more unflinchingly if you intend to write plays that will refine the theatregoing public or create a new one that is why i cant endure to have you even seem to give way to godolphin  you must stand it so long as i only seem to do it hes far more manageable than i expected him to be its quite pathetic how docile he is how perfectly ductile but it wont do to browbeat him when he comes over here a little out of shape hes a curious creature maxwell went on with a relish in godolphin as material which his wife suffered with difficulty i wonder if he could ever be got into a play if he could he would like nothing better than to play himself and he would do it to perfection only it would be a comic part and godolphins mind is for the serious drama maxwell laughed all his artistic instincts are in solution and it needs something like a chemical agent to precipitate them or to give them any positive character hes like a woman  thank you said mrs maxwell  oh i mean all sorts of good things by that he has the sensitiveness of a woman  is that a good thing then i suppose he was so piqued by what i said about his skirtdance that he will renounce you  oh i dont believe he will i managed to smooth him up after you went out  mrs maxwell sighed yes you are very patient and if you are patient you are good you are better than i am  i dont see the sequence exactly said maxwell  they were both silent and she seemed to have followed his devious thought in the same muse for when he spoke again she did not reproach him with an equal inconsequence i dont know whether i could write a novel and besides i think the drama is the supreme literary form it stands on its own feet it doesnt have to be pushed along or pulled along as the novel does  yes of course its grand thats the reason i cant bear to have you do anything unworthy of it  i know louise he said tenderly and then again they did not speak for a little while  he emerged from their silence at a point apparently very remote with a sigh if i could only know just what the feelings of a murderer really were for five minutes i could outshakespeare shakespeare in that play but i shall have to trust to the fall of man and the general depravity of human nature i suppose after all theres the potentiality of every kind of man in every man if youve known what it is to hate youve known what it is to kill  i felt once as if i had killed you she said and then he knew that she was thinking of a phase of their love which had a perpetual fascination for them both but i never hated you  no i did the hating he returned lightly  ah dont say so dear she entreated half in earnest  well have it all to yourself then he said and he rose and went indoors and lighted the lamp and she saw him get out the manuscript of his play while she sat still recalling the time when she had tried to dismiss him from her thoughts upon a theory of his unworthiness he had not yet spoken of love to her then but she felt as if she had refused to listen to him and her remorse kept his image before her in an attitude of pathetic entreaty for at least a hearing she knew that she had given him reason if she had not given him courage to believe that she cared for him but he was too proud to renew the tacit approaches from which she had so abruptly retreated and she had to invite them from him  when she began to do this with the arts so imperceptible to the singlemindedness of a man she was not yet sure whether she could endure to live with him or not she was merely sure that she could not live without him or to be more specific without his genius which she believed no one else appreciated as she did she believed that she understood his character better than any one else and would know how to supplement it with her own she had no ambition herself but she could lend him a more telescopic vision in his and keep his aims high if his selfconcentration ever made him shortsighted he would write plays because he could not help it but she would inspire him to write them with the lofty sense of duty she would have felt in writing them if she had his gifts  she was as happy in their engagement and as unhappy as girls usually are during their courtship it is the convention to regard those days as very joyous but probably no woman who was honest about the fact would say that they were so from her own experience louise found them full of excitement and an interest from which she relaxed at times with such a sense of having strained forward to their end that she had a cold reluctance from maxwell and though she never dreamed of giving him up again she sometimes wished she had never seen him she was eager to have it all over and be married and out of the way for one thing because she knew that maxwell could never be assimilated to her circumstance and she should have no rest till she was assimilated to his when it came to the dinners and lunches which the hilary kinship and friendship made in honor of her engagement she found that maxwell actually thought she could make excuse of his work to go without him and she had to be painfully explicit before she could persuade him that this would not do at all he was not timid about meeting her friends as he might very well have been but in comparison with his work he apparently held them of little moment and at last he yielded to her wishes rather than her reasons he made no pretence of liking those people but he gave them no more offence than might have been expected among the hilary cousins there were several clever women who enjoyed the quality of maxwells somewhat cold sarcastic humor and there were several men who recognized his ability though none of them liked him any better than he liked them he had a way of regarding them all at first as of no interest and then if something kindled his imagination from them of showing a sudden technical curiosity which made the ladies at least feel as if he were dealing with them as so much material they professed to think that it was only a question of time when they should all reappear in dramatic form unless louise should detect them in the manuscript before they were put upon the stage and forbid his using them if it were to be done before marriage they were not sure that she would do it or could do it for it was plain to be seen that she was perfectly infatuated with him the faults they found in him were those of manner mostly and they perceived that these were such as passion might forgive to his other qualities there were some who said that they envied her for being so much in love with him but these were not many and some did not find him goodlooking or see what could have taken her with him  maxwell showed himself ignorant of the observances in every way and if louise had not rather loved him the more for what he made her suffer because of them she must certainly have given him up at times he had never to her thinking known how to put a note properly on paper his letters were perfectly fascinating but they lacked a final charm in being often written on one side of halfsheets and numbered in the upper righthand corner like printers copy she had to tell him that he must bring his mother to call upon her and then he was so long doing it that louise imagined a timidity in his mother which he was too proud to own and made her own mother go with her to see mrs maxwell in the house which she partly let out in lodgings on a very modest street it really did not matter about any of those things though and she and maxwells mother got on very well after the first plunge though the country doctors widow was distinctly a country person with the narrow social horizons of a villager whose knowledge of the city was confined to the compass of her courageous ventures in it  to her own mother louise feigned to see nothing repulsive in the humility of these she had been rather fastidiously worldly she had been even aggressively worldly in her preference for a luxurious and tasteful setting and her mother now found it hard to bear her contented acceptance of the pervading commonness of things at mrs maxwells either her senses were holden by her fondness for maxwell or else she was trying to hoodwink her mother by an effect of indifference but mrs hilary herself was certainly not obtuse to that commonness if she did not rub it into louise which would have done no good she did rub it into louises father though that could hardly have been said to do any good either her report of the whole affair made him writhe but when she had made him writhe enough she began to admit some extenuating circumstances if mrs maxwell was a country person she was not foolish she did not chant in a vain attempt to be genteel in her speech she did not expand unduly under mrs hilarys graciousness and she did not resent it in fact the graciousness had been very skilfully managed and mrs maxwell had not been allowed to feel that there was any condescension to her she got on with louise very well if mrs maxwell had any overweening pride in her son she kept it as wholly to herself as any overweening pride she might have had in her sons choice  mrs hilary did not like her daughters choice but she had at last reached such resignation concerning it as the friends of a hopeless invalid may feel when the worst comes she had tried to stop the affair when there was some hope or some use in trying and now she determined to make the best of it the worst was that maxwell was undoubtedly of different origin and breeding and he would always in society subject louise to a consciousness of his difference if he did nothing more but when you had said this you seemed to have said all there was to say against him the more the hilarys learned about the young fellow the more reason they had to respect him his life on its level was blameless every one who knew him spoke well of him and those who knew him best spoke enthusiastically he had believers in his talent and in his character in a society so barometrical as ours even in a city where it was the least barometrical the obstacles to the acceptance of maxwell were mainly subjective they were formed not so much of what people would say as of what mrs hilary felt they had a right to say and in view of the necessities of the case she found herself realizing that if they did not say anything to her it would be much as if they had not said anything at all she dealt with the fact before her frankly and in the duties which it laid upon her she began to like maxwell before hilary did not that hilary disliked him but there was something in the young fellow taking his daughter away from him in that cool matteroffact way as if it were quite in the course of nature that he should instead of being abashed and overwhelmed by his good fortune which left hilary with a misgiving lest he might realize it less and less as time went on  hilary had no definite ambition for her in marriage but his vague dreams for her were not of a young man who meant to leave off being a newspaper writer to become a writer of plays he instinctively wished her to be of his own order of things and it had pleased him when he heard from his wifes report that louise had seen the folly of her fancy for the young journalist whom a series of accidents had involved with their lives and had decided to give him up when the girl decided again more tacitly that she could not give him up hilary submitted as he would have submitted to anything she wished to his simple idolatry of her she was too good for anything on earth and if he were to lose her he found that after all he had no great choice in the matter as soon as her marriage appeared inevitable he agreed with his wife that their daughter must never have any unhappiness of their making and they let her reverse without a word the purpose of going to spend the winter abroad which they had formed at her wish when she renounced maxwell  all this was still recent in point of time and though marriage had remanded it to an infinite distance apparently with the young people it had not yet taken away the importance or the charm of the facts and the feelings that had seemed the whole of life before marriage when louise turned from her retrospect she went in through the window that opened on the veranda and stood beside her husband where he sat with his manuscript before him frowning at it in the lamplight that made her blink a little after the dark outside she put her hand on his head and carried it down his cheek over his mouth so that he might kiss its palm  going to work much longer little man she asked and she kissed the top of his head in her turn it always amused her to find how smooth and soft his hair was he flung his pen away and threw himself back in his chair oh its that infernal love business he said  she sat down and let her hands fall on her lap why what makes it so hard  oh i dont know but it seems as if i were fighting it as the actors say all the way it doesnt go of itself at all its forced from the beginning  why do you have it in then  i have to have it in it has to be in every picture of life as it has to be in every life godolphin is perfectly right i talked with him about leaving it out today but i had to acknowledge that it wouldnt do in fact i was the first to suggest that there must be some sort of love business when i first talked the play over with him but i wish there hadnt it makes me sick every time i touch it the confounded fools dont know what to do with their love  they might get married with it louise suggested  i dont believe they have sense enough to think of that said her husband the curse of their origin is on them i suppose i tried to imagine them when i was only fit to imagine a man hating a woman with all his might  louise laughed out her secure delight if the public could only know why your lovers were such feeble folk it would make the fortune of the play  maxwell laughed too yes fancy pinney getting hold of a fact like that and working it up with all his native delicacy in the sunday edition of the events  pinney was a reporter of maxwells acquaintance who stood to louise for all that was most terrible in journalistic enterprise dont she shrieked  maxwell went on he would have both our portraits in and your fathers and mothers and my mothers and your house on commonwealth avenue and our meek mansion on pinckney street he would make it a work of art pinney would and he would believe that we were all secretly gratified with it no matter how we pretended to writhe under it he laughed and laughed and then suddenly he stopped and was very grave  i know what youre thinking of now said his wife  what  whether you couldnt use our affair in the play  youre a witch yes i was i was thinking it wouldnt do  stuff it will do and you must use it who would ever know it and i shall not care how blackly you show me up i deserve it if i was the cause of your hating love so much that you failed with your lovers on the old lines i certainly ought to be willing to be the means of your succeeding on lines that had never been tried before  generous girl he bent overhe had not to bend farand kissed her then he rose excitedly and began to walk the floor with his hands in his pockets and his head dropped forward he broke into speech i could disguise it so that nobody would ever dream of it ill just take a hint from ourselves how would it do to have had the girl actually reject him it never came to that with us and instead of his being a howling outside swell that was rather condescending to her suppose i have him some sort of subordinate in her fathers business it doesnt matter much what its easy to arrange such a detail she could be in love with him all the time without even knowing it herself or at least not knowing it when he offers himself and she could always be vaguely hoping or expecting that he would come to time again  thats what i did said his wife and you hadnt offered yourself either  maxwell stopped with an air of discomfiture and disappointment you wouldnt like me to use that point then  what a simpleton of course i should i shouldnt care if all the world knew it  ah well we wont give it to pinney anyway but i really think it could be done without involving our own facts i should naturally work farther and farther away from them when the thing got to spinning just take a little color from them now and then i might have him hating her all the way through or supposing he hated her and yet doing all sorts of nice little things and noble big things for her till it came out about her fathers crime and then he stopped again with a certain air of distaste  that would be rather romantic wouldnt it his wife asked  that was what i was thinking he answered it would be confoundedly romantic  well ill tell you said louise you could have them squabbling all the way through and doing hateful things to one another  that would give it the cast of comedy  well  and that wouldnt do either  not if it led up to the pathos and prettiness of their reconciliation in the end shakespeare mixes the comic and the tragic all through  oh yes i know that  and it would be very effective to leave the impression of their happiness with the audience so that they might have strength to get on their rubbers and wraps after the tremendous ordeal of your haxard deathscene  godolphin wouldnt stand that he wants the gloom of haxards death to remain in unrelieved inkiness at the end he wants the people to go away thinking of godolphin and how well he did the last gasp he wouldnt stand any love business there he would rather not have any in the play  very well if youre going to be a slave to godolphin  im not going to be a slave to godolphin and if i can see my way to make the right use of such a passage at the close ill do it even if it kills the play or godolphin  now youre shouting said louise she liked to use a bit of slang when it was perfectly safeas in very good company or among those she loved at other times she scrupulously shunned it  but i can do it somehow maxwell mused aloud now i have the right idea i can make it take any shape or color i want its magnificent  and who thought of it she demanded  who why i thought of it myself  oh you little wretch she cried in utter fondness and she ran at him and drove him into a corner now say that again and ill tickle you  no no no he laughed and he fought away the pokes and thrusts she was aiming at him we both thought of it together it was mind transference  she dropped her hands with an instant interest in the psychological phenomena wasnt it strange or no it wasnt either if our lives are so united in everything the wonder is that we dont think more things and say more things together but now i want you to own brice that i was the first to speak about your using our situation  yes you were and i was the first to think of it but thats perfectly natural you always speak of things before you think and i always think of things before i speak  well i dont care said louise by no means displeased with the formulation i shall always say it was perfectly miraculous and i want you to give me credit for letting you have the idea after you had thought of it  yes theres nothing mean about you louise as pinney would say by jove ill bring pinney in ill have pinney interview haxard concerning greenshaws disappearance  very well then if you bring pinney in you will leave me out said louise i wont be in the same play with pinney  well i wont bring pinney in then said maxwell i prefer you to pinneyin a play but i have got to have in an interviewer it will be splendid on the stage and ill be the first to have him he went and sat down at his table  youre not going to work any more tonight his wife protested  no just jot down a note or two to clinch that idea of ours in the right shape he dashed off a few lines with pencil in his play at several points and then he said there i guess i shall get some bones into those two flabby idiots tomorrow i see just how i can do it he looked up and met his wifes adoring eyes  youre wonderful brice she said  well dont tell me so he returned or it might spoil me now i wouldnt tell you how good you were on any account  oh yes do dearest she entreated and a mist came into her eyes i dont think you praise me enough  how much ought i to praise you  you ought to say that you think ill never be a hinderance to you  let me see he said and he pretended to reflect how would it do to say that if i ever come to anything worth while itll be because you made me  oh brice but would it be true she dropped on her knees at his side  well i dont know lets hope it would and with these words he laughed again and put his arms round her presently she felt his arm relax and she knew that he had ceased to think about her and was thinking about his play again  she pulled away and well she asked  he laughed at being found out so instantly that was a mighty good thing your father said when you went to tell him of our engagement  it was very good but if you think im going to let you use that youre very much mistaken no brice dont you touch papa he wouldnt like it he wouldnt understand it why what a perfect cormorant you are  they laughed over his voracity and he promised it should be held in check as to the point which he had thought for a moment might be worked so effectively into the play  the next morning louise said to her husband i can see brice that you are full of the notion of changing that love business and if i stay round i shall simply bother im going down to lunch with papa and mamma and get back here in the afternoon just in time to madden godolphin with my meddling  she caught the first train after breakfast and in fifteen minutes she was at beverly farms she walked over to her fathers cottage where she found him smoking his cigar on the veranda  he was alone he said her mother had gone to boston for the day and he asked did you walk from the station why didnt you come back in the carriage it had just been there with your mother  i didnt see it besides i might not have taken it if i had as the wife of a struggling young playwright i should have probably thought it unbecoming to drive but the struggle is practically over youll be happy to know  what has he given it up asked her father  given it up hes just got a new light on his love business  i thought his love business had gone pretty well with him said hilary with a lingering grudge in his humor  this is another love business louise exclaimed the love business in the play brice has always been so disgusted with it that he hasnt known what to do but last night we thought it out together and ive left him this morning getting his hero and heroine to stand on their legs without being held up do you want to know about it  i think i can get on without said hilary  louise laughed joyously well you wouldnt understand what a triumph it was if i told you i suppose papa youve no idea how philistine you are but youre nothing to mamma  i dare say said hilary sulkily but she looked at him with eyes beaming with gayety and he could see that she was happy and he was glad at heart when does maxwell expect to have his play done he relented so far as to ask  why its done now and has been for a month in one sense and it isnt done at all in another he has to keep working it over and he has to keep fighting godolphins inspirations he comes over from manchester with a fresh lot every afternoon  i dare say maxwell will be able to hold his own said hilary but not so much proudly as dolefully  she knew he was braving it out about the theatre and that secretly he thought it undignified and even disreputable to be connected with it or to be in such close relations with an actor as maxwell seemed to be with this fellow who talked of taking his play hilary could go back very easily to the time in boston when the theatres were not allowed open on saturday night lest they should profane the approaching sabbath and when you would no more have seen an actor in society than an elephant he had not yet got used to meeting them and he always felt his difference though he considered himself a very liberal man and was fond of the theatrefrom the front  he asked now what sort of chap is he really meaning godolphin and louise did her best to reassure him she told him godolphin was young and enthusiastic and he had an ideal of the drama and he believed in brice and he had been two seasons with booth and barrett and now he had made his way on the pacific coast and wanted a play that he could take the road with she parroted those phrases which made her fathers flesh creep and she laughed when she saw it creeping for sympathy her own had crept first  well he said at last he wont expect you and maxwell to take the road too with it  oh no we shall only be with him in new york he wont put the play on there first they usually try a new play in the country  oh do they said hilary with a sense that his daughters knowledge of the fact was disgraceful to her  yes shall i tell you what they call that trying it on a dog she shrieked and hilary had to laugh too its dreadful she went on then if it doesnt kill the dog godolphin will bring it to new york and put it on for a runa week or a monthas long as his money holds out if he believes in it hell fight it her father looked at her for explanation and she said with a gleeful perception of his suffering hell keep it on if he has to play to paper every night that is to free tickets  oh said hilary and are you to be there the whole time with him  why not necessarily but brice will have to be there for the rehearsals and if we are going to live in new york  hilary sighed i wish maxwell was going on with his newspaper work i might be of use to him in that line if he were looking forward to an interest in a newspaper but i couldnt buy him a theatre you know  louise laughed he wouldnt let you buy him anything papa brice is awfully proud now ill tell you if you want to know just how we expect to manage in new york brice and i have been talking it all over and its all going to be done on that thousand dollars he saved up from his newspaper work and were not going to touch a cent of my money till that is gone dont you call that pretty businesslike  very said hilary and he listened with apparent acquiescence to the details of a life which he divined that maxwell had planned from his own simple experience he did not like the notion of it for his daughter but he could not help himself and it was a consolation to see that she was in love with it  she went back from it to the play itself and told her father that now maxwell had got the greatest love business for it that there ever was she would not explain just what it was she said because her father would get a wrong notion of it if she did but i have a great mind to tell you something else she said if you think you can behave sensibly about it papa do you suppose you can  hilary said he would try and she went on its part of the happiness of having got hold of the right kind of love business now and i dont know but it unconsciously suggested it to both of us for we both thought of the right thing at the same time but in the beginning you couldnt have told it from a quarrel her father started and louise began to laugh yes we had quite a little tiff just like real married people about my satirizing one of godolphins inspirations to his face and wounding his feelings brice is so cautious and so gingerly with him and he was vexed with me and told me he wished i wouldnt do it and that vexed me and i said i wouldnt have anything to do with his play after this and i didnt speak to him again till after supper i said he was selfcentred and he is hes always thinking about his play and its chances and i suppose i would rather have had him think more about me now and then but ive discovered a way now and i believe it will serve the same purpose im going to enter so fully into his work that i shall be part of it and when he is thinking of that he will be thinking of me without knowing it now you wouldnt say there was anything in that to cry about would you and yet you see im at it and with this she suddenly dropped her face on her fathers shoulder  hilary groaned in his despair of being able to imagine an injury sufficiently atrocious to inflict on maxwell for having brought this grief upon his girl at the sound of his groan as if she perfectly interpreted his meaning in it she broke from a sob into a laugh will you never she said dashing away the tears learn to let me cry simply because i am a goose papa and a goose must weep without reason because she feels like it i wont have you thinking that i am not the happiest person in the world and i was even when i was suffering so because i had to punish brice for telling me i had done wrong and if you think im not i will never tell you anything more for i see you cant be trusted will you  he said no to her rather complicated question and he was glad to believe that she was really as happy as she declared for if he could not have believed it he would have had to fume away an intolerable deal of exasperation this always made him very hot and uncomfortable and he shrank from it but he would have done it if it had been necessary as it was he got back to his newspaper again with a sufficiently light heart when louise gave him a final kiss and went indoors and put herself in authority for the day and ordered what she liked for luncheon the maids were delighted to have her and she had a welcome from them all which was full of worship for her as a bride whose honeymoon was not yet over  she went away before her mother got home and she made her father own before she left him that he had never had such a lovely day since he could remember he wanted to drive over to magnolia with her but she accused him of wanting to go so that he could spy round a little and satisfy himself of the misery of her married life and then he would not insist     iv   louise kept wondering the whole way back how maxwell had managed the recasting of the lovebusiness and she wished she had stayed with him so that he could have appealed to her at any moment on the points that must have come up all the time she ought to have coached him more fully about it and told him the womans side of such a situation as he never could have imagined how many advances a woman can make with a man in such an affair and the man never find it out she had not made any advances herself when she wished to get him back but she had wanted to make them and she knew he would not have noticed it if she had done the boldest sort of things to encourage him to let him know that she liked him he was so simple in his straightforward egotism beside her sinuous unselfishness  she began to think how she was always contriving little sacrifices to his vanity his modesty and he was always accepting them with a serene ignorance of the fact that they were offered and at this she strayed off on a little byway in her revery and thought how it was his mind always that charmed her it was no ignoble fondness she felt no poor grovelling pleasure in his good looks though she had always seen that in a refined sort he had a great deal of manly beauty but she had held her soul aloof from all that and could truly say that what she adored in him was the beauty of his talent which he seemed no more conscious of than of his dreamy eyes the scornful sweetness of his mouth the purity of his forehead his sensitive nostrils his pretty ineffective little chin she had studied her own looks with reference to his and was glad to own them in no wise comparable though she knew she was more graceful and she could not help seeing that she was a little taller she kept this fact from herself as much as possible her features were not regular like his but she could perceive that they had charm in their irregularity she could only wonder whether he thought that line going under her chin and suggesting a future double chin in the little fold it made was so very ugly he seemed never to have thought of her looks and if he cared for her it was for some other reason just as she cared for him she did not know what the reason could be but perhaps it was her sympathy her appreciation her cheerfulness louise believed that she had at least these small merits  the thought of them brought her back to the play again and to the lovebusiness and she wondered how she could have failed to tell him when they were talking about what should bring the lovers together after their prefatory quarrel that simply willing it would do it she knew that after she began to wish maxwell back she was in such a frenzy that she believed her volition brought him back and now she really believed that you could hypnotize fate in some such way and that your longings would fulfil themselves if they were intense enough if he could not use that idea in this play then he ought to use it in some other something psychological symbolistic maeterlinckish  she was full of it when she dismounted from the barge at the hotel and hurried over to their cottage and she was intolerably disappointed when she did not find him at work in the parlor  brice brice she shouted in the security of having the whole cottage to herself she got no answer and ran up to their room overhead he was not there either and now it seemed but too probable that he had profited by her absence to go out for a walk alone after his writing and fallen from the rocks and been killedhe was so absentminded she offered a vow to heaven that if he were restored to her she would never leave him again even for a halfday as long as either of them lived in reward for this she saw him coming from the direction of the beach where nothing worse could have befallen him than a chill from the water if the wind was off shore and he had been taking a bath  she had not put off her hat yet and she went out to meet him she could not kiss him at once if she went to meet him but she could wait till she got back to the cottage and then kiss him it would be a trial to wait but it would be a trial to wait for him to come in and he might stroll off somewhere else unless she went to him as they approached each other she studied his face for some sign of satisfaction with his mornings work it lighted up at sight of her but there remained an inner dark in it to her eye  what is the matter she asked as she put her hand through his arm and hung forward upon it so that she could look up into his face how did you get on with the lovebusiness  oh i think ive got that all right he answered with a certain reservation ive merely blocked it out of course  so that you can show it to godolphin  i guess so  i see that youre not sure of it we must go over it before he comes he hasnt been here yet  not yet  why are you so quiet brice is anything the matter you look tired  im not particularly tired  then you are worried what is it  oh you would have to know sooner or later he took a letter from his pocket and gave it to her it came just after i had finished my mornings work  she pulled it out of the envelope and read     manchesterbythesea friday  dear sir i beg leave to relinquish any claim that you may feel i have established to the play you have in hand as it now stands i do not see my part in it and i can imagine why you should be reluctant to make further changes in it in order to meet my requirements  if i can be of any service to you in placing the piece i shall be glad to have you make use of me                       yours truly                           launcelot godolphin   you blame me she said after a blinding moment in which the letter darkened before her eyes and she tottered in her walk she gave it back to him as she spoke  what a passion you have for blaming he answered coldly if i fixed the blame on you it wouldnt help  no louise meekly assented and they walked along towards their cottage they hardly spoke again before they reached it and went in then she asked did you expect anything like this from the way he parted with you yesterday  maxwell gave a bitter laugh from the way we parted yesterday i was expecting him early this afternoon with the world in the palm of his hand to lay it at my feet he all but fell upon my neck when he left me i suppose his not actually doing it was an actors intimation that we were to see each other no more  i wish you had nothing to do with actors said louise  they appear to have nothing to do with me said maxwell it comes to the same thing  they reached the cottage and sat down in the little parlor where she had left him so hopefully at work in the morning where they had talked his play over so jubilantly the night before  what are you going to do she asked after an abysmal interval  nothing what is there to do  you have a right to an explanation you ought to demand it  i dont need any explanation the case is perfectly clear godolphin doesnt want my play that is all  oh brice she lamented i am so dreadfully sorry and i know it was my fault why dont you let me write to him and explain  maxwell shook his head he doesnt want any explanation he doesnt want the play even we must make up our minds to that and let him go now we can try it with your managers  louise felt keenly the unkindness of his calling them her managers but she was glad to have him unkind to her deep within her unitarianism she had the puritan joy in suffering for a sin her treatment of godolphins suggestion of a skirtdance while very righteous in itself was a sin against her husbands interest and she would rather he were unkind to her than not the sooner she was punished for it and done with it the better in her unscientific conception of life the consequences of a sin ended with its punishment if maxwell had upbraided her with the bitterness she merited it would have been to her as if it were all right again with godolphin his failure to do so left the injury unrepaired and she would have to do something i suppose you dont care to let me see what youve written today  no not now said maxwell in a tone that said i havent the heart for it  they sat awhile without speaking and then she ventured brice i have an idea but i dont know what you will think of it why not take godolphins letter on the face of it and say that you are very sorry he must give up the play and that you will be greatly obliged to him if he can suggest some other actor that would be frank at least  maxwell broke into a laugh that had some joy in it do you think so it isnt my idea of frankness exactly  no of course not you always say what you mean and you dont change that is what is so beautiful in you you cant understand a nature that is one thing today and another thing tomorrow  oh i think i can said maxwell with a satirical glance  brice she softly murmured and then she said well i dont care he is just like a woman  you didnt like my saying so last night  that was a different thing at any rate its i that say so now and i want you to write that to him it will bring him back flying will you  ill think about it said maxwell im not sure that i want godolphin back or not at once its a great relief to be rid of him in a certain way though a manager might be worse slavery still i think i would like to try a manager i have never shown this play to one and i know the odeon people in boston and perhaps  you are saying that to comfort me  i wouldnt comfort you for worlds my dear i am saying this to distress you but since i have worked that lovebusiness over it seems to me much less a onepart play and if i could get a manager to take a fancy to it i could have my own way with it much better at least he wouldnt want me to take all the good things out of the other characters mouths and stuff them into haxards  do you really think so  i really thought so before i got godolphins letter that made him seem the one and only man for me  yes louise assented with a sad intelligence  maxwell seemed to have got some strength from confronting his calamity at any rate he said almost cheerfully ill read you what i wrote this morning and she had to let him though she felt that it was taking her at a moment when her wish to console him was so great that she would not be able to criticise him but she found that he had done it so well there was no need of criticism  you are wonderful brice she said in a transport of adoration which she indulged as simply his due you are miraculous well this is the greatest triumph yet even of your genius how you have seized the whole idea and so subtly so delicately and so completely disguised the girl acts just as a girl would have acted how could you know it  perhaps ive seen it he suggested demurely  no no you didnt see it that is the amusing part of it you were as blind as a bat all the time and you never had the least suspicion youve told me so  well then ive seen it retrospectively  perhaps that way but i dont believe youve seen it at all youve divined it and thats where your genius is worth all the experience in the world the girl is twice as good as the man and you never experienced a girls feelings or motives you divined them its pure inspiration its the prophet in you  youll be stoning me next said maxwell i dont think the man is so very bad even if i didnt divine him  yes for a poor creature of experience and knowledge he will do very well but he doesnt compare with the girl  i hadnt so good a model  she hugged him for saying that you pay the prettiest compliments in the world even if you dont pick up handkerchiefs  their joy in the triumph of his art was unalloyed by the hope of anything outside of it of any sort of honor or profit from it though they could not keep the thought of these out very long  yes she said after one of the delicious silences that divided their moments of exaltation there wont be any trouble about getting your play taken now  after supper they strolled down for the sunset and twilight on the rocks there as the dusk deepened she put her wrap over his shoulders as well as her own and pulled it together in front of them both i am not going to have you taking cold now when you need all your health for your work more than ever that lovebusiness seems to me perfect just as it is but i know you wont be satisfied till you have put the very last touch on it  yes i see all sorts of things i can do to it louise  well what  dont you see that the lovebusiness is the play now i have got to throw away all the sininterest all the haxard situation or keep them together as they are and write a new play altogether with the light semicomic motive of the lovebusiness for the motive of the whole its out of tone with haxards tragedy and it cant be brought into keeping with it the sininterest will kill the lovebusiness or the lovebusiness will kill the sininterest dont you see  why of course you must make this light affair now and when its opened the way for you with the public you can bring out the old play she assented and it instantly became the old play in both their minds it became almost the superannuated play they talked it over in this new aspect and then they went back to the cottage to look at the new play as it shadowed itself forth in the sketch maxwell had made he read the sketch to her again and they saw how it could be easily expanded to three or four acts and made to fill the stage and the evening  and it will be the most original thing that ever was she exulted  i dont think theres been anything exactly like it before he allowed  from time to time they spoke to each other in the night and she asked if he were asleep and he if she were asleep and then they began to talk of the play again towards morning they drowsed a little but at their time of life the loss of a nights sleep means nothing and they rose as glad as they had lain down  ill tell you brice she said the first thing you must have it that they have been engaged and you can call the play the second chapter or something more alliterative dont you think that would be a good name  it would make the fortune of any play he answered let alone a play of such merit as this  well then shant you always say that i did something towards it  i shall say you did everything towards it you originated the idea and named it and i simply acted as your amanuensis as it were and wrote it out mostly from your dictation it shall go on the bills the second chapter a demisemiserious comedy by mrs louise hilary maxwellin letters half a foot highand by b maxwellin very small lower case that cant be read without the aid of a microscope  oh brice if you make him talk that way to her it will be perfectly killing  i dare say the audience will find it so  they were so late at breakfast and sat there so long talking for maxwell said he did not feel like going to work quite so promptly as usual that it was quite ten oclock when they came out of the diningroom and then they stayed awhile gossiping with people on the piazza of the hotel before they went back to their cottage when they came round the corner in sight of it they saw the figure of a man pacing back and forth on the veranda with his head dropped forward and swinging a stick thoughtfully behind him louise pulled maxwell convulsively to a halt for the man was godolphin  what do you suppose it means she gasped  i suppose he will tell us said maxwell dryly dont stop and stare at him he has got eyes all over him and hes clothed with selfconsciousness as with a garment and i dont choose to let him think that his being here is the least important or surprising  no of course not that would be ridiculous and she would have liked to pause for a moments worship of her husbands sense which appeared to her almost as great as his genius but it seemed to her an inordinately long time before they reached the cottagegate and godolphin came halfway down the walk to meet them  he bowed seriously to her and then said with dignity to her husband mr maxwell i feel that i owe you an apologyor an explanation ratherfor the abrupt note i sent you yesterday i wish to assure you that i had no feeling in the matter and that i am quite sincere in my offer of my services  why youre very good mr godolphin said maxwell i knew that i could fully rely on your kind offer wont you come in he offered the actor his hand and they moved together towards the cottage louise had at once gone before but not so far as to be out of hearing  why thank you i will sit down a moment i found the walk over rather fatiguing its going to be a hot day he passed his handkerchief across his forehead and insisted upon placing a chair for mrs maxwell before he could be made to sit down though she said that she was going indoors and would not sit you understand of course mr maxwell that i should still like to have your play if it could be made what i want  maxwell would not meet his wifes eye in answering oh yes the only question with me is whether i can make it what you want that has been the trouble all along i know that the lovebusiness in the play as it stood was inadequate but yesterday just before i got your note i had been working it over in a perfectly new shape i wish if you have a quarter of an hour to throw away youd let me show you what ive written perhaps you can advise me  why i shall be delighted to be of any sort of use mr maxwell said godolphin with softened state and he threw himself back in his chair with an air of eager readiness  i will get your manuscript brice said louise at a motion her husband made to rise she ran in and brought it out and then went away again she wished to remain somewhere within earshot but upon the whole she decided against it and went upstairs where she kept herself from eavesdropping by talking with the chambermaid who had come over from the hotel     v   louise did not come down till she heard godolphin walking away on the plank she said to herself that she had shipwrecked her husband once by putting in her oar and she was not going to do it again when the actors footfalls died out in the distance she descended to the parlor where she found maxwell over his manuscript at the table  she had to call to him well before he seemed aware of her presence  even then he did not look round but he said godolphin wants to play atland  the lover  yes he thinks he sees his part in it  and do you  how do i know  well i am glad i let him get safely away before i came back for i certainly couldnt have held in when he proposed that if i had been here i dont understand you brice why do you have anything more to do with him why do you let him touch the new play was he ever of the least use with the old one  maxwell lay back in his chair with a laugh not the least in the world the realization of the fact amused him more and more i was just thinking how everything he ever got me to do to it he looked down at the manuscript was false and wrong they talk about a knowledge of the stage as if the stage were a difficult science instead of a very simple piece of mechanism whose limitations and possibilities any one can seize at a glance all that their knowledge of it comes to is claptrap pure and simple they brag of its resources and tell you the carpenter can do anything you want nowadays but if you attempt anything outside of their tradition they are frightened they think that their exits and their entrances are great matters and that they must come on with such a speech and go off with such another but it is not of the least consequence how they come or go if they have something interesting to say or do  why dont you say these things to godolphin  i do and worse he admits their truth with a candor and an intelligence that are dismaying he has a perfect conception of atlands part and he probably will play it in a way to set your teeth on edge  why do you let him why dont you keep your play and offer it to a manager or some actor who will know how to do it demanded louise with sorrowful submission  godolphin will know how to do it even if he isnt able to and besides i should be a fool to fling him away for any sort of promising uncertainty  he was willing to fling you away  yes but im not so important to him as he is to me hes the best i can do for the present its a compromise all the way througha cursed spite from beginning to end your own words dont represent your ideas and the more conscience you put into the work the further you get from what you thought it would be then comes the actor with the infernal chemistry of his personality he imagines the thing perfectly not as you imagined it but as you wrote it and then he is no more able to play it as he imagined it than you were to write it as you imagined it what the public finally gets is something three times removed from the truth that was first in the dramatists mind but im very lucky to have godolphin back again  i hope youre not going to let him see that you think so  oh no im going to keep him in a suppliant attitude throughout and im going to let you come in and tame his spirit if hekicks  dont be vulgar brice said louise and she laughed rather forlornly i dont see how you have the heart to joke if you think its so bad as you say  i havent im joking without any heart he stood up let us go and take a bath  she glanced at him with a swift inventory of his fagged looks and said indeed you shall not take a bath this morning you couldnt react against it you wont will you  no ill only lie on the sand if you can pick me out a good warm spot and watch you  i shall not bathe either  well then ill watch the other women he put out his hand and took hers  she felt his touch very cold you are excited i can see i wish  what that i was not an intending dramatist  that you didnt have such excitements in your life they will kill you  they are all that will keep me alive  they went down to the beach and walked back and forth on its curve several times before they dropped in the sand at a discreet distance from several groups of hotel acquaintance people were coming and going from the line of bathhouses that backed upon the low sandbank behind them with its tufts of coarse silverygreen grasses the maxwells bowed to some of the ladies who tripped gayly past them in their airy costumes to the surf or came up from it sobered and shivering four or five young fellows with sunblackened arms and legs were passing ball near them a ponycarriage drove by on the wet sand a horseman on a croptailed roan thumped after it at a hard trot dogs ran barking vaguely about and children with wooden shovels screamed at their play far off shimmered the sea of one pale blue with the sky the rooks were black at either end of the beach a line of sailboats and dories swung across its crescent beyond the bathers who bobbed up and down in the surf or showed a head here and there outside of it  what a singular spectacle said maxwell the casting off of the conventional in seabathing always seems to me like the effect of those dreams where we appear in society insufficiently dressed and wonder whether we can make it go  yes isnt it his wife tried to cover all the propositions with one loosely fitting assent  im surprised maxwell went on that some realistic wretch hasnt put this sort of thing on the stage it would be tremendously effective if he made it realistic enough it would be attacked by the press as improper and would fill the house couldnt we work a seabathing scene into the second chapter it would make the fortune of the play and it would give godolphin a chance to show his noble frame in something like the majesty of nature godolphin would like nothing better we could have atland rescue salome and godolphin could flop round among the canvas breakers for ten minutes and come on for a recall with the heroine both dripping real water all over the stage  dont be disgusting brice said his wife absently she had her head half turned from him watching a lady who had just come out of her bathhouse and was passing very near them on her way to the water maxwell felt the inattention in his wifes tone and looked up  the bather returned their joint gaze steadily from eyes that seemed as maxwell said to smoulder under their long lashes and to question her effect upon them in a way that he was some time finding a phrase for he was tormented to make out whether she were a large person or not without her draperies he could not tell but she moved with splendid freedom and her beauty expressed a maturity of experience beyond her years she looked young and yet she looked as if she had been taking care of herself a good while she was certainly very handsome louise owned to herself as the lady quickened her pace and finally ran down to the water and plunged into a breaker that rolled in at the right moment in uncommon volume  well she asked her husband whose eyes had gone with hers  we ought to have clapped  do you think she is an actress  i dont know i never saw her before she seemed to turn the sunshine into limelight as she passed why thats rather pretty isnt it and its a verse i wonder what it is about these people the best of them have nothing of the stage in themat least the men havent im not sure though that the women havent there are lots of women off the stage who are actresses but they dont seem so theyre personal this one was impersonal she didnt seem to regard me as a man she regarded me as a house did you feel that  yes that was it i suppose but she regarded you more than she did me i think  why of course you were only a matinée  they sat half an hour longer in the sand and then he complained that the wind blew all the warmth out of him as fast as the sun shone it into him she felt his hand next her and found it still cold after a glance round she furtively felt his forehead  youre still thinking she sighed come we must go back  yes that girl wont be out of the water for half an hour yet and we couldnt wait to see her clothed and in her right mind afterwards  what makes you think shes a girl asked his wife as they moved slowly off  he did not seem to have heard her question he said i dont believe i can make the new play go louise i havent the strength for it theres too much good stuff in haxard i cant throw away what ive done on it  that is just what i was thinking brice it would be too bad to lose that the lovebusiness as youve remodeled it is all very well but it is light its comedy and haxard is such splendid tragedy i want you to make your first impression in that you can do comedy afterwards but if you did comedy first the public would never think your tragedy was serious  yes theres a law in that a clown mustnt prophesy if a prophet chooses to joke now and then all well and good i couldnt begin now and expand that lovebusiness into a whole play it must remain an episode and godolphin must take it or leave it of course hell want atland emaciated to fatten haxard as he calls it but atland doesnt amount to much as it is and i dont believe i could make him its essentially a passive part salome must make the chief effect in that business and i think ill have her a little more serious too itll be more in keeping with the rest  i dont see why she shouldnt be serious theres nothing ignoble in what she does  no it can be very impassioned  louise thought of the smouldering eyes of that woman and she wondered if they were what suggested something very impassioned to maxwell but with all the frankness between them she did not ask him  on their way to the cottage they saw one of the hotel bellboys coming out just left a telegram in there for you he called as he came towards them  louise began oh dear i hope theres nothing the matter with papa or your mother  she ran forward and maxwell followed at his usual pace so that she had time to go inside and come out with the despatch before he mounted the veranda steps  you open it she entreated piteously holding it towards him  he pulled it impatiently open and glanced at the signature its from godolphin and he read dont destroy old play keep new lovebusiness for episode will come over this afternoon maxwell smiled more mind transference  louise laughed in hysterical relief now you can make him do just what you want     vi   maxwell now at least knew that he had got his play going in the right direction again he felt a fresh pleasure in returning to the old lines after his excursion in the region of comedy and he worked upon them with fresh energy he rehabilitated the lovebusiness as he and his wife had newly imagined it and to disguise the originals the more effectively he made the girl whom he had provisionally called salome more like himself than louise in certain superficial qualities though in an essential nobleness and singleness which consisted with a great deal of feminine sinuosity and subtlety she remained a portrait of louise he was doubtful whether the mingling of characteristics would not end in unreality but she was sure it would not she said he was so much like a woman in the traits he had borrowed from himself that salome would be all the truer for being like him or at any rate she would be finer and more ideal she said that it was nonsense the way people regarded women as altogether different from men she believed they were very much alike a girl was as much the daughter of her father as of her mother she alleged herself as proof of the fact that a girl was often a great deal more her fathers daughter and she argued that if maxwell made salome quite in his own spiritual image no one would dream of criticising her as unwomanly then he asked if he need only make atland in her spiritual image to have him the manliest sort of fellow she said that was not what she meant and in any case a man could have feminine traits and be all the nicer for them but if a woman had masculine traits she would be disgusting at the same time if you drew a man from a woman he would be ridiculous  then you want me to model atland on myself too said maxwell  she thought a moment yes i do if salome is to be taken mostly from me i couldnt bear to have him like anybody but you it would be indelicate  well now ill tell you what im not going to stand it said maxwell i am going to make atland like pinney  but she would not be turned from the serious aspect of the affair by his joking she asked do you think it would intensify the situation if he were not equal to her if the spectator could be made to see that she was throwing herself away on him after all  wouldnt that leave the spectator a little too inconsolable you dont want the lovebusiness to double the tragedy you want to have it relieved dont you  yes that is true you must make him worth all the sacrifice i couldnt stand it if he wasnt  maxwell frowned as he always did when he became earnest and said with a little sigh he must be passive negative as i said you must simply feel that he is good and that she will be safe with him after the worst has happened to her father and i must keep the interest of the lovebusiness light without letting it become farcical i must get charm all i can into her character you wont mind my getting the charm all from you  oh brice what sweet things you say to me i wish everybody could know how divine you are  the women would all be making love to me and i should hate that one is quite enough  am i quite enough she entreated  you have been up to the present time  and do you think i shall always be she slid from her chair to her knees on the floor beside him where he sat at his desk and put her arms round him  he did not seem to know it look here louise i have got to connect this lovebusiness with the main action of the play somehow it wont do simply to have it an episode how would it do to have atland know all the time that haxard has killed greenshaw and be keeping it from salome while she is betraying her love for him  wouldnt that be rather tawdry louise let her arms slip down to her side and looked up at him as she knelt  yes it would he owned  he looked very unhappy about it and she rose to her feet as if to give it more serious attention brice i want your play to be thoroughly honest and true from beginning to end and not to have any sort of catchpenny effectivism in it you have planned it so nobly that i cant bear to have you lower the standard the least bit and i think the honest and true way is to let the lovebusiness be a pleasant fact in the case as it might very well be those things do keep going on in life alongside of the greatest misery the greatest unhappiness  well said maxwell i guess you are right about the lovebusiness ill treat it frankly for what it is a fact in the case that will be the right way and that will be the strong way it will be like life i dont know that you are bound to relate things strictly to each other in art any more than they are related in life there are all sorts of incidents and interests playing round every great event that seem to have no more relation to it than the rings of saturn have to saturn they form the atmosphere of it if i can let haxards wretchedness be seen at last through the atmosphere of his daughters happiness  yes she said that will be quite enough she knew that they had talked up to the moment when he could best begin to work and now left him to himself  within a week he got the rehabilitated lovebusiness in place and the play ready to show to godolphin again he had managed to hold the actor off in the meantime but now he returned in full force with suggestions and misgivings which had first to be cleared away before he could give a clear mind to what maxwell had done then maxwell could see that he was somehow disappointed for he began to talk as if there were no understanding between them for his taking the play he praised it warmly but he said that it would be hard to find a woman to do the part of salome  that is the principal part in the piece now you know he added  i dont see how maxwell protested it seems to me that her character throws haxards into greater relief than before and gives it more prominence  youve made the lovebusiness too strong i think i supposed you would have something light and graceful to occupy the house in the suspense between the points in haxards case if i were to do him i should be afraid that people would come back from salome to him with more or less of an effort i dont say they would but thats the way it strikes me now perhaps some one else would look at it quite differently  then as it is you dont want it  i dont say that but it seems to me that salome is the principal figure now i think thats a mistake  if its a fact its a mistake i dont want to have it so said maxwell and he made such effort as he could to swallow his disgust  godolphin asked after a while in that last scene between her and her father and in fact in all the scenes between them couldnt you give more of the strong speeches to him shes a great creation now but isnt she too great for atland  ive kept atland under purposely because the part is necessarily a negative one and because i didnt want him to compete with haxard at all  yes that is all right but as it is she competes with haxard  after godolphin had gone louise came down and found maxwell in a dreary muse over his manuscript he looked up at her with a lacklustre eye and said godolphin is jealous of salome now what he really wants is a fiveact monologue that will keep him on the stage all the time he thinks that as it is she will take all the attention from him  louise appeared to reflect well isnt there something in that  good heavens i should think you were going to play haxard too  no but of course you cant have two characters of equal importance in your play some one has to be first and godolphin doesnt want an actress taking all the honors away from him  then why did you pretend to like the way i had done it maxwell demanded angrily if you think she will take the honors from him  i didnt say that i did all that i want is that you should ask yourself whether she would or not  are you jealous of her  now my dear if you are going to be unreasonable i will not talk with you  nothing maddened maxwell so much as to have his wife take this tone with him when he had followed her up through the sinuosities that always began with her after a certain point short of that she was as frank and candid as a man and he understood her but beyond that the eternal womanly began and he could make nothing of her she evaded and came and went and returned upon her course and all with as good a conscience apparently as if she were meeting him fairly and squarely on the question they started with sometimes he doubted if she really knew that she was behaving insincerely or whether if she knew it she could help doing it he believed her to be a more truthful nature than himself and it was insufferable for her to be less so and then accuse him of illogicality  i have no wish to talk he said smothering his rage and taking up a page of manuscript  of course she went on as if there had been no break in their good feeling i know what a goose godolphin is and i dont wonder youre vexed with him but you know very well that i have nothing but the good of the play in view as a work of art and i should say that if you couldnt keep salome from rivalling haxard in the interest of the spectator you had better go back to the idea of making two plays of it i think that the second chapter would be a very good thing to begin with  why good heavens you said just the contrary when we decided to drop it  yes but that was when i thought you would be able to subdue salome  there never was any question of subduing salome it was a question of subduing atland  its the same thing keeping the lovebusiness in the background  i give it up maxwell flung down his manuscript in sign of doing so the whole thing is a mess and you seem to delight in tormenting me about it how am i to give the lovebusiness charm and yet keep it in the background  i should think you could  how  well i was afraid you would give salome too much prominence  didnt you know whether i had done so or not you knew what i had done before godolphin came  if godolphin thinks she is too prominent you ought to trust his instinct  maxwell would not answer her he went out and she saw him strolling down the path to the rocks she took the manuscript and began to read it over  he did not come back and when she was ready to go to supper she had to go down to the rocks for him his angry fit seemed to have passed but he looked abjectly sad and her heart ached at sight of him she said cheerfully i have been reading that lovebusiness over again brice and i dont find it so far out as i was afraid it was salome is a little too prononcée but you can easily mend that she is a delightful character and you have given her charmtoo much charm i dont believe theres a truer woman in the whole range of the drama she is perfect and that is why i think you can afford to keep her back a little in the passages with haxard of course godolphin wants to shine there you neednt give him her speeches but you can put them somewhere else in some of the scenes with atland it wont make any difference how much she outshines him poor fellow  he would not be entreated at once but after letting her talk on to much the same effect for awhile he said i will see what can be done with it at present i am sick of the whole thing  yes just drop it for the present she said im hungry arent you  i didnt know it was time  she was very tender with him walking up to the hotel and all that evening she kept him amused so that he would not want to look at his manuscript she used him as a wife is apt to use her husband when he is fretted and not very well as if he were her little boy and she did this so sweetly that maxwell could not resent it  the next morning she let him go to his play again and work all the morning he ended about noon and told her he had done what she wanted done to the lovebusiness he thought but he would not show it to her for he said he was tired of it and would have to go over it with godolphin at any rate when he came in the afternoon they went to the beach but the person with the smouldering eyes failed to appear and in fact they did not see her again at magnolia and they decided that she must have been passing a few days at one of the other hotels and gone away  godolphin arrived in the sunniest goodhumor as if he had never had any thought of relinquishing the play and he professed himself delighted with the changes maxwell had made in the lovebusiness he said the character of salome had the true proportion to all the rest now and maxwell understood that he would not be jealous of the actress who played the part or feel her a dangerous rival in the public favor he approved of the transposition of the speeches that maxwell had made or at least he no longer openly coveted them for haxard  what was more important to maxwell was that louise seemed finally contented with the part too and said that now no matter what godolphin wanted she would never let it be touched again i am glad you have got that impassioned rubbish out i never thought that was in character with salome  the artistic consciousness of maxwell which caught all the fine reluctances and all the delicate feminine preferences of his wife was like a subtle web woven around him and took everything without his willing it from within him as well as from without and held it inexorably for future use he knew the source of the impassioned rubbish which had displeased his wife and he had felt while he was employing it that he was working in a commoner material than the rest of salomes character but he had experimented with it in the hope that she might not notice it the fact that she had instantly noticed it and had generalized the dislike which she only betrayed at last after she had punished him sufficiently remained in the meshes of the net he wore about his mind as something of value which he could employ to exquisite effect if he could once find a scheme fit for it  in the meantime it would be hard to say whether godolphin continued more a sorrow or a joy to maxwell who was by no means always of the same mind about him he told his wife sometimes when she was pitying him that it was a good discipline for him to work with such a man for it taught him a great deal about himself if it did not teach him much else he said that it tamed his overweening pride to find that there was artistic ability employing itself with literature which was so unlike literary ability godolphin conceived perfectly of the literary intention in the fine passages of the play and enjoyed their beauty but he did not value them any more than the poorest and crudest verbiage that promised him a point in fact maxwell found that in two or three places the actor was making a wholly wrong version of his words and maturing in his mind an effect from his error that he was rather loath to give up though when he was instructed as to their true meaning he saw how he could get a better effect out of it he had an excellent intelligence but this was employed so entirely in the study of impression that significance was often a secondary matter with him he had not much humor and maxwell doubted if he felt it much in others but he told a funny story admirably and did characterstuff as he called it with the subtlest sense he had begun in sketches of the variety type sometimes maxwell thought him very well versed in the history and theory of the drama but there were other times when his ignorance seemed almost creative in that direction he had apparently no feeling for values he would want a good effect used without regard to the havoc it made of the whole picture though doubtless if it could have been realized to him he would have abhorred it as thoroughly as maxwell himself he would come over from manchester one day with a notion for the play so bad that it almost made maxwell shed tears and the next with something so good that maxwell marvelled at it but godolphin seemed to value the one no more than the other he was a creature of moods the most extreme his faith in maxwell was as profound as his abysmal distrust of him and his frank and open nature was full of suspicion he was like a child in the simplicity of his selfishness as far as his art was concerned but in all matters aside from it he was chaotically generous his formlessness was sometimes almost distracting he presented himself to the authors imagination as mere human material waiting to be moulded in this shape or that from day to day from week to week maxwell lived in a superficial uncertainty whether godolphin had really taken his play or would ever produce it yet at the bottom of his heart he confided in the promises which the actor lavished upon him in both the written and the spoken word they had an agreement carefully drawn up as to all the business between them but he knew that godolphin would not be held by any clause of it that he wished to break he did not believe that godolphin understood what it bound him to either when he signed it or afterward but he was sure that he would do not only what was right but what was noble if he could be taken at the right moment upon the whole he liked him in a curious sort he respected and honored him and he defended him against mrs maxwell when she said godolphin was wearing her husbands life out and that if he made the play as greatly successful as hamlet or the trip to chinatown he would not be worth what it cost them both in time and temper  they lost a good deal of time and temper with the play which was almost a conjugal affair with them and the struggle to keep up a show of gay leisure before the summering world up and down the coast told upon mrs maxwells nerves she did not mind the people in the hotel so much they were very nice but she did not know many of them and she could not care for them as she did for her friends who came up from beverly farms and over from manchester she hated to call maxwell from his work at such times not only because she pitied him but because he came to help her receive her friends with such an air of gloomy absence and open reluctance and she had hated still worse to say he was busy with his play the play he was writing for mr godolphin her friends were apparently unable to imagine anyone writing a play so seriously and they were unable to imagine mr godolphin at all for they had never heard of him the splendor of his unknown name took them more than anything else as for getting maxwell to return their visits with her when men had come with the ladies who called upon her she could only manage it if he was so fagged with working at his play that he was too weak to resist her will and even then he had to be torn from it almost by main force he behaved so badly in the discharge of some of these duties to society and was to her eye at least so bored and worried by them that she found it hard to forgive him and made him suffer for it on the way home till she relented at the sight of his thin face the face that she loved that she had thought the world well lost for after the third or fourth time she made him go with her she gave it up and went alone though she was aware that it might look as if they were not on good terms she only obliged him after that to go with her to her fathers where she would not allow any shadow of suspicion to fall upon their happiness and where his absentmindedness would be accounted for her mother seemed to understand it better than her father who she could see sometimes inwardly resented it as neglect she also exacted of maxwell that he should not sit silent through a whole meal at the hotel and that if he did not or could not talk he should keep looking at her and smiling and nodding now and then if he would remember to do this she would do all the talking herself sometimes he did not remember and then she trod on his foot in vain  the droll side of the case often presented itself for her relief and after all she knew beforehand that this was the manner of man she was marrying and she was glad to marry him she was happier than she had ever dreamed of being she was one of those women who live so largely in their sympathies that if these were employed she had no thought of herself and not to have any thought of ones self is to be blessed maxwell had no thought of anything but his work and that made his bliss if she could have no thought but of him in his work she could feel herself in heaven with him     vii   july and august went by and it was time for godolphin to take the road again by this time maxwells play was in as perfect form as it could be until it was tried upon the stage and then overhauled for repairs godolphin had decided to try it first in toronto where he was going to open and then to give it in the west as often as he could if it did as well as he expected he would bring it on for a run in new york about the middle of december he would want maxwell at the rehearsals there but for the present he said he preferred to stagemanage it himself they had talked it up so fully that he had all the authors intentions in mind  he came over from manchester the day before his vacation ended to take leave of the maxwells he was in great spirits with the play but he confessed to a misgiving in regard to the lady whom he had secured for the part of salome he said there was only one woman he ever saw fit to do that part but when he named the actress the maxwells had to say they had never heard of her before she is a southerner she is very well known in the west godolphin said  louise asked if she had ever played in boston and when he said she had not louise said oh  maxwell trembled but godolphin seemed to find nothing latent in his wifes offensive tone and after a little further talk they all parted on the friendliest terms the maxwells did not hear from him for a fortnight though he was to have tried the play in toronto at least a week earlier then there came a telegram from midland    tried play here last night went like wildfire     will write                   godolphin  the message meant success and the maxwells walked the air the production of the piece was mentioned in the associated press despatches to the boston papers and though mrs maxwell studied these in vain for some verbal corroboration of godolphins jubilant message she did not lose faith in it nor allow her husband to do so in fact while they waited for godolphins promised letter they made use of their leisure to count the chickens which had begun to hatch the actor had agreed to pay the author at the rate of five dollars an act for each performance of the play and as it was five acts long a simple feat of arithmetic showed that the nightly gain from it would be twentyfive dollars and that if it ran every night and two afternoons for matinées the weekly return from it would be two hundred dollars besides this godolphin had once said in a moment of high content with the piece that if it went as he expected it to go he would pay maxwell over and above this twentyfive dollars a performance five per cent of the net receipts whenever these passed one thousand dollars his promise had not been put in writing and maxwell had said at the time that he should be satisfied with his five dollars an act but he had told his wife of it and they had both agreed that godolphin would keep it they now took it into the account in summing up their gains and mrs maxwell thought it reasonable to figure at least twentyfive dollars more from it for each time the play was given but as this brought the weekly sum up to four hundred dollars she so far yielded to her husband as to scale the total at three hundred dollars though she said it was absurd to put it at any such figure she refused at any rate to estimate their earnings from the season at less than fifteen thousand dollars it was useless for maxwell to urge that godolphin had other pieces in his repertory things that had made his reputation and that he would naturally want to give sometimes she asked him whether godolphin himself had not voluntarily said that if the piece went as he expected he would play nothing else as long as he lived like jefferson with rip van winkle and here she said it had already by his own showing gone at once like wildfire when maxwell pleaded that they did not know what wildfire meant she declared that it meant an overwhelming house and unbridled rapture in the audience it meant an instant and lasting triumph for the play she began to praise godolphin or at least to own herself mistaken in some of her decrials of him she could not be kept from bubbling over to two or three ladies at the hotel where it was quickly known what an immense success the first performance of maxwells play had been he was put to shame by several asking him when they were to have it in boston but his wife had no embarrassment in answering that it would probably be kept the whole winter in new york and not come to boston till some time in the early spring  she was resolved now that he should drive over to beverly farms with her and tell her father and mother about the success of the play she had instantly telegraphed them on getting godolphins despatch and she began to call out to her father as soon as she got inside the house and saw him coming down the stairs in the hall now what do you say papa isnt it glorious didnt i tell you it would be the greatest success did you ever hear anything like it wheres mamma if she shouldnt be at home i dont know what i shall do  shes here said her father arriving at the foot of the stairs where louise embraced him and then let him shake hands with her husband shes dressing we were just going over to see you  well youve been pretty deliberate about it here its after lunch and i telegraphed you at ten oclock she went on to bully her father more and more and to flourish maxwells triumph in his face were going to have three hundred dollars a week from it at the very least and fifteen thousand dollars for the season what do you think of that isnt that pretty good for two people that had nothing in the world yesterday what do you say now papa  there were all sorts of lurking taunts demands reproaches in these words which both the men felt but they smiled across her and made as if they were superior to her simple exultation  i should say you had written the play yourself louise said her father  no answered her husband godolphin wrote the play or ive no doubt hes telling the reporters so by this time  louise would not mind them well i dont care i want papa to acknowledge that i was right for once anybody could believe in brices genius but i believed in his star and i always knew that he would get on and i was all for his giving up his newspaper work and devoting himself to the drama and now the way is open to him and all he has got to do is to keep on writing  come now louise said her husband  well her father interposed im glad of your luck maxwell it isnt in my line exactly but i dont believe i could be any happier if it were after all its doing something to elevate the stage i wish someone would take hold of the pulpit  maxwell shrugged im not strong enough for that quite and i cant say that i had any conscious intention to elevate the stage with my play  but you had it unconsciously brice said louise and it cant help having a good effect on life too  it will teach people to be careful how they murder people maxwell assented  well its a great chance said hilary with the will to steer a middle course between maxwells modesty and louises overweening pride there really isnt anything that people talk about more they discuss plays as they used to discuss sermons if youve done a good play youve done a good thing  his wife hastened to make answer for him hes done a great play and there are no ifs or ans about it she went on to celebrate maxwells achievement till he was quite out of countenance for he knew that she was doing it mainly to rub his greatness into her father and he had so much of the old grudge left that he would not suffer himself to care whether hilary thought him great or not it was a relief when mrs hilary came in louise became less defiant in her joy then or else the effect of it was lost in mrs hilarys assumption of an entire expectedness in the event her world was indeed so remote from the world of art that she could value success in it only as it related itself to her family and it seemed altogether natural to her that her daughters husband should take its honors she was by no means a stupid woman for a woman born and married to wealth with all the advantages that go with it she was uncommonly intelligent but she could not help looking upon æsthetic honors of any sort as in questionable taste she would have preferred position in a soninlaw to any distinction appreciable to the general but wanting that it was fit he should be distinguished in the way he chose in her feeling it went far to redeem the drama that it should be related to the hilarys by marriage and if she had put her feeling into words which always oversay the feelings they would have been to the effect that the drama had behaved very well indeed and deserved praise this is what mrs hilarys instinct would have said but of course her reason would have said something quite different and it was her reason that spoke to maxwell and expressed a pleasure in his success that was very gratifying to him he got on with her better than with hilary partly because she was a woman and he was a man and partly because though she had opposed his marriage with louise more steadily than her husband there had been no open offence between them he did not easily forgive a hurt to his pride and hilary with all his good will since and his quick repentance at the time had never made it quite right with maxwell for treating him rudely once when he came to him so helplessly in the line of his newspaper work they were always civil to each other and they would always be what is called good friends they had even an air of mutual understanding as regarded louise and her exuberances still she was so like her father in these and so unlike her mother that it is probable the understanding between hilary and maxwell concerning her was only the understanding of men and that maxwell was really more in sympathy with mrs hilary even about louise even about the world he might have liked it as much as she if he had been as much of it and he thought so well of it as a world that he meant to conquer one of the chief places in it in the meantime he would have been very willing to revenge himself upon it to satirize it to hurt it to humble itbut for his own pleasure not the worlds good  hilary wanted the young people to stay the afternoon and have dinner but his wife perceived that they wished to be left alone in their exultation and she would not let him keep them beyond a decent moment or share too much in their joy with only that telegram from godolphin they could not be definite about anything but their future which louise at least beheld all rose color just what size or shape their good fortune had already taken they did not know and could not till they got the letter godolphin had promised and she was in haste to go back to magnolia for that though it could not arrive before the next morning at the earliest she urged that he might have written before telegraphing or when he came from the theatre after the play was given she was not satisfied with the reception of her news and she said so to maxwell as soon as they started home  what did you want he retorted in a certain vexation they were as cordial as they could be  cordial is not enough you cant expect anything like uproar from mamma but she took it too much as a matter of course and i did suppose papa would be a little more riotous  if you are going to be as exacting as that with people maxwell returned you are going to disappoint yourself frightfully and if you insist you will make them hate you people cant share your happiness any more than they can share your misery its as much as they can do to manage their own  but i did think my own father and mother might have entered into it a little more she grieved well you are right brice and i will try to hold in after this it wasnt for myself i cared  i know said maxwell so appreciatively that she felt all her loss made up to her and shrunk closer to him in the buggy he was driving with a lax absentminded rein but i think a little less fourth of july on my account would be better  yes you are wise and i shall not say another word about it to anybody just treat it as a common everyday event  he laughed at what was so far from her possibilities and began to tell her of the scheme for still another play that had occurred to him while they were talking with her father she was interested in the scheme but more interested in the involuntary workings of his genius and she celebrated that till he had to beg her to stop for she made him ashamed of himself even in the solitude of the woodland stretches they were passing through then he said as if it were part of the same strain of thought you have to lose a lot of things in writing a play now for instance that beautiful green light there in the woods he pointed to a depth of the boscage where it had almost an emerald quality it was so vivid so intense if i were writing a story about two lovers in such a light and how it bathed their figures and illumined their faces i could make the reader feel it just as i did i could make them see it but if i were putting them in a play i should have to trust the carpenter and the scenepainter for the effect and you know what broken reeds they are  yes she sighed and some day i hope you will write novels but now youve made such a success with this play that you must do some others and when youve got two or three going steadily you can afford to take up a novel it would be wicked to turn your back on the opportunity youve won  he silently assented and said i shall be all the the better novelist for waiting a year or two     viii   there was no letter from godolphin in the morning but in the course of the forenoon there came a newspaper addressed in his handwriting and later several others they were midland papers and they had each heavily outlined in ink a notice of the appearance of mr launcelot godolphin in a new play written expressly for him by a young boston littérateur mr godolphin believed the author to be destined to make his mark high in the dramatic world he said in the course of a long interview in the paper which came first an evening edition preceeding the production of the piece and plainly meant to give the public the right perspective he had entered into a generous expression of his own feelings concerning it and had given maxwell full credit for the lofty conception of an american drama modern in spirit and broad in purpose he modestly reserved to himself such praise as might be due for the hints his lifelong knowledge of the stage had enabled him to offer the dramatist he told how they had spent the summer near each other on the north shore of massachusetts and had met almost daily and the reporter got a picturesque bit out of their first meeting at the actors hotel in boston the winter before when the dramatist came to lay the scheme of the play before godolphin and godolphin made up his mind before he had heard him half through that he should want the piece he had permitted himself a personal sketch of maxwell which lost none of its original advantages in the diction of the reporter and which represented him as young slight in figure with a refined and delicate face bearing the stamp of intellectual force a journalist from the time he left school and one of the best exponents of the formative influences of the press in the training of its votaries from time to time it was hard for maxwell to make out whose words the interview was couched in but he acquitted godolphin of the worst and he certainly did not accuse him of the flowery terms giving his patriotic reasons for not producing the piece first in toronto as he had meant to do it appeared that upon second thoughts he had reserved this purely american drama for the opening night of his engagement in one of the most distinctively american cities after having had it in daily rehearsal ever since the season began  i should think they had pinney out there said maxwell as he and his wife looked over the interview with their cheeks together  not at all she retorted it isnt the least like pinney and he was amazed to find that she really liked the stuff she said that she was glad now that she understood why godolphin had not opened with the play in toronto as he had promised and she thoroughly agreed with him that it ought first to be given on our own soil she was dashed for a moment when maxwell made her reflect that they were probably the losers of four or five hundred dollars by the delay then she said she did not care that it was worth the money she did not find the personal account of maxwell offensive though she contended that it did not do him full justice and she cut out the interview and pasted it in a book where she was going to keep all the notices of his play and every printed fact concerning it he told her she would have to help herself out with some of the fables if she expected to fill her book and she said she did not care for that either and probably it was just such things as this interview that drew attention to the play and must have made it go like wildfire that first night in midland maxwell owned that it was but too likely and then he waited hungrily for further word of his play while she expected the next mail in cheerful faith  it brought them four or five morning papers and it seemed from these that a play might have gone like wildfire and yet not been seen by a very large number of people the papers agreed in a sense of the graceful compliment paid their city by mr godolphin who was always a favorite there in producing his new piece at one of their theatres and confiding it at once to the judgment of a cultivated audience instead of trying it first in a subordinate place and bringing it on with a factitious reputation worked up from all sorts of unknown sources they agreed too that his acting had never been better that it had great smoothness and that it rose at times into passion and was full of his peculiar force his company was well chosen and his support had an even excellence which reflected great credit upon the young star who might be supposed if he had followed an unwise tradition to be willing to shine at the expense of his surroundings his rendition of the rôle of haxard was magnificent in one journal grand in another superb in a third rich full and satisfying in a fourth subtle and conscientious in a fifth beyond this the critics ceased to be so much of one mind they were by a casting vote adverse to the leading lady whom the majority decided an inadequate salome without those great qualities which the author had evidently meant to redeem a certain coquettish lightness in her the minority held that she had grasped the rôle with intelligence and expressed with artistic force a very refined intention in it the minority hinted that salome was really the great part in the piece and that in her womanly endeavor to win back the lover whom she had not at first prized at his true worth while her heart was wrung by sympathy with her unhappy father in the mystery brooding over him she was a far more interesting figure than the less complex haxard and they intimated that godolphin had an easier task in his portrayal they all touched more or less upon the conduct of the subordinate actors in their parts and the maxwells in every case had to wade through their opinions of the playing before they got to their opinions of the play which was the only vital matter concerned  louise would have liked to read them as she had read the first with her arm across maxwells shoulder and as it were with the same eye and the same mind but maxwell betrayed an uneasiness under the experiment which made her ask dont you like to have me put my arm round you brice  yes yes he answered impatiently i like to have you put your arm around me on all proper occasions butit isnt favorable to collected thought  why i think it is she protested with pathos and a burlesque of her pathos i never think half so well as when i have my arm around you then it seems as if i thought with your mind i feel so judicial  perhaps i feel too emotional under the same conditions and think with your mind at any rate i cant stand it and we cant both sit in the same chair either now you take one of the papers and go round to the other side of the table i want to have all my faculties for the appreciation of this noble criticism its going to be full of instruction  he made her laugh and she feigned a pout in obeying him but nevertheless in her heart she felt herself postponed to the interest that was always first in him and always before his love  and dont talk he urged or keep calling out or reading passages ahead i want to get all the sense there doesnt seem to be in this thing  in fact the critics had found themselves confronted with a task which is always confusing to criticism in the necessity of valuing a work of art so novel in material that it seems to refuse the application of criterions as he followed their struggles in the endeavor to judge his work by such canons of art as were known to them instead of taking it frankly upon the plane of nature and of truth where he had tried to put it and blaming or praising him as he had failed or succeeded in this he was more and more bowed down within himself before the generous courage of godolphin in rising to an appreciation of his intention he now perceived that he was a man of far more uncommon intelligence than he had imagined him and that in taking his play godolphin had shown a zeal for the drama which was not likely to find a response in criticism whatever its fate with the public might be the critics frankly owned that in spite of its defects the piece had a cordial reception from the audience that the principal actors were recalled again and again and they reported that godolphin had spoken both for the author and himself in acknowledging the applause and had disclaimed all credit for their joint success this made maxwell ashamed of the suspicion he had harbored that godolphin would give the impression of a joint authorship at the least he felt that he had judged the man narrowly and inadequately and he decided that as soon as he heard from him he would write and make due reparation for the tacit wrong he had done him  upon the whole he had some reason to be content with the first fortune of his work whatever its final fate might be to be sure if the audience which received it was enthusiastic it was confessedly small and it had got no more than a foothold in the public favor it must remain for further trial to prove it a failure or a success his eye wandered to the column of advertised amusements for the pleasure of seeing the play announced there for the rest of the week there was a full list of the pieces for the time of godolphins stay but it seemed that neither at night nor at morning was maxwells play to be repeated the paper dropped from his hand  what is the matter his wife asked looking up from her own paper this poor man is the greatest possible goose he doesnt seem to know what he is talking about even when he praises you but of course he has to write merely from a first impression do you want to change papers  maxwell mechanically picked his up and gave it to her the worst of it is he said with the sardonic smile he had left over from an unhappier time of life that he wont have an opportunity to revise his first impression  what do you mean  he told her but she could not believe him till she had verified the fact by looking at the advertisements in all the papers  then she asked what in the world does he mean  not to give it there any more apparently he hasnt entered upon the perpetual performance of the piece but if he isnt like jefferson perhaps hes like rip he dont count this time well i might have known it why did i ever trust one of that race he began to walk up and down the room and to fling out one after another the expressions of his scorn and his selfscorn they have no idea of what good faith is except as something that brings down the house when they register a noble vow but i dont blame him i blame myself what an ass what an idiot i was why he could have told me not to believe in his promises he is a perfectly honest man and would have done it if i had appealed to him he didnt expect me to believe in them and from the wary way i talked i dont suppose he thought i did he hadnt the measure of my folly i hadnt myself  now brice his wife called out to him severely i wont have you going on in that way when i denounced godolphin you wouldnt listen to me and when i begged and besought you to give him up you always said he was the only man in the world for you till i got to believing it and i believe it now why dearest she added in a softer tone dont you see that he probably had his programme arranged all beforehand and couldnt change it just because your play happened to be a hit im sure he paid you a great compliment by giving it the first night now you must just wait till you hear from him and you may be sure he will have a good reason for not repeating it there  oh godolphin would never lack for a good reason and i can tell you what his reason in this case will be that the thing was practically a failure and that he would have lost money if he had kept it on  is that what is worrying you i dont believe it was a failure i think from all that the papers say and the worst that they say the piece was a distinct success it was a great success with nice people you can see that for yourself and it will be a popular success too i know it will as soon as it gets a chance but you may be sure that godolphin has some scheme about it and that if he doesnt give it again in midland its because he wants to make people curious about it and hold it in reserve or something like that at any rate i think you ought to wait for his letter before you denounce him  maxwell laughed again at these specious arguments but he could not refuse to be comforted by them and he had really nothing to do but to wait for godolphins letter it did not come the next mail and then his wife and he collated his dispatch with the newspaper notices and tried to make up a judicial opinion from their combined testimony concerning the fate of the play with the audience their scrutiny of the telegram developed the fact that it must have been sent the night of the performance and while godolphin was still warm from his recalls and from the congratulations of his friends it could not have reached them so soon as it did in the morning if it had been sent to the office then it was not a night message but it had probably lain in the office over night in this view it was not such valuable testimony to the success of the play as it had seemed before but a second and a third reading of the notices made them seem friendlier than at first the maxwells now perceived that they had first read them in the fever of their joy from godolphins telegram and that their tempered approval had struck cold upon them because they were so overheated they were really very favorable after all and they witnessed to an interest in the play which could not be ignored very likely the interest in it was partly from the fact that godolphin had given it but apart from this it was evident that the play had established a claim of its own the mail which did not bring a letter from godolphin brought another copy of that evening paper which had printed the anticipatory interview with him and this had a long and careful consideration of the play in its editorial columns apparently written by a lover of the drama as well as a lover of the theatre very little regard was paid to the performance but a great deal to the play which was skilfully analyzed and praised and blamed in the right places the writer did not attempt to forecast its fate but he said that whatever its fate with the public might be here at least was a step in the direction of the drama dealing with facts of american lifesimply vigorously and honestly it had faults of construction but the faults were not the faults of weakness they were rather the effects of a young talent addressing itself to the management of material too rich too abundant for the scene and allowing itself to touch the borders of melodrama in its will to enforce some tragic points of the intrigue but it was not mawkish and it was not romantic in its highest reaches it made you think by its stern and unflinching fidelity to the implications of ibsen but it was not too much to say that it had a charm often wanting to that master it was full of the real american humor it made its jokes as americans did in the very face of the most disastrous possibilities and in the lovepassages it was delicious the whole episode of the love between haxards daughter salome and atland was simply the sweetest and freshest bit of nature in the modern drama it daringly portrayed a woman in circumstances where it was the convention to ignore that she ever was placed and it lent a grace of delicate comedy to the somber ensemble of the piece without lowering the dignity of the action or detracting from the sympathy the spectator felt for the daughter of the homicide it rather heightened this  louise read the criticism aloud and then she and maxwell looked at each other it took their breath away but louise got her breath first who in the world would have dreamed that there was any one who could write such a criticism out there  maxwell took the paper and ran the article over again then he said if the thing did nothing more than get itself appreciated in that way i should feel that it had done enough i wonder who the fellow is could it be a woman  there was in fact a feminine fineness in the touch here and there that might well suggest a woman but they finally decided against the theory louise said that a woman writer would not have the honesty to own that the part salome played in getting back her lover was true to life though every woman who saw it would know that it was she examined the wrapper of the newspaper and made sure that it was addressed in godolphins hand and she said that if he did not speak of the article in his letter maxwell must write out to the newspaper and ask who had done it  godolphins letter came at last with many excuses for his delay he said he had expected the newspaper notices to speak for him and he seemed to think that they had all been altogether favorable to the play it was not very consoling to have him add that he now believed the piece would have run the whole week in midland if he had kept it on but he had arranged merely to give it a trial and maxwell would understand how impossible it was to vary a programme which had once been made out one thing was certain however the piece was an assured success and a success of the most flattering and brilliant kind and godolphin would give it a permanent place in his répertoire there was no talk of his playing nothing else and there was no talk of putting the piece on for a run when he opened in new york he said he had sent maxwell a paper containing a criticism in the editorial columns which would serve to show him how great an interest the piece had excited in midland though he believed the article was not written by one of the regular force but was contributed from the outside by a young fellow who had been described to godolphin as a sort of ibsen crank at the close he spoke of certain weaknesses which the piece had developed in the performance and casually mentioned that he would revise it at these points as he found the time it appeared to him that it needed overhauling particularly in the love episode there was too much of that and the interest during an entire act centred so entirely upon salome that as he had foreseen the rôle of haxard suffered     ix   the maxwells stared at each other in dismay when they had finished this letter which louise had opened but which they had read together she looking over his shoulder all interest in the authorship of the article of the ibsen crank all interest in godolphins apparent forgetfulness of his solemn promises to give the rest of his natural life to the performance of the piece was lost in amaze at the fact that he was going to revise it to please himself and to fashion maxwells careful work over in his own ideal of the figure he should make in it to the public the thought of this was so petrifying that even louise could not at once find words for it and they were both silent as people sometimes are when a calamity has befallen them in the hope that if they do not speak it will turn out a miserable dream  well brice she said at last you certainly never expected this  no he answered with a ghastly laugh this passes my most sanguine expectations even of godolphin good heaven fancy the botch he will make of it  you mustnt let him touch it you must demand it back peremptorily you must telegraph  what a mania you have for telegraphing he retorted a special delivery postagestamp will serve every purpose he isnt likely to do the piece again for a week at the earliest he thought for awhile and then he said in a week hell have a chance to change his mind so often that perhaps he wont revise and overhaul it after all  but he mustnt think that you would suffer it for an instant his wife insisted its an indignity that you should not submit to its an outrage  very likely maxwell admitted and he began to walk the floor with his head fallen and his fingers clutched together behind him the sight of his mute anguish wrought upon his wife and goaded her to more and more utterance  its an insult to your genius brice dear and you must resent it i am sure i have been as humble about the whole affair as any one could be and i should be the last person to wish you to do anything rash i bore with godolphins suggestions and i let him worry you to death with his plans for spoiling your play but i certainly didnt dream of anything so highhanded as his undertaking to work it over himself or i should have insisted on your breaking with him long ago how patient you have been through it all youve shown so much forbearance and so much wisdom and so much delicacy in dealing with his preposterous ideas and then to have it all thrown away its too bad  maxwell kept walking hack and forth and louise began again at a new point  i was willing to have it remain simply a succès destime as far as midland was concerned though i think you were treated abominably in that for he certainly gave you reason to suppose that he would do it every night there he says himself that it would have run the whole week and you can see from that article how it was growing in public favor all the time what has become of his promise to play nothing else i should like to know and hes only played it once and now he proposes to revise it himself  still maxwell walked on and she continued  i dont know what i shall say to my family they can never understand such a thing never papa couldnt conceive of giving a promise and not keeping it much less giving a promise just for the pleasure of breaking it what shall i tell them brice i cant bear to say that godolphin is going to make your play over unless i can say at the same time that youve absolutely forbidden him to do so thats why i wanted you to telegraph i wanted to say you had telegraphed  maxwell stopped in his walk and gazed at her but she could feel that he did not see her and she said  i dont know that its actually necessary for me to say anything at present i can show them the notices or that article alone its worth all the rest put together and then we can wait and see if we hear anything more from godolphin but now i dont want you to lose any more time you must write to him at once and absolutely forbid him to touch your play will you  her husband returned from his wanderings of mind and body and as he dropped upon the lounge at her side he said gently no i dont think ill write at all louise  not write at all then youre going to let him tamper with that beautiful work of yours  im going to wait till i hear from him again godolphin is a good fellow  oh  and he wont be guilty of doing me injustice besides and here maxwell broke off with a laugh that had some gayety in it he couldnt godolphin is a fine actor and hes going to be a great one but his gifts are not in the line of literature  i should think not  he couldnt change the piece any more than if he couldnt read or write and if he could when it came to touching it i dont believe he would because the fact would remind him that it wasnt fair he has to realize things in the objective way before he can realize them at all thats the stage if they can have an operator climbing a real telegraphpole to tap the wire and telegraph the girl he loves that he is dead so that she can marry his rich rival and go to europe and cultivate her gift for sculpture they feel that they have got real life  louise would not be amused or laugh with her husband at this then what in the world does godolphin mean she demanded  why being interpreted out of actors parlance he means that he wishes he could talk the play over with me again and be persuaded that he is wrong about it  i must say louise remarked after a moment for mastering the philosophy of this that you take it very strangely brice  ive thought it out said maxwell  and what are you going to do  i am going to wait the turn of events my faith in godolphin is unshakensuch as it is  and what is going to be our attitude in regard to it  attitude with whom  with our friends suppose they ask us about the play and how it is getting along and my family  i dont think it will be necessary to take any attitude they can think what they like let them wait the turn of events too if we can stand it they can  no brice said his wife that wont do we might be silently patient ourselves but if we left them to believe that it was all going well we should be living a lie  what an extraordinary idea  ive told papa and mammaweve both told them though i did the talking you can saythat the play was a splendid success and godolphin was going to give it seven or eight times a week and now if its a failure  it isnt a failure maxwell retorted as if hurt by the notion  no matter if hes only going to play it once a fortnight or so and is going to tinker it up to suit himself without saying byyourleave to you i say were occupying a false position and thats what i mean by living a lie  maxwell looked at her in that bewilderment which he was beginning to feel at the contradictions of her character she sometimes told outright little fibs which astonished him society fibs she did not mind at all but when it came to peoples erroneously inferring this or that from her actions she had a yearning for the explicit truth that nothing else could appease he on the contrary was indifferent to what people thought if he had not openly misled them let them think this or let them think that it was altogether their affair and he did not hold himself responsible but he was ill at ease with any conventional lie on his conscience he hated to have his wife say to people as he sometimes overheard her saying that he was out when she knew he had run upstairs with his writing to escape them she contended that it was no harm since it deceived nobody  now he said arent you rather unnecessarily complex  no im not and i shall tell papa as soon as i see him just how the case stands why it would be dreadful if we let him believe it was all going well and perhaps tell others that it was and we knew all the time that it wasnt he would hate that and he wouldnt like us for letting him  hadnt you better give the thing a chance to go right there hasnt been time yet  no dearest i feel that since ive bragged so to papa i ought to eat humblepie before him as soon as possible  yes why should you make me eat it too  i cant help that i would if i could but unfortunately we are one  and you seem to be the one suppose i should ask you not to eat humblepie before your father  then of course i should do as you asked but i hope you wont  maxwell did not say anything and she went on tenderly entreatingly and i hope youll never allow me to deceive myself about anything you do i should resent it a great deal more than if you had positively deceived me will you promise me if anything sad or bad happens that you dont want me to know because it will make me unhappy or disagreeable youll tell me at once  it wont be necessary youll find it out  no do be serious dearest i am very serious will you  what is the use of asking such a thing as that it seems to me that ive invited you to a full share of the shame and sorrow that godolphin has brought upon me  yes you have said louise thoughtfully and you may be sure that i appreciate it dont you like to have me share it  well i dont know i might like to get at it first myself  ah you didnt like my opening godolphins letter when it came  i shouldnt mind now if you would answer it  i shall be only too glad to answer it if you will let me answer it as it deserves  that needs reflection     x   the weather grew rough early in september and all at once all in a moment as it were the pretty wateringplace lost its air of summer gayety the sky had an inner gray in its blue the sea looked cold a few hardy bathers braved it out on select days in the surf but they were purple and red when they ran up to the bathhouses and they came out wrinkled and hurried to their hotels where there began to be a smell of steamheat and a snapping of radiators in the halls the barges went away laden to the stations and came back empty except at night when they brought over the few and fewer husbands whose wives were staying down simply because they hated to go up and begin the social life of the winter the people who had thronged the grassybordered paths of the village dwindled in number the riding and driving on the roads was less and less the native life showed itself more in the sparsity of the sojourners the sweet fern in the open fields and the brakes and blackberryvines among the bowlders were blighted with the cold wind even the seaweed swaying at the foot of the rocks seemed to feel a sharper chill than that of the brine a storm came and strewed the beach with kelp and blew over half the bathhouses and then the hardiest lingerer ceased to talk of staying through october there began to be rumors at the maxwells hotel that it would close before the month was out some ladies pressed the landlord for the truth and he confessed that he expected to shut the house by the 25th this spread dismay but certain of the boarders said they would go to the other hotels which were to keep open till october the dependent cottages had been mostly emptied before those who remained in them if they did not go away came into the hotel the maxwells themselves did this at last for the sake of the warmth and the human companionship around the blazing hearthfires in the parlors they got a room with a stove in it so that he could write and there was a pensive fleeting coziness in it all with the shrinking numbers in the vast diningroom grouped at two or three tables for dinner and then gathered in the light of the evening lamps over the evening papers in these conditions there came if not friendship an intensification of acquaintance such as is imaginable of a company of cultured castaways ladies who were not quite socially certain of one another in town gossiped fearlessly together there was whist among the men more than once it happened that a young girl played or sang by request and not as so often happens where a hotel is full against the general desire it came once to a wish that mr maxwell would read something from his play but no one had the courage to ask him in society he was rather severe with women and his wife was not sorry for that she made herself all the more approachable because of it but she discouraged the hope of anything like reading from him she even feigned that he might not like to do it without consulting mr godolphin and if she did not live a lie concerning the status of his play she did not scruple to tell one now and then  that is she would say it was going beyond their expectations and this was not so fabulous as it might seem for their expectations were not so high as they had been and godolphin was really playing the piece once or twice a week they heard no more from him by letter for maxwell had decided that it would be better not to answer his missive from midland but he was pretty faithful in sending the newspaper notices whenever he played and so they knew that he had not abandoned it they did not know whether he had carried out his threat of overhauling it and maxwell chose to remain in ignorance of the fact till godolphin himself should speak again unless he demanded the play back he was really helpless and he was not ready to do that for he hoped that when the actor brought it on to new york he could talk with him about it and come to some understanding he had not his wifes belief in the perfection of the piece it might very well have proved weak in places and after his first indignation at the notion of godolphins revising it he was willing to do what he could to meet his wishes he did not so much care what shape it had in these remote theatres of the west the real test was new york and there it should appear only as he wished  it was a comfort to his wife when he took this stand and she vowed him to keep it she would have made him go down on his knees and hold up his right hand which was her notion of the way an oath was taken in court but she did not think he would do it and he might refuse to seal any vow at all if she urged it  in the meanwhile she was not without other consolations at her insistence he wrote to the newspaper which had printed the ibsen cranks article on the play and said how much pleasure it had given him and begged his thanks to the author they got a very pretty letter back from him adding some praises of the piece which he said he had kept out of print because he did not want to seem too gushing about it and he ventured some wary censures of the acting which he said he had preferred not to criticise openly since the drama was far more important to him than the theatre he believed that mr godolphin had a perfect conception of the part of haxard and a thorough respect for the piece but his training had been altogether in the romantic school he was working out of it but he was not able at once to simplify himself this was in fact the fault of the whole company the girl who did salome had moments of charming reality but she too suffered from her tradition and the rest went from bad to worse he thought that they would all do better as they familiarized themselves with the piece and he deeply regretted that mr godolphin had been able to give it only once in midland  at this mrs maxwells wounds inwardly bled afresh and she came little short of bedewing the kind letter with her tears she made maxwell answer it at once and she would not let him deprecate the writers worship of him as the first american dramatist to attempt something in the spirit of the great modern masters abroad she contended that it would be as false to refuse this tribute as to accept one that was not due him and there could be no doubt but it was fully and richly merited the critic wrote again in response to maxwell and they exchanged three or four letters  what was even more to louise was the admirable behavior of her father when she went to eat humblepie before him he laughed at the notion of godolphins meddling with the play and scolded her for not taking her husbands view of the case which he found entirely reasonable and the only reasonable view of it he argued that godolphin simply chose to assert in that way a claim to joint authorship which he had all along probably believed he had and he approved of maxwells letting him have his head in the matter so far as the west was concerned if he attempted to give it with any alterations of his own in the east there would be time enough to stop him louise seized the occasion to confirm herself in her faith that her father admired maxwells genius as much as she did herself and she tried to remember just the words he used in praising it so that she could repeat them to maxwell she also committed to memory his declaration that the very fact of godolphins playing the piece every now and then was proof positive that he would be very reluctant to part with it if it came to that this seemed to her very important and she could hardly put up with maxwells sardonic doubt of it  before they left magnolia there came a letter from godolphin himself wholly different in tone from his earlier letter he said nothing now of overhauling the piece which he felt was gradually making its way he was playing it at various onenight stands in the northwest preparatory to bringing it to chicago and putting it on for a week and he asked if maxwell could not come out and see it there he believed they were all gradually getting down to it and the authors presence at the rehearsals would be invaluable he felt more and more that they had a fortune in it and it only needed careful working to realize a bonanza he renewed his promises in view of his success so far to play it exclusively if the triumph could be clinched by a weeks run in such a place as chicago he wrote from grand rapids and asked maxwell to reply to him at oshkosh  tell him youll come of course said his wife  maxwell shook his head he doesnt mean this any more than he meant to revise the thing himself he probably finds that he cant do that and wants me to do it but if i did it he might take it off after the first night in chicago if the notices were unfavorable  but they wont be she argued i know they wont  i should simply break him up from the form hes got into if i went to the rehearsals he must keep on doing it in his own way till he comes to new york  but think of the effect it will have in new york if you should happen to make it go in chicago  it wont have the slightest effect when he brings it east it will have to make its way just as if it had never been played anywhere before  a bright thought occurred to louise then tell him that if he will bring it on to boston you will superintend all the rehearsals and i will go with you to them  maxwell only laughed at this boston wouldnt serve any better than chicago as far as new york is concerned we shall have to build a success from the ground up there if we get one it might run a whole winter in boston and then we should probably begin with half a house in new york or a third the only advantage of trying it anywhere before is that the actors will be warm in their parts besides do you suppose godolphin could get a theatre in boston out of the order of his engagement there next spring  why not  simply because every night at every house is taken six months beforehand  who would ever have dreamt said louise ruefully that simply writing a play would involve any one in all these exasperating business details  nobody can get free of business maxwell returned  then i will tell you she brightened up to say why not sell him the piece outright and wash your hands of it  because he wouldnt buy it outright and if i washed my hands of it he could do what he pleased with it if he couldnt tinker it up himself he could hire some one else to do it and that would be worse yet  well then the only thing for us to do is to go on to new york and wait there till godolphin comes i suppose papa and mamma would like to have us stay through october with them in boston but i dont see much sense in that and i dont choose to have the air of living on them i want to present an unbroken front of independence from the beginning as far as inquiring friends are concerned and in new york we shall be so lost to sight that nobody will know how we are living you can work at your new play while were waiting and we can feel that the onset in the battle of life has sounded  maxwell laughed as she meant him at the mock heroics of her phrase and she pulled off his hat and rubbed his hair round on his skull in exultation at having arrived at some clear understanding i wouldnt have hair like silk she jeered  and i wouldnt have hair like cornsilk he returned at least not on my own head  yes it is coarse and its yours quite as much as mine she said thoughtfully we do belong to each other utterly dont we i never thought of it in that light before and now our life has gone into your work already i cant tell you brice how sweet it is to think of that lovebusiness being our own i shall be so proud of it on the stage but as long as we live no one but ourselves must know anything about it do you suppose they will she asked in sudden dismay  he smiled should you care  she reflected a moment no she shouted boldly what difference  godolphin would pay any sum for the privilege of using the fact as an advertisement if he could put it into pinneys hands and give him carte blanche to work in all the romance he liked  brice she shrieked  well we neednt give it away and if we dont nobody else will  no and we must always keep it sacredly secret promise me one thing  twenty  that you will let me hold your hand all through the first performance of that part will you  why we shall be set up like two brazen images in a box for all the firstnighters to stare at and the society reporters to describe what would society journalism say to your holding my hand throughout the tender passages it would be onto something personal in them in an instant  no now i will show you how we will do they were sitting in a nook of the rocks in the pallor of the late september sunshine with their backs against a warm bowlder now give me your hand  why youve got hold of it already  oh yes so i have well ill just grasp it in mine firmly and let them both rest on your knee so and fling the edge of whatever im wearing on my shoulders over them or my mantle if its hanging on the back of the chair soshe flung the edge of her shawl over their clasped hands to illustrateand nobody will suspect the least thing suppose the sea was the audiencea sea of faces you know would any one dream down there that i was squeezing your hand at all the important moments or you squeezing mine  i hope they wouldnt think me capable of doing anything so indelicate as squeezing a ladys hand said maxwell i dont know what they might think of you though if there was any such elaborate display of concealment as youve got up here  oh this is merely rehearsing of course i shall be more adroit more careless when i really come to it but what i mean is that when we first see it together the lovebusiness i shall want to feel that you are feeling every instant just as i do will you  i dont see any great objection to that we shall both be feeling very anxious about the play if thats what you mean  thats what i mean in one sense louise allowed shant you be very anxious to see how they have imagined salome and atland  not so anxious as about how godolphin has created haxard  i care nothing about that but if the woman who does me is vulgar or underbred or the least bit coarse and doesnt keep the character just as sweet and delicate as you imagined it i dont know what i shall do to her  nothing violent i hope maxwell suggested languidly  i am not so sure said louise its a dreadfully intimate affair with me and if i didnt like it i should hiss anyway  maxwell laughed long and loud what a delightful thing that would be for society journalism at one point the wife of the author was apparently unable to control her emotions and she was heard to express her disapprobation by a prolonged sibilation all eyes were turned upon the box where she sat with her husband their hands clasped under the edge of her mantle no you mustnt hiss my dear but if you find salome getting too much for you you can throw a dynamite bomb at the young woman who is doing her i dare say we shall want to blow up the whole theatre before the play is over  oh i dont believe we shall i know the piece will go splendidly if the lovebusiness is well done but you can understand cant you just how i feel about salome  i think i can and i am perfectly sure that you will be bitterly disappointed in her no matter how shes done unless you do her yourself  i wish i could  then the other people might be disappointed     xi   the maxwells went to new york early in october and took a little furnished flat for the winter on the west side between two streets among the eighties it was in a new apartmenthouse rather fine on the outside and its balconies leaned caressingly towards the tracks of the elevated road whose trains steamed back and forth under them night and day at first they thought it rather noisy but their young nerves were strong and they soon ceased to take note of the uproar even when the windows were open  the weather was charming as the weather of the new york october is apt to be the month proved much milder than september had been at magnolia they were not very far from central park and they went for whole afternoons into it they came to have such a sense of ownership in one of the seats in the ramble that they felt aggrieved when they found anybody had taken it and they resented other peoples intimacy with the squirrels which louise always took a pocketful of nuts to feed the squirrels got a habit of climbing into her lap for them sometimes maxwell hired a boat and rowed her lazily about on the lake while he mused and she talked sometimes to be very lavish they took places in the public carriage which plied on the drives of the park and went up to the tennisgrounds beyond the reservoirs and watched the players or the artstudents sketching the autumn scenery there they began to know without acquaintance certain attached or semiattached couples and no doubt they passed with these for lovers themselves though they felt a vast superiority to them in virtue of their married experience they looked upon them though the people were sometimes their elders as very young things who were in the right way but were as yet deplorably ignorant how happy they were going to be they almost always walked back from these drives and it was not so far but they could walk over to the north river for the sunset before their dinner which they had late when they did that and earlier when they did not do it dinner was rather a matter of caprice with them sometimes they dined at a french or italian table dhôte sometimes they foraged for it before they came in from their sunset or their afternoon in the park when dinner consisted mainly of a steak or chops with one of the delicious salads their avenue abounded in and some improvisation of potatoes and coffee afterward it was very easy to get it up in half an hour they kept one maid who called herself a swedens girl and louise cooked some of the things herself she did not cook them so well as the maid but maxwell never knew what he was eating and he thought it all alike good  in their simple circumstances louise never missed the affluence that had flattered her whole life in her fathers house it seemed to her as if she had not lived before her marriageas if she had always lived as she did now she made the most of her housekeeping but there was not a great deal of that at the most she knew some new york people but it was too early yet for them to be back to town and besides she doubted if she should let them know where she was for society afflicted maxwell and she could not care for it unless he did she did not wish to do anything as yet or be anything apart from him she was timid about going into the street without him she wished to be always with him and always talking to him but it soon came to his imploring her not to talk when she was in the room where he was writing and he often came to the table so distraught that the meal might have passed without a word but for her  he valued her all she could possibly have desired in relation to his work and he showed her how absolutely he rested upon her sympathy if not her judgment in it he submitted everything to her and forbore and changed and amended and wrote and rewrote at her will or when he revolted and wrote on in defiance of her he was apt to tear the work up he destroyed a good deal of good literature in this way and more than once it happened that she had tacitly changed her mind and was of his way of thinking when it was too late in view of such a chance she made him promise that he would always show her what he had written even when he had written wholly against her taste and wish he was not to let his pride keep him from doing this though as a general thing she took a good deal of pride in his pride having none herself as she believed whether she had or not she was very wilful and rather prepotent but she never bore malice as the phrase is when she got the worst of anything though she might have been quite to blame she had in all things a high ideal of conduct which she expected her husband to live up to when she was the prey of adverse circumstances at other times she did her share of the common endeavor  all through the month of october he worked at the new play and from time to time they heard from the old play which godolphin was still giving here and there in the west he had not made any reply to maxwells letter of regret that he could not come to the rehearsals at chicago but he sent the notices marked in the newspapers at the various points where he played and the maxwells contented themselves as they could with these proofs of an unbroken amity they expected something more direct and explicit from him when he should get to chicago where his engagement was to begin the first week in november in the meantime the kind of life they were living had not that stressful unreality for louise that it had for maxwell on the economic side for the first time his regular and serious habits of work did not mean the earning of money but only the chance of earning money ever since he had begun the world for himself and he had begun it very early there had been some income from his industry however little it was it was certain the salary was there for him at the end of the week when he went to the cashiers desk his mother and he had both done so well and so wisely in their several ways of taking care of themselves that maxwell had not only been able to live on his earnings but he had been able to save out of them the thousand dollars which louise bragged of to her father and it was this store which they were now consuming not rapidly indeed but steadily and with no immediate return in money to repair the waste the fact kept maxwell wakeful at night sometimes and by day he shuddered inwardly at the shrinkage of his savings so much swifter than their growth though he was generously abetted by louise in using them with frugality she could always have had money from her father but this was something that maxwell would not look forward to there could be no real anxiety for them in the situation but for maxwell there was care he might be going to get a great deal out of the play he was now writing but as yet it was in no form to show to a manager or an actor and he might be going to get a great deal out of his old play but so far godolphin had made no sign that he remembered one of the most essential of the obligations which seemed all to rest so lightly upon him maxwell hated to remind him of it and in the end he was very glad that he never did or that he had not betrayed the slightest misgiving of his good faith  one morning near the end of the month when he was lower in his spirits than usual from this cause there came a letter from the editor of the boston abstract asking him if he could not write a weekly letter from new york for his old newspaper it was a temptation and maxwell found it a hardship that his wife should have gone out just then to do the marketing for the day she considered this the duty of a wife and she fulfilled it often enough to keep her sense of it alive but she much preferred to forage with him in the afternoon that was poetry she said and the other was prose he would have liked to talk the proposition over with her to realize the compliment while it was fresh to grumble at it a little and to be supported in his notion that it would be bad business just then for him to undertake a task that might draw him away from his play too much to do the latter well would take a great deal of time yet he did not feel quite that he ought to refuse it in view of the uncertainties of the future and it might even be useful to hold the position aside from the money it would bring him the new york correspondent of the boston abstract might have a claim upon the attention of the managers which a wholly unaccredited playwright could not urge there was no question of their favor with maxwell he would disdain to have that even if he could get it except by the excellence or at least the availability of his work  louise did not come in until much later than usual and then she came in looking very excited well my dear she began to call out to him as soon as the door was opened for her i have seen that woman again  what woman he asked  you know that smoulderingeyed thing in the bathingdress she added in answer to his stupefied gaze i dont mean that she was in the bathingdress still but her eyes were smouldering away just as they were that day on the beach at magnolia  oh said maxwell indifferently where did you see her  on the avenue and i know she lives in the neighborhood somewhere because she was shopping here on the avenue and i could have easily followed her home if she had not taken the elevated for down town  why didnt you take it too it might have been a long way round but it would have been certain ive been wanting you here badly just tell me what you think of that  he gave her the editors letter and she hastily ran it through i wouldnt think of it for a moment she said were there any letters for me  it isnt a thing to be dismissed without reflection he began  i thought you wanted to devote yourself entirely to the drama  of course  and youve always said there was nothing so killing to creative work as any sort of journalism  this wouldnt take more than a day or two each week and twentyfive dollars a letter would be convenient while we are waiting for our cards to turn up  oh very well if you are so fickle as all that i dont know what to say to you she put the letter down on the table before him and went out of the room  he tried to write but with the hurt of what he felt her unkindness he could not and after a certain time he feigned an errand into their room where she had shut herself from him and found her lying down are you sick he asked coldly  not at all she answered i suppose one may lie down without being sick as you call it i should say ill myself  im so glad youre not sick that i dont care what you call it  he was going out when she spoke again i didnt know you cared particularly you are always so much taken up with your work i suppose if you wrote those letters for the abstract you need never think of me at all whether i was ill or well  you would take care to remind me of your existence from time to time i dare say you havent the habit of suffering in silence a great deal  you would like it better of course if i had  a great deal better my dear but i didnt know that you regarded my work as selfindulgence altogether i have flattered myself now and then that i was doing it for you too  oh yes very likely but if you had never seen me you would be doing it all the same  im afraid so i seem to have been made that way im sorry you dont approve i supposed you did once  oh i do approvehighly he left her and she heard him getting his hat and stick in the little hallway as if he were going out of doors she called to him what i wonder is how a man so selfcentred that he cant look at his wife for days together can tell whether another womans eyes are smouldering or not  maxwell paused with his hand on the knob as if he were going to make some retort but perhaps because he could think of none he went out without speaking  he stayed away all the forenoon walking down the river along the squalid waterside avenues he found them in sympathy with the squalor in himself which always followed a squabble with his wife at the end of one of the westward streets he found himself on a pier flanked by vast flotillas of canalboats as he passed one of these he heard the sound of furious bickering within and while he halted a man burst from the gangway and sprang ashore followed by the threats and curses of a woman who put her head out of the hatch to launch them after him  the incident turned maxwell faint he perceived that the case of this unhappy man who tried to walk out of earshot with dignity was his own in quality if not in quantity he felt the shame of their human identity and he reached home with his teeth set in a hard resolve to bear and forbear in all things thereafter rather than share ever again in misery like that which dishonored his wife even more than it dishonored him at the same time he was glad of a thought the whole affair suggested to him and he wondered whether he could get a play out of it this was the notion of showing the evil eventuation of good their tiffs came out of their love for each other and no other quarrels could have the bitterness that these got from the very innermost sweetness of life it would be hard to show this dramatically but if it could be done the success would be worth all the toil it would cost  at his door he realized with a pang that he could not submit the notion to his wife now and perhaps never but the door was pulled open before he could turn his latchkey in the lock and louise threw her arms round his neck  oh dearest guess she commanded between her kisses  guess what he asked walking her into the parlor with his arms round her she kept her hands behind her when he released her and they stood confronted  what should you consider the best newsor not news exactly the best thingin the world  why i dont know has the play been a great success in chicago  better than that she shouted and she brought an open letter from behind her and flourished it before him while she went on breathlessly its from godolphin and of course i opened it at once for i thought if there was anything worrying in it i had better find it out while you were gone and prepare you for it hes sent you a check for 300twelve performances of the playand hes written you the sweetest letter in the world and i take back everything i ever said against him here shall i read it or no youll want to read it yourself now sit down at your desk and ill put it before you with the check on top  she pushed him into his chair and he obediently read the check first and then took up the letter it was dated at chicago and was written with a certain histrionic consciousness as if godolphin enjoyed the pose of a rising young actor paying over to the author his share of the profits of their joint enterprise in their play there was a list of the dates and places of the performances which maxwell noted were chiefly matinées and he argued a distrust of the piece from this fact which godolphin did not otherwise betray he said that the play constantly grew upon him and that with such revision as they should be able to give it together when he reached new york they would have one of the greatest plays of the modern stage he had found that wherever he gave it the better part of his audience was best pleased with it and he felt sure that when he put it on for a run the houses would grow up to it in every way he was going to test it for a week in chicago there was no reference to his wish that maxwell should have been present at the rehearsals there but otherwise godolphins letter was as candid as it was cordial  maxwell read it with a silent joy which seemed to please his wife as well as if he had joined her in rioting over it she had kept the lunch warm for him and now she brought it in from the kitchen herself and set it before him talking all the time  well now we can regard it as an accomplished fact and i shall not allow you to feel any anxiety about it from this time forward i consider that godolphin has done his whole duty by it he has kept the spirit of his promises if he hasnt the letter and from this time forward i am going to trust him implicitly and im going to make you no more question of godolphin in this family dont you long to know how it goes in chicago but i dont really care for as you say that wont have the slightest influence in new york and i know it will go here anyway yes i consider it from this time on an assured success and isnt it delightful that as godolphin says its such a favorite with refined people she went on a good while to this effect but when she had talked herself out maxwell had still said so little that she asked what is it brice  do you think we deserve it he returned seriously  for squabbling so why i suppose i was tired and overwrought or i shouldnt have done it  and i hadnt even that excuse said maxwell  oh yes you had she retorted i provoked you and if any one was to blame i was do you mind it so much  yes it tears my heart and it makes me feel so low and mean  oh how good you are she began but he stopped her  dont im not good and i dont deserve success i dont feel as if this belonged to me i ought to send godolphins check back in common honesty common decency he told of the quarrel he had witnessed on the canalboat and she loved him for his simplehearted humility but she said there was nothing parallel in the cases and she would not let him think so that it was morbid and showed he had been overworking  and now she went on you must write to mr ricker at once and thank him and tell him you cant do the letters for him will you  ill see  you must i want you to reserve your whole strength for the drama thats your true vocation and it would be a sin for you to turn to the right or left he continued silent and she went on are you still thinking about our scrap this morning well then ill promise never to begin it again will that do  oh i dont know that you began it and i wasnt thinkingi was thinking of an idea for a playthe eventuation of good in evillove evolving in hate  that will be grand if you can work it out and now you see dont you that there is some use in squabbling even  i suppose nothing is lost said maxwell he took out his pocketbook and folded godolphins check into it     xii   a week later there came another letter from godolphin it was very civil and in its general text it did not bear out the promise of severity in its change of address to dear sir from the dear mr maxwell of the earlier date  it conveyed in as kindly terms as could have been asked a fact which no terms could have flattered into acceptability  godolphin wrote after trying the play two nights and a matinée in chicago to tell the author that he had withdrawn it because its failure had not been a failure in the usual sense but had been a grievous collapse which left him no hopes that it would revive in the public favor if it were kept on maxwell would be able to judge he said from the newspapers he sent of the view the critics had taken of the piece but this would not have mattered at all if it had not been the view of the public too he said he would not pain maxwell by repeating the opinions which he had borne the brunt of alone but they were such as to satisfy him fully and finally that he had been mistaken in supposing there was a part for him in the piece he begged to return it to maxwell and he ventured to send his promptbook with the original manuscript which might facilitate his getting the play into other hands  the parcel was brought in by express while they were sitting in the dismay caused by the letter and took from them the hope that godolphin might have written from a mood and changed his mind before sending back the piece neither of them had the nerve to open the parcel which lay upon maxwells desk very much sealed and tied and labelled diffusing a faint smell of horses as express packages mostly do through the room  maxwell found strength if not heart to speak first i suppose i am to blame for not going to chicago for the rehearsals louise said she did not see what that could have done to keep the play from failing and he answered that it might have kept godolphin from losing courage you see he says he had to take the brunt of public opinion alone he was sore about that  oh well if he is so weak as that and would have had to be bolstered up all along you are well rid of him  i am certainly rid of him maxwell partially assented and they both lapsed into silence again even louise could not talk they were as if stunned by the blow that had fallen on them as all such blows fall when it was least expected and it seemed to the victims as if they were least able to bear it in fact it was a cruel reverse from the happiness they had enjoyed since godolphins check came and although maxwell had said that they must not count upon anything from him except from hour to hour his words conveyed a doubt that he felt no more than louise now his gloomy wisdom was justified by a perfidy which she could paint in no colors that seemed black enough perhaps the want of these was what kept her mute at first even when she began to talk she could only express her disdain by urging her husband to send back godolphins check to him we want nothing more to do with such a man if he felt no obligation to keep faith with you its the same as if he had sent that money out of charity  yes i have thought of that said maxwell but i guess i shall keep the money he may regard the whole transaction as childs play but i dont and i never did i worked very hard on the piece and at the rates for spacework merely i earned his money and a great deal more if i can ever do anything with it i shall be only too glad to give him his three hundred dollars again  she could see that he had already gathered spirit for new endeavor with the play and her heart yearned upon him in pride and fondness oh you dear what do you intend to do next  i shall try the managers  brice she cried in utter admiration  he rose and said as he took up the express package and gave godolphins letter a contemptuous push with his hand you can gather up this spilt milk put it away somewhere i dont want to see it or think of it again he cut open the package and found the promptbook which he laid aside while he looked to see if his own copy of the play were all there  you are going to begin at once gasped louise  this instant he said it will be slow enough work at the best and we mustnt lose time i shall probably have to go the rounds of all the managers but i am not going to stop till i have gone the rounds i shall begin with the highest and i shant stop till i reach the lowest  but when how you havent thought it out  yes i have i have been thinking it out ever since i got the play into godolphins hands i havent been at peace about him since that day when he renounced me in magnolia and certainly till we got his check there has been nothing in his performance to restore my confidence come now louise you mustnt stop me dear he said for she was beginning to cling about him i shall be back for lunch and then we can talk over what i have begun to do if i began to talk of it before i should lose all heart for it kiss me good luck  she kissed him enough for all the luck in the world and then he got himself out of her arms while she still hardly knew what to make of it all he was halfway down the housestairs when her eye fell on the promptbook she caught it up and ran out upon the landing and screamed down after him brice brice youve forgotten something  he came flying back breathless and she held the book out to him oh i dont want that he panted it would damage the play with a manager to know that godolphin had rejected it  but do you think it would be quite rightquite frankto let him take it without telling him  it will be right to show it him without telling him it will be time enough to tell him if he likes it  that is true she assented and then she kissed him again and let him go he stood a step below her and she had to stoop a good deal but she went in doors looking up to him as if he were a whole flight of steps above her and saying to herself that he had always been so good and wise that she must now simply trust him in everything  louise still had it on her conscience to offer maxwell reparation for the wrong she thought she had done him when she had once decided that he was too selfseeking and selfcentred and had potentially rejected him on that ground the first thing she did after they became engaged was to confess the wrong and give him a chance to cast her off if he wished but this never seemed quite reparation enough perhaps because he laughed and said that she was perfectly right about him and must take him with those faults or not at all she now entered upon a long delightful review of his behavior ever since that moment and she found that although he was certainly as selfcentred as she had ever thought or he had owned himself to be selfseeking he was not in any mean or greedy sense she perceived that his selfseeking now at least was as much for her sake as his own and that it was really after all not selfseeking but the helpless pursuit of aims which he was born into the world to achieve she had seen that he did not stoop to achieve them but had as haughty a disdain of any but the highest means as she could have wished him to have and much haughtier than she could have had in his place if he forgot her in them he forgot himself quite as much and they were equal before his ambition in fact this seemed to her even more her charge than his and if he did not succeed as with his genius he had a right to succeed it would be constructively her fault and at any rate she should hold herself to blame for it there would be some satisfaction in that she thought with tender pathos how hard he worked and was at his writing all day long except when she made him go out with her and was then often so fagged that he could scarcely speak she was proud of his almost killing himself at it but she must study more and more not to let him kill himself and must do everything that was humanly possible to keep up his spirits when he met with a reverse  she accused herself with shame of having done nothing for him in the present emergency but rather flung upon him the burden of her own disappointment she thought how valiantly he had risen up under it and had not lost one moment in vain repining how instantly he had collected himself for a new effort and taken his measures with a wise prevision that omitted no detail in view of all this she peremptorily forbade herself to be uneasy at the little reticence he was practising with regard to godolphins having rejected his play and imagined the splendor he could put on with the manager after he had accepted it in telling him its history and releasing him if he would from his agreement she imagined the manager generously saying this made no difference whatever though he appreciated mr maxwells candor in the matter and should be all the happier to make a success of it because godolphin had failed with it  but she returned from this flight into the future and her husbands part in it to the present and her own first duty in regard to him and it appeared to her that this was to look carefully after his health in the strain put upon it and to nourish him for the struggle before him it was to be not with one manager only but many managers probably and possibly with all the managers in new york that was what he had said it would be before he gave up and she remembered how flushed and excited he looked when he said it and though she did not believe he would get back for lunchthe manager might ask him to read his play to him so that he could get just the authors notionshe tried to think out the very most nourishing lunch she could for him oysters were in season and they were very nourishing but they had already had them for breakfast and beefsteak was very good but he hated it perhaps chops would do or better still mushrooms on toast only they were not in the market at that time of year she dismissed a stewed squab and questioned a sweetbread and wondered if there were not some kind of game in the end she decided to leave it to the provision man and she lost no time after she reached her decision in going out to consult him he was a bland soothing german and it was a pleasure to talk with him because he brought her married name into every sentence and said no mrs maxwell yes mrs maxwell i send it right in mrs maxwell she went over his whole list of provisions with him and let him persuade her that a small fillet was the best she could offer a person whose frame needed nourishing while at the same time his appetite needed coaxing she allowed him to add a can of mushrooms as the right thing to go with it and some salad and then while he put the order up she stood reproaching herself for it since it formed no fit lunch and was both expensive and commonplace  she was roused from her daze when she was going to countermand the whole stupid order by the mans saying what can i do for you this morning mrs harley and she turned round to find at her elbow the smoulderingeyed woman of the bathingbeach she lifted her heavy lids and gave louise a dull glance which she let a sudden recognition burn through for a moment and then quenched but in that moment the two women sealed a dislike that had been merely potential before their look said for each that the other was by nature tradition and aspiration whatever was most detestable in their sex  mrs harley whoever she was under a name that louise electrically decided to be fictitious seemed unable to find her voice at first in their mutual defiance and she made a pretence of letting her strange eyes rove about the shop before she answered her presence was so repugnant to louise that she turned abruptly and hurried out of the place without returning the goodmorning which the german sent after her with the usual addition of her name she resented it now for if it was not tantamount to an introduction to that creature it was making her known to her and louise wished to have no closer acquaintance with her than their common humanity involved it seemed too odious to have been again made aware that they were inhabitants of the same planet and the anger that heaved within her went out in a wild flash of resentment towards her husband for having forever fixed that woman in her consciousness with a phrase if it had not been for that she would not have thought twice of her when they first saw her and she would not have known her when they met again and at the worst would merely have been harassed with a vague resemblance which would never have been verified  she had climbed the stairs to their apartment on the fourth floor when she felt the need to see more know more of this hateful being so strong upon her that she stopped with her latchkey in her door and went down again she did not formulate her intention but she meant to hurry back to the provision store with the pretext of changing her order and follow the woman wherever she went until she found out where she lived and she did not feel as a man would the disgrace of dogging her steps in that way so much as she felt a fatal dread of her if she should be gone by the time louise got back to the shop she would ask the provision man about her and find out in that way she stayed a little while to rehearse the terms of her inquiry and while she lingered the woman herself came round the corner of the avenue and mounted the steps where louise stood and with an air of custom went on upstairs to the second floor where louise heard her putting a latchkey into the door which then closed after her     xiii   maxwell went to a manager whom he had once met in boston where they had been apparently acceptable to each other in a long talk they had about the drama the manager showed himself a shrewd and rather remorseless man of business in all that he said of the theatre but he spoke as generously and reverently of the drama as maxwell felt and they parted with a laughing promise to do something for it yet in fact if it had not been for the chances that threw him into godolphins hand afterwards he would have gone to this manager with his play in the first place and he went to him now as soon as he was out of godolphins hands not merely because he was the only manager he knew in the city but because he believed in him as much as his rather sceptical temper permitted him to believe in any one and because he believed he would give him at least an intelligent audience  the man in the boxoffice where he stood in the glow of an electric light at midday recovered himself from the disappointment he suffered when maxwell asked for the manager instead of a seat for the nights performance he owned that the manager was in his room but said he was very much engaged and he was hardly moved from this conviction by maxwells urgence that he should send in his card perhaps something in maxwells tone and face as of authority prevailed with him perhaps it was the title of the boston abstract which maxwell wrote under his name to recall himself better to the managers memory the answer was a good while getting back people came in and bought tickets and went away while maxwell hung about the vestibule of the theatre and studied the bill of the play which formed its present attraction but at last the man in the boxoffice put his face sidewise to the semicircular opening above the glassframed plan of seats and after he had identified maxwell said mr grayson would like to see you at the same time the swinging doors of the theatre opened and a young man came out to whom the other added indicating maxwell this is the gentleman and the young man held the door open for him to pass in and then went swiftly before him into the theatre and led the way around the orchestra circle to a little door that opened in the wall beside one of the boxes there was a rehearsal going on in the glare of some grouped incandescent bulbs on the stage and people moving about in top hats and bonnets and other everyday outside gear which maxwell lost sight of in his progress through the wings and past a rough brick wall before he arrived at another door down some winding stairs in the depths of the building his guide knocked at it and when an answering voice said come in he left maxwell to go in alone the manager had risen from his chair at his table and stood holding out his hand with a smile of kindly enough welcome he said ive just made you out mr maxwell do you come as a friendly interviewer or as a deadly dramatist  as both or as neither whichever you like said maxwell and he gladly took the managers hand and then took the chair which he cleared of some promptbooks for him to sit down in  i hadnt forgotten the pleasant talk i had with you in boston you see the manager began again but i had forgotten whom i had it with  i cant say i had even done that maxwell answered and this seemed to please the manager  well that counts you one he said you noticed that we have put on engaged weve made a failure of the piece we began with its several pieces now couldnt you do something like engaged  i wish i could but im afraid gilbert is the only man living who can do anything like engaged my hand is too heavy for that kind  well the heavy hand is not so bad if it hits hard enough said the manager who had a face of lively intelligence and an air of wary kindliness he looked fifty but this was partly the effect of overwork there was something of the jew something of the irishman in his visage but he was neither he was a yankee from maine with a boston training in his business what have you got he asked for maxwells play was evident  something ive been at work on for a year more or less maxwell sketched the plot of his play and the manager seemed interested  rather ibsenish isnt it he suggested at the end  the time had passed with maxwell when he wished to have this said of his play not because he did not admire ibsen but because he preferred the recognition of the original quality of his work i dont know that it is very perhapsif one didnt like it  oh i dont know that i should dislike it for its ibsenism the time of that sort of thing may be coming you never can be sure in this business when the time of anything is coming ive always thought that a naturalized ibsenism wouldnt be so bad for our stage you dont want to be quite so bleak you know as the real norwegian ibsen  ive tried not to be very bleak because i thought it wasnt in the scheme said maxwell  i dont understand that it ends well  unless you consider the implicated marriage of the young people a good ending haxard himself of course is past all surgery but the thing isnt pessimistic as i understand for its doctrine is that harm comes only from doing wrong  the manager laughed oh the average public would consider that very pessimistic they want no harm to come even from doing wrong they want the drama to get round it somehow if you could show that divine providence forgets wrongdoing altogether in certain cases you would make the fortune of your piece come why couldnt you try something of that kind it would be the greatest comfort to all the sinners in front for every last man of themor womanwould think she was the one who was going to get away  i might come up to that later said maxwell willing to take the humorous view of the matter if it would please the manager and smooth the way for the consideration of his work but more obscurely he was impatient and sorry to have found him in so philosophical a mood  the manager was like the man of any other trade he liked to talk of his business and this morning he talked of it a long time and to an effect that maxwell must have found useful if he had not been so bent upon getting to his manuscript that he had no mind for generalities at last the manager said abruptly you want me to read your play  very much maxwell answered and he promptly put the packet he had brought into the managers extended hand  he not only took it but he untied it and even glanced at the first few pages all right he said ill read it and let you hear from me as soon as i can your addressoh its on the wrapper here bytheway why shouldnt you lunch with me well go over to the players club  maxwell flushed with eager joy then he faltered  i should like to do it immensely but im afraidim afraid mrs maxwell will be waiting for me  oh all right some other time answered the manager and then maxwell was vexed that he had offered any excuse for he thought it would have been very pleasant and perhaps useful for him to lunch at the players but the manager did not urge him he only said as he led the way to the stagedoor i didnt know there was a mrs maxwell  shes happened since we met said maxwell blushing with fond pride were such a small family that we like to get together at lunch he added  oh yes i can understand that stage of it said the manager bytheway are you still connected with the abstract i noticed the name on your card  not quite in the old way but and with the words a purpose formed itself in maxwells mind theyve asked me to write their new york letter  well drop in now and then i may have something for you the manager shook hands with him cordially and maxwell opened the door and found himself in the street  he was so little conscious of the transit homeward that he seemed to find himself the next moment with louise in their little parlor he remembered afterwards that there was something strange in her manner towards him at first but before he could feel presently cognizant of it this wore off in the interest of what he had to tell  the sum of it all he ended his account of the interview with the manager is that hes taken the thing to read and that hes to let me hear from him when hes read it when that will be nobody knows and i should be the last to ask but he seemed interested in my sketch of it and he had an intelligence about it that was consoling and it was a great comfort after godolphin and godolphins pyrotechnics to have him take it in a hard business way he made no sort of promises and he held out no sort of hopes he didnt commit himself in any sort of way and he cant break his word for he hasnt given it i wish now that i had never let godolphin have the play back after he first renounced it i should have saved a great deal of time and wear and tear of feelings yes if i had taken your advice then  at this generous tribute to her wisdom all that was reluctant ceased from louises manner and behavior she put her arm around his neck and protested no no i cant let you say that brice you were right about that as you are about everything if you hadnt had this experience with godolphin you wouldnt have known how to appreciate mr graysons reception of you and you might have been unreasonable i can see now that its all been for the best and that we needed just this discipline to prepare us for prosperity but i guess godolphin will wish when he hears that mr grayson has taken your piece and is going to bring it out at the argosy here  oh good heavens do give those poor chickens a chance to get out of the shell this time my dear  well i know it vexes you and i know its silly but still i feel sure that mr grayson will take it you dont mind that do you  not if you dont say it i want you to realize that the chances are altogether against it he was civil because i think he rather liked me personally  of course he did  oh  well never mind personally  and i dont suppose it did me any harm with him to suppose that i still had a newspaper connection i put boston abstract on my cardfor purposes of identification as the editors saybecause i was writing for it when i met him in boston  oh well as long as youre not writing for it now i dont care i want you to devote yourself entirely to the drama brice  yes thats all very well but i think i shall do rickers letters for him this winter at least i was thinking of it on the way down itll be work but itll be money too and if i have something coming in i shant feel as if i were ruined every time my play gets back from a manager  mr grayson will take it  now louise if you say that you will simply drive me to despair for i shall know how you will feel when he doesnt  no i shall not feel so and you will see but if you dont let me hope for you  you know i cant stand hoping the only safe way is to look for the worst and if anything better happens it is so much pure gain if we hadnt been so eager to pin our faith to godolphin  how much better off should we have been what have we lost by it she challenged him  he broke off with a laugh we have lost the pins well hope away but remember you take the whole responsibility maxwell pulled out his watch isnt lunch nearly ready this prosperity is making me hungry and it seems about a year since breakfast  ill see whats keeping it said louise and she ran out to the kitchen with a sudden fear in her heart she knew that she had meant to countermand her order for the fillet and mushrooms and she thought that she had forgotten to order anything else for lunch she found the cook just serving it up because such a dish as that took more time than an ordinary lunch and the things had come late louise said yes she understood that and went back to maxwell whom she found walking up and down the room in a famine very uncommon for him she felt the motherly joy a woman has in being able to appease the hunger of the man she loves and now she was glad that she had not postponed the fillet till dinner as she had thought of doing everything was turning out so entirely for the best that she was beginning to experience some revival of an ancestral faith in providence in a heart individually agnostic and she was piously happy when maxwell said at sight of the lunch isnt this rather prophetic if it isnt that its telepathic i shant regret now that i didnt go with grayson to lunch at the players club  did he ask you to do that  maxwell nodded with his mouth full  a sudden misgiving smote her oh brice you ought to have gone why didnt you go  it must have been a deep subconsciousness of the fillet and mushrooms or perhaps i didnt quite like to think of your lunching alone  oh you dear faithful little soul she cried the tears came into her eyes and she ran round the table to kiss him several times on the top of his head  he kept on eating as well as he could and when she got back to her place of course it would have been a good thing for me to go to the players he teased for it would have pleased grayson and i should probably have met some other actors and managers there and made interest with them provisionally for my play if he shouldnt happen to want it  oh i know it she moaned you have ruined yourself for me im not worth it no im not now i want you to promise dearest that youll never mind me again but lunch or dine or breakfast or sup whenever anybody asks you  well i cant promise all that quite  i mean when the play is at stake  oh in that case yes  what in the world did you say to mr grayson  very much what i have said to you that i hated to leave you to lunch alone here  oh didnt he think it very silly she entreated fondly dont you think hell laugh at you for it  very likely but he wont like me the less for it men are glad of marital devotion in other men they feel that it acts as a sort of dispensation for them  you oughtnt to waste those things on me she said humbly you ought to keep them for your plays  oh theyre not wasted exactly i can use them over again i can say much better things than that with a pen in my hand  she hardly heard him she felt a keen remorse for something she had meant to do and to say when he came home now she put it far from her she thought she ought not to keep even an extinct suspicion in her heart against him and she asked brice did you know that woman was living in this house  what woman  louise was ashamed to say anything about the smouldering eyes that woman on the bathingbeach at magnoliathe one i met the other day  he said dryly she seems to be pursuing us how did you find it out  she told him and she added i think she must be an actress of some sort  very likely but i hope she wont feel obliged to call because were connected with the profession  some time afterwards louise was stitching at a centrepiece she was embroidering for the diningtable and maxwell was writing a letter for the abstract which he was going to send to the editor with a note telling him that if it were the sort of thing he wanted he would do the letters for them  after all she breathed that look of the eyes may be purely physical  what look maxwell asked from the depths of his work  she laughed in perfect content and said oh nothing but when he finished his letter and was putting it into the envelope she asked did you tell mr grayson that godolphin had returned the play  no i didnt that wasnt necessary at this stage of the proceedings  no     xiv   during the week that passed before maxwell heard from the manager concerning his play he did another letter for the abstract and with a journalistic acquaintance enlarged through certain boston men who had found places on new york papers familiarized himself with new york ways and means of getting news he visited what is called the coast a series of points where the latest intelligence grows in hotel bars and lobbies of a favorable exposure and is nurtured by clerks and barkeepers skilled in its culture and by inveterate gossips of their acquaintance but he found this sort of stuff generally telegraphed on by the associated press before he reached it and he preferred to make his letter a lively comment on events rather than a report of them the editor of the abstract seemed to prefer this too he wrote maxwell some excellent criticism and invited him to appeal to the better rather than the worse curiosity of his readers to remember that this was the principle of the abstract in its home conduct maxwell showed the letter to his wife and she approved of it all so heartily that she would have liked to answer it herself of course brice she said its you he wants more than your news any wretched reporter could give him that but you are the one man in the world who can give him your mind about it  why not say universe returned maxwell but though he mocked her he was glad to believe she was right and he was proud of her faith in him  in another way this was put to proof more than once during the week for louise seemed fated to meet mrs harley on the common stairs now when she went out or came in it was very strange that after living with her a whole month in the house and not seeing her she should now be seeing her so much mostly she was alone but sometimes she was with an elderly woman whom louise decided at one time to be her mother and at another time to be a professional companion the first time she met them together she was sure that mrs harley indicated her to the chaperon and that she remembered her from magnolia but she never looked at louise any more than louise looked at her after that  she wondered if maxwell ever met her but she was ashamed to ask him and he did not mention her only once when they were together did they happen to encounter her and then he said quite simply i think shes certainly an actress that public look of the eyes is unmistakable emotional parts i should say  louise forced herself to suggest you might get her to let you do a play for her  i doubt if i could do anything unwholesome enough for her  at last the summons they were expecting from grayson came just after they had made up their minds to wait another week for it  louise had taken the letter from the maid and she handed it to maxwell with a gasp at sight of the argosy theatre address printed in the corner of the envelope i know its a refusal  if you think that will make it an acceptance he had the hardihood to answer it wont ive tried that sort of thing too often and he tore open the letter  it was neither a refusal nor an acceptance and their hopes soared again hers visibly his secretly to find it a friendly confession that the manager had not found time to read the play until the night before and a request that maxwell would drop in any day between twelve and one which was rather a leisure time with him and talk it over  dont lose an instant dear she adjured him  its only nine oclock he answered and i shall have to lose several instants  that is so she lamented and then they began to canvas the probable intention of the managers note she held out passionately to the end for the most encouraging interpretation of it but she did not feel that it would have any malign effect upon the fact for him to say oh its just a way of letting me down easy and it clearly gave him great heart to say so  when he went off to meet his fate she watched him trembling from the window as she saw him mounting the elevated steps she wondered at his courage she had given him all her own  the manager met him with ah im glad you came soon these things fade out of ones mind so and i really want to talk about your play ive been very much interested in it  maxwell could only bow his head and murmur something about being very glad very very glad with a stupid iteration  i suppose you know as well as i do that its two plays and that its only half as good as if it were one  the manager wheeled around from his table and looked keenly at the author who contrived to say i think i know what you mean  youve got the making of the prettiest kind of little comedy in it and youve got the making of a very strong tragedy but i dont think your oil and water mix exactly said grayson  you think the interest of the lovebusiness will detract from the interest of the homicides fate  and vice versa excuse me for asking something that i can very well understand your not wanting to tell till i had read your play isnt this the piece godolphin has been trying out west  yes it is said maxwell i thought it might prejudice you against it if  oh thats all right why have you taken it from him  maxwell felt that he could make up for his want of earlier frankness now i didnt take it from him he gave it back to me  he sketched the history of his relation to the actor and the manager said with smiling relish just like him just like godolphin then he added ill tell you and you mustnt take it amiss godolphin may not know just why he gave the piece up and he probably thinks its something altogether different but you may depend upon it the trouble was your trying to ride two horses in it didnt you feel that it was a mistake yourself  i felt it so strongly at one time that i decided to develop the lovebusiness into a play by itself and let the other go for some other time my wife and i talked it over we even discussed it with godolphin he wanted to do atland but we all backed out simultaneously and went back to the play as it stood  godolphin saw he couldnt make enough of atland said the manager as if he were saying it to himself well you may be sure he feels now that the character which most appeals to the public in the play is salome  he felt that before  and he was right now i will tell you what you have got to do you have either got to separate the lovebusiness from the rest of the play and develop it into a comedy by itself  that would mean a great deal of work and i am rather sick of the whole thing  or the manager went on without minding maxwell you have got to cut the part of salome and subordinate it entirely to haxardmaxwell made a movement of impatience and refusal and the manager finishedor else you have got to treat it frankly as the leading part in the piece and get it into the hands of some leading actress  do you mean the author asked that youor any managerwould take it if that were done  grayson looked a little unhappy no that isnt what i mean exactly i mean that as it stands no manager would risk it and that as soon as an actor had read it he would see as godolphin must have seen from the start that haxard was a subordinate part what you want to do is to get it in the hands of some woman who wants to star and would take the road with it the manager expatiated at some length on the point and then he stopped and sat silent as if he had done with the subject  maxwell perceived that the time had come for him to get up and go away  im greatly obliged to you for all your kindness mr grayson and i wont abuse your patience any further youve been awfully good to me and he faltered in a dejection which he could not control against all reason he had hoped that the manager would have taken his piece just as it stood and apparently he would not have taken it in any event  you mustnt speak of that said the manager i wish you would let me see anything else you do theres a great deal thats good in this piece and i believe that a woman who would make it her battlehorse could make it go  maxwell asked with melancholy scorn but you dont happen to know any leading lady who is looking round for a battlehorse  the manager seemed trying to think yes i do you wouldnt like her altogether and i dont say she would be the ideal salome but she would be in her way effective and i know that she wants very much to get a play she hasnt been doing anything for a year or two but getting married and divorced but she made a very good start she used to call herself yolande havisham i dont suppose it was her name and she had a good deal of success in the west i dont think shes ever appeared in new york i believe she was of quite a good southern family the southerners all are and i hear she has money  godolphin mentioned a southern girl for the part said maxwell i wonder if  very likely its the same one she does emotional leads she and godolphin played together in california i believe i was trying to think of her married nameor her unmarried name  some one knocked at the door and the young man put his head in with what maxwell fancied a preconcerted effect and gave the manager a card he said all right bring him round and he added to maxwell shall i send your play  no no i will take it and maxwell carried it away with a heavier heart than he had even when he got it back from godolphin he did not know how to begin again and he had to go home and take counsel with his wife as to the next step  he could not bear to tell her of his disappointment and it was harder still to tell her of the kind of hope the manager had held out to him he revolved a compromise in his mind and when they sat down together he did not mean to conceal anything but only to postpone something he did not clearly know why he told her the alternatives the manager had suggested and she agreed with him they were all impossible  besides she said he doesnt promise to take the play even if you do everything to a t did he ask you to lunch again  no that seemed altogether a thing of the past  well let us have ours and then we can go into the park and forget all about it for a while and perhaps something new will suggest itself  that was what they did but nothing new suggested itself they came home fretted with their futile talk there seemed nothing for maxwell to do but to begin the next day with some other manager  they found a note from grayson waiting maxwell well you open it he said listlessly to his wife and in fact he felt himself at that moment physically unable to cope with the task and he dreaded any fluctuation of emotion that would follow even if it were a joyous one  what does this mean brice demanded his wife with a terrible provisionality in her tone as she stretched out the letter to him and stood before him where he lounged in the cushioned windowseat  grayson had written if you care to submit your play to yolande havisham you can easily do so i find that her address is the same as yours her name is harley but i was mistaken about the divorce it was a death  maxwell lay stupidly holding the note before him  will you tell me what it means his wife repeated or why you didnt tell me before if you meant to give your play to that creature  i dont mean to give it to her said maxwell doggedly i never did for an instant as for not telling you that grayson had suggested itwell perhaps i wished to spare myself a scene like the present  do you think i will believe you  i dont think you will insult me why shouldnt you believe i am telling you the truth  becausebecause you didnt tell me at once  that is nonsense and you know it if i wanted to keep this from you it was to spare you the annoyance i cant help now and because the thing was settled in my mind as soon as grayson proposed it  then why has he written to you about it  i suppose i didnt say it was settled  suppose dont you know whether you did  come now louise i am not on the witnessstand and i wont be crossquestioned you ought to be ashamed of yourself what is the matter with you am i to blame because a man who doesnt imagine your dislike of a woman that you never spoke to suggests her taking part in a play that she probably wouldnt look at youre preposterous try to have a little commonsense these appeals seemed to have a certain effect with his wife she looked daunted but maxwell had the misfortune to add one would think you were jealous of the woman  now you are insulting me she cried but its a part of the vulgarity of the whole business actors authors managers youre all alike  maxwell got very pale look out louise he warned her  i wont look out if you had any delicacy the least delicacy in the world you could imagine how a woman who had given the most sacred feelings of her nature to you for your selfish art would loathe to be represented by such a creature as that and still not be jealous of her as you call it but i am justly punished i might have expected it  the maid appeared at the door and said something which neither of them could make out at once but which proved to be the question whether mrs maxwell had ordered the dinner  no i will goi was just going out for it said louise she had in fact not taken off her hat or gloves since she came in from her walk and she now turned and swept out of the room without looking at her husband he longed to detain her to speak some kindly or clarifying word to set himself right with her to set her right with herself but the rage was so hot in his heart that he could not she came back to the door a moment and looked in i will do my duty  its rather late he sneered but if youre very conscientious i dare say we shall have dinner at the usual time  he did not leave the windowseat and it was as if the door had only just clashed to after her when there came a repeated and violent ringing at the bell so that he jumped up himself to answer it without waiting for the maid  your wifeyour wife panted the bellboy who stood there shes hurt herself and shes fainted  my wife wherehow he ran down stairs after the boy and in the hallway on the ground floor he found louise stretched upon the marble pavement with her head in the lap of a woman who was chafing her hands he needed no look at this womans face to be sure that it was the woman of his wifes abhorrence and he felt quite as sure that it was the actress yolande havisham from the effective drama of her selfpossession  dont be frightened your wife turned her foot on the steps here i was coming into the house and caught her from falling its only a swoon she spoke with the pseudoenglish accent of the stage but with a southern slip upon the vowels here and there get some water please  the hallboy came running up the back stairs with some that he had gone to get and the woman bade maxwell sprinkle his wifes face but he said noyou and he stooped and took his wifes head into his own hands so that she might not come to in the lap of mrs harley in the midst of his dismay he reflected how much she would hate that he could hardly keep himself from being repellant and resentful towards the woman in his remorse for quarrelling with louise it was the least reparation he could offer her mrs harley if it were she seemed not to notice his rudeness she sprinkled louises face and wiped her forehead with the handkerchief she dipped in the water but this did not bring her out of her faint and maxwell began to think she was dead and to feel that he was a murderer with a strange æsthetic vigilance he took note of his sensations for use in revising haxard  the janitor of the building had somehow arrived and mrs harley said i will go for a doctor if you can get her up to your apartment and she left louise with the two men  the janitor a burly irishman lifted her in his arms and carried her up the three flights of steps maxwell followed haggardly helplessly  on her own bed louise revived and said my shoeoh get it off  the doctor came a few minutes later but mrs harley did not appear with him as maxwell had dreaded she would he decided that mrs maxwell had strained not sprained her ankle and he explained how the difference was all the difference in the world as he bound the ankle up with a long ribbon of indiarubber and issued directions for care and quiet  he left them there and maxwell heard him below in parley apparently with the actress at her door louise lay with her head on her husbands arm and held his other hand tight in hers while he knelt by the bed the bliss of repentance and mutual forgiveness filled both their hearts while she told him how she had hurt herself  i had got down to the last step and i was putting my foot to the pavement and i thought now i am going to turn my ankle wasnt it strange and i turned it how did you get me upstairs  the janitor carried you  how lucky he happened to be there i suppose the hallboy kept me from fallingpoor little fellow you must give him some money how did you find out about me  he ran up to tell maxwell said this and then he hesitated i guess you had better know all about it can you bear something disagreeable or would you rather wait  no no tell me now i cant bear to wait what is it  it wasnt the hallboy that caught you it was thatwoman  he felt her neck and hand grow rigid but he went on and told her all about it at the end some quiet tears came into her eyes well then we must be civil to her i am glad you told me at once brice she pulled his head down and kissed him and he was glad too     xv   louise sent maxwell down to mrs harleys apartment to thank her and tell her how slight the accident was and while he was gone she abandoned herself to an impassioned dramatization of her own death from bloodpoisoning and her husbands early marriage with the actress who then appeared in all his plays though they were not happy together her own spectre was always rising between them and she got some fearful joy out of that she counted his absence by her heartbeats but he came back so soon that she was ashamed and was afraid that he had behaved so as to give the woman a notion that he was not suffered to stay longer he explained that he had found her gloved and bonneted to go out and that he had not stayed for fear of keeping her she had introduced him to her mother who was civil about louises accident and they had both begged him to let them do anything they could for her he made his observations and when louise after a moment asked him about them he said they affected him as severally typifying the old south and the new south they had a photograph over the mantel thrown up large of an officer in confederate uniform otherwise the room had nothing personal in it he suspected the apartment of having been taken furnished like their own louise asked if he should say they were ladies and he answered that he thought they were  of course she said and she added with a wide sweep of censure they get engaged to four or five men at a time down there well she sighed you mustnt stay in here with me dear go to your writing  i was thinking whether you couldnt come out and lie on the lounge i hate to leave you alone in here  no the doctor said to be perfectly quiet perhaps i can tomorrow if it doesnt swell up any worse  she kept her hold of his hand which he had laid in hers and he sat down beside the bed in the chair he had left there he did not speak and after a while she asked what are you thinking of  oh nothing the confounded play i suppose  youre disappointed at graysons not taking it  one is always a fool  yes said louise with a catching of the breath she gripped his hand hard and said as well as she could in keeping back the tears well i will never stand in your way brice you may do anythinganythingwith it that you think best  i shall never do anything you dont like he answered and he leaned over and kissed her and at this her passion burst in a violent sobbing and when she could speak she made him solemnly promise that he would not regard her in the least but would do whatever was wisest and best with the play for otherwise she should never be happy again  as she could not come out to join him at dinner he brought a little table to the bedside and put his plate on it and ate his dinner there with her she gave him some attractive morsels off her own plate which he had first insisted on bestowing upon her they had such a gay evening that the future brightened again and they arranged for maxwell to take his play downtown the next day and not lose a moment in trying to place it with some manager  it all left him very wakeful for his head began to work upon this scheme and that when he went to lock the outer door for the night the sight of his overcoat hanging in the hall made him think of a theatrical newspaper he had bought coming home at a certain corner of broadway where numbers of smoothshaven handsome men and women with dark eyes and champagned hair were lounging and passing he had got it on the desperate chance that it might suggest something useful to him he now took it out of his coatpocket and began to look its advertisements over in the light of his study lamp partly because he was curious about it and partly because he knew that he should begin to revise his play otherwise and then he should not sleep all night  in several pages of the paper ladies with flowery and alliterative names and pseudonyms proclaimed themselves in large letters and in smaller type the parts they were presently playing in different combinations others gave addresses and announced that they were at liberty or specified the kinds of rôles they were accustomed to fill as leads or heavies dancing soubrettes and boys leads emotional and juvenile heavy or juvenile or emotional leads there were gentlemen seeking engagements who were artistic whistling soloists magicians leading men leading heavies singing and dancing comedians and there were both ladies and gentlemen who were now starring in this play or that but were open to offers later a teacher of stage dancing promised instruction in skirt and serpentine dancing as well as high kicking front and back the backward bend side practice toepractice and all novelties dramatic authors had their cards among the rest and one poor fellow as if he had not the heart to name himself advertised a play to be heard of at the office of the newspaper whatever related to the theatre was there in bizarre solidarity which was droll enough to maxwell in one way but he hated to be mixed up with all that and he perceived that he must be mixed up with it more and more if he wrote for the theatre whether he liked it or not he was part of the thing which in its entirety meant highkicking and toepractice as well as the expression of the most mystical passions of the heart there was an austerity in him which the fact offended and he did what he could to appease this austerity by reflecting that it was the drama and never the theatre that he loved but for the time this was useless he saw that if he wrote dramas he could not hold aloof from the theatre nor from actors and actressesheavies and juveniles and emotionals and soubrettes he must know them and more intimately and at first he must be subject to them however he mastered them at last he must flatter their oddities and indulge their caprices his experience with godolphin had taught him that and his experience with godolphin in the construction of his play could be nothing to what he must undergo at rehearsals and in the effort to adapt his work to a company he reminded himself that shakespeare even must have undergone all that but this did not console him he was himself and what another the greatest had suffered would not save him besides it was not the drama merely that maxwell loved it was not making plays alone it was causing the life that he had known to speak from the stage and to teach there its serious and important lesson in the last analysis he was a moralist and more a moralist than he imagined to enforce in the vividest and most palpable form what he had thought true it might be worth while to endure all the trials that he must but at that moment he did not think so and he did not dare submit his misgiving to his wife  they had now been six months married and if he had allowed himself to face the fact he must have owned that though they loved each other so truly and he had known moments of exquisite of incredible rapture he had been as little happy as in any halfyear he had lived he never formulated his wifes character or defined the precise relation she bore to his life if he could have been challenged to do so he would have said that she was the whole of life to him and that she was the most delightful woman in the world  he tasted to its last sweetness the love of loving her and of being loved by her at the same time there was an obscure stress upon him which he did not trace to her at once a trouble in his thoughts which if he could have seen it clearly he would have recognized for a lurking anxiety concerning how she would take the events of their life as they came without realizing it for his mind was mostly on his work and it was only in some dim recess of his spirit that the struggle took place he was perpetually striving to adjust himself to the unexpected or rather the unpredictable  but when he was most afraid of her harassing uncertainty of emotion or action he was aware of her fixed loyalty to him and perhaps it was the final effect with himself that he dreaded should he always be able to bear and forbear as he felt she would with all her variableness and turning the question did not put itself in words and neither did his conviction that his relation to the theatre was doubled in difficulty through her but he perceived that she had no love for the drama and only a love for his love of it and sometimes he vaguely suspected that if he had been in business she would have been as fond of business as she was of the drama he never perhaps comprehended her ideal and how it could include an explicit and somewhat noisy devotion to the aims of his ambition because it was his and a patronizing reservation in regard to the ambition itself but this was quite possible with louise just as it was possible for her to have had a humble personal joy in giving herself to him while she had a distinct social sense of the sacrifice she had made in marrying him in herself she looked up to him as her fathers and mothers daughter as the child of her circumstance there is no doubt she looked down upon him but neither of these attitudes held in their common life love may or may not level ranks but marriage unquestionably does and is the one form of absolute equality the maxwells did not take themselves or each other objectively they loved and hated they made war and made peace without any sense of the difference or desert that might have been apparent to the spectators  maxwell had never been so near the standpoint of the impartial observer as now when he confronted the question of what he should do with a heart twice burdened by the question whether his wife would not make it hard for him to do it whatever it was he thought with dark foreboding of the difficulties he should have to smooth out for her if it ever came to a production of the piece the best thing that could happen perhaps would be its rejection final and total by all possible managers and actors for she would detest any one who took the part of salome and would hold him responsible for all she should suffer from it  he recurred to what he had felt so strongly himself and what grayson had suggested and thought how he could free himself from fealty to her by cutting out the whole lovebusiness from his play but that would be very hard the thing had now knitted itself in one texture in his mind and though he could sever the ties that bound the parts together it would take from the piece the great element of charm it was not symmetrical as it stood but it was not two distinct motives the motives had blended and they really belonged to each other he would have to invent some other lovebusiness if he cut this out but still it could be done then it suddenly flashed upon him that there was something easier yet and that was to abandon the notion of getting his piece played at all and to turn it into a novel he could give it narrative form without much trouble if any beyond that of copying it and it would be thought a very dramatic story he saw instantly how he could keep and even enhance all the charm of the lovebusiness as it stood in a novel and in his revulsion of feeling he wished to tell his wife he made a movement towards the door of her room but he heard the even breathing of her sleep and he stopped and flung himself on the lounge to think it was such a happy solution of the whole affair he need not even cease trying it with the managers for he could use the copy of the play that godolphin had returned for that and he could use the copy he had always kept for recasting it in narrative by the time that he had got his play back from the last manager he would have his novel ready for the first publisher in the meantime he should be writing his letters for the abstract and not consuming all his little savings  the relief from the stress upon him was delicious he lay at rest and heard the soft breathing of his wife from the other room and an indescribable tenderness for her filled his heart then he heard her voice saying well dont wake him poor boy     xvi   maxwell opened his eyes and found the maid lightly escaping from the room he perceived that he had slept all night on the lounge and he sent a cheery hail into his wifes room and then followed it to tell her how he had thought it all out she was as glad as he was she applauded his plan to the ceiling and he might not have thought of her accident if he had not seen presently that she was eating her breakfast in bed  then he asked after her ankle and she said oh that is perfectly well or the same as perfectly theres no pain at all there to speak of and i shall get up to luncheon you neednt mind me any more if you havent taken your death of cold sleeping there on the lounge  i havent  i want you to go down town to some manager with your play and get some paper the kind i like and then after lunch well begin turning it into a novel from your copy it will be so easy for you that you can dictate and ill do the writing and well work it up together shall you like collaborating with me  ah  it will be our story and i shall like it twice as well as if it were a play we shall be independent of the theatre thats one satisfaction they can take the play if they like but it will be perfectly indifferent to us i shall help you get in all those nice touches that you said you could never get into a play like that green light in the woods i know just how we shall manage that love business and we shant have any horror of an actress interpreting our inspirations to the public well play atland and salome ourselves wellow  she had given her foot a twist in the excitement and she fell back on the pillow rather faint but she instantly recovered herself with a laugh and she hurried him away to his breakfast and then away with his play he would rather have stayed and begun turning it into a story at once but she would not let him she said it would be a loss of time and she should fret a good deal more to have him there with her than to have him away for she should know he was just staying to cheer her up  when he was gone she sent for whatever papers the maid could find in the parlor so that she need not think of him in the amusement she would get out of them among the rest was that dramatic newspaper which caught her eye first with the effigy of a very dramatized young woman whose portrait filled the whole first page louise abhorred her but with a novel sense of security in the fact that maxwells play was going so soon to be turned into a story and she felt personally aloof from all the people who had dragged him down with a sense of complicity in their professional cards she found them neither so droll nor so painful as he had but she was very willing to turn from them and she was giving the paper a parting glance before dropping it when she was arrested by an advertisement which made her start       wanteda drama for prominent star light comic and emotional      star part must embody situations for the display of intense      effects   address l sterne this office  a series of effects as intense as the advertiser could have desired in a drama followed one another in the mind of louise she now wildly reproached herself that she had however unwittingly sent her husband out of reach for four or five hours when his whole future might depend upon his instantly answering this notice whether he had already seen the notice and rashly decided to ignore it or had not seen it he might involve himself with some manager irretrievably before he could be got at with a demand which seemed specifically framed to describe his play she was in despair that there was no means of sending a messengerboy after him with any chance of finding him the light comic reliefs which the advertiser would have wished to give the dark phases of her mood were suggested by her reckless energy in whirling herself into her dressinggown and hopping out to maxwells desk in the other room where she dashed off a note in reply to the advertisement in her husbands name and then checked herself with the reflection that she had no right to sign his name even in such a cause she must not do anything wrong something must be done however right or wrong and she decided that a very formal note in the third person would involve the least moral trespass she fixed upon these terms after several experiments almost weeping at the time they cost her when every moment was precious  mr brice maxwell writes to mr l sterne and begs to inform him that he has a play which he believes will meet the requirements of mr sterne as stated in his advertisement in the theatrical register of november the tenth mr maxwell asks the favor of an interview with mr sterne at any time and place that mr sterne may appoint  it seemed to her that this violated no law of man or god or if it did the exigency was such that the action could be forgiven if not justified she ransacked maxwells desk for a special delivery stamp and sent the letter out beyond recall and then it occurred to her that its opening terms were too much those of a lady addressing a seamstress but after a good deal of anguish on this point she comforted herself with the hope that a man would not know the form or at least would not suspect another man of using it offensively  she passed the time till maxwell came back in doubt whether to tell him what she had done there was no reason why she should not except that he might have seen the advertisement and decided not to answer it for some reason but in that case it might be said that he ought to have spoken to her about it she told him everything at once but there were many things that he did not tell her till long afterwards it would be a good thing to let him realize how that felt besides it would be a pleasure to keep it and let it burst upon him if that l sterne whoever he was asked to see the play in any case it would not be a great while that she need keep from him what she had done but at sight of him when he came in she could hardly be silent he was gloomy and dispirited and he confessed that his pleasant experience with grayson had not been repeated with the other managers they had all been civil enough and he had seen three or four of them but only one had consented to let him even leave his play with him the others said that it would be useless for them to look at it  she could not forbear showing him the advertisement she had answered as they sat at lunch but he glanced at it with disdain and said there must be some sort of fake in it if it was some irresponsible fellow getting up a combination he would not scruple to use the ideas of any manuscript submitted to him and work them over to suit himself louise could not speak all heart went out of her she wanted to cry and she did not tell what she had done  neither of them ate much he asked her if she was ready to begin on the story with him she said oh yes and she hobbled off into the other room then he seemed to remember her hurt for the first time he had been so full of his failure with the play before he asked her how she was and she said much better and then he stretched himself on the lounge and tried to dictate and she took her place at his desk and tried to write but she either ran ahead of him and prompted him which vexed him or she lagged so far behind that he lost the thread of what he was saying and became angry at last she put her head down on the paper and blotted it with her tears  at that he said oh youd better go back to bed and then though he spoke harshly he lifted her tenderly and half carried her to her room     xvii   they did not try working the play into a story again together maxwell kept doggedly at it though he said it was of no use the thing had taken the dramatic form with inexorable fixity as it first came from his mind it could be changed of course but it could only be changed for the worse artistically if he could sell it as a story the work would not be lost he would gain the skill that came from doing in any event and it would keep him alive under the illluck that now seemed to have set in  none of the managers wanted his play some of them seemed to want it less than others some wanted it less immediately than others some did not want it after reading some refused it without reading it some had their arrangements made for an indefinite time others in the present uncertain state of affairs could not make any arrangements some said it was an american play others that it was unamerican in its pessimistic spirit some found it too literary others lacking in imagination they were nearly all so kind that at first maxwell was guilty of the folly of trying to persuade them against the reasons they gave when he realized that these reasons were also excuses he set his teeth and accepted them in silence  for a number of days louise suffered in momentary expectation of a reply from l sterne she thought it would come by district messenger the day she wrote and for several days afterwards she had the letters brought to her first so that she could read them and not disturb maxwell with them at his work if it were not necessary he willingly agreed to that he saw that it helped to pass the irksome time for her she did not mean to conceal any answer she should have from l sterne but she meant when the answer came to prepare her husband for it in such sort that he would understand her motive and though he condemned it would easily forgive her but the days went and no letter from l sterne came and after a season of lively indignation at his rudeness louise began to forget him a little though she still kept her surveillance of the mail  it was always on her conscience in the meantime to give some of the first moments of her recovery to going with maxwell and thanking mrs harley for the kindness she had shown her in her accident she was the more strenuous in this intention because the duty was so distasteful and she insisted upon maxwells company though he argued that he had already done enough himself in thanking her preserver because she wished to punish a certain reluctance of her own in having him go she promised herself that she would do everything that was right by the creature and perhaps she repaired to her presence in rather overwhelming virtue if this was so mrs harley showed herself equal to the demand upon her and was overwhelming in her kind she not only made nothing of what she had done for louise but she made nothing of louise and contrived with a few welldirected strokes to give her distinctly the sense of being a chit a thing louise was not at all used to she was apparently one of those women who have no use for persons of their own sex but few women even of that sort could have so promptly relegated louise to the outside of their interest or so frankly devoted themselves to maxwell the impartial spectator might easily have imagined that it was his ankle which had been strained and that louise was at best an intrusive sympathizer sometimes mrs harley did not hear what she said at other times if she began a response to her she ended it in a question to him even when she talked to louise her eyes were smouldering upon maxwell if this had all or any of it been helpless or ignorant rudeness it could have been borne and forgiven but louise was aware of intention of perfect intelligence in it she was sensible of being even more disliked than disliking and of finally being put to flight with a patronizing benevolence for her complete recovery that was intolerable what was worse was that while the woman had been so offensive she could not wholly rid herself of the feeling that her punishment was in a measure merited though it was not justice that had dealt with her  well that is over said maxwell when they were again by themselves  yes forever sighed louise and for once she was not let have the last word  i hope youll remember that i didnt want to go  at least they had not misunderstood each other about mrs harley  towards the end of the month louises father and mother came on from boston they professed that they had been taken with that wish to see the autumn exhibition at the national academy which sometimes affects bostonians and that their visit had nothing to do with the little hurt that louise wrote them of when she was quite well of it they drove over from their hotel the morning they arrived and she did not know anything of their coming till she heard their voices at the door her fathers voice was rather husky from the climb to her apartment  the apartment was looking somewhat frouzy for the maxwells breakfasted late and the housemaid had not had time to put it in order louise saw it through her fathers and mothers eyes with the glance they gave it and found the rooms ridiculously little and furnished with cheap fourteenth street things but she bragged all the more noisily of it on that account and made her mother look out of the window for the pretty view they had from their corner room mrs hilary pulled her head back from the prospect of the railroadridden avenue with silent horror and louise burst into a wild laugh well it isnt commonwealth avenue mamma i dont pretend that you know  wheres maxwell asked hilary still puffing from the lounge he had sunk upon as soon as he got into the room  oh hes down town interviewing a manager about his play  i thought that fellow out west had his play or is this a new one  no said louise very slowly and thoughtfully brice has taken back his play from mr godolphin this was true he had taken it back in a sense she added as much to herself as to her father but he has got a new playthat hes working at  i hope he hasnt been rash with godolphin though i always had an idea that it would have been better for him to deal with a manager it seems more businesslike  oh much said louise  after a little while they were more at home with each other she began to feel herself more their child and less maxwells wife the barriers of reluctance against him which she always knew were up with them fell away from between them and herself but her father said they had come to get her and maxwell to lunch with them at their hotel and then louise felt herself on her husbands side of the fence again she said no they must stay with her that she was sure brice would be back for lunch and she wanted to show them her housekeeping mrs hilary cast her eye about the room at the word as if she had seen quite enough of it already and this made louise laugh again she was no better in person than the room was and she felt her mothers tacit censure apply to her slatternly dressinggown  i know what youre thinking mamma but i got the habit of it when i had my strained ankle  oh im sure it must be very comfortable mrs hilary said of the dressinggown is it entirely well now she added of the ankle and she and hilary both looked at louise in a way that would have convinced her that their final anxiety concerning it had brought them to new york if she had not guessed it already the doctor and by this she meant their old family doctor as if he were the only one said you couldnt be too careful  well i havent been careful said louise gayly but im quite well and you can go back at once if thats all mamma  hilary laughed with her you havent changed much louise  her mother said in another sense i think you look a little pulled down and that made her and her father laugh again she got to playing with him and poking him and kissing him in the way she had with him when she was a girl it was not so very long ago  her mother bore with this for awhile and then she rose to go  youre not going to stay louise protested  not today my dear ive got some shopping to do before lunch  well said louise i didnt suppose you would stay the first time such swells as you and papa but i shall insist upon your coming tomorrow when youve recovered a little from the blow this home of virtuous poverty has given you and ive had a chance to dust and prepare for you and ill tell you what mamma brice and i will come to dinner with you tonight and we wont take any refusal well be with you at seven how will that do papa  that will do said hilary with his arm round her waist and they kissed each other to clinch the bargain  and dont you two old things go away and put your frosty paws together and say brice and i are not happy we do quarrel like cats and dogs every now and then but the rest of the time were the happiest couple in the universe and an example to parents  hilary would have manifestly liked to stay and have her go on with her nonsense but his wife took him away  when maxwell came in she was so full of their visit that she did not ask him what luck he had with his play but told him at once they were going to dine with her father and mother and i want you to brace up my dear and not let them imagine anything  how anything he asked listlessly  oh nothing about your play not going perfectly i didnt think it necessary to go into particulars with them and you neednt just pass it over lightly if they ask you anything about it but they wont  maxwell did not look so happy as he might at the prospect of dining with his wifes father and mother but he did not say anything disagreeable and after an instant of silent resentment louise did not say anything disagreeable either in fact she devoted herself to avoiding any displeasures with him and she arrived with him at the hilarys hotel on perfectly good terms and as far as he was concerned in rather good spirits  upon the whole they had a very good time hilary made occasion to speak to maxwell of his letters to the abstract and told him they were considered by far the best letters of the kind published anywhere which meant anywhere in boston  you do that sort of thing so well newspaper writing he continued with a slyness that was not lost upon louise though maxwell was ignorant of his drift that i wonder you dont sometimes want to take it up again  its well enough said maxwell who was gratified by his praise  by the way said hilary i met your friend mr ricker the other day and he spoke most cordially about you i fancy he would be very glad to have you back  in the old way i would rather be excused  no from what he said i thought he would like your writing in the editorial page  maxwell looked pleased rickers always been very good but he has very little influence on the abstract he has no money interest in the paper  hilary said with the greatest artfulness i wonder he doesnt buy in i hear it can be done  not by ricker for the best of all possible reasons said maxwell with a laugh  louise could hardly wait till she had parted from her father and mother before she began on her husband you goose didnt you see that papa was hinting at buying you a share in the abstract  he was very modest about it then i didnt see anything of the kind  oh do you think you are the only modest man papa is very modest and he wouldnt make you an offer outright unless he saw that you would like it but i know that was what he was coming to and if youll let me  a sentiment of a reluctance rather than a refusal was what made itself perceptible from his arm to hers as they hurried along the street together and louise would not press the question till he spoke again  he did not speak till they were in the train on their way home then he said i shouldnt care to have a money interest in a newspaper it would tie me up to it and load me down with cares i should hate it wouldnt be my real life  yes said his wife but when they got into their little apartment she cast an eye opened to its meanness and narrowness over the common belongings and wondered if he would ask himself whether this was her real life but she did not speak though she was apt to speak out most things that she thought     xviii   some people began to call old friends of her mother whose visit to new york seemed to have betrayed to them the fact of louises presence for the first time and some friends of her own who had married and come to new york to live and who said they had just got back to town long enough to learn that she was there these all reproached her for not having let them know sooner where she was and they all more or less followed up their reproaches with the invitations which she dreaded because of maxwells aversion for them but she submitted them to him and submitted to his refusal to go with her and declined them in her heart she thought he was rather ungracious but she did not say so though in two or three cases of people whom she liked she coaxed him a little to go with her meeting her mother and talking over the life she used to lead in boston and the life so many people were leading there still made her a little hungry for society she would have liked well enough to find herself at a dinner again and she would have felt a little dancing after the dinner no hardship but she remembered the promise she had made herself not to tease maxwell about such things so she merely coaxed him and he so far relented as to ask her why she could not go without him and that hurt her and she said she never would go without him all the same when there came an invitation for lunch from a particularly nice friend of her girlhood she hesitated and was lost she had expected somehow that it was going to be a very little lunch but she found it a very large one in the number of people and after the stress of accounting for her husbands failure to come with her she was not sorry to have it so she inhaled with joy the atmosphere of the flowerscented rooms her eye dwelt with delight on their luxurious and tasteful appointments the belongings of her former life which seemed to emerge in them from the past and claim her again the women in their chic new york costumes and their miracles of early winter hats hailed her a longlost sister by every graceful movement and cultivated tone the correctly tailored and agreeably mannered men had polite intelligence of a world that maxwell never would and never could be part of the talk of the little amusing unvital things that began at once was more precious to her than the problems which the austere imagination of her husband dealt with it suddenly fatigued her to think how hard she had tried to sympathize with his interest in them her heart leaped at sight of the long roseheaped table with its glitter of glass and silver and the solemn perfection of the servingmen a spectacle not important in itself was dear to her from association with gayeties which now for a wicked moment seemed to her better than love  there were all sorts of people artists and actors as well as people of fashion her friend had given her some society notable to go out with but she had appointed for the chair next her on the other hand a young man in a pretty pointed beard whom she introduced across from the head of the table as soon as she could civilly take the notable to herself louise did not catch his name and it seemed presently that he had not heard hers but their acquaintance prospered without this knowledge he made some little jokes which she promptly responded to and they talked awhile as if they were both newyorkers till she said at some remark of his but i am not a newyorker and then he said well neither am i and offered to tell her what he was if she would tell him what she was  oh im from boston of course she answered but then instead of saying where he was from he broke out  now i will fulfil my vow  your vow what is your vow  to ask the first boston person i met if that boston person knew anything about another boston person who wrote a most remarkable play i saw in the fall out at home  a play said louise with a total loss of interest in the gentlemans city or country  yes by a boston man named maxwell  louise stared at him and if their acquaintance had been a little older she might have asked him to come off as it was she could not speak and she let him go on  i dont know when ive ever had a stronger impression in the theatre than i had from that play perfectly modern and perfectly american he briefly sketched it it was like a terrible experience on the tragic side and on the other side it was a rapture i never saw lovemaking on the stage before that made me wish to be a lover  a firered flew over louises face and she said almost snubbingly as if he had made some unwarrantable advance i think i had better not let you go on it was my husband who wrote that play i am mrs maxwell  mrs maxwell you are mrs maxwell he gasped and she could not doubt the honesty of his amaze  his confusion was so charming that she instantly relented of course i should like to have you go on all day as youve begun but theres no telling what exceptions you might be going to make later where did you see my husbands play  in midland  what you are notyou cant bemr ray  i ami can he returned gleefully and now louise impulsively gave him her hand under the tablecloth  the manoeuvre caught the eye of the hostess a bet she asked  better cried louise not knowing her pun a thousand times and she turned without further explanation to the gentleman when i tell mr maxwell of this he will suffer as he ought and thats saying a great deal for not coming with me today to think of its being you  ah but to think of its being he you acquit me of the poor taste of putting up a job  oh of anything you want to be acquitted of what crime would you prefer there are whole deluges of mercy for you but now go on and tell me everything you thought about the play  id rather youd tell me what you know about the playwright  everything of course and nothing she added the last words from a sudden poignant conviction isnt that the way with the wives of you men of genius  am i a man of genius  youre literary  oh literary yes but im not married  youre determined to get out of it somehow tell me about midland it has filled such a space in our imagination you cant think what a comfort and stay you have been to us but why in midland is it a large place  would it take such a very big one to hold me its the place i brought myself up in and its very good to me and so i live there i dont think it has any vast intellectual or æsthetic interests but there are very nice people there very cultivated some of them and very well read after all you dont need a great many people three or four will do  and have you always lived there  i lived a year or so in new york and i manage to get on here some time every winter the rest of the year midland is quite enough for me its gay at times theres a good deal going on and i can write there as well as anywhere and better than in new york then you know in a small way im a prophet in my own country perhaps because i was away from it for awhile its very pretty but its very base of you to make me talk about myself when im so anxious to hear about mr maxwell  and do you spend all your time writing ibsen criticisms of ibsen plays louise pursued against his protest  i do some other kind of writing  as  oh no im not here to interview myself  oh but you ought i know youve written somethingsome novel your name was so familiar from the first mr ray laughed and shook his head in mockery of her cheap device you mustnt be vexed because im so vague about it im very ignorant  you said you were from boston  but there are bostons and bostons the boston that i belonged to never hears of american books till they are forgotten  ah how famous i must be there  i see you are determined to be bad but i remember now it was a play havent you written a play he held up three fingers i knew it what was it  my plays said the young fellow with a mock of superiority have never been played ive been told that they are above the heads of an audience its a great consolation but now really about mr maxwells when is it to be given here i hoped very much that i might happen on the very time  louise hesitated a moment and then she said you know he has taken it back from godolphin it was not so hard to say this as it was at first but it still required resolution  oh im so glad said mr ray i never thought he appreciated it he was so anxious to make his part all in all that he would have been willing to damage the rest of it irretrievably i could see from the way he talked of it that he was mortally jealous of salome and the girl who did that did it very sweetly and prettily who has got the play now  well said louise with rather a painful smile nobody has it at present were trying to stir up strife for it among managers  what play is that asked her friend the hostess and all that end of the table became attentive as any fashionable company will at the mention of a play books may be more or less out of the range of society but plays never at all  my husbands said louise meekly  why does your husband write plays cried the lady  what did you think he did returned louise resentfully she did not in the least know what her friends husband did and he was no more there to speak for himself than her own  hes written a very great play mr ray spoke up with generous courage the very greatest american play i have seen i dont say ever written for ive written some myself that i havent seen yet he added and every one laughed at his bit of selfsacrifice but mr maxwells play is just such a play as i would have written if i couldlarge and serious and charming  he went on about it finely and louises heart swelled with pride she wished maxwell could have been there but if he had been of course mr ray would not have spoken so freely  the hostess asked him where he had seen it and he said in midland  then she said we must all go and she had the effect of rising to do so but it was only to leave the men to their tobacco  louise laid hold of her in the drawingroom who is he what is he  a little dear isnt he  yes of course but what has he done  why he wrote a noveli forget the name but i have it somewhere it made a great sensation but surely you must know what it was  no no louise lamented i am ashamed to say i dont  when the men joined the ladies she lingered long enough to thank mr ray and try to make him tell her the name of his novel she at least made him promise to let them know the next time he was in new york and she believed all he said of his regret that he was going home that night he sent many sweet messages to maxwell whom he wanted to talk with about his play and tell him all he had thought about it he felt sure that some manager would take it and bring it out in new york and again he exulted that it was out of the actors hands a manager might not have an artistic interest in it an actor could only have a personal interest in it     xix   louise came home in high spirits the world seemed to have begun to move again it was full of all sorts of gay hopes or at least she was and she was impatient to impart them to maxwell now she decided that her great office in his life must be to cheer him up to supply that spring of joyousness which was so lacking in him and which he never could do any sort of work without she meant to make him go into society with her it would do him good and he would shine he could talk as well as mr ray and if he would let himself go he could be as charming  she rushed in to speak with him and was vexed to find a strange man sitting in the parlor alone the stranger rose at her onset and then when she confusedly retreated he sank into his chair again she had seen him black against the window and had not made out any feature or expression of his face  the maid explained that it was a gentleman who had called to see mr maxwell earlier in the day and the last time had asked if he might sit down and wait for him he had been waiting only a few minutes  but who is he demanded louise with a provisional indignation in case it should be a liberty on some unauthorized persons part didnt he give you a card  he had given the girl a card and she now gave it to mrs maxwell it bore the name mr lawrence sterne which louise read with much the same emotion as if it had been mr william shakespeare she suspected what her husband would have called a fake of some sort and she felt a little afraid she did not like the notion of the mans sitting there in her parlor while she had nobody with her but the girl he might be all right and he might even be a gentleman but the dark bulk which had risen up against the window and stood holding a hat in its hand was not somehow a gentlemanly bulk the hat was not definitively a gentlemans hat and the baldness which had shone against the light was not exactly what you would have called a gentlemans baldness clearly however the only thing to do was to treat the event as one of entire fitness till it proved itself otherwise and louise returned to the parlor with an air of ladylike inquiry expressed in her look and movement if this effect was not wholly unmixed with patronage it still was kind  i am sorry she said that my husband is out and i am sorry to say that i dont know just when he will be at home she stood and the man had risen again with his portly frame and his invisible face between her and the light again if i could be of any use in giving him a message she stopped it was really sending the man out of the house and she could not do that it was not decent she added or if you dont mind waiting a few minutes longer  she sat down but the man did not he said i cant wait any longer just now but if mr maxwell would like to see me i am at the coleman house she looked at him as if she did not understand and he went on if he doesnt recall my name hell remember answering my advertisement some weeks ago in the theatrical register for a play  oh yes said louise this was the actor whom she had written to on behalf of maxwell with electrical suddenness and distinctness she now recalled the name l sterne along with all the rest though the card of mr lawrence sterne had not stirred her sleeping consciousness she had always meant to tell maxwell what she had done but she was always waiting for something to come of it and when nothing came of it she did not tell she had been so disgusted at the mere notion of answering the mans advertisement now here was the man himself and he had to be answered and that would probably be worse than answering his advertisement i remember she said provisionally but with the resolution to speak exactly the truth i wrote to you for mr maxwell which did not satisfy her as the truth ought to have done  well then i wish you would please tell him that i didnt reply to his letter because it kept following me from place to place and i only got it at the register office this morning  i will tell mr maxwell said louise  i should be glad to see his play if he still has it to dispose of from what mr grayson has told me of it i think it mighti think i should like to see it it might suit thethe party i am acting for he added letting himself go  then you are not thethestar  i am the manager for the star  oh said louise with relief the fact seemed to put another complexion on the affair a distaste which she had formed for mr sterne personally began to cede to other feelings if he was manager for the star he must be like other managers such as maxwell was willing to deal with and if he knew mr grayson he must be all right i will tell mr maxwell she said with no provisionality this time  mr sterne prepared to go so far as buttoning his overcoat and making some paces towards the door gave token of his intention louise followed him with a politeness which was almost gratitude to him for reinstating her in her own esteem he seemed to have atmospheric intelligence of her better will towards him for he said as if it were something she might feel an interest in if i can get a play that will suit i shall take the road with a combination immediately after new years i dont know whether you have ever seen the lady i want the play for  the lady gasped louise  she isnt very wellknown in the east yet but she will be she wants a play of her own as i understand mr grayson there is a part in mr maxwells play that would fit her to a t or could be fitted to her these things always need some little adaptation mr sternes manner became easier and easier curious thing about it is that you are next dooror next floorneighbors here mrs harley  wewe have met her said louise in a hollow murmur  well you cant have any idea what yolande havisham is from mrs harley i shall be at the coleman the whole evening if mr maxwell would like to call well goodmorning said mr sterne and he got himself away before louise could tell him that maxwell would never give his play to a woman before she could say that it was already as good as accepted by another manager before she could declare that if no manager ever wanted it still as far as mrs harley was concerned with her smouldering eyes it would always be in negotiation before she could form or express any utter and final refusal and denial of his abominable hopes  it remained for her either to walk quietly down to the north river and drown herself or to wait her husbands return and tell him everything and throw herself on his mercy implore him adjure him not to give that woman his play and then to go into a decline that would soon rid him of the clog and hinderance she had always been to him it flashed through her turmoil of emotion that it was already dark in spite of mr sternes goodmorning at parting and that some one might speak to her on the way to the river and then she thought how maxwell would laugh when she told him the fear of being spoken to had kept her from suicide and she sat waiting for him to come with such an inward haggardness that she was astonished at sight of herself in the glass to find that she wan looking very much as usual maxwell certainly noticed no difference when he came in and flung himself wearily on the lounge and made no attempt to break the silence of their meeting they had kissed of course but had not spoken  she was by no means sure what she was going to do she had hoped there would be some leading on his part that would make it easy for her to do right whatever the right was but her heart sank at sight of him he looked defeated and harassed but there was no help for it she must speak and speak unaided the only question was whether she had better speak before dinner or after she decided to speak after dinner and then all at once she was saying brice i have brought something dreadful on myself  at the lunch he asked wearily and she saw that he thought she had been making some silly speech she was ashamed of  oh if it had only been at the lunch she cried no it was herehere in this very room  i dont know whats the matter with you louise he said lying back and shutting his eyes  then i must tell you and she came out with the whole story which she had to repeat in parts before he could understand it when he did understand that she had answered an advertisement in the register in his name he opened his eyes and sat up  well he said  well dont you see how wrong and wicked that was  ive heard of worse things  oh dont say so dearest it was living a lie dont you see and ive been living a lie ever since and now im justly punished for not telling you long ago  she told him of the visit she had just had and who the man was and whom he wanted the play for and now a strange thing happened with her she did not beseech him not to give his play to that woman on the contrary she said and now brice i want you to let her have it i know she will play salome magnificently and that will make the fortune of the piece and it will give you such a name that anything you write after this will get accepted and you can satisfy your utmost ambition and you neednt mind menoor think of me at all any more than if i were the dust of the earth and i am will you  he got up from the lounge and began to walk the floor as he always did when he was perplexed and she let him walk up and down in silence as long as she could bear it at last she said i am in earnest brice i am indeed and if you dont do it if you let me or my feelings stand in your way in the slightest degree i will never forgive you will you go straight down to the coleman house as soon as youve had your dinner and tell that man he can have your play for that woman  no said maxwell stopping in his walk and looking at her in a dazed way  her heart seemed to leap into her throat why she choked  because godolphin is here  godo she began and she cast herself on the lounge that maxwell had vacated and plunged her face in the pillow and sobbed oh cruel cruel cruel oh cruel cruel cruel cruel     xx   maxwell stood looking at his wife with the cold disgust which hysterics are apt to inspire in men after they have seen them more than once i suppose that when you are ready you will tell me what is the matter with you  to let me suffer so when you knew all the time that godolphin was here and you neednt give your play to that creature at all wailed louise  how did i know you were suffering he retorted and how do i know that i can do anything with godolphin  oh i know you can she sprang up with the greatest energy and ran into the bedroom to put in order her tumbled hair she kept talking to him from there i want you to go down and see him the instant you have had dinner and dont let him escape you tell him he can have the play on any terms i believe he is the only one who can make it go he was the first to appreciate the idea andfrida she called into the hall towards the kitchen we will have dinner at once now pleasehe always talked so intelligently about it and now if hes where you can superintend the rehearsals it will be the greatest success how in the world did you find out he was here  she came out of her room in surprising repair with this question and the rest of their talk went on through dinner  it appeared that maxwell had heard of godolphins presence from grayson whom he met in the street and who told him that godolphin had made a complete failure of his venture his combination had gone to pieces at cleveland and his company were straggling back to new york as they could godolphin was deeply in debt to them all and to everybody else and yet the manager spoke cordially of him and with no sort of disrespect as if his insolvency were only an affair of the moment which he would put right louise took the same view of it and she urged maxwell to consider how godolphin had promptly paid him and would always do so  probably i got the pay of some poor devil who needed it worse said maxwell  she said nonsense the other actors will take care of all that they are so good to each other and she blamed maxwell for not going to see godolphin at once  that was what i did he answered but he wasnt at home he was to be at home after dinner  well that makes it all the more providential said louise her piety always awoke in view of favorable chances you mustnt lose any time better not wait for the coffee  i think ill wait for the coffee said maxwell its no use going there before eight  no she consented where is he stopping  at the coleman house  the coleman house then if that wretch should see you she meant the manager of mrs harley  he wouldnt know me probably maxwell returned scornfully but if you think theres any danger of his laying hold of me and getting the play away before godolphin has a chance of refusing it ill go masked im tired of thinking about it what sort of lunch did you have  i had the best time in the world you ought to have come with me brice i shall make you the next one oh and guess who was there mr ray  our mr ray maxwell breathlessly demanded  there is no other and hes the sweetest little dear in the world he isnt so big as you are even and hes such a merry spirit he hasnt the bulk your gloom gives you i want you to be like him brice i dont see why you shouldnt go into society too  if id gone into society today i should have missed seeing grayson and shouldnt have known godolphin was in town  well that is true of course but if you get your play into godolphins hands youll have to show yourself a little so that nice people will be interested in it you ought to have heard mr ray celebrate it he piped up before the whole table  louise remembered what ray said very well and she repeated it to a profound joy in maxwell it gave him an exquisite pleasure and it flattered him to believe that as the hostess had said in response they the nice people must see it though he had his opinion of nice people apart from their usefulness in seeing his play to reward his wife for it all he rose as soon as he had drunk his coffee and went out to put on his hat and coat she went with him and saw that he put them on properly and did not go off with half his coatcollar turned up after he got his hat on she took it off to see whether his cowlick was worse than usual  why good heavens godolphins seen me before and besides im not going to propose marriage to him he protested  oh its much more serious than that she sighed anybody would take you dear but its your play we want him to takeor take back  when maxwell reached the hotel he did not find godolphin there he came back twice then as something in his manner seemed to give maxwell authority the clerk volunteered to say that he thought he might find the actor at the players club in this hope he walked across to gramercy park godolphin had been dining there and when he got maxwells name he came half way down the stairs to meet him he put his arm round him to return to the library  there happened to be no one else there and he made maxwell sit down in an armchair fronting his own and give an account of himself since they parted he asked after mrs maxwells health and as far as maxwell could make out he was sincere in the quest he did not stop till he had asked with the most winning and radiant smile and the play what have you done with the play  he was so buoyant that maxwell could not be heavy about it and he answered as gayly oh i fancy i have been waiting for you to come on and take it  godolphin did not become serious but he became if possible more sincere do you really think i could do anything with it  if you cant nobody can  why that is very good of you very good indeed maxwell do you know i have been thinking about that play you see the trouble was with the salome the girl i had for the part was a thoroughly nice girl but she hadnt the weight for it she did the comic touches charmingly but when it came to the tragedy she wasnt there i never had any doubt that i could create the part of haxard its a noble part its the greatest rôle on the modern stage it went magnificently in chicagowith the best people you saw what the critics said of it  no you didnt send me the chicago papers maxwell did not say that all this was wholly different from what godolphin had written him when he renounced the play yet he felt that godolphin was honest then and was honest now it was another point of view that was all  ah i thought i sent them there was some adverse criticism of the play as a whole but there was only one opinion of haxard and you havent done anything with the piece yet  no nothing  and you think i could do haxard you still have faith in me  as much faith as i ever had said maxwell and godolphin found nothing ambiguous in a thing certainly susceptible of two interpretations  that is very good of you maxwell very good he lifted his fine head and gazed absently a moment at the wall before him well then i will tell you what i will do mr maxwell i will take the play  you will  yes that is if you think i can do the part  why of course  and ifif there could be some changesvery slight changesmade in the part of salome it needs subduing godolphin said this as if he had never suggested anything of the kind before as if the notion were newly evolved from his experience  i will do what i can mr godolphin maxwell promised while he knitted his brows in perplexity but i do think that the very strength of salome gives relief to haxardgives him greater importance  it may be so dramatically but theatrically it detracts from him haxard must be the central figure in the eye of the audience from first to last  maxwell mused for a moment of discouragement they were always coming back to that very likely godolphin was right but maxwell did not know just how to subdue the character of salome so as to make her less interesting do you think that was what gave you bad houses in chicagothe double interest or the weakened interest in haxard  i think so said godolphin  were the houses badcomparatively  godolphin took a little notebook out of his breastpocket here are my dates i opened the first night the tenth of november with haxard but we papered the house thoroughly and we made a good show to the public and the press there were four hundred and fifty dollars in it the next night there were three hundred the next night two eighty wednesday matinée less than two hundred that night we put on virginius and played to eight hundred dollars thursday night with the lady of lyons we had eleven hundred friday night we gave the lady to twelve hundred saturday afternoon with the same piece we took in eleven hundred and fifty saturday night with ingomar we had fifteen hundred dollars in the house and a hundred people standing maxwell listened with a drooping head he was bitterly mortified but it was too late then said godolphin with a sigh as he shut his hook  do you mean demanded maxwell that my piece had crippled you so thatthat  i didnt say that mr maxwell i never meant to let you see the figures but you asked me  oh youre quite right said maxwell he thought how he had blamed the actor in his impatience with him for not playing his piece oftenerand called him fool and thought him knave for not doing it all the time as godolphin had so lavishly promised to do he caught at a straw to save himself from sinking with shame but the houses were they so bad everywhere  godolphin checked himself in a movement to take out his notebook again maxwell had given him such an imploring glance they were pretty poor everywhere but its been a bad season with a good many people  no no cried maxwell you did very well with the other plays godolphin why do you want to touch the thing again its been ruinous to you so far give it up come i cant let you have it  godolphin laughed and all his beautiful white teeth shone there was a rich wholesome red in his smoothly shaven cheeks he was a real pleasure to the eye i believe it would go better in new york im not afraid to try it you mustnt take away my last chance of retrieving the season hair of the dog you know have you seen grayson lately  yes i saw him this afternoon it was he that told me you were in town  ah yes  and godolphin ive got it on my conscience if you do take the play to tell you that i offered it to grayson and he refused it i think you ought to know that its only fair and for the matter of that its been kicking round all the theatres in new york  dear boy said godolphin caressingly and with a smile that was like a benediction that doesnt make the least difference  well i wished you to know said maxwell with a great load off his mind  yes i understand that will you drink anything or smoke anything ori forgot i hate all that too but youll join me in a cup of tea downstairs they descended to the smokingroom below and godolphin ordered the tea and went on talking with a gay irrelevance till it came then he said as he poured out the two cups of it the fact is grayson is going in with me if i do your piece this was news to maxwell and yet he was somehow not surprised at it i dare say he told you  no he didnt give me any hint of it he simply told me that you were in town and where you were  ah that was like grayson queer fish  but im mighty glad to know it you can make it go together if any power on earth can do it and if it fails maxwell added i shall have the satisfaction of ruining some one else this time  well grayson has made nearly as bad a mess of it as i have this season said godolphin hes got to take off that thing he has going now and its a question of what he shall put on it will be an experiment with haxard but i believe it will be a successful experiment i have every confidence in that play godolphin looked up his lips set convincingly and with the air of a man who had stood unfalteringly by his opinion from the first now if you will excuse me i will tell you what i think ought to be done to it  by all means said maxwell i shall be glad to do anything you wish or that i can  godolphin poured out a cloudy volume of suggestion with nothing clear in it but the belief that the part of haxard ought to be fattened he recurred to all the structural impossibilities that he had ever desired and there was hardly a point in the piece that he did not want changed at the end he said but all these things are of no consequence comparatively speaking what we need is a woman who can take the part of salome and play it with all the feminine charm that youve given it and yet keep it strictly in the background or thoroughly subordinated to the interest of haxard  for all that godolphin seemed to have learned from his experience with the play maxwell might well have thought they were still talking of it at magnolia it was a great relief to his prepossessions in the form of conclusions to have grayson appear with the air of looking for some one and of finding the object of his search in godolphin he said he was glad to see maxwell too and they went on talking of the play from the talk of the other two maxwell perceived that the purpose of doing his play had already gone far with them but they still spoke of it as something that would be very good if the interest could be unified in it suddenly the manager broke out look here godolphin i have an idea why not frankly accept the inevitable i dont believe mr maxwell can make the play different from what it is structurally and i dont believe the character of salome can be subdued or subordinated then why not play salome as strongly as possible and trust to her strength to enhance haxards effect instead of weakening it  godolphin smiled towards maxwell that was your idea  yes said maxwell and he kept himself from falling on graysons neck for joy  it might do the actor assented with smiling eagerness and tolerant superiority but whom could you get for such a salome as that  well theres only one woman for it said grayson  yolande havisham  the name made maxwells heart stop he started forward to say that mrs harley could not have the part when the manager said and we couldnt get her sterne has engaged her to star in his combination by the way he was looking for you today mr maxwell  i missed him answered maxwell with immense relief but i should not have let him have the piece while i had the slightest hope of your taking it  neither the manager nor the actor was perhaps greatly moved by his generous preference though they both politely professed to be so they went on to canvass the qualities and reputations of all the other actresses attainable and always came back to yolande havisham who was unattainable sterne would never give her up in the world even if she were willing to give up the chance he was offering her but she was the one woman who could do salome  they decided that they must try to get miss pettrell who had played the part with godolphin and who had done it with refinement if not with any great force when they had talked to this conclusion grayson proposed getting something to eat and the others refused but they went into the diningroom with him where he showed maxwell the tankards of the members hanging on the walls over their tablesbooths tankard salvinis irvings jeffersons he was surprised that maxwell was not a member of the players and said that he must be it was the only club for him if he was going to write for the stage he came out with them and pointed out several artists whose fame maxwell knew and half a dozen literary men among them certain playwrights they were all smoking and the place was blue with the fumes of their cigars the actors were coming in from the theatres for supper and maxwell found himself with his friends in a group with a charming old comedian who was telling brief vivid little stories and sketching character with illustrations from his delightful art he was not swagger like some of the younger men who stood about with their bellcrowned hats on before they went into supper and two or three other elderly actors who sat round him and took their turn in the anecdote and mimicry looked with their smoothshaven faces like oldfashioned ministers godolphin who was like a youthful priest began to tell stories too and he told very good ones admirably but without appearing to feel their quality though he laughed loudly at them with the rest  when maxwell refused every ones wish to have him eat or drink something and said goodnight grayson had already gone in to his supper and godolphin rose and smiled so fondly upon him that maxwell felt as if the actor had blessed him but he was less sure than in the beginning of the evening that the play was again in godolphins hands and he had to confirm himself from his wifes acceptance of the facts in the belief that it was really so     xxi   louise asked maxwell as soon as they had established their joint faith whom godolphin was going to get to play salome and he said that grayson would like to reengage miss pettrell though he had a theory that the piece would be strengthened and the effect of haxard enhanced if they could have a more powerful salome  mr ray told me at lunch said louise impartially but with an air of relief that in all the lovemaking she was delightful but when it came to the tragedy she wasnt there  grayson seemed to think that if she could be properly rehearsed she could be brought up to it maxwell interposed  mr ray said she was certainly very refined and her salome was always a lady and that is the essential thing louise added decisively i dont at all agree with mr grayson about having salome played so powerfully i think mr godolphin is right  for heavens sake dont tell him so said maxwell we have had trouble enough to get him under  indeed i shall tell him so i think he ought to know how we feel  we repeated maxwell  yes what we want for salome is sweetness and delicacy and refinement for she has to do rather a bold thing and yet keep herself a lady  well it may be too late to talk of miss pettrell now said maxwell your favorite godolphin parted enemies with her  oh stage enemies mr grayson can get her and he must  ill tell him what your orders are said maxwell  the next day he saw the manager but nothing had been done and the affair seemed to be hanging fire again in the evening while he was talking it over with his wife in a discouragement which they could not shake off a messenger came to him with a letter from the argosy theatre which he tore nervously open  what is it dear asked his wife tenderly another disappointment  not exactly he returned with a husky voice and after a moment of faltering he gave her the letter it was from grayson and it was to the effect that he had seen sterne and that sterne had agreed to a proposition he had made him to take maxwells play on the road if it succeeded and in view of this had agreed to let yolande havisham take the part of salome  godolphin was going to get all his old company together as far as possible with the exception of miss pettrell and there was to be little or no delay because the actors had mostly got back to new york and were ready to renew their engagements that no time might be lost grayson asked maxwell to come the next morning and read the piece to such of them as he could get together in the argosy greenroom and give them his sense of it  louise handed him back the letter and said with dangerous calm you might save still more time by going down to mrs harleys apartment and reading it to her at once maxwell was miserably silent and she pursued may i ask whether you knew they were going to try to get her  no said maxwell  was there anything said about her  yes there was last night but both grayson and godolphin regarded it as impossible to get her  why didnt you tell me that they would like to get her  you knew it already and i thought as they both had given up the hope of getting her i wouldnt mention the subject its always been a very disagreeable one  yes louise sat quiet and then she said what a long misery your play has been to me  you havent helped make it any great joy to me said maxwell bitterly  she began to weep silently and he stood looking down at her in utter wretchedness well he said at last what shall i do about it  louise wiped her tears and cleared up cold as we say of the weather she rose as if to leave the room and said haughtily you shall do as you think best for yourself you must let them have the play and let them choose whom they think best for the part but you cant expect me to come to see it  then that unsays all the rest if you dont come to see it i shant and i shall not let them have the piece that is all louise he entreated after these first desperate words cant we grapple with this infernal nightmare so as to get it into the light somehow and see what it really is how can it matter to you who plays the part why do you care whether miss pettrell or mrs harley does it  why do you ask such a thing as that she returned in the same hard frost you know where the idea of the character came from and why it was sacred to me or perhaps you forget  no i dont forget but trycant you tryto specify just why you object to mrs harley  you have your theory you said i was jealous of her  i didnt mean it i never believed that  then i cant explain if you dont understand after all thats been said what is the use of talking im tired of it  she went into her room and he sank into the chair before his desk and sat there thinking when she came back after a while he did not look round at her and she spoke to the back of his head should you have any objection to my going home for a few days  no he returned  i know papa would like to have me and i think you would be less hampered in what you will have to do now if im not here  youre very considerate but if thats what you are going for you might as well stay im not going to do anything whatever  now you mustnt talk foolishly brice she said with an air of superior virtue mixed with a hint of martyrdom i wont have you doing anything rash or boyish you will go on and let them have your play just the same as if i didnt exist she somewhat marred the effect of her selfdevotion by adding and i shall go on just as if it didnt exist he said nothing and she continued you couldnt expect me to take any interest in it after this could you because though i am ready to make any sort of sacrifice for you i think any one i dont care who it was would say that was a little too much dont you think so yourself  you are always right i think that  dont be silly i am trying to do the best i can and you have no right to make it hard for me  maxwell wheeled round in his chair then i wish you wouldnt make your best so confoundedly disagreeable  oh she twitted i see that you have made up your mind to let them have the play after all  yes i have he answered savagely  perhaps you meant to do it all along  perhaps i did  very well then said louise would you mind coming to the train with me on your way down town tomorrow  not at all     xxii   in the morning neither of them recurred to what louise had said of her going home for a few days she had apparently made no preparation for the journey but if she was better than her words in this he was quite as bad as his in going down town after breakfast to let grayson have the play no matter whom he should get to do salome he did not reiterate his purpose but she knew from the sullen leave or noleave which he took of her that it was fixed  when he was gone she had what seemed to her the very worst quarter of an hour she had ever known but when he came back in the afternoon looking haggard but savage her ordeal had long been over she asked him quietly if they had come to any definite conclusion about the play and he answered with harsh aggression yes that mrs harley had agreed to take the part of salome godolphins old company had been mostly got together and they were to have the first rehearsal the next morning  should you like me to come some time asked louise  i should like you very much to come said maxwell soberly but with a latent doubt of her meaning which she perceived  i have been thinking she said whether you would like me to call on mrs harley this evening with you  what for he demanded suspiciously  well i dont know i thought it might be appropriate  maxwell thought a moment i dont think it would be expected after all it isnt a personal thing he said with a relenting in his defiance  no said louise  they got through the evening without further question  they had always had some sort of explicit makingup before even when they had only had a tacit falling out but this time louise thought there had better be none of that they were to rehearse the play every day that week and maxwell said he must be at the theatre the next morning at eleven he could not make out to his wifes satisfaction that he was of much use but he did not try to convince her he only said that they referred things to him now and then and that generally he did not seem to know much about them she saw that his æsthetic honesty kept him from pretending to more than this and she believed he ought to have greater credit than he claimed  four or five days later she went with him to a rehearsal by this time they had got so well forward with their work at the theatre that maxwell said it would now be in appreciable shape but still he warned her not to expect too much he never could tell her just what she wanted to know about mrs harley all he could say was that her salome was not ideal though it had strong qualities and he did not try to keep her from thinking it offensive that would only have made bad worse  it had been snowing overnight and there was a bright glare of sunshine on the drifts which rendered the theatre doubly dark when they stepped into it from the street it was a dramatic event for louise to enter by the stagedoor and to find maxwell recognized by the old man in charge as having authority to do so and she made as much of the strange interior as the obscurity and her preoccupation would allow there was that immediate bareness and roughness which seems the first characteristic of the theatre behind the scenes where the theatre is one of the simplest and frankest of workshops in which certain effects are prepared to be felt before the footlights nothing of the glamour of the front is possible there is a hard air of business in everything and the work that goes to the making of a play shows itself the severest toil figures now came and went in the twilight beyond the reach of the gas in the doorkeepers booth but rapidly as if bent upon definite errands and with nothing of that loitering gayety which is the imagined temperament of the stage  louise and maxwell were to see grayson first in his private office and while their names were taken in the old doorkeeper gave them seats on the mourners bench a hard wooden settee in the corridor which he said was the place where actors wanting an engagement waited till the manager sent word that he could see them the manager did not make the author and his wife wait but came for them himself and led the way back to his room when he gave them seats there maxwell had the pleasure of seeing that louise made an excellent impression with the magnate of whom he had never quite lost the awe we feel for the master of our fortunes whoever he is he perceived that her inalienable worldly splendor added to his own consequence and that his wifes air of grande dame was not lost upon a man who could at least enjoy it artistically grayson was very polite to her and said hopefuller things about the play than he had yet said to maxwell though he had always been civil about its merits he had a number of papers before him and he asked louise if she had noticed their friendliness she said yes she had seen some of those things but she had supposed they were authorized and she did not know how much to value them  grayson laughed and confessed that he did not practice any concealments with the press when it was a question of getting something to the public notice of course he said we dont want the piece to come in on rubbers  what do you mean she demanded with an ignorant joy in the phrase  thats what we call it when a thing hasnt been sufficiently heralded or heralded at all we have got to look after that part of it you know  of course i am not complaining though i think all thats dreadful  the manager assented partly then he said theres something curious about it you may put up the whole affair yourself and yet in whats said you can tell whether theres a real good will that comes from the writers themselves or not  and you mean that there is this mystical kindness for mr maxwells play in the prophecies that all read so much alike to me  yes i do said the manager laughing they like him because hes new and young and is making his way singlehanded  well said louise those seem good grounds for preference to me too and she thought how nearly they had been her own grounds for liking maxwell  grayson went with them to the stage and found her the best place to sit and see the rehearsal he made some one get chairs and he sat with her chatting while men in high hats and overcoats and women in bonnets and furedged butterflycapes came in one after another godolphin arrived among the first with an ulster which came down to where his pantaloons were turned up above his overshoes he caught sight of louise and approached her with outstretched hand and grayson gave up his chair to the actor godolphin was very cordial deferentially cordial with a delicate vein of reminiscent comradery running through his manner she spoke to him of having at last got his ideal for salome and he said with a slight sigh and a sort of melancholy absence yes miss havisham will do it magnificently then he asked with a look of latent significance  have you ever seen her  louise laughed for as darkling a reason only in real life you know we live just over and under each other  ah true but i meant on the stage shes a great artist you know shes the one i wanted for salome from the start  then you ought to be very happy in getting her at last  she will do everything for the play sighed godolphin shell make up for all my shortcomings  you wont persuade us that you have any shortcomings mr godolphin said louise you are haxard and haxard is the play you cant think mr godolphin how deeply grateful we both are to you for your confidence in my husbands work your sacrifices  you overpay me a thousand times for everything mrs maxwell said the actor any one might have been proud and happy to do all ive done and more for such a play ive never changed my opinion for a moment that it was the american drama and now if miss havisham only turns out to be the salome we want  if returned louise and she felt a wild joy in the word why i thought there could be no earthly doubt about it  oh there isnt we are all united on that point i believe maxwell  maxwell shrugged i confide in you and mr grayson  godolphin looked at his watch its eleven now and she isnt here yet i would rather not have begun without her but i think we had better not delay any longer he excused himself to louise and went and sat down with his hat on at a small table lit with a single electric bulb dropping like a luminous spider by a thread from the dark above other electric bulbs were grouped before reflectors on either side of the stage and these shone on the actors before godolphin back in the depths of the stage some scenepainters and carpenters were at work on large strips of canvas lying unrolled upon the floor or stretched upon light wooden frames across godolphins head the dim hollow of the auditorium showed pierced by long bars of sunlight full of dancing motes which slanted across its gloom from the gallery windows women in long aprons were sweeping the floors and pounding the seats and a smell of dust from their labors mixed with the smell of paint and glue and escaping gas which pervaded the atmosphere of the stage  godolphin made maxwell come and sit with him at the table he opened his promptbook and directed the rehearsal to begin the people were mostly well up in their parts and the work went smoothly except for now and then an impatience in godolphin which did not seem to come from what was going forward  he showed himself a thorough master of his trade in its more mechanical details and there were signal instances of his intelligence in the higher things of it which might well have put mrs maxwell to shame for her many hasty judgments of the actor he was altogether more of a man more of a mind than she had supposed even when she supposed the best of him she perceived that godolphin grasped the whole meaning of her husbands work and interpreted its intentions with perfect accuracy not only in his own part of haxard but in all the other persons and he corrected the playing of each of the rôles as the rehearsal went on she saw how he had really formed the other actors upon himself they repeated his tones his attitudes his mannerisms in their several ways his touch could be felt all through the performance and his limitations characterized it he was very gentle and forbearing with their mistakes but he was absolute master all the same if some one erred godolphin left his place and went and showed how the thing should be said and done he carefully addressed the men by their surnames with the mr always the women were all dear to him according to a convention of the theatre he said no dear and yes dear and he was as caressingly deferential to each of them as he was formally deferential to the men he required the same final obedience of them and it was not always so easy to make them obey in nonessentials he yielded at times as when one of the ladies had overdone a point and he demurred but i always got a laugh on that mr godolphin she protested oh well my dear hang on to your laugh then however he meant to do haxard himself his voice was for simplicity and reality in others is that the way you would do it is that the way you would say it if it were you he stopped one of the men in a bit of rant  even of maxwell he exacted as clear a vision of his own work as he exacted of its interpreters he asked the author his notion of points in dress and person among the different characters which he had hitherto only generalized in his mind and which he was gladly willing when they were brought home to him to leave altogether to godolphins judgment  the rehearsal had gone well on towards the end of the first act and godolphin was beginning to fidget from where she sat louise saw him take out his watch and lean towards her husband to say something an actor who was going through a piece of business perceived that he had not godolphins attention and stopped just then mrs harley came in  godolphin rose and advanced towards her with the promptbook shut on his thumb you are late miss havisham  yes she answered haughtily as if in resentment of his tone she added in concession unavoidably but salome doesnt come on till the end of the act  i think it best for the whole company to be present from the beginning said godolphin  i quite agree with you said mrs harley where are we she asked and then she caught sight of louise and came up to her how do you do mrs maxwell i dont know whether im glad to see you or not i believe im rather afraid to have you see my salome ive an idea you are going to be very severe with her  i am sure no severity will be needed youll see me nodding approval all the way through louise returned  i have always thought somehow that you had the part especially under your protection i feel that im a very bold woman to attempt it  in spite of her will to say yes a very bold woman indeed louise answered then i shall admire your courage as well as your art  she was aware of godolphin fretting at the colloquy he could not interrupt and of mrs harley prolonging it wilfully i know you are sincere and i am going to make you tell me everything you object to in me when its over will you  of course louise answered gayly and now mrs harley turned to godolphin again where were you     xxiii   twice during the rehearsal maxwell came to louise and asked her if she were not tired and would not like to go home he offered to go out and put her on a car but both times she made him the same answer she was not tired and would not go away on any account the second time she said with a certain meaning in her look and voice that she thought she could stand it if he could at the end she went up and made her compliments to mrs harley you must enjoy realizing your ideal of a character so perfectly she began  yes did you feel that about it the actress returned it is a satisfaction but if one has a strong conception of a part i dont see how one can help rendering it strongly and this salome she takes hold of me so powerfully her passion and her will that wont stop at anything seem to pierce through and through me you can feel that she wouldnt mind killing a man or two to carry her point  that is certainly what you make one feel about her and you make her very living very actual  you are very good said mrs harley i am so glad you liked it i was dreadfully afraid you wouldnt like it  oh i couldnt imagine your being afraid of anything said louise lightly her smile was one which the other woman might have known how to interpret rightly but her husband alone among men could feel its peculiar quality godolphin beamed with apparent satisfaction in it  wasnt salome magnificent he said and he magnanimously turned to the actress you will make everybody forget haxard you made me forget him  i didnt forget him though said mrs harley i was trying all the time to play up to himand to mrs maxwell  the actor laughed his deep mellow hollow laugh which was a fine work of art in itself and said mrs maxwell you must let me present the other dramatis personæ to you and he introduced the whole cast of the play one after another each said something of the salome how grand it was how impassioned how powerful maxwell stood by listening with his eyes on his wifes face trying to read her thought  they were silent most of the way home and she only talked of indifferent things when the door of their apartment shut them in with themselves alone she broke out horrible horrible horrible well the play is ruined ruined we might as well die or i might i suppose you really liked it  maxwell turned white with anger i didnt try to make her think i did anyway but i knew how you really felt and i dont believe you deceived her very much either all the same i was ashamed to see you try  dont talk to medont speak she knew from every syllable i uttered that i perfectly loathed it and i know that she tried to make it as hateful to me all the way through as she could she played it at me and she knew it was me it was as if she kept saying all the time how do you like my translation of your boston girl into alabama or mississippi or arkansas or wherever i came from this is the way you would have acted if you were me yes that is the hideous part of it her nature has come off on the character and i shall never see or hear or think or dream salome after this without having yolande havisham before me shes spoiled the sweetest thing in my life shes made me hate myself shes made me hate you will you go out somewhere and get your lunch i dont want anything myself and just now i cant bear to look at you oh youre not to blame that i know of if thats what you mean only go  i can go out for lunch certainly said maxwell perhaps you would rather i stayed out for dinner too  dont be cruel dearest i am trying to control myself  i shouldnt have thought it youre not succeeding  no not so well as you if you hated this womans salome as much as i did if its always been as bad as it was today youve controlled yourself wonderfully well never to give me any hint of it or prepare me for it in the least  how could i prepare you you would have come to it with your own prepossessions no matter what i said  was that why you said nothing  you would have hated it if she had played it with angelic perfection because you hated her  perhaps you think she really did play it with angelic perfection well you neednt come back to dinner  louise passed into their room to lay off her hat and sack  i will not come back at all if you prefer maxwell called after her  i have no preferences in the matter she mocked back     xxiv   maxwell and louise had torn at each others hearts till they were bleeding and he wished to come back at once and she wished him to come that they might hurt themselves still more savagely but when this desire passed they longed to meet and bind up one anothers wounds this better feeling brought them together before nightfall when maxwell returned and louise at the sound of his latchkey in the door ran to let him in  mr godolphin is here she said in a loud cheery voice and he divined that he owed something of his eager welcome to her wish to keep him from resuming the quarrel unwittingly he has just come to talk over the rehearsal with you and i wouldnt let him go i was sure you would be back soon  she put her finger to her lip with whatever warning intention and followed her husband into the presence of the actor and almost into his arms so rapturous was the meeting between them  well cried godolphin i couldnt help looking in a moment to talk with you and mrs maxwell about our salome i feel that she will make the fortune of the pieceof any piece doesnt miss havishams rendition grow upon you its magnificent its on the grand scale its immense the more i think about it the more im impressed with it shell carry the house by storm ive never seen anything like it and im glad to find that mrs maxwell feels just as i do about it maxwell looked at his wife who returned his glance with a guiltless eye i was afraid she might feel the loss of things that certainly are lost in it i dont say that miss havishams salome superb as it is is your salomeor mrs maxwells ive always fancied that mrs maxwell had a great deal to do with that character andi dont know whyive always thought of her when ive thought of it but at the same time its a splendid salome she makes it southern almost tropical it isnt the boston salome you may say that it is wanting in delicacy and the nice shades but its full of passion theres nothing caviare to the general in it the average audience will understand just what the girl that miss havisham gives is after and she gives her so abundantly that theres no more doubt of the why than there is of the how sometimes i used to think the house couldnt follow miss pettrell in her subtle touches but the house to the topmost tier of the gallery will get miss havishams intention  godolphin was standing while he said all this and maxwell now asked wont you sit down  the actor had his overcoat on his arm and his hat in one hand he tapped at his boot with the umbrella he held in the other no i dont believe i will thank you the fact is i just dropped in a moment to reassure you if you had misgivings about the salome and to give you my point of view  maxwell did not say anything he looked at louise again and it seemed to her that he meant her to speak she said oh we understood that we couldnt have all kinds of a salome in one creation of the part and im sure no one can see mrs harley in it without feeling her intensity  shes a force said godolphin and if as we all decided he continued to maxwell when we talked it over with grayson that a powerful salome would heighten the effect of haxard she is going to make the success of the piece  you are going to make the success of the piece cried louise  ah i shant care if they forget me altogether said the actor i shall forget myself he laughed his mellow hollow laugh and gave his hand to louise and then to maxwell im so glad you feel as you do about it and i dont wish you to lose your faith in our salome for a moment youve quite confirmed mine he wrung the hands of each with a fervor of gratitude that left them with a disquiet which their eyes expressed to each other when he was gone  what does it mean asked louise  maxwell shook his head its beyond me  brice she appealed after a moment do you think i had been saying anything to set him against her  no he returned instantly why should i suspect you of anything so base  her throat was full but she made out to say no you are too generous too good for such a thing and now she went on to eat humblepie with a selfdevotion which few women could practise i know that if i dont like having her i have no one but myself to thank for it if i had never written to that miserable mr sterne or answered his advertisement he would never have heard of your play and nothing that has happened would have happened  no you dont know that at all said maxwell and it seemed to her that she must sink to her knees under his magnanimity the thing might have happened in a dozen different ways  no matter i am to blame for it when it did happen and now you will never hear another word from me would you like me to swear it  that would be rather unpleasant said maxwell  they both felt a great physical fatigue and they neither had the wish to prolong the evening after dinner maxwell was going to lock the door of the apartment at nine oclock and then go to bed when there came a ring at it he opened it and stood confronted with grayson looking very hot and excited  can i come in a moment the manager asked are you alone can i speak with you  theres no one here but mrs maxwell said her husband and he led the way into the parlor  and if you dont like louise confessed to have overheard him you neednt speak before her even  no no said the manager dont go we may want your wisdom we certainly want all the wisdom we can get on the question its about godolphin  godolphin they both echoed  yes hes given up the piece  the manager drew out a letter which he handed to maxwell and which louise read with her husband over his shoulder it was addressed to grayson and began very formally       dear sir       i wish to resign to you all claim i may have to a joint interest      in mr maxwells piece and to withdraw from the company formed for      its representation i feel that my part in it has been made      secondary to another and i have finally decided to relinquish it      altogether i trust that you will be able to supply my place and i      offer you my best wishes for the success of your enterprise                            yours very truly                                      l godolphin  the maxwells did not look at each other they both looked at the manager and neither spoke  you see said the manager putting the letter back in its envelope its miss havisham i saw some signs of what was coming at the rehearsals but i didnt think it would take such peremptory shape  why but he was here only a few hours ago praising her to the skies said louise and she hoped that she was keeping secret the guilty joy she felt but probably it was not unknown to her husband  oh of course said grayson with a laugh that was godolphins way he may have felt all that he said or he may have been trying to find out what mr maxwell thought and whether he could count upon him in a move against her  we said nothing cried louise and she blessed heaven that she could truly say so which could possibly be distorted into that  i didnt suppose you had said the manager but now we have got to act we have got to do one of two things and godolphin knows it we have got to let miss havisham go or we have got to let him go for my part i would much rather let him go she is a finer artist every way and she is more important to the success of the piece but it would be more difficult to replace him than it would be to replace her and he knows it we could get miss pettrell at once for salome and we should have to look about for a haxard still i am disposed to drop godolphin if mr maxwell feels as i do  he looked at maxwell but louise lowered her eyes and would not influence her husband by so much as a glance it seemed to her that he was a long time answering  i am satisfied with godolphins haxard much better than i am with miss havishams salome strong as it is on the artistic side alone i should prefer to keep godolphin and let her go if it could be done justly then i know that godolphin has made sacrifices and borne losses on account of the play and i think that he has a right to a share in its success if it has a chance of succeeding hes jealous of miss havisham of course i could see that from the first minute but hes earned the first place and im not surprised he wants to keep it i shouldnt like to lose it if i were he i should say that we ought to make any concession he asks in that way  very well said grayson he will ask to have our agreement with mrs harley broken and we can say that we were compelled to break it i feel as you do that he has some right on his side shes a devilish provoking womanexcuse me mrs maxwelland ive seen her trying to take the centre from godolphin ever since the rehearsals began but i dont like to be driven by him still there are worse things than being driven in any case we have to accept the inevitable and its only a question of which inevitable we accept goodnight i will see godolphin at once goodnight mrs maxwell we shall expect you to do what you can in consoling your fair neighbor and reconciling her to the inevitable louise did not know whether this was ironical or not and she did not at all like the laugh from maxwell which greeted the suggestion  i shall have to reconcile sterne and i dont believe that will be half so easy  the managers words were gloomy but there was an imaginable relief in his tone and a final cheerfulness in his manner he left the maxwells to a certain embarrassment in each others presence louise was the first to break the silence that weighed upon them both  brice did you decide that way to please me  i am not such a fool said maxwell  because she said if you did you did very wrong and i dont believe any good could come of it  yet she did not seem altogether averse to the risks involved and in fact she could not justly accuse herself of what had happened however devoutly she had wished for such a consummation     xxv   it was miss havisham and not godolphin who appeared to the public as having ended the combination their managers had formed the interviewing on both sides continued until the interest of the quarrel was lost in that of the first presentation of the play when the impression that miss havisham had been illused was effaced by the impression made by miss pettrell in the part of salome her performance was not only successful in the delicacy and refinement which her friends expected of her but she brought to the work a vivid yet purely feminine force which took them by surprise and made the public her own no one in the house could have felt as the maxwells felt a certain quality in it which it would be extremely difficult to characterize without overstating it perhaps louise felt this more even than her husband for when she appealed to him he would scarcely confess to a sense of it but from time to time in the stronger passages she was aware of an echo to the ear and to the eye of a more passionate personality than miss pettrells had godolphin profited by his knowledge of miss havishams creation and had he imparted to miss pettrell who never saw it hints of it which she used in her own creation of the part if he had just what was the measure and the nature of his sin louise tormented herself with this question while a sense of the fact went as often as it came and left her in a final doubt of it what was certain was that if godolphin had really committed this crime of which he might have been quite unconsciously guilty miss pettrell was wholly innocent of it and indeed the effect she made might very well have been imagined by herself and only have borne this teasing resemblance by pure accident godolphin was justly punished if he were culpable and he suffered an eclipse in any case which could not have been greater from miss havisham there were recalls for the chief actors at every fall of the curtain and at the end of the third act in which godolphin had really been magnificent there began to be cries of author author and a messenger appeared in the box where the maxwells sat and begged the author in godolphins name to come behind at once the next thing that louise knew the actor was leading her husband on the stage and they were both bowing to the house which shouted at them and had them back once and twice and still shouted but now with a certain confusion of voices in its demand which continued till the author came on a fourth time led by the actor as before and himself leading the heroine of his piece then the storm of applause left no doubt that the will of the house had been rightly interpreted  louise sat still with the tears blurring the sight before her they were not only proud and happy tears but they were tears of humble gratitude that it was miss pettrell and not mrs harley whom her husband was leading on to share his triumph she did not think her own desert was great but she could not tax herself with any wrong that she had not at least tried to repair she felt that what she had escaped she could not have suffered and that heaven was merciful to her weakness if not just to her merit perhaps this was why she was so humble and so grateful  there arose in her a vague fear as to what godolphin might do in the case of a salome who was certainly no more subordinated to his haxard than miss havishams or what new demands he might not make upon the author but maxwell came back to her with a message from the actor which he wished conveyed with his congratulations upon the success of the piece this was to tell her of his engagement to miss pettrell which had suddenly taken place that day and which he thought there could be no moment so fit to impart to her as that of their common triumph  louise herself went behind at the end of the piece and made herself acceptable to both the artists in her cordial good wishes neither of them resented the arch intention with which she said to godolphin i suppose you wont mind such a beautiful salome as miss pettrell has given us now that its to be all in the family  miss pettrell answered for him with as complete an intelligence oh i shall know how to subdue her to his haxard if she ever threatens the peace of the domestic hearth  that salome has never done so in any serious measure maxwell argues from the fact that though the godolphins have now been playing his piece together for a whole year since their marriage they have not yet been divorced  the end
