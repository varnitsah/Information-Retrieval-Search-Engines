88088172	the legacy of cain  by wilkie collins   to  mrs henry powell bartley  permit me to add your name to my name in publishing this novel the pen which has written my books cannot be more agreeably employed than in acknowledging what i owe to the pen which has skillfully and patiently helped me by copying my manuscripts for the printer  wilkie collins  wimpole street 6th december 1888      the legacy of cain     first period 18581859 events in the prison related by the governor    chapter i the governor explains  at the request of a person who has claims on me that i must not disown i consent to look back through a long interval of years and to describe events which took place within the walls of an english prison during the earlier period of my appointment as governor  viewing my task by the light which later experience casts on it i think i shall act wisely by exercising some control over the freedom of my pen  i propose to pass over in silence the name of the town in which is situated the prison once confided to my care i shall observe a similar discretion in alluding to individualssome dead some living at the present time  being obliged to write of a woman who deservedly suffered the extreme penalty of the law i think she will be sufficiently identified if i call her the prisoner of the four persons present on the evening before her execution three may be distinguished one from the other by allusion to their vocations in life i here introduce them as the chaplain the minister and the doctor the fourth was a young woman she has no claim on my consideration and when she is mentioned her name may appear if these reserves excite suspicion i declare beforehand that they influence in no way the sense of responsibility which commands an honest man to speak the truth    chapter ii the murderess asks questions  the first of the events which i must now relate was the conviction of the prisoner for the murder of her husband  they had lived together in matrimony for little more than two years the husband a gentleman by birth and education had mortally offended his relations in marrying a woman of an inferior rank of life he was fast declining into a state of poverty through his own reckless extravagance at the time when he met with his death at his wifes hand  without attempting to excuse him he deserved to my mind some tribute of regret it is not to be denied that he was profligate in his habits and violent in his temper but it is equally true that he was affectionate in the domestic circle and when moved by wisely applied remonstrance sincerely penitent for sins committed under temptation that overpowered him if his wife had killed him in a fit of jealous rageunder provocation be it remembered which the witnesses provedshe might have been convicted of manslaughter and might have received a light sentence but the evidence so undeniably revealed deliberate and merciless premeditation that the only defense attempted by her counsel was madness and the only alternative left to a righteous jury was a verdict which condemned the woman to death those mischievous members of the community whose topsyturvy sympathies feel for the living criminal and forget the dead victim attempted to save her by means of highflown petitions and contemptible correspondence in the newspapers but the judge held firm and the home secretary held firm they were entirely right and the public were scandalously wrong  our chaplain endeavored to offer the consolations of religion to the condemned wretch she refused to accept his ministrations in language which filled him with grief and horror  on the evening before the execution the reverend gentleman laid on my table his own written report of a conversation which had passed between the prisoner and himself  i see some hope sir he said of inclining the heart of this woman to religious belief before it is too late will you read my report and say if you agree with me  i read it of course it was called a memorandum and was thus written  at his last interview with the prisoner the chaplain asked her if she had ever entered a place of public worship she replied that she had occasionally attended the services at a congregational church in this town attracted by the reputation of the minister as a preacher he entirely failed to make a christian of me she said but i was struck by his eloquence besides he interested me personallyhe was a fine man  in the dreadful situation in which the woman was placed such language as this shocked the chaplain he appealed in vain to the prisoners sense of propriety you dont understand women she answered the greatest saint of my sex that ever lived likes to look at a preacher as well as to hear him if he is an agreeable man he has all the greater effect on her this preachers voice told me he was kindhearted and i had only to look at his beautiful eyes to see that he was trustworthy and true  it was useless to repeat a protest which had already failed recklessly and flippantly as she had described it an impression had been produced on her it occurred to the chaplain that he might at least make the attempt to turn this result to her own religious advantage he asked whether she would receive the minister if the reverend gentleman came to the prison that will depend she said on whether you answer some questions which i want to put to you first the chaplain consented provided always that he could reply with propriety to what she asked of him her first question only related to himself  she said the women who watch me tell me that you are a widower and have a family of children is that true  the chaplain answered that it was quite true  she alluded next to a report current in the town that the minister had resigned the pastorate being personally acquainted with him the chaplain was able to inform her that his resignation had not yet been accepted on hearing this she seemed to gather confidence her next inquiries succeeded each other rapidly as follows  is my handsome preacher married  yes  has he got any children  he has never had any children  how long has he been married  as well as i know about seven or eight years  what sort of woman is his wife  a lady universally respected  i dont care whether she is respected or not is she kind  certainly  is her husband well off  he has a sufficient income  after that reply the prisoners curiosity appeared to be satisfied she said bring your friend the preacher to me if you likeand there it ended  what her object could have been in putting these questions it seems to be impossible to guess having accurately reported all that took place the chaplain declares with heartfelt regret that he can exert no religious influence over this obdurate woman he leaves it to the governor to decide whether the minister of the congregational church may not succeed where the chaplain of the jail has failed herein is the one last hope of saving the soul of the prisoner now under sentence of death  in those serious words the memorandum ended although not personally acquainted with the minister i had heard of him on all sides as an excellent man in the emergency that confronted us he had as it seemed to me his own sacred right to enter the prison assuming that he was willing to accept what i myself felt to be a very serious responsibility the first necessity was to discover whether we might hope to obtain his services with my full approval the chaplain left me to state the circumstances to his reverend colleague    chapter iii the child appears  during my friends absence my attention was claimed by a sad incidentnot unforeseen  it is i suppose generally known that near relatives are admitted to take their leave of criminals condemned to death in the case of the prisoner now waiting for execution no person applied to the authorities for permission to see her i myself inquired if she had any relations living and if she would like to see them she answered none that i care to see or that care to see meexcept the nearest relation of all  in those last words the miserable creature alluded to her only child a little girl an infant i should say who had passed her first years birthday by a few months the farewell interview was to take place on the mothers last evening on earth and the child was now brought into my rooms in charge of her nurse  i had seldom seen a brighter or prettier little girl she was just able to walk alone and to enjoy the first delight of moving from one place to another quite of her own accord she came to me attracted i daresay by the glitter of my watchchain helping her to climb on my knee i showed the wonders of the watch and held it to her ear at that past time death had taken my good wife from me my two boys were away at harrow school my domestic life was the life of a lonely man whether i was reminded of the bygone days when my sons were infants on my knee listening to the ticking of my watchor whether the friendless position of the poor little creature who had lost one parent and was soon to lose the other by a violent death moved me in depths of pity not easily reached in my later experiencei am not able to say this only i know my heart ached for the child while she was laughing and listening and something fell from me on the watch which i dont deny might have been a tear a few of the toys mostly broken now which my two children used to play with are still in my possession kept like my poor wifes favorite jewels for old remembrance sake these i took from their repository when the attraction of my watch showed signs of failing the child pounced on them with her chubby hands and screamed with pleasure and the hangman was waiting for her motherand more horrid still the mother deserved it  my duty required me to let the prisoner know that her little daughter had arrived did that heart of iron melt at last it might have been so or it might not the message sent back kept her secret all that it said to me was let the child wait till i send for her  the minister had consented to help us on his arrival at the prison i received him privately in my study  i had only to look at his facepitiably pale and agitatedto see that he was a sensitive man not always able to control his nerves on occasions which tried his moral courage a kind i might almost say a noble face and a voice unaffectedly persuasive at once prepossessed me in his favor the few words of welcome that i spoke were intended to compose him they failed to produce the impression on which i had counted  my experience he said has included many melancholy duties and has tried my composure in terrible scenes but i have never yet found myself in the presence of an unrepentant criminal sentenced to deathand that criminal a woman and a mother i own sir that i am shaken by the prospect before me  i suggested that he should wait a while in the hope that time and quiet might help him he thanked me and refused  if i have any knowledge of myself he said terrors of anticipation lose their hold when i am face to face with a serious call on me the longer i remain here the less worthy i shall appear of the trust that has been placed in methe trust which please god i mean to deserve  my own observation of human nature told me that this was wisely said i led the way at once to the cell  chapter iv the minister says yes  the prisoner was seated on her bed quietly talking with the woman appointed to watch her when she rose to receive us i saw the minister start the face that confronted him would in my opinion have taken any man by surprise if he had first happened to see it within the walls of a prison  visitors to the picturegalleries of italy growing weary of holy families in endless succession observe that the idea of the madonna among the rank and file of italian painters is limited to one changeless and familiar type i can hardly hope to be believed when i say that the personal appearance of the murderess recalled that type she presented the delicate light hair the quiet eyes the finelyshaped lower features and the correctly oval form of face repeated in hundreds on hundreds of the conventional works of art to which i have ventured to allude to those who doubt me i can only declare that what i have here written is undisguised and absolute truth let me add that daily observation of all classes of criminals extending over many years has considerably diminished my faith in physiognomy as a safe guide to the discovery of character nervous trepidation looks like guilt guilt firmly sustained by insensibility looks like innocence one of the vilest wretches ever placed under my charge won the sympathies while he was waiting for his trial of every person who saw him including even the persons employed in the prison only the other day ladies and gentlemen coming to visit me passed a body of men at work on the road judges of physiognomy among them were horrified at the criminal atrocity betrayed in every face that they noticed they condoled with me on the near neighborhood of so many convicts to my official place of residence i looked out of the window and saw a group of honest laborers whose only crime was poverty employed by the parish  having instructed the female warder to leave the roombut to take care that she waited within calli looked again at the minister  confronted by the serious responsibility that he had undertaken he justified what he had said to me still pale still distressed he was now nevertheless master of himself i turned to the door to leave him alone with the prisoner she called me back  before this gentleman tries to convert me she said i want you to wait here and be a witness  finding that we were both willing to comply with this request she addressed herself directly to the minister suppose i promise to listen to your exhortations she began what do you promise to do for me in return  the voice in which she spoke to him was steady and clear a marked contrast to the tremulous earnestness with which he answered her  i promise to urge you to repentance and the confession of your crime i promise to implore the divine blessing on me in the effort to save your poor guilty soul  she looked at him and listened to him as if he was speaking to her in an unknown tongue and went on with what she had to say as quietly as ever  when i am hanged tomorrow suppose i die without confessing without repentingare you one of those who believe i shall be doomed to eternal punishment in another life  i believe in the mercy of god  answer my question if you please is an impenitent sinner eternally punished do you believe that  my bible leaves me no other alternative  she paused for a while evidently considering with special attention what she was about to say next  as a religious man she resumed would you be willing to make some sacrifice rather than let a fellowcreature goafter a disgraceful deathto everlasting torment  i know of no sacrifice in my power he said fervently to which i would not rather submit than let you die in the present dreadful state of your mind  the prisoner turned to me is the person who watches me waiting outside  yes  will you be so kind as to call her in i have a message for her  it was plain that she had been leading the way to the delivery of that message whatever it might be in all that she had said up to the present time so far my poor powers of penetration helped me and no further  the warder appeared and received her message tell the woman who has come here with my little girl that i want to see the child  taken completely by surprise i signed to the attendant to wait for further instructions  in a moment more i had sufficiently recovered myself to see the impropriety of permitting any obstacle to interpose between the minister and his errand of mercy i gently reminded the prisoner that she would have a later opportunity of seeing her child your first duty i told her is to hear and to take to heart what the clergyman has to say to you  for the second time i attempted to leave the cell for the second time this impenetrable woman called me back  take the parson away with you she said i refuse to listen to him  the patient minister yielded and appealed to me to follow his example i reluctantly sanctioned the delivery of the message  after a brief interval the child was brought to us tired and sleepy for a while the nurse roused her by setting her on her feet she happened to notice the minister first her bright eyes rested on him gravely wondering he kissed her and after a momentary hesitation gave her to her mother the horror of the situation overpowered him he turned his face away from us i understood what he felt he almost overthrew my own selfcommand  the prisoner spoke to the nurse in no friendly tone you can go  the nurse turned to me ostentatiously ignoring the words that had been addressed to her am i to go sir or to stay i suggested that she should return to the waitingroom she returned at once in silence the prisoner looked after her as she went out with such an expression of hatred in her eyes that the minister noticed it  what has that person done to offend you he asked  she is the last person in the whole world whom i should have chosen to take care of my child if the power of choosing had been mine but i have been in prison without a living creature to represent me or to take my part no more of that my troubles will be over in a few hours more i want you to look at my little girl whose troubles are all to come do you call her pretty do you feel interested in her  the sorrow and pity in his face answered for him  quietly sleeping the poor baby rested on her mothers bosom was the heart of the murderess softened by the divine influence of maternal love the hands that held the child trembled a little for the first time it seemed to cost her an effort to compose herself before she could speak to the minister again  when i die tomorrow she said i leave my child helpless and friendlessdisgraced by her mothers shameful death the workhouse may take heror a charitable asylum may take her she paused a first tinge of color rose on her pale face she broke into an outburst of rage think of my daughter being brought up by charity she may suffer poverty she may be treated with contempt she may be employed by brutal people in menial work i cant endure it it maddens me if she is not saved from that wretched fate i shall die despairing i shall die cursing  the minister sternly stopped her before she could say the next word to my astonishment she appeared to be humbled to be even ashamed she asked his pardon forgive me i wont forget myself again they tell me you have no children of your own is that a sorrow to you and your wife  her altered tone touched him he answered sadly and kindly it is the one sorrow of our lives  the purpose which she had been keeping in view from the moment when the minister entered her cell was no mystery now ought i to have interfered let me confess a weakness unworthy perhaps of my office i was so sorry for the childi hesitated  my silence encouraged the mother she advanced to the minister with the sleeping infant in her arms  i daresay you have sometimes thought of adopting a child she said perhaps you can guess now what i had in my mind when i asked if you would consent to a sacrifice will you take this wretched innocent little creature home with you she lost her selfpossession once more a motherless creature tomorrow she burst out think of that  god knows how i still shrunk from it but there was no alternative now i was bound to remember my duty to the excellent man whose critical position at that moment was in some degree at least due to my hesitation in asserting my authority could i allow the prisoner to presume on his compassionate nature and to hurry him into a decision which in his calmer moments he might find reason to regret i spoke to him does the man live whohaving to say what i had to saycould have spoken to the doomed mother  i am sorry to have allowed this to go on i said in justice to yourself sir dont answer  she turned on me with a look of fury  he shall answer she cried  i saw or thought i saw signs of yielding in his face take time i persistedtake time to consider before you decide  she stepped up to me  take time she repeated are you inhuman enough to talk of time in my presence  she laid the sleeping child on her bed and fell on her knees before the minister i promise to hear your exhortationsi promise to do all a woman can to believe and repent oh i know myself my heart once hardened is a heart that no human creature can touch the one way to my better natureif i have a better natureis through that poor babe save her from the workhouse dont let them make a pauper of her she sank prostrate at his feet and beat her hands in frenzy on the floor you want to save my guilty soul she reminded him furiously theres but one way of doing it save my child  he raised her her fierce tearless eyes questioned his face in a mute expectation dreadful to see suddenly a foretaste of deaththe death that was so near nowstruck her with a shivering fit her head dropped on the ministers shoulder other men might have shrunk from the contact of it that true christian let it rest  under the maddening sting of suspense her sinking energies rallied for an instant in a whisper she was just able to put the supreme question to him  yes or no  he answered yes  a faint breath of relief just audible in the silence told me that she had heard him it was her last effort he laid her insensible on the bed by the side of her sleeping child look at them was all he said to me how could i refuse    chapter v miss chance asserts herself  the services of our medical officer were required in order to hasten the recovery of the prisoners senses  when the doctor and i left the cell together she was composed and ready in the performance of her promise to listen to the exhortations of the minister the sleeping child was left undisturbed by the mothers desire if the minister felt tempted to regret what he had done there was the artless influence which would check him as we stepped into the corridor i gave the female warder her instructions to remain on the watch and to return to her post when she saw the minister come out  in the meantime my companion had walked on a little way  possessed of ability and experience within the limits of his profession he was in other respects a man with a crotchety mind bold to the verge of recklessness in the expression of his opinion and possessed of a command of language that carried everything before it let me add that he was just and merciful in his intercourse with others and i shall have summed him up fairly enough when i joined him he seemed to be absorbed in reflection  thinking of the prisoner i said  thinking of what is going on at this moment in the condemned cell he answered and wondering if any good will come of it  i was not without hope of a good result and i said so  the doctor disagreed with me i dont believe in that womans penitence he remarked and i look upon the parson as a poor weak creature what is to become of the child  there was no reason for concealing from one of my colleagues the benevolent decision on the part of the good minister of which i had been a witness the doctor listened to me with the first appearance of downright astonishment that i had ever observed in his face when i had done he made an extraordinary reply  governor i retract what i said of the parson just now he is one of the boldest men that ever stepped into a pulpit  was the doctor in earnest strongly in earnest there could be no doubt of it before i could ask him what he meant he was called away to a patient on the other side of the prison when we parted at the door of my room i made it a request that my medical friend would return to me and explain what he had just said  considering that you are the governor of a prison he replied you are a singularly rash man if i come back how do you know i shall not bore you  my rashness runs the risk of that i rejoined  tell me something before i allow you to run your risk he said are you one of those people who think that the tempers of children are formed by the accidental influences which happen to be about them or do you agree with me that the tempers of children are inherited from their parents  the doctor as i concluded was still strongly impressed by the ministers resolution to adopt a child whose wicked mother had committed the most atrocious of all crimes was some serious foreboding in secret possession of his mind my curiosity to hear him was now increased tenfold i replied without hesitation  i agree with you  he looked at me with his sense of humor twinkling in his eyes do you know i rather expected that answer he said slyly all right ill come back  left by myself i took up the days newspaper  my attention wandered my thoughts were in the cell with the minister and the prisoner how would it end sometimes i was inclined to doubt with the doctor sometimes i took refuge in my own more hopeful view these idle reflections were agreeably interrupted by the appearance of my friend the chaplain  you are always welcome i said and doubly welcome just now i am feeling a little worried and anxious  and you are naturally the chaplain added not at all disposed to receive a stranger  is the stranger a friend of yours i asked  oh no having occasion just now to go into the waitingroom i found a young woman there who asked me if she could see you she thinks you have forgotten her and she is tired of waiting i merely undertook of course to mention what she had said to me  the nurse having been in this way recalled to my memory i felt some little interest in seeing her after what had passed in the cell in plainer words i was desirous of judging for myself whether she deserved the hostile feeling which the prisoner had shown toward her i thanked the chaplain before he left me and gave the servant the necessary instructions when she entered the room i looked at the woman attentively for the first time  youth and a fine complexion a wellmade figure and a natural grace of movementthese were her personal attractions so far as i could see her defects were to my mind equally noticeable under a heavy forehead her piercing eyes looked out at persons and things with an expression which was not to my taste her large mouthanother defect in my opinionwould have been recommended to mercy in the estimation of many men by her magnificent teeth white wellshaped cruelly regular believers in physiognomy might perhaps have seen the betrayal of an obstinate nature in the lengthy firmness of her chin while i am trying to describe her let me not forget her dress a womans dress is the mirror in which we may see the reflection of a womans nature bearing in mind the melancholy and impressive circumstances under which she had brought the child to the prison the gayety of color in her gown and her bonnet implied either a total want of feeling or a total want of tact as to her position in life let me confess that i felt after a closer examination at a loss to determine it she was certainly not a lady the prisoner had spoken of her as if she was a domestic servant who had forfeited her right to consideration and respect and she had entered the prison as a nurse might have entered it in charge of a child i did what we all do when we are not clever enough to find the answer to a riddlei gave it up  what can i do for you i asked  perhaps you can tell me she answered how much longer i am to be kept waiting in this prison  the decision i reminded her doesnt depend on me  then who does it depend on  the minister had undoubtedly acquired the sole right of deciding it was for him to say whether this woman should or should not remain in attendance on the child whom he had adopted in the meanwhile the feeling of distrust which was gaining on my mind warned me to remember the value of reserve in holding intercourse with a stranger  she seemed to be irritated by my silence if the decision doesnt rest with you she asked why did you tell me to stay in the waitingroom  you brought the little girl into the prison i said was it not natural to suppose that your mistress might want you  stop sir  i had evidently given offense i stopped directly  no person on the face of the earth she declared loftily has ever had the right to call herself my mistress of my own free will sir i took charge of the child  because you are fond of her i suggested  i hate her  it was unwise on my parti protested hate a baby little more than a year old i said  her baby  she said it with the air of a woman who had produced an unanswerable reason i am accountable to nobody she went on if i consented to trouble myself with the child it was in remembrance of my friendshipnotice if you please that i say friendshipwith the unhappy father  putting together what i had just heard and what i had seen in the cell i drew the right conclusion at last the woman whose position in life had been thus far an impenetrable mystery to me now stood revealed as one among other objects of the prisoners jealousy during her disastrous married life a serious doubt occurred to me as to the authority under which the husbands mistress might be acting after the husbands death i instantly put it to the test  do i understand you to assert any claim to the child i asked  claim she repeated i know no more of the child than you do i heard for the first time that such a creature was in existence when her murdered father sent for me in his dying moments at his entreaty i promised to take care of her while her vile mother was out of the house and in the hands of the law my promise has been performed if i am expected having brought her to the prison to take her away again understand this i am under no obligation even if i could afford it to burden myself with that child i shall hand her over to the workhouse authorities  i forgot myself once morei lost my temper  leave the room i said your unworthy hands will not touch the poor baby again she is provided for  i dont believe you the wretch burst out who has taken the child  a quiet voice answered i have taken her  we both looked round and saw the minister standing in the open doorway with the child in his arms the ordeal that he had gone through in the condemned cell was visible in his face he looked miserably haggard and broken i was eager to know if his merciful interest in the prisoner had purified her guilty soulbut at the same time i was afraid after what he had but too plainly suffered to ask him to enter into details  only one word i said are your anxieties at rest  gods mercy has helped me he answered i have not spoken in vain she believes she repents she has confessed the crime  after handing the written and signed confession to me he approached the venomous creature still lingering in the room to hear what passed between us before i could stop him he spoke to her under a natural impression that he was addressing the prisoners servant  i am afraid you will be disappointed he said when i tell you that your services will no longer be required i have reasons for placing the child under the care of a nurse of my own choosing  she listened with an evil smile  i know who furnished you with your reasons she answered apologies are quite needless so far as i am concerned if you had proposed to me to look after the new member of your family there i should have felt it my duty to myself to have refused i am not a nursei am an independent single lady i see by your dress that you are a clergyman allow me to present myself as a mark of respect to your cloth i am miss elizabeth chance may i ask the favor of your name  too weary and too preoccupied to notice the insolence of her manner the minister mentioned his name i am anxious he said to know if the child has been baptized perhaps you can enlighten me  still insolent miss elizabeth chance shook her head carelessly i never heardand to tell you the truth i never cared to hearwhether she was christened or not call her by what name you like i can tell you thisyou will find your adopted daughter a heavy handful  the minister turned to me what does she mean  i will try to tell you miss chance interposed being a clergyman you know who deborah was very well i am deborah now and i prophesy she pointed to the child remember what i say reverend sir you will find the tigresscub take after its mother  with those parting words she favored us with a low curtsey and left the room    chapter vi the doctor doubts  the minister looked at me in an absent manner his attention seemed to have been wandering what was it miss chance said he asked  before i could speak a friends voice at the door interrupted us the doctor returning to me as he had promised answered the ministers question in these words  i must have passed the person you mean sir as i was coming in here and i heard her say you will find the tigresscub take after its mother if she had known how to put her meaning into good english miss chancethat is the name you mentioned i thinkmight have told you that the vices of the parents are inherited by the children and the one particular parent she had in her mind the doctor continued gently patting the childs cheek was no doubt the mother of this unfortunate little creaturewho may or may not live to show you that she comes of a bad stock and inherits a wicked nature  i was on the point of protesting against my friends interpretation when the minister stopped me  let me thank you sir for your explanation he said to the doctor as soon as my mind is free i will reflect on what you have said forgive me mr governor he went on if i leave you now that i have placed the prisoners confession in your hands it has been an effort to me to say the little i have said since i first entered this room i can think of nothing but that unhappy criminal and the death that she must die tomorrow  does she wish you to be present i asked  she positively forbids it after what you have done for me she said the least i can do in return is to prevent your being needlessly distressed she took leave of me she kissed the little girl for the last timeoh dont ask me to tell you about it i shall break down if i try come my darling he kissed the child tenderly and took her away with him  that man is a strange compound of strength and weakness the doctor remarked did you notice his face just now nine men out of ten suffering as he suffered would have failed to control themselves such resolution as his may conquer the difficulties that are in store for him yet  it was a trial of my temper to hear my clever colleague justifying in this way the ignorant prediction of an insolent woman  there are exceptions to all rules i insisted and why are the virtues of the parents not just as likely to descend to the children as the vices there was a fund of good i can tell you in that poor babys fatherthough i dont deny that he was a profligate man and even the horrible motheras you heard just nowhas virtue enough left in her to feel grateful to the man who has taken care of her child these are facts you cant dispute them  the doctor took out his pipe do you mind my smoking he asked tobacco helps me to arrange my ideas  i gave him the means of arranging his ideas that is to say i gave him the matchbox he blew some preliminary clouds of smoke and then he answered me  for twenty years past my friend i have been studying the question of hereditary transmission of qualities and i have found vices and diseases descending more frequently to children than virtue and health i dont stop to ask why there is no end to that sort of curiosity what i have observed is what i tell you no more and no less you will say this is a horribly discouraging result of experience for it tends to show that children come into the world at a disadvantage on the day of their birth of course they do children are born deformed children are born deaf dumb or blind children are born with the seeds in them of deadly diseases who can account for the cruelties of creation why are we endowed with lifeonly to end in death and does it ever strike you when you are cutting your mutton at dinner and your cat is catching its mouse and your spider is suffocating its fly that we are all big and little together born to one certain inheritancethe privilege of eating each other  very sad i admitted but it will all be set right in another world  are you quite sure of that the doctor asked  quite sure thank god and it would be better for you if you felt about it as i do  we wont dispute my dear governor i dont scoff at comforting hopes i dont deny the existence of occasional compensations but i do see nevertheless that evil has got the upper hand among us on this curious little planet judging by my observation and experience that illfated babys chance of inheriting the virtues of her parents is not to be compared with her chances of inheriting their vices especially if she happens to take after her mother there the virtue is not conspicuous and the vice is one enormous fact when i think of the growth of that poisonous hereditary taint which may come with timewhen i think of passions let loose and temptations lying in ambushi see the smooth surface of the ministers domestic life with dangers lurking under it which make me shake in my shoes god what a life i should lead if i happened to be in his place some years hence suppose i said or did something in the just exercise of my parental authority which offended my adopted daughter what figure would rise from the dead in my memory when the girl bounced out of the room in a rage the image of her mother would be the image i should see i should remember what her mother did when she was provoked i should lock my bedroom door in my own house at night i should come down to breakfast with suspicions in my cup of tea if i discovered that my adopted daughter had poured it out oh yes its quite true that i might be doing the girl a cruel injustice all the time but how am i to be sure of that i am only sure that her mother was hanged for one of the most merciless murders committed in our time pass the matchbox my pipes out and my confession of faith has come to an end  it was useless to dispute with a man who possessed his command of language at the same time there was a bright side to the poor ministers prospects which the doctor had failed to see it was barely possible that i might succeed in putting my positive friend in the wrong i tried the experiment at any rate  you seem to have forgotten i reminded him that the child will have every advantage that education can offer to her and will be accustomed from her earliest years to restraining and purifying influences in a clergymans household  now that he was enjoying the fumes of tobacco the doctor was as placid and sweettempered as a man could be  quite true he said  do you doubt the influence of religion i asked sternly  he answered sweetly not at all  or the influence of kindness  oh dear no  or the force of example  i wouldnt deny it for the world  i had not expected this extraordinary docility the doctor had got the upper hand of me againa state of things that i might have found it hard to endure but for a call of duty which put an end to our sitting one of the female warders appeared with a message from the condemned cell the prisoner wished to see the governor and the medical officer  is she ill the doctor inquired  no sir  hysterical or agitated perhaps  as easy and composed sir as a person can be  we set forth together for the condemned cell  chapter vii the murderess consults the authorities  there was a considerate side to my friends character which showed itself when the warder had left us  he was especially anxious to be careful of what he said to a woman in the prisoners terrible situation especially in the event of her having been really subjected to the influence of religious belief on the ministers own authority i declared that there was every reason to adopt this conclusion and in support of what i had said i showed him the confession it only contained a few lines acknowledging that she had committed the murder and that she deserved her sentence from the planning of the crime to the commission of the crime i was in my right senses throughout i knew what i was doing with that remarkable disavowal of the defense set up by her advocate the confession ended  my colleague read the paper and handed it back to me without making any remark i asked if he suspected the prisoner of feigning conversion to please the minister  she shall not discover it he answered gravely if i do  it would not be true to say that the doctors obstinacy had shaken my belief in the good result of the ministers interference i may however acknowledge that i felt some misgivings which were not dispelled when i found myself in the presence of the prisoner  i had expected to see her employed in reading the bible the good book was closed and was not even placed within her reach the occupation to which she was devoting herself astonished and repelled me  some carelessness on the part of the attendant had left on the table the writing materials that had been needed for her confession she was using them nowwhen death on the scaffold was literally within a few hours of herto sketch a portrait of the female warder who was on the watch the doctor and i looked at each other and now the sincerity of her repentance was something that i began to question too  she laid down the pen and proceeded quietly to explain herself  even the little time that is left to me proves to be a weary time to get through she said i am making a last use of the talent for drawing and catching a likeness which has been one of my gifts since i was a girl you look as if you didnt approve of such employment as this for a woman who is going to be hanged well sir i have no doubt you are right she paused and tore up the portrait if i have misbehaved myself she resumed i make amends to find you in an indulgent frame of mind is of importance to me just now i have a favor to ask of you may the warder leave the cell for a few minutes  giving the woman permission to withdraw for a while i waited with some anxiety to hear what the prisoner wanted of me  i have something to say to you she proceeded on the subject of executions the face of a person who is going to be hanged is hidden as i have been told by a white cap drawn over it is that true  how another man might have felt in my place i cannot of course say to my mind such a questionon her lipswas too shocking to be answered in words i bowed  and the body is buried she went on in the prison  i could remain silent no longer is there no human feeling left in you i burst out what do these horrid questions mean  dont be angry with me sir you shall hear directly i want to know first if i am to be buried in the prison  i replied as before by a bow  now she said i may tell you what i mean in the autumn of last year i was taken to see some waxworks portraits of criminals were among them there was one portrait she hesitated her infernal selfpossession failed her at last the color left her face she was no longer able to look at me firmly there was one portrait she resumed that had been taken after the execution the face was so hideous it was swollen to such a size in its frightful deformityoh sir dont let me be seen in that state even by the strangers who bury me use your influenceforbid them to take the cap off my face when i am deadorder them to bury me in it and i swear to you ill meet death tomorrow as coolly as the boldest man that ever mounted the scaffold before i could stop her she seized me by the hand and wrung it with a furious power that left the mark of her grasp on me in a bruise for days afterward will you do it she cried youre an honorable man you will keep your word give me your promise  i gave her my promise  the relief to her tortured spirit expressed itself horribly in a burst of frantic laughter i cant help it she gasped im so happy  my enemies said of me when i got my appointment that i was too excitable a man to be governor of a prison perhaps they were not altogether wrong anyhow the quickwitted doctor saw some change in me which i was not aware of myself he took my arm and led me out of the cell leave her to me he whispered the fine edge of my nerves was worn off long ago in the hospital  when we met again i asked what had passed between the prisoner and himself  i gave her time to recover he told me and except that she looked a little paler than usual there was no trace left of the frenzy that you remember i ought to apologize for troubling you she said but it is perhaps natural that i should think now and then of what is to happen to me tomorrow morning as a medical man you will be able to enlighten me is death by hanging a painful death she had put it so politely that i felt bound to answer her if the neck happens to be broken i said hanging is a sudden death fright and pain if there is any pain are both over in an instant as to the other form of death which is also possible i mean death by suffocation i must own as an honest man that i know no more about it than you do after considering a little she made a sensible remark and followed it by an embarrassing request a great deal she said must depend on the executioner i am not afraid of death doctor why should i be my anxiety about my little girl is set at rest i have nothing left to live for but i dont like pain would you mind telling the executioner to be careful or would it be better if i spoke to him myself i said i thought it would come with a better grace from herself she understood me directly and we dropped the subject are you surprised at her coolness after your experience of her  i confessed that i was surprised  think a little the doctor said the one sensitive place in that womans nature is the place occupied by her selfesteem  i objected to this that she had shown fondness for her child  my friend disposed of the objection with his customary readiness  the maternal instinct he said a cat is fond of her kittens a cow is fond of her calf no sir the one cause of that outbreak of passion which so shocked youa genuine outbreak beyond all doubtis to be found in the vanity of a fine feminine creature overpowered by a horror of looking hideous even after her death do you know i rather like that woman  is it possible that you are in earnest i asked  i know as well as you do he answered that this is neither a time nor a place for jesting the fact is the prisoner carries out an idea of mine it is my positive conviction that the worst murdersi mean murders deliberately plannedare committed by persons absolutely deficient in that part of the moral organization which feels the night before they are hanged they sleep on their last morning they eat a breakfast incapable of realizing the horror of murder they are incapable of realizing the horror of death do you remember the last murderer who was hanged herea gentlemans coachman who killed his wife he had but two anxieties while he was waiting for execution one was to get his allowance of beer doubled and the other was to be hanged in his coachmans livery no no these wretches are all alike they are human creatures born with the temperaments of tigers take my word for it we need feel no anxiety about tomorrow the prisoner will face the crowd round the scaffold with composure and the people will say she died game    chapter viii the minister says goodby  the capital punishment of the prisoner is in no respect connected with my purpose in writing the present narrative neither do i desire to darken these pages by describing in detail an act of righteous retribution which must present by the nature of it a scene of horror for these reasons i ask to be excused if i limit what i must needs say of the execution within the compass of a few wordsand pass on  the one selfpossessed person among us was the miserable woman who suffered the penalty of death  not very discreetly as i think the chaplain asked her if she had truly repented she answered i have confessed the crime sir what more do you want to my mindstill hesitating between the view that believes with the minister and the view that doubts with the doctorthis reply leaves a way open to hope of her salvation her last words to me as she mounted the steps of the scaffold were remember your promise it was easy for me to be true to my word at that bygone time no difficulties were placed in my way by such precautions as are now observed in the conduct of executions within the walls of the prison from the time of her death to the time of her burial no living creature saw her face she rests veiled in her prison grave  let me now turn to living interests and to scenes removed from the thunderclouds of crime    on the next day i received a visit from the minister  his first words entreated me not to allude to the terrible event of the previous day i cannot escape thinking of it he said but i may avoid speaking of it this seemed to me to be the misplaced confidence of a weak man in the refuge of silence by way of changing the subject i spoke of the child there would be serious difficulties to contend with as i ventured to suggest if he remained in the town and allowed his new responsibilities to become the subject of public talk  his reply to this agreeably surprised me there were no difficulties to be feared  the state of his wifes health had obliged him acting under medical advice to try the influence of her native air an interval of some months might elapse before the good effect of the change had sufficiently declared itself and a return to the peculiar climate of the town might bring on a relapse there had consequently been no alternative to but resign his charge only on that day the resignation had been acceptedwith expressions of regret sincerely reciprocated by himself he proposed to leave the town immediately and one of the objects of his visit was to bid me goodby  the next place i live in he said will be more than a hundred miles away at that distance i may hope to keep events concealed which must be known only to ourselves so far as i can see there are no risks of discovery lurking in this place my servants only two in number have both been born here and have both told my wife that they have no wish to go away as to the person who introduced herself to me by the name of miss chance she was traced to the railway station yesterday afternoon and took her ticket for london  i congratulated the minister on the good fortune which had befriended him so far  you will understand how carefully i have provided against being deceived he continued when i tell you what my plans are the persons among whom my future lot is castand the child herself of coursemust never suspect that the new member of my family is other than my own daughter this is deceit i admit but it is deceit that injures no one i hope you see the necessity for it as i do  there could be no doubt of the necessity  if the child was described as adopted there would be curiosity about the circumstances and inquiries relating to the parents prevaricating replies lead to suspicion and suspicion to discovery but for the wise course which the minister had decided on taking the poor childs life might have been darkened by the horror of the mothers crime and the infamy of the mothers death  having quieted my friends needless scruples by this perfectly sincere expression of opinion i ventured to approach the central figure in his domestic circle by means of a question relating to his wife how had that lady received the unfortunate little creature for whose appearance on the homescene she must have been entirely unprepared  the ministers manner showed some embarrassment he prefaced what he had to tell me with praises of his wife equally creditable no doubt to both of them the beauty of the child the pretty ways of the child he said fascinated the admirable woman at first sight it was not to be denied that she had felt and had expressed misgivings on being informed of the circumstances under which the ministers act of mercy had been performed but her mind was too well balanced to incline to this state of feeling when her husband had addressed her in defense of his conduct she then understood that the true merit of a good action consisted in patiently facing the sacrifices involved her interest in the new daughter being in this way ennobled by a sense of christian duty there had been no further difference of opinion between the married pair  i listened to this plausible explanation with interest but at the same time with doubts of the lasting nature of the ladys submission to circumstances suggested perhaps by the constraint in the ministers manner it was well for both of us when we changed the subject he reminded me of the discouraging view which the doctor had taken of the prospect before him  i will not attempt to decide whether your friend is right or wrong he said trusting as i do in the mercy of god i look hopefully to a future time when all that is brightest and best in the nature of my adopted child will be developed under my fostering care if evil tendencies show themselves my reliance will be confidently placed on pious example on religious instruction and above all on intercession by prayer repeat to your friend he concluded what you have just heard me say let him ask himself if he could confront the uncertain future with my cheerful submission and my steadfast hope  he intrusted me with that message and gave me his hand so we parted  i agreed with him i admired him but my faith seemed to want sustaining power as compared with his faith on his own showing as it appeared to me there would be two forces in a state of conflict in the childs nature as she grew upinherited evil against inculcated good try as i might i failed to feel the ministers comforting conviction as to which of the two would win    chapter ix the governor receives a visit  a few days after the good man had left us i met with a serious accident caused by a false step on the stone stairs of the prison  the long illness which followed this misfortune and my removal afterward in the interests of my recovery to a milder climate than the climate of england obliged me to confide the duties of governor of the prison to a representative i was absent from my post for rather more than a year during this interval no news reached me from my reverend friend  having returned to the duties of my office i thought of writing to the minister while the proposed letter was still in contemplation i was informed that a lady wished to see me she sent in her card my visitor proved to be the ministers wife  i observed her with no ordinary attention when she entered the room  her dress was simple her scanty light hair so far as i could see it under her bonnet was dressed with taste the paleness of her lips and the faded color in her face suggested that she was certainly not in good health two peculiarities struck me in her personal appearance i never remembered having seen any other person with such a singularly narrow and slanting forehead as this lady presented and i was impressed not at all agreeably by the flashing shifting expression in her eyes on the other hand let me own that i was powerfully attracted and interested by the beauty of her voice its fine variety of compass and its musical resonance of tone fell with such enchantment on the ear that i should have liked to put a book of poetry into her hand and to have heard her read it in summertime accompanied by the music of a rocky stream  the object of her visitso far as she explained it at the outsetappeared to be to offer her congratulations on my recovery and to tell me that her husband had assumed the charge of a church in a large town not far from her birthplace  even those commonplace words were made interesting by her delicious voice but however sensitive to sweet sounds a man may be there are limits to his capacity for deceiving himselfespecially when he happens to be enlightened by experience of humanity within the walls of a prison i had it may be remembered already doubted the ladys good temper judging from her husbands overwrought description of her virtues her eyes looked at me furtively and her manner gracefully selfpossessed as it was suggested that she had something of a delicate or disagreeable nature to say to me and that she was at a loss how to approach the subject so as to produce the right impression on my mind at the outset there was a momentary silence between us for the sake of saying something i asked how she and the minister liked their new place of residence  our new place of residence she answered has been made interesting by a very unexpected eventan event how shall i describe it which has increased our happiness and enlarged our family circle  there she stopped expecting me as i fancied to guess what she meant a woman and that woman a mother might have fulfilled her anticipations a man and that man not listening attentively was simply puzzled  pray excuse my stupidity i said i dont quite understand you  the ladys temper looked at me out of the ladys shifting eyes and hid itself again in a moment she set herself right in my estimation by taking the whole blame of our little misunderstanding on her own innocent shoulders  i ought to have spoken more plainly she said let me try what i can do now after many years of disappointment in my married life it has pleased providence to bestow on me the happinessthe inexpressible happinessof being a mother my baby is a sweet little girl and my one regret is that i cannot nurse her myself  my languid interest in the ministers wife was not stimulated by the announcement of this domestic event  i felt no wish to see the sweet little girl i was not even reminded of another example of longdeferred maternity which had occurred within the limits of my own family circle all my sympathies attached themselves to the sad little figure of the adopted child i remembered the poor baby on my knee enchanted by the ticking of my watchi thought of her peacefully and prettily asleep under the horrid shelter of the condemned celland it is hardly too much to say that my heart was heavy when i compared her prospects with the prospects of her babyrival kind as he was conscientious as he was could the minister be expected to admit to an equal share in his love the child endeared to him as a father and the child who merely reminded him of an act of mercy as for his wife it seemed the merest waste of time to put her state of feeling placed between the two children to the test of inquiry i tried the useless experiment nevertheless  it is pleasant to think i began that your other daughter  she interrupted me with the utmost gentleness do you mean the child that my husband was foolish enough to adopt  say rather fortunate enough to adopt i persisted as your own little girl grows up she will want a playfellow and she will find a playfellow in that other child whom the good minister has taken for his own  no my dear sirnot if i can prevent it  the contrast between the cruelty of her intention and the musical beauty of the voice which politely expressed it in those words really startled me i was at a loss how to answer her at the very time when i ought to have been most ready to speak  you must surely understand she went on that we dont want another persons child now we have a little darling of our own  does your husband agree with you in that view i asked  oh dear no he said what you said just now and oddly enough almost in the same words but i dont at all despair of persuading him to change his mindand you can help me  she made that audacious assertion with such an appearance of feeling perfectly sure of me that my politeness gave way under the strain laid on it what do you mean i asked sharply  not in the least impressed by my change of manner she took from the pocket of her dress a printed paper you will find what i mean there she repliedand put the paper into my hand  it was an appeal to the charitable public occasioned by the enlargement of an orphanasylum with which i had been connected for many years what she meant was plain enough now i said nothing i only looked at her  pleased to find that i was clever enough to guess what she meant on this occasion the ministers wife informed me that the circumstances were all in our favor she still persisted in taking me into partnershipthe circumstances were in our favor  in two years more she explained the child of that detestable creature who was hangeddo you know i cannot even look at the little wretch without thinking of the gallowswill be old enough with your interest to help us to be received into the asylum what a relief it will be to get rid of that child and how hard i shall work at canvassing for subscribers votes your name will be a tower of strength when i use it as a reference pardon meyou are not looking so pleasantly as usual do you see some obstacles in our way  i see two obstacles  what can they possibly be  for the second time my politeness gave way under the strain laid on it you know perfectly well i said what one of the obstacles is  am i to understand that you contemplate any serious resistance on the part of my husband  certainly  she was unaffectedly amused by my simplicity  are you a single man she asked  i am a widower  then your experience ought to tell you that i know every weak point in the ministers character i can tell him on your authority that the hateful child will be placed in competent and kindly handsand i have my own sweet baby to plead for me with these advantages in my favor do you actually suppose i can fail to make my way of thinking his way of thinking you must have forgotten your own married life suppose we go on to the second of your two obstacles i hope it will be better worth considering than the first  the second obstacle will not disappoint you i answered i am the obstacle this time  you refuse to help me  positively  perhaps reflection may alter your resolution  reflection will do nothing of the kind  you are rude sir  in speaking to you madam i have no alternative but to speak plainly  she rose her shifting eyes for once looked at me steadily  what sort of enemy have i made of you she asked a passive enemy who is content with refusing to help me or an active enemy who will write to my husband  it depends entirely i told her on what your husband does if he questions me about you i shall tell him the truth  and if not  in that case i shall hope to forget that you ever favored me with a visit  in making this reply i was guiltless of any malicious intention what evil interpretation she placed on my words it is impossible for me to say i can only declare that some intolerable sense of injury hurried her into an outbreak of rage her voice strained for the first time lost its tuneful beauty of tone  come and see us in two years time she burst outand discover the orphan of the gallows in our house if you can if your asylum wont take her some other charity will ha mr governor i deserve my disappointment i ought to have remembered that you are only a jailer after all and what is a jailer proverbially a brute do you hear that a brute  her strength suddenly failed her she dropped back into the chair from which she had risen with a faint cry of pain a ghastly pallor stole over her face there was wine on the sideboard i filled a glass she refused to take it at that time in the day the doctors duties required his attendance in the prison i instantly sent for him after a moments look at her he took the wine out of my hand and held the glass to her lips  drink it he said she still refused drink it he reiterated or you will die  that frightened her she drank the wine the doctor waited for a while with his fingers on her pulse she will do now he said  can i go she asked  go wherever you please madamso long as you dont go upstairs in a hurry  she smiled i understand you sirand thank you for your advice  i asked the doctor when we were alone what made him tell her not to go upstairs in a hurry  what i felt he answered when i had my fingers on her pulse you heard her say that she understood me  yes but i dont know what she meant  she meant probably that her own doctor had warned her as i did  something seriously wrong with her health  yes  what is it  heart    chapter x miss chance reappears  a week had passed since the ministers wife had left me when i received a letter from the minister himself  after surprising me as he innocently supposed by announcing the birth of his child he mentioned some circumstances connected with that event which i now heard for the first time  within an easy journey of the populous scene of my present labors he wrote there is a secluded country village called low lanes the rector of the place is my wifes brother before the birth of our infant he had asked his sister to stay for a while at his house and the doctor thought she might safely be allowed to accept the invitation through some error in the customary calculations as i suppose the child was born unexpectedly at the rectory and the ceremony of baptism was performed at the church under circumstances which i am not able to relate within the limits of a letter let me only say that i allude to this incident without any sectarian bitterness of feelingfor i am no enemy to the church of england you have no idea what treasures of virtue and treasures of beauty maternity has revealed in my wifes sweet nature other mothers in her proud position might find their love cooling toward the poor child whom we have adopted but my household is irradiated by the presence of an angel who gives an equal share in her affections to the two little ones alike  in this semihysterical style of writing the poor man unconsciously told me how cunningly and how cruelly his wife was deceiving him  i longed to exhibit that wicked woman in her true characterbut what could i do she must have been so favored by circumstances as to be able to account for her absence from home without exciting the slightest suspicion of the journey which she had really taken if i declared in my reply to the ministers letter that i had received her in my rooms and if i repeated the conversation that had taken place what would the result be she would find an easy refuge in positive denial of the truthand in that case which of us would her infatuated husband believe  the one part of the letter which i read with some satisfaction was the end of it  i was here informed that the ministers plans for concealing the parentage of his adopted daughter had proved to be entirely successful the members of the new domestic household believed the two children to be infantsisters neither was there any danger of the adopted child being identified as the oldest child of the two by consultation of the registers  before he left our town the minister had seen for himself that no baptismal name had been added after the birth of the daughter of the murderess had been registered and that no entry of baptism existed in the registers kept in places of worship he drew the inferencein all probability a true inference considering the characters of the parentsthat the child had never been baptized and he performed the ceremony privately abstaining for obvious reasons from adding her christian name to the imperfect register of her birth i am not aware he wrote whether i have or have not committed an offense against the law in any case i may hope to have made atonement by obedience to the gospel  six weeks passed and i heard from my reverend friend once more  his second letter presented a marked contrast to the first it was written in sorrow and anxiety to inform me of an alarming change for the worse in his wifes health i showed the letter to my medical colleague after reading it he predicted the event that might be expected in two wordssudden death  on the next occasion when i heard from the minister the doctors grim reply proved to be a prophecy fulfilled  when we address expressions of condolence to bereaved friends the principles of popular hypocrisy sanction indiscriminate lying as a duty which we owe to the deadno matter what their lives may have beenbecause they are dead within my own little sphere i have always been silent when i could not offer to afflicted persons expressions of sympathy which i honestly felt to have condoled with the minister on the loss that he had sustained by the death of a woman selfbetrayed to me as shamelessly deceitful and pitilessly determined to reach her own cruel ends would have been to degrade myself by telling a deliberate lie i expressed in my answer all that an honest man naturally feels when he is writing to a friend in distress carefully abstaining from any allusion to the memory of his wife or to the place which her death had left vacant in his household my letter i am sorry to say disappointed and offended him he wrote to me no more until years had passed and time had exerted its influence in producing a more indulgent frame of mind these letters of a later date have been preserved and will probably be used at the right time for purposes of explanation with which i may be connected in the future    the correspondent whom i had now lost was succeeded by a gentleman entirely unknown to me  those reasons which induced me to conceal the names of persons while i was relating events in the prison do not apply to correspondence with a stranger writing from another place i may therefore mention that mr dunboyne of fairmount on the west coast of ireland was the writer of the letter now addressed to me he proved to my surprise to be one of the relations whom the prisoner under sentence of death had not cared to see when i offered her the opportunity of saying farewell mr dunboyne was a brotherinlaw of the murderess he had married her sister  his wife he informed me had died in childbirth leaving him but one consolationa boy who already recalled all that was brightest and best in his lost mother the father was naturally anxious that the son should never become acquainted with the disgrace that had befallen the family  the letter then proceeded in these terms  i heard yesterday for the first time by means of an old newspapercutting sent to me by a friend that the miserable woman who suffered the ignominy of public execution has left an infant child can you tell me what has become of the orphan if this little girl is as i fear not well provided for i only do what my wife would have done if she had lived by offering to make the childs welfare my especial care i am willing to place her in an establishment well known to me in which she will be kindly treated well educated and fitted to earn her own living honorably in later life  if you feel some surprise at finding that my good intentions toward this illfated niece of mine do not go to the length of receiving her as a member of my own family i beg to submit some considerations which may perhaps weigh with you as they have weighed with me  in the first place there is at least a possibilityhowever carefully i might try to conceal itthat the childs parentage would sooner or later be discovered in the second place and assuming that the parentage had been successfully concealed if this girl and my boy grew up together there is another possibility to be reckoned with they might become attached to each other does the father live who would allow his son ignorantly to marry the daughter of a convicted murderess i should have no alternative but to part them cruelly by revealing the truth the letter ended with some complimentary expressions addressed to myself and the question was how ought i to answer it  my correspondent had strongly impressed me in his favor i could not doubt that he was an honorable man but the interest of the minister in keeping his own benevolent action secure from the risk of discoveryincreased as that interest was by the filial relations of the two children toward him now publicly establishedhad as i could not doubt the paramount claim on me the absolutely safe course to take was to admit no one friend or stranger to our confidence i replied expressing sincere admiration of mr dunboynes motives and merely informing him that the child was already provided for  after that i heard no more of the irish gentleman  it is perhaps hardly necessary to add that i kept the minister in ignorance of my correspondence with mr dunboyne i was too well acquainted with my friends sensitive and selftormenting nature to let him know that a relative of the murderess was living and was aware that she had left a child  a last event remains to be related before i close these pages  during the year of which i am now writing our chaplain added one more to the many examples that i have seen of his generous readiness to serve his friends he had arranged to devote his annual leave of absence to a tour among the english lakes when he received a letter from a clergyman resident in london whom he had known from the time when they had been schoolfellows this old friend wrote under circumstances of the severest domestic distress which made it absolutely necessary that he should leave london for a while having failed to find a representative who could relieve him of his clerical duties he applied to the chaplain to recommend a clergyman who might be in a position to help him my excellent colleague gave up his holidayplans without hesitation and went to london himself  on his return i asked if he had seen anything of some acquaintances of his and of mine who were then visitors to the metropolis he smiled significantly when he answered me  i have a card to deliver from an acquaintance whom you have not mentioned he said and i rather think it will astonish you  it simply puzzled me when he gave me the card this is what i found printed on it  mrs tenbruggen of south beveland  well said the chaplain  well i answered i never even heard of mrs tenbruggen of south beveland who is she  i married the lady to a foreign gentleman only last week at my friends church the chaplain replied perhaps you may remember her maiden name  he mentioned the name of the dangerous creature who had first presented herself to me in charge of the prisoners childotherwise miss elizabeth chance the reappearance of this woman on the scenealthough she was only represented by her cardcaused me a feeling of vague uneasiness so contemptibly superstitious in its nature that i now remember it with shame i asked a stupid question  how did it happen  in the ordinary course of such things my friend said they were married by license in their parish church the bridegroom was a fine tall man with a bold eye and a dashing manner the bride and i recognized each other directly when miss chance had become mrs tenbruggen she took me aside and gave me her card ask the governor to accept it she said in remembrance of the time when he took me for a nursemaid tell him i am married to a dutch gentleman of high family if he ever comes to holland we shall be glad to see him in our residence at south beveland there is her message to you repeated word for word  i am glad she is going to live out of england  why surely you have no reason to fear her  none whatever  you are thinking perhaps of somebody else  i was thinking of the minister but it seemed to be safest not to say so   my pen is laid aside and my many pages of writing have been sent to their destination what i undertook to do is now done to take a metaphor from the stagethe curtain falls here on the governor and the prison     second period 1875 the girls and the journals    chapter xi helenas diary  we both said goodnight and went up to our room with a new object in view by our fathers advice we had resolved on keeping diaries for the first time in our lives and had pledged ourselves to begin before we went to bed  slowly and silently and lazily my sister sauntered to her end of the room and seated herself at her writingtable on the desk lay a nicely bound book full of blank pages the word journal was printed on it in gold letters and there was fitted to the covers a bright brass lock and key a second journal exactly similar in every respect to the first was placed on the writingtable at my end of the room i opened my book the sight of the blank leaves irritated me they were so smooth so spotless so entirely ready to do their duty i took too deep a dip of ink and began the first entry in my diary by making a blot this was discouraging i got up and looked out of window  helena  my sisters voice could hardly have addressed me in a more weary tone if her pen had been at work all night relating domestic events well i said what is it  have you done already she asked  i showed her the blot my sister eunice the strangest as well as the dearest of girls always blurts out what she has in her mind at the time she fixed her eyes gravely on my spoiled page and said that comforts me i crossed the room and looked at her book she had not even summoned energy enough to make a blot what will papa think of us she said if we dont begin tonight  why not begin i suggested by writing down what he said when he gave us our journals those wise words of advice will be in their proper place on the first page of the new books  not at all a demonstrative girl naturally not ready with her tears not liberal with her caresses not fluent in her talk eunice was affected by my proposal in a manner wonderful to see she suddenly developed into an excitable personi declare she kissed me oh she burst out how clever you are the very thing to write about ill do it directly  she really did it directly without once stopping to consider without once waiting to ask my advice line after line i heard her noisy pen hurrying to the bottom of a first page and getting threeparts of the way toward the end of a second page before she closed her diary i reminded her that she had not turned the key in the lock which was intended to keep her writing private  its not worth while she answered anybody who cares to do it may read what i write goodnight  the singular change which i had noticed in her began to disappear when she set about her preparations for bed i noticed the old easy indolent movements again and that regular and deliberate method of brushing her hair which i can never contemplate without feeling a stupefying influence that has helped me to many a delicious nights sleep she said her prayers in her favorite corner of the room and laid her head on the pillow with the luxurious little sigh which announces that she is falling asleep this reappearance of her usual habits was really a relief to me eunice in a state of excitement is eunice exhibiting an unnatural spectacle  the next thing i did was to take the liberty which she had already sanctionedi mean the liberty of reading what she had written here it is copied exactly  i am not half so fond of anybody as i am of papa he is always kind he is always right i love him i love him i love him  but this is not how i meant to begin i must tell how he talked to us i wish he was here to tell it himself  he said to me you are getting lazier than ever eunice he said to helena you are feeling the influence of eunices example he said to both of us you are too ready my dear children to sit with your hands on your laps looking at nothing and thinking of nothing i want to try a new way of employing your leisure time  he opened a parcel on the table he made each of us a present of a beautiful book called journal he said when you have nothing to do my dears in the evening employ yourselves in keeping a diary of the events of the day it will be a useful record in many ways and a good moral discipline for young girls helena said oh thank you i said the same but not so cheerfully  the truth is i feel out of spirits now if i think of papa i am not easy in my mind about him when he is very much interested there is a quivering in his face which i dont remember in past times he seems to have got older and thinner all on a sudden he shouts which he never used to do when he threatens sinners at sermontime being in dreadful earnest about our souls he is of course obliged to speak of the devil but he never used to hit the harmless pulpit cushion with his fist as he does now nobody seems to have seen these things but me and now i have noticed them what ought i to do i dont know i am certain of nothing except what i have put in at the top of page one i love him i love him i love him    there this very curious entry ended it was easy enough to discover the influence which had made my slowminded sister so ready with her memory and her penso ready in short to do anything and everything provided her heart was in it and her father was in it  but eunice is wrong let me tell her in what she says of myself  i too have seen the sad change in my father but i happen to know that he dislikes having it spoken of at home and i have kept my painful discoveries to myself unhappily the best medical advice is beyond our reach the one really competent doctor in this place is known to be an infidel but for that shocking obstacle i might have persuaded my father to see him as for the other two doctors whom he has consulted at different times one talked about suppressed gout and the other told him to take a years holiday and enjoy himself on the continent  the clock has just struck twelve i have been writing and copying till my eyes are heavy and i want to follow eunices example and sleep as soundly as she does we have made a strange beginning of this journalizing experiment i wonder how long it will go on and what will come of it   second day  i begin to be afraid that i am as stupidno that is not a nice word to uselet me say as simple as dear eunice a diary means a record of the events of the day and not one of the events of yesterday appears in my sisters journal or in mine well it is easy to set that mistake right our lives are so dull but i would not say so in my fathers hearing for the world that the record of one day will be much the same as the record of another after family prayers and breakfast i suffer my customary persecution at the hands of the cook that is to say i am obliged being the housekeeper to order what we have to eat oh how i hate inventing dinners and how i admire the enviable slowness of mind and laziness of body which have saved eunice from undertaking the worries of housekeeping in her turn she can go and work in her garden while i am racking my invention to discover variety in dishes without overstepping the limits of economy i suppose i may confess it privately to myselfhow sorry i am not to have been born a man  my next employment leads me to my fathers study to write under his dictation i dont complain of this it flatters my pride to feel that i am helping so great a man at the same time i do notice that here again eunices little defects have relieved her of another responsibility she can neither keep dictated words in her memory nor has she ever been able to learn how to put in her stops  after the dictation i have an hours time left for practicing music my sister comes in from the garden with her pencil and paintbox and practices drawing then we go out for a walka delightful walk if my father goes too he has something always new to tell us suggested by what we pass on the way then dinnertime comesnot always a pleasant part of the day to me sometimes i hear paternal complaints always gentle complaints of my housekeeping sometimes my sister i wont say the greedy sister tells me i have not given her enough to eat poor father dear eunice  dinner having reached its end we stroll in the garden when the weather is fine when it rains we make flannel petticoats for poor old women what a horrid thing old age is to look at to be ugly to be helpless to be miserably unfit for all the pleasures of lifei hope i shall not live to be an old woman what would my father say if he saw this for his sake to say nothing of my own feelings i shall do well if i make it a custom to use the lock of my journal our next occupation is to join the scripture class for girls and to help the teacher this is a good discipline for eunices temper andoh i dont deny itfor my temper too i may long to box the ears of the whole class but it is my duty to keep a smiling face and to be a model of patience from the scripture class we sometimes go to my fathers lecture at other times we may amuse ourselves as well as we can till the tea is ready after tea we read books which instruct us poetry and novels being forbidden when we are tired of the books we talk when supper is over we have prayers again and we go to bed there is our day oh dear me there is our day    and how has eunice succeeded in her second attempt at keeping a diary here is what she has written it has one merit that nobody can denyit is soon read  i hope papa will excuse me i have nothing to write about today  over and over again i have tried to point out to my sister the absurdity of calling her father by the infantile nickname of papa i have reminded her that she is in years at least no longer a child why dont you call him father as i do i asked only the other day  she made an absurd reply i used to call him papa when i was a little girl  that i reminded her doesnt justify you in calling him papa now  and she actually answered yes it does what a strange state of mind and what a charming girl in spite of her mind   third day  the morning post has brought with it a promise of some little variety in our livesor to speak more correctly in the life of my sister  our new and nice friends the staveleys have written to invite eunice to pay them a visit at their house in london i dont complain at being left at home it would be unfilial indeed if we both of us forsook our father and last year it was my turn to receive the first invitation and to enjoy the change of scene the staveleys are excellent peoplestrictly pious members of the methodist connectionand exceedingly kind to my sister and me but it was just as well for my moral welfare that i ended my visit to our friends when i did with my fondness for music i felt the temptation of the evil one trying me when i saw placards in the street announcing that the italian opera was open i had no wish to be a witness of the shameful and sinful dancing which goes on i am told at the opera but i did feel my principles shaken when i thought of the wonderful singers and the entrancing music and this when i knew what an atmosphere of wickedness people breathe who enter a theater i reflect with horror on what might have happened if i had remained a little longer in london  helping eunice to pack up i put her journal into the box you will find something to write about now i told her while i record everything that happens at home you will keep your diary of all that you do in london and when you come back we will show each other what we have written my sister is a dear creature i dont feel sure of being able to do it she answered but i promise to try good eunice    chapter xii eunices diary  the air of london feels very heavy there is a nasty smell of smoke in london there are too many people in london they seem to be mostly people in a hurry the head of a country girl when she goes into the streets turns giddyi suppose through not being used to the noise  i do hope that it is london that has put me out of temper otherwise it must be i myself who am illtempered i have not yet been one whole day in the staveleys house and they have offended me already i dont want helena to hear of this from other people and then to ask me why i concealed it from her we are to read each others journals when we are both at home again let her see what i have to say for myself here  there are seven staveleys in all mr and mrs two three young masters five two young misses seven an eldest miss and the second young master are the only ones at home at the present time  mr mrs and miss kissed me when i arrived young master only shook hands he looked as if he would have liked to kiss me too why shouldnt he it wouldnt have mattered i dont myself like kissing what is the use of it where is the pleasure of it  mrs was so glad to see me she took hold of me by both hands she said my dear child you are improving you were wretchedly thin when i saw you last now you are almost as welldeveloped as your sister i think you are prettier than your sister mr didnt agree to that he and his wife began to dispute about me before my face i do call that an aggravating thing to endure  mr said she hasnt got her sisters pretty gray eyes  mrs said she has got pretty brown eyes which are just as good  mr said you cant compare her complexion with helenas  mrs said i like eunices pale complexion so delicate  young miss struck in i admire helenas hairlight brown  young master took his turn i prefer eunices hairdark brown  mr opened his great big mouth and asked a question which of you two sisters is the oldest i forget  mrs answered for me helena is the oldest she told us so when she was here last  i really could not stand that you must be mistaken i burst out  certainly not my dear  then helena was mistaken i was unwilling to say of my sister that she had been deceiving them though it did seem only too likely  mr and mrs looked at each other mrs said you seem to be very positive eunice surely helena ought to know  i said helena knows a good deal but she doesnt know which of us is the oldest of the two  mr put in another question do you know  no more than helena does  mrs said dont you keep birthdays  i said yes we keep both our birthdays on the same day  on what day  the first day of the new year  mr tried again you cant possibly be twins  i dont know  perhaps helena knows  not she  mrs took the next question out of her husbands mouth come come my dear you must know how old you are  yes i do know that im eighteen  and how old is helena  helenas eighteen  mrs turned round to mr do you hear that  mr said i shall write to her father and ask what it means  i said papa will only tell you what he told usyears ago  what did your father say  he said he had added our two ages together and he meant to divide the product between us its so long since i dont remember what the product was then but ill tell you what the product is now our two ages come to thirtysix half thirtysix is eighteen i get one half and helena gets the other when we ask what it means and when friends ask what it means papa has got the same answer for everybody i have my reasons thats all he saysand thats all i say  i had no intention of making mr angry but he did get angry he left off speaking to me by my christian name he called me by my surname he said let me tell you miss gracedieu it is not becoming in a young lady to mystify her elders  i had heard that it was respectful in a young lady to call an old gentleman sir and to say if you please i took care to be respectful now if you please sir write to papa you will find that i have spoken the truth  a woman opened the door and said to mrs staveley dinner maam that stopped this nasty exhibition of our tempers we had a very good dinner    the next day i wrote to helena asking her what she had really said to the staveleys about her age and mine and telling her what i had said i found it too great a trial of my patience to wait till she could see what i had written about the dispute in my journal the days since then have passed and i have been too lazy and stupid to keep my diary  today it is different my head is like a dark room with the light let into it i remember things i think i can go on again  we have religious exercises in this house morning and evening just as we do at home not to be compared with papas religious exercises two days ago his answer came to mr staveleys letter he did just what i had expectedsaid i had spoken truly and disappointed the family by asking to be excused if he refrained from entering into explanations mr said very odd and mrs agreed with him young miss is not quite as friendly now as she was at first and young master was impudent enough to ask me if i had got religion to conclude the list of my worries i received an angry answer from helena nobody but a simpleton she wrote would have contradicted me as you did who but you could have failed to see that papas strange objection to let it be known which of us is the elder makes us ridiculous before other people my presence of mind prevented that you ought to have been grateful and held your tongue perhaps helena is rightbut i dont feel it so  on sunday we went to chapel twice we also had a sermon read at home and a cold dinner in the evening a hot dispute on religion between mr staveley and his son i dont blame them after being pious all day long on sunday i have myself felt my piety give way toward evening  there is something pleasant in prospect for tomorrow all london is going just now to the exhibition of pictures we are going with all london    i dont know what is the matter with me tonight i have positively been to bed without going to sleep after tossing and twisting and trying all sorts of positions i am so angry with myself that i have got up again rather than do nothing i have opened my inkbottle and i mean to go on with my journal now i think of it it seems likely that the exhibition of works of art may have upset me  i found a dreadfully large number of pictures matched by a dreadfully large number of people to look at them it is not possible for me to write about what i saw there was too much of it besides the show disappointed me i would rather write about a disagreement oh dear another dispute i had with mrs staveley the cause of it was a famous artist not himself but his works he exhibited four pictureswhat they call figure subjects mrs staveley had a pencil at every one of the great mans four pictures she made a big mark of admiration on her catalogue at the fourth one she spoke to me perfectly beautiful eunice isnt it  i said i didnt know she said you strange girl what do you mean by that  it would have been rude not to have given the best answer i could find i said i never saw the flesh of any persons face like the flesh in the faces which that man paints he reminds me of waxwork why does he paint the same waxy flesh in all four of his pictures i dont see the same colored flesh in all the faces about us mrs staveley held up her hand by way of stopping me she said dont speak so loud eunice you are only exposing your own ignorance  a voice behind us joined in the voice said excuse me mrs staveley if i expose my ignorance i entirely agree with the young lady  i felt grateful to the person who took my part just when i was at a loss what to say for myself and i looked round the person was a young gentleman  he wore a beautiful blue frockcoat buttoned up i like a frockcoat to be buttoned up he had lightcolored trousers and gray gloves and a pretty cane i like lightcolored trousers and gray gloves and a pretty cane what color his eyes were is more than i can say i only know they made me hot when they looked at me not that i mind being made hot it is surely better than being made cold he and mrs staveley shook hands  they seemed to be old friends i wished i had been an old friendnot for any bad reason i hope i only wanted to shake hands too what mrs staveley said to him escaped me somehow i think the picture escaped me also i dont remember noticing anything except the young gentleman especially when he took off his hat to me he looked at me twice before he went away i got hot again i said to mrs staveley who is he  she laughed at me i said again who is he she said he is young mr dunboyne i said does he live in london she laughed again i said again does he live in london she said he is here for a holiday he lives with his father at fairmount in ireland  young mr dunboynehere for a holidaylives with his father at fairmount in ireland i have said that to myself fifty times over and here it is saying itself for the fiftyfirst time in my journal i must indeed be a simpleton as helena says i had better go to bed again    chapter xiii eunices diary  not long before i left home i heard one of our two servants telling the other about a person who had been bewitched are you bewitched when you dont understand your own self that has been my curious case since i returned from the picture show this morning i took my drawing materials out of my box and tried to make a portrait of young mr dunboyne from recollection i succeeded pretty well with his frockcoat and cane but try as i might his face was beyond me i have never drawn anything so badly since i was a little girl i almost felt ready to cry what a fool i am  this morning i received a letter from papait was in reply to a letter that i had written to himso kind so beautifully expressed so like himself that i felt inclined to send him a confession of the strange state of feeling that has come over me and to ask him to comfort and advise me on second thoughts i was afraid to do it afraid of papa i am further away from understanding myself than ever  mr dunboyne paid us a visit in the afternoon fortunately before we went out  i thought i would have a good look at him so as to know his face better than i had known it yet another disappointment was in store for me without intending it i am sure he did what no other young man has ever donehe made me feel confused instead of looking at him i sat with my head down and listened to his talk his voicethis is high praisereminded me of papas voice it seemed to persuade me as papa persuades his congregation i felt quite at ease again when he went away we shook hands he gave my hand a little squeeze i gave him back the squeezewithout knowing why when he was gone i wished i had not done itwithout knowing why either  i heard his christian name for the first time today mrs staveley said to me we are going to have a dinnerparty shall i ask philip dunboyne i said to mrs staveley oh do  she is an old woman her eyes are dim at times she can look mischievous she looked at me mischievously now i wished i had not been so eager to have mr dunboyne asked to dinner  a fear has come to me that i may have degraded myself my spirits are depressed this as papa tells us in his sermons is a miserable world i am sorry i accepted the staveleys invitation i am sorry i went to see the pictures when that young man comes to dinner i shall say i have got a headache and shall stop upstairs by myself i dont think i like his christian name i hate london i hate everybody  what i wrote up above yesterday is nonsense i think his christian name is perfect i like london i love everybody  he came to dinner today i sat next to him how beautiful a dresscoat is and a white cravat we talked he wanted to know what my christian name was i was so pleased when i found he was one of the few people who like it his hair curls naturally in color it is something between my hair and helenas he wears his beard how manly it curls naturally like his hair it smells deliciously of some perfume which is new to me he has white hands his nails look as if he polished them i should like to polish my nails if i knew how whatever i said he agreed with me i felt satisfied with my own conversation for the first time in my life helena wont find me a simpleton when i go home what exquisite things dinnerparties are   my sister told me when we said goodby to be particular in writing down my true opinion of the staveleys helena wishes to compare what she thinks of them with what i think of them  my opinion of mr staveley isi dont like him my opinion of miss staveley isi cant endure her as for master staveley my clever sister will understand that he is beneath notice but oh what a wonderful woman mrs staveley is we went out together after luncheon today for a walk in kensington gardens never have i heard any conversation to compare with mrs staveleys helena shall enjoy it here at second hand i am quite changed in two things first i think more of myself than i ever did before second writing is no longer a difficulty to me i could fill a hundred journals without once stopping to think  mrs staveley began nicely i suppose eunice you have often been told that you have a good figure and that you walk well  i said helena thinks my figure is better than my face but do i really walk well nobody ever told me that  she answered philip dunboyne thinks so he said to me i resist the temptation because i might be wanting in respect if i gave way to it but i should like to follow her when she goes outmerely for the pleasure of seeing her walk  i stood stockstill i said nothing when you are as proud as a peacock which never happened to me before i find you cant move and cant talk you can only enjoy yourself  kind mrs staveley had more things to tell me she said i am interested in philip i lived near fairmount in the time before i was married and in those days he was a child i want him to marry a charming girl and be happy  what made me think directly of miss staveley what made me mad to know if she was the charming girl i was bold enough to ask the question mrs staveley turned to me with that mischievous look which i have noticed already i felt as if i had been running at the top of my speed and had not got my breath again yet  but this good motherly friend set me at my ease she explained herself philip is not much liked poor fellow in our house my husband considers him to be weak and vain and fickle and my daughter agrees with her father there are times when she is barely civil to philip he is too goodnatured to complain but i see it tell me my dear do you like philip  of course i do out it came in those words before i could stop it was there something unbecoming to a young lady in saying what i had just said mrs staveley seemed to be more amused than angry with me she took my arm kindly and led me along with her my dear you are as clear as crystal and as true as steel you are a favorite of mine already  what a delightful woman as i said just now i asked if she really liked me as well as she liked my sister  she said better  i didnt expect that and didnt want it helena is my superior she is prettier than i am cleverer than i am better worth liking than i am mrs staveley shifted the talk back to philip i ought to have said mr philip no i wont i shall call him philip if i had a heart of stone i should feel interested in him after what mrs staveley has told me  such a sad story in some respects mother dead no brothers or sisters only the father left he lives a dismal life on a lonely stormy coast not a severe old gentleman for all that his reasons for taking to retirement are reasons so mrs staveley says which nobody knows he buries himself among his books in an immense library and he appears to like it his son has not been brought up like other young men at school and college he is a great scholar educated at home by his father to hear this account of his learning depressed me it seemed to put such a distance between us i asked mrs staveley if he thought me ignorant as long as i live i shall remember the reply he thinks you charming  any other girl would have been satisfied with this i am the miserable creature who is always making mistakes my stupid curiosity spoiled the charm of mrs staveleys conversation and yet it seemed to be a harmless question i only said i should like to know what profession philip belonged to  mrs staveley answered no profession  i foolishly put a wrong meaning on this i said is he idle  mrs staveley laughed my dear he is an only sonand his father is a rich man  that stopped meat last  we have enough to live on in comfort at homeno more papa has told us himself that he is not and can never hope to be a rich man this is not the worst of it last year he refused to marry a young couple both belonging to our congregation this was very unlike his usual kind self helena and i asked him for his reasons they were reasons that did not take long to give the young gentlemans father was a rich man he had forbidden his son to marry a sweet girlbecause she had no fortune  i have no fortune and philips father is a rich man  the best thing i can do is to wipe my pen and shut up my journal and go home by the next train    i have a great mind to burn my journal it tells me that i had better not think of philip any more  on second thoughts i wont destroy my journal i will only put it away if i live to be an old woman it may amuse me to open my book again and see how foolish the poor wretch was when she was young  what is this aching pain in my heart  i dont remember it at any other time in my life is it trouble how can i telli have had so little trouble it must be many years since i was wretched enough to cry i dont even understand why i am crying now my last sorrow so far as i can remember was the toothache other girls mothers comfort them when they are wretched if my mother had livedits useless to think about that we lost her while i and my sister were too young to understand our misfortune  i wish i had never seen philip  this seems an ungrateful wish seeing him at the pictureshow was a new enjoyment sitting next to him at dinner was a happiness that i dont recollect feeling even when papa has been most sweet and kind to me i ought to be ashamed of myself to confess this shall i write to my sister but how should she know what is the matter with me when i dont know it myself besides helena is angry she wrote unkindly to me when she answered my last letter  there is a dreadful loneliness in this great house at night i had better say my prayers and try to sleep if it doesnt make me feel happier it will prevent me spoiling my journal by dropping tears on it    what an evening of evenings this has been last night it was crying that kept me awake tonight i cant sleep for joy  philip called on us again today he brought with him tickets for the performance of an oratorio sacred music is not forbidden music among our people mrs staveley and miss staveley went to the concert with us philip and i sat next to each other  my sister is a musiciani am nothing that sounds bitter but i dont mean it so all i mean is that i like simple little songs which i can sing to myself by remembering the tune there my musical enjoyment ends when voices and instruments burst out together by hundreds i feel bewildered i also get attacked by fidgets this last misfortune is sure to overtake me when choruses are being performed the unfortunate people employed are made to keep singing the same words over and over and over again till i find it a perfect misery to listen to them the choruses were unendurable in the performance tonight this is one of them here we are all alone in the wildernessalone in the wildernessin the wilderness alone alone alonehere we are in the wildernessalone in the wildernessall all alone in the wilderness and soon till i felt inclined to call for the learned person who writes oratorios and beg him to give the poor music a more generous allowance of words  whenever i looked at philip i found him looking at me perhaps he saw from the first that the music was wearying music to my ignorant ears with his usual delicacy he said nothing for some time but when he caught me yawning though i did my best to hide it for it looked like being ungrateful for the tickets then he could restrain himself no longer he whispered in my ear  you are getting tired of this and so am i  i am trying to like it i whispered back  dont try he answered lets talk  he meant of course talk in whispers we were a good deal annoyedespecially when the characters were all alone in the wildernessby bursts of singing and playing which interrupted us at the most interesting moments philip persevered with a manly firmness what could i do but follow his exampleat a distance  he said is it really true that your visit to mrs staveley is coming to an end  i answered it comes to an end the day after tomorrow  are you sorry to be leaving your friends in london  what i might have said if he had made that inquiry a day earlier when i was the most miserable creature living i would rather not try to guess being quite happy as things were i could honestly tell him i was sorry  you cant possibly be as sorry as i am eunice may i call you by your pretty name  yes if you please  eunice  yes  you will leave a blank in my life when you go away  there another chorus stopped him just as i was eager for more it was such a delightfully new sensation to hear a young gentleman telling me that i had left a blank in his life the next change in the oratorio brought up a young lady singing alone some people behind us grumbled at the smallness of her voice we thought her voice perfect it seemed to lend itself so nicely to our whispers  he said will you help me to think of you while you are away i want to imagine what your life is at home do you live in a town or in the country  i told him the name of our town when we give a person information i have always heard that we ought to make it complete so i mentioned our address in the town but i was troubled by a doubt perhaps he preferred the country being anxious about this i said would you rather have heard that i live in the country  live where you may eunice the place will be a favorite place of mine besides your town is famous it has a public attraction which brings visitors to it  i made another of those mistakes which no sensible girl in my position would have committed i asked if he alluded to our new marketplace  he set me right in the sweetest manner i alluded to a building hundreds of years older than your marketplaceyour beautiful cathedral  fancy my not having thought of the cathedral this is what comes of being a congregationalist if i had belonged to the church of england i should have forgotten the marketplace and remembered the cathedral not that i want to belong to the church of england papas chapel is good enough for me  the song sung by the lady with the small voice was so pretty that the audience encored it didnt philip and i help them with the sweetest smiles the lady sang it all over again the people behind us left the concert  he said do you know i take the greatest interest in cathedrals i propose to enjoy the privilege and pleasure of seeing your cathedral early next week  i had only to look at him to see that i was the cathedral it was no surprise to hear next that he thought of paying his respects to mr gracedieu he begged me to tell him what sort of reception he might hope to meet with when he called at our house i got so excited in doing justice to papa that i quite forgot to whisper when the next question came philip wanted to know if mr gracedieu disliked strangers when i answered oh dear no i said it out loud so that the people heard me cruel cruel people they all turned round and stared one hideous old woman actually said silence miss staveley looked disgusted even kind mrs staveley lifted her eyebrows in astonishment  philip dear philip protected and composed me  he held my hand devotedly till the end of the performance when he put us into the carriage i was last he whispered in my ear expect me next week miss staveley might be as illnatured as she pleased on the way home it didnt matter what she said the eunice of yesterday might have been mortified and offended the eunice of today was indifferent to the sharpest things that could be said to her    all through yesterdays delightful evening i never once thought of philips father when i woke this morning i remembered that old mr dunboyne was a rich man i could eat no breakfast for thinking of the poor girl who was not allowed to marry her young gentleman because she had no money  mrs staveley waited to speak to me till the rest of them had left us together i had expected her to notice that i looked dull and dismal no her cleverness got at my secret in quite another way  she said how do you feel after the concert you must be hard to please indeed if you were not satisfied with the accompaniments last night  the accompaniments of the oratorio  no my dear the accompaniments of philip  i suppose i ought to have laughed in my miserable state of mind it was not to be done i said i hope mr dunboynes father will not hear how kind he was to me  mrs staveley asked why  my bitterness overflowed at my tongue i said because papa is a poor man  and philips papa is a rich man says mrs staveley putting my own thought into words for me where do you get these ideas eunice surely you are not allowed to read novels  oh no  and you have certainly never seen a play  never  clear your head child of the nonsense that has got into iti cant think how rich mr dunboyne has taught his heir to despise the base act of marrying for money he knows that philip will meet young ladies at my house and he has written to me on the subject of his sons choice of a wife let philip find good principles good temper and good looks and i promise beforehand to find the money there is what he says are you satisfied with philips father now  i jumped up in a state of ecstasy just as i had thrown my arms round mrs staveleys neck the servant came in with a letter and handed it to me  helena had written again on this last day of my visit her letter was full of instructions for buying things that she wants before i leave london i read on quietly enough until i came to the postscript the effect of it on me may be told in two words i screamed mrs staveley was naturally alarmed bad news she asked being quite unable to offer an opinion i read the postscript out loud and left her to judge for herself  this was helenas news from home  i must prepare you for a surprise before your return you will find a strange lady established at home dont suppose there is any prospect of her bidding us goodby if we only wait long enough she is already with fathers full approval as much a member of the family as we are you shall form your own unbiased opinion of her eunice for the present i say no more  i asked mrs staveley what she thought of my news from home she said your father approves of the lady my dear i suppose its good news  but mrs staveley did not look as if she believed in the good news for all that    chapter xiv helenas diary  today i went as usual to the scriptureclass for girls it was harder work than ever teaching without eunice to help me indeed i felt lonely all day without my sister when i got home i rather hoped that some friend might have come to see us and have been asked to stay to tea the housemaid opened the door to me i asked maria if anybody had called  yes miss a lady to see the master  a stranger  never saw her before miss in all my life i put no more questions many ladies visit my father they call it consulting the minister he advises them in their troubles and guides them in their religious difficulties and so on they come and go in a sort of secrecy so far as i know they are mostly old maids and they waste the ministers time  when my father came in to tea i began to feel some curiosity about the lady who had called on him visitors of that sort in general never appear to dwell on his mind after they have gone away he sees too many of them and is too well accustomed to what they have to say on this particular evening however i perceived appearances that set me thinking he looked worried and anxious  has anything happened father to vex you i said  yes  is the lady concerned in it  what lady my dear  the lady who called on you while i was out  who told you she had called on me  i asked maria  that will do helena for the present  he drank his tea and went back to his study instead of staying a while and talking pleasantly as usual my respect submitted to his want of confidence in me but my curiosity was in a state of revolt i sent for maria and proceeded to make my own discoveries with this result  no other person had called at the house nothing had happened except the visit of the mysterious lady she looked between young and old and oh dear me she was certainly not pretty not dressed nicely to my mind but they do say dress is a matter of taste  try as i might i could get no more than that out of our stupid young housemaid  later in the evening the cook had occasion to consult me about supper this was a person possessing the advantages of age and experience i asked if she had seen the lady the cooks reply promised something new i cant say i saw the lady but i heard her  do you mean that you heard her speaking  no misscrying  where was she crying  in the masters study  how did you come to hear her  am i to understand miss that you suspect me of listening  is a lie told by a look as bad as a lie told by words i looked shocked at the bare idea of suspecting a respectable person of listening the cooks sense of honor was satisfied she readily explained herself i was passing the door miss on my way upstairs  here my discoveries came to an end it was certainly possible that an afflicted member of my fathers congregation might have called on him to be comforted but he sees plenty of afflicted ladies without looking worried and anxious after they leave him still suspecting something out of the ordinary course of events i waited hopefully for our next meeting at suppertime nothing came of it my father left me by myself again when the meal was over he is always courteous to his daughters and he made an apology excuse me helena i want to think    i went to bed in a vile humor and slept badly wondering in the long wakeful hours what new rebuff i should meet with on the next day  at breakfast this morning i was agreeably surprised no signs of anxiety showed themselves in my fathers face instead of retiring to his study when we rose from the table he proposed taking a turn in the garden you are looking pale helena and you will be the better for a little fresh air besides i have something to say to you  excitement i am sure is good for young women i saw in his face i heard in his last words that the mystery of the lady was at last to be revealed the sensation of languor and fatigue which follows a disturbed night left me directly  my father gave me his arm and we walked slowly up and down the lawn  when that lady called on me yesterday he began you wanted to know who she was and you were surprised and disappointed when i refused to gratify your curiosity my silence was not a selfish silence helena i was thinking of you and your sister and i was at a loss how to act for the best you shall hear why my children were in my mind presently i must tell you first that i have arrived at a decision i hope and believe on reasonable grounds ask me any questions you please my silence will be no longer an obstacle in your way  this was so very encouraging that i said at once i should like to know who the lady is  the lady is related to me he answered we are cousins  here was a disclosure that i had not anticipated in the little that i have seen of the world i have observed that cousinswhen they happen to be brought together under interesting circumstancescan remember their relationship and forget their relationship just as it suits them is your cousin a married lady i ventured to inquire  no  short as it was that reply might perhaps mean more than appeared on the surface the cook had heard the lady crying what sort of tender agitation was answerable for those tears was it possible barely possible that eunice and i might go to bed one night a widowers daughters and wake up the next day to discover a stepmother  have i or my sister ever seen the lady i asked  never she has been living abroad and i have not seen her myself since we were both young people  my excellent innocent father not the faintest idea of what i had been thinking of was in his mind little did he suspect how welcome was the relief that he had afforded to his daughters wicked doubts of him but he had not said a word yet about his cousins personal appearance there might be remains of good looks which the housemaid was too stupid to discover  after the long interval that has passed since you met i said i suppose she has become an old woman  no my dear let us say a middleaged woman  perhaps she is still an attractive person  he smiled i am afraid helena that would never have been a very accurate description of her  i now knew all that i wanted to know about this alarming person excepting one last morsel of information which my father had strangely forgotten  we have been talking about the lady for some time i said and you have not yet told me her name  father looked a little embarrassed its not a very pretty name he answered my cousin my unfortunate cousin ismiss jillgall  i burst out with such a loud oh that he laughed i caught the infection and laughed louder still bless miss jillgall the interview promised to become an easy one for both of us thanks to her name i was in good spirits and i made no attempt to restrain them the next time miss jillgall honors you with a visit i said you must give me an opportunity of being presented to her  he made a strange reply you may find your opportunity helena sooner than you anticipate  did this mean that she was going to call again in a day or two i am afraid i spoke flippantly i said oh father another lady fascinated by the popular preacher  the garden chairs were near us he signed to me gravely to be seated by his side and said to himself this is my fault  what is your fault i asked  i have left you in ignorance my dear of my cousins sad story it is soon told and if it checks your merriment it will make amends by deserving your sympathy i was indebted to her father when i was a boy for acts of kindness which i can never forget he was twice married the death of his first wife left him with one childonce my playfellow now the lady whose visit has excited your curiosity his second wife was a belgian she persuaded him to sell his business in london and to invest the money in a partnership with a brother of hers established as a sugarrefiner at antwerp the little daughter accompanied her father to belgium are you attending to me helena  i was waiting for the interesting part of the story and was wondering when he would get to it  as time went on he resumed the new partner found that the value of the business at antwerp had been greatly overrated after a long struggle with adverse circumstances he decided on withdrawing from the partnership before the whole of his capital was lost in a failing commercial speculation the end of it was that he retired with his daughter to a small town in east flanders the wreck of his property having left him with an income of no more than two hundred pounds a year  i showed my father that i was attending to him now by inquiring what had become of the belgian wife those nervous quiverings which eunice has mentioned in her diary began to appear in his face  it is too shameful a story he said to be told to a young girl the marriage was dissolved by law and the wife was the person to blame i am sure helena you dont wish to hear any more of this part of the story  i did wish but i saw that he expected me to say noso i said it  the father and daughter he went on never so much as thought of returning to their own country they were too poor to live comfortably in england in belgium their income was sufficient for their wants on the fathers death the daughter remained in the town she had friends there and friends nowhere else and she might have lived abroad to the end of her days but for a calamity to which we are all liable a long and serious illness completely prostrated her skilled medical attendance costing large sums of money for the doctors traveling expenses was imperatively required experienced nurses summoned from a distant hospital were in attendance night and day luxuries far beyond the reach of her little income were absolutely required to support her wasted strength at the time of her tedious recovery in one word her resources were sadly diminished when the poor creature had paid her debts and had regained her hold on life at that time she unhappily met with the man who has ruined her  it was getting interesting at last ruined her i repeated do you mean that he robbed her  that helena is exactly what i meanand many and many a helpless woman has been robbed in the same way the man of whom i am now speaking was a lawyer in large practice he bore an excellent character and was highly respected for his exemplary life my cousin not at all a discreet person i am bound to admit was induced to consult him on her pecuniary affairs he expressed the most generous sympathyoffered to employ her little capital in his businessand pledged himself to pay her double the interest for her money which she had been in the habit of receiving from the sound investment chosen by her father  and of course he got the money and never paid the interest eager to hear the end i interrupted the story in those inconsiderate words my fathers answer quietly reproved me  he paid the interest regularly as long as he lived  and what happened when he died  he died a bankrupt the secret profligacy of his life was at last exposed nothing actually nothing was left for his creditors the unfortunate creature whose ugly name has amused you must get help somewhere or must go to the workhouse  if i had been in a state of mind to attend to trifles this would have explained the reason why the cook had heard miss jillgall crying but the prospect before methe unendurable prospect of having a strange woman in the househad showed itself too plainly to be mistaken i could think of nothing else with infinite difficulty i assumed a momentary appearance of composure and suggested that miss jillgalls foreign friends might have done something to help her  my father defended her foreign friends my dear they were poor people and did all they could afford to do but for their kindness my cousin might not have been able to return to england  and to cast herself on your mercy i added in the character of a helpless woman  no helena not to cast herself on my mercybut to find my house open to her as her fathers house was open to me in the bygone time i am her only surviving relative and while i live she shall not be a helpless woman  i began to wish that i had not spoken out so plainly my fathers sweet temperi do so sincerely wish i had inherited itmade the kindest allowances for me  i understand the momentary bitterness of feeling that has escaped you he said i may almost say that i expected it my only hesitation in this matter has been caused by my sense of what i owe to my children it was putting your endurance and your sisters endurance to a trial to expect you to receive a stranger and that stranger not a young girl like yourselves as one of the household living with you in the closest intimacy of family life the consideration which has decided me does justice i hope to you and eunice as well as to myself i think that some allowance is due from my daughters to the father who has always made loving allowance for them am i wrong in believing that my good children have not forgotten this and have only waited for the occasion to feel the pleasure of rewarding me  it was beautifully put there was but one thing to be donei kissed him and there was but one thing to be said i asked at what time we might expect to receive miss jillgall she is staying helena at a small hotel in the town i have already sent to say that we are waiting to see her perhaps you will look at the spare bedroom  it shall be got ready father directly  i ran into the house i rushed upstairs into the room that is eunices and mine i locked the door and then i gave way to my rage before it stifled me i stamped on the floor i clinched my fists i cast myself on the bed i reviled that hateful woman by every hard word that i could throw at her oh the luxury of it the luxury of it  cold water and my hairbrush soon made me fit to be seen again  as for the spare room it looked a great deal too comfortable for an incubus from foreign parts the one improvement that i could have made if a friend of mine had been expected was suggested by the windowcurtains i was looking at a torn place in one of them and determined to leave it unrepaired when i felt an arm slipped round my waist from behind a voice so close that it tickled my neck said dear girl what friends we shall be i turned round and confronted miss jillgall  chapter xv helenas diary  if i am not a good girl where is a good girl to be found this is in eunices style it sometimes amuses me to mimic my simple sister  i have just torn three pages out of my diary in deference to the expression of my fathers wishes he took the first opportunity which his cousin permitted him to enjoy of speaking to me privately and his object was to caution me against hastily relying on first impressions of anybodyespecially of miss jillgall wait for a day or two he said and then form your estimate of the new member of our household  the stormy state of my temper had passed away and had left my atmosphere calm again i could feel that i had received good advice but unluckily it reached me too late  i had formed my estimate of miss jillgall and had put it in writing for my own satisfaction at least an hour before my father found himself at liberty to speak to me i dont agree with him in distrusting first impressions and i had proposed to put my opinion to the test by referring to what i had written about his cousin at a later time however after what he had said to me i felt bound in filial duty to take the pages out of my book and to let two days pass before i presumed to enjoy the luxury of hating miss jillgall on one thing i am determined eunice shall not form a hasty opinion either she shall undergo the same severe discipline of selfrestraint to which her sister is obliged to submit let us be just as somebody says before we are generous no more for today    i open my diary againafter the prescribed interval has elapsed the first impression produced on me by the new member of our household remains entirely unchanged  have i already made the remark that when one removes a page from a book it does not necessarily follow that one destroys the page afterward or did i leave this to be inferred in either case my course of proceeding was the same i ordered some paste to be made then i unlocked a drawer and found my poor illused leaves and put them back in my journal an act of justice is surely not the less praiseworthy because it is an act of justice done to ones self  my father has often told me that he revises his writings on religious subjects i may harmlessly imitate that good example by revising my restored entry it is now a sufficiently remarkable performance to be distinguished by a title let me call it  impressions of miss jillgall my first impression was a strong oneit was produced by the state of this ladys breath in other words i was obliged to let her kiss me it is a duty to be considerate toward human infirmity i will only say that i thought i should have fainted  my second impression draws a portrait and produces a striking likeness  figure little and leanhair of a dirty drab color which we see in stringsmall light gray eyes sly and restless and deeply sunk in the headprominent cheekbones and a florid complexionan inquisitive nose turning up at the enda large mouth and a servile smilerawlooking hands decorated with black mittensa misfitting white jacket and a limp skirtmanners familiartemper cleverly hiddenvoice too irritating to be mentioned whose portrait is this it is the portrait of miss jillgall taken in words  her true character is not easy to discover i suspect that it will only show itself little by little that she is a born meddler in other peoples affairs i think i can see already i also found out that she trusted to flattery as the easiest means of making herself agreeable she tried her first experiment on myself  you charming girl she began your bright face encourages me to ask a favor pray make me useful the one aspiration of my life is to be useful unless you employ me in that way i have no right to intrude myself into your family circle yes yes i know that your father has opened his house and his heart to me but i dare not found any claimyour name is helena isnt it dear helena i dare not found any claim on what i owe to your fathers kindness  why not i inquired  because your father is not a man  i was rude enough to interrupt her what is he then  an angel miss jillgall answered solemnly a destitute earthly creature like me must not look up as high as your father i might be dazzled  this was rather more than i could endure patiently let us try i suggested if we cant understand each other at starting  miss jillgalls little eyes twinkled in their bony caverns the very thing i was going to propose she burst out  very well i went on then let me tell you plainly that flattery is not relished in this house  flattery she put her hand to her head as she repeated the word and looked quite bewildered dear helena i have lived all my life in east flanders and my own language is occasionally strange to me can you tell me what flattery is in flemish  i dont understand flemish  how very provoking you dont understand flemish and i dont understand flattery i should so like to know what it means ah i see books in this lovely room is there a dictionary among them she darted to the bookcase and discovered a dictionary now i shall understand flattery she remarkedand then we shall understand each other oh let me find it for myself she ran her raw red finger along the alphabetical headings at the top of each page fad that wont do fie further on still fle too far the other way fla here we are flattery false praise commendation bestowed for the purpose of gaining favor and influence oh helena how cruel of you she dropped the book and sank into a chairthe picture if such a thing can be of a brokenhearted old maid  i should most assuredly have taken the opportunity of leaving her to her own devices if i had been free to act as i pleased but my interests as a daughter forbade me to make an enemy of my fathers cousin on the first day when she had entered the house i made an apology very neatly expressed  she jumped uplet me do her justice miss jillgall is as nimble as a monkeyand faugh she kissed me for the second time if i had been a man i am afraid i should have called for that deadly poison we are all temperance people in this house known by the name of brandy  if you will make me love you miss jillgall explained you must expect to be kissed dear girl let us go back to my poor little petition oh do make me useful there are so many things i can do you will find me a treasure in the house i write a good hand i understand polishing furniture i can dress hair look at my own hair i play and sing a little when people want to be amused i can mix a salad and knit stockingswho is this the cook came in at the moment to consult me i introduced her and oh cried miss jillgall in ecstasy i can cook do please let me see the kitchen  the cooks face turned red she had come to me to make a confession and she had not as she afterward said bargained for the presence of a stranger for the first time in her life she took the liberty of whispering to me i must ask you miss to let me send up the cauliflower plain boiled i dont understand the directions in the book for doing it in the foreign way  miss jillgalls earsperhaps because they are so largepossess a quickness of hearing quite unparalleled in my experience not one word of the cooks whispered confession had escaped her  here she declared is an opportunity of making myself useful what is the cooks name hannah take me downstairs hannah and ill show you how to do the cauliflower in the foreign way she seems to hesitate is it possible that she doesnt believe me listen hannah and judge for yourself if i am deceiving you have you boiled the cauliflower very well this is what you must do next take four ounces of grated cheese two ounces of best butter the yolks of four eggs a little bit of glaze lemonjuice nutmegdear dear how black she looks what have i said to offend her  the cook passed over the lady who had presumed to instruct her as if no such person had been present and addressed herself to me if i am to be interfered with in my own kitchen miss i will ask you to suit yourself at a months notice  miss jillgall wrung her hands in despair  i meant so kindly she said and i seem to have made mischief with the best intentions helena i have set you and your servant at variance i really didnt know you had such a temper hannah she declared following the cook to the door im sure theres nothing i am not ready to do to make it up with you perhaps you have not got the cheese downstairs im ready to go out and buy it for you i could show you how to keep eggs sweet and fresh for weeks together your gown doesnt fit very well i shall be glad to improve it if you will leave it out for me after you have gone to bed there cried miss jillgall as the cook majestically left the room without even looking at her i have done my best to make it up and you see how my advances are received what more could i have done i really ask you dear as a friend what more could i have done  i had it on the tip of my tongue to say the cook doesnt ask you to buy cheese for her or to teach her how to keep eggs or to improve the fit of her gown all she wants is to have her kitchen to herself but here again it was necessary to remember that this odious person was my fathers guest  pray dont distress yourself i began i am sure you are not to blame miss jillgall  oh dont  dontwhat  dont call me miss jillgall i call you helena call me selina  i had really not supposed it possible that she could be more unendurable than ever when she mentioned her christian name she succeeded nevertheless in producing that result in the whole list of womens names is there any one to be found so absolutely sickening as selina i forced myself to pronounce it i made another neatlyexpressed apology i said english servants were so very peculiar selina was more than satisfied she was quite delighted  is that it indeed an explanation was all i wanted how good of you and now tell meis there no chance in the house or out of the house of my making myself useful oh whats that do i see a chance i do i do  miss jillgalls eyes are more than mortal at one time they are microscopes at another time they are telescopes she discovered right across the room the torn place in the windowcurtain in an instant she snatched a dirty little leather case out of her pocket threaded her needle and began darning the curtain she sang over her work my heart is light my will is free i can repeat no more of it when i heard her singing voice i became reckless of consequences and ran out of the room with my hands over my ears    chapter xvi helenas diary  when i reached the foot of the stairs my father called me into his study  i found him at his writingtable with such a heap of tornup paper in his wastebasket that it overflowed on to the floor he explained to me that he had been destroying a large accumulation of old letters and had ended when his employment began to grow wearisome in examining his correspondence rather carelessly the result was that he had torn up a letter and a copy of the reply which ought to have been set aside as worthy of preservation after collecting the fragments he had heaped them on the table if i could contrive to put them together again on fair sheets of paper and fasten them in their right places with gum i should be doing him a service at a time when he was too busy to set his mistake right for himself  here was the best excuse that i could desire for keeping out of miss jillgalls way i cheerfully set to work on the restoration of the letters while my father went on with his writing  having put the fragments togetherexcepting a few gaps caused by morsels that had been losti was unwilling to fasten them down with gum until i could feel sure of not having made any mistakes especially in regard to some of the lost words which i had been obliged to restore by guesswork so i copied the letters and submitted them in the first place to my fathers approval he praised me in the prettiest manner for the care that i had taken but when he began after some hesitation to read my copy i noticed a change the smile left his face and the nervous quiverings showed themselves again  quite right my child he said in low sad tones  on returning to my side of the table i expected to see him resume his writing he crossed the room to the window and stood with his back to me looking out  when i had first discovered the sense of the letters they failed to interest me a tiresome woman presuming on the kindness of a goodnatured man to beg a favor which she had no right to ask and receiving a refusal which she had richly deserved was no remarkable event in my experience as my fathers secretary and copyist but the change in his face while he read the correspondence altered my opinion of the letters there was more in them evidently than i had discovered i kept my manuscript copyhere it is   from miss elizabeth chance to the rev abel gracedieu  date of year 1859 date of month missing   dear siryou have i hope not quite forgotten the interesting conversation that we had last year in the governors rooms i am afraid i spoke a little flippantly at the time but i am sure you will believe me when i say that this was out of no want of respect to yourself my pecuniary position being far from prosperous i am endeavoring to obtain the vacant situation of housekeeper in a public institution the prospectus of which i inclose you will see it is a rule of the place that a candidate must be a single woman which i am and must be recommended by a clergyman you are the only reverend gentleman whom it is my good fortune to know and the thing is of course a mere formality pray excuse this application and oblige me by acting as my reference  sincerely yours  elizabeth chance   p splease address miss e chance poste restante st martinslegrand london   from the rev abel gracedieu to miss chance  copy   madamthe brief conversation to which your letter alludes took place at an accidental meeting between us i then saw you for the first time and i have not seen you since it is impossible for me to assert the claim of a perfect stranger like yourself to fill a situation of trust i must beg to decline acting as your reference  your obedient servant  abel gracedieu    my father was still at the window  in that idle position he could hardly complain of me for interrupting him if i ventured to talk about the letters which i had put together if my curiosity displeased him he had only to say so and there would be an end to any allusions of mine to the subject my first idea was to join him at the window on reflection and still perceiving that he kept his back turned on me i thought it might be more prudent to remain at the table  this miss chance seems to be an impudent person i said  yes  was she a young woman when you met with her  yes  what sort of a woman to look at ugly  no  here were three answers which eunice herself would have been quick enough to interpret as three warnings to say no more i felt a little hurt by his keeping his back turned on me at the same time and naturally i think i found my interest in miss chance i dont say my friendly interest considerably increased by my fathers unusually rude behavior i was also animated by an irresistible desire to make him turn round and look at me  miss chances letter was written many years ago i resumed i wonder what has become of her since she wrote to you  i know nothing about her  not even whether she is alive or dead  not even that what do these questions mean helena  nothing father  i declare he looked as if he suspected me  why dont you speak out he said have i ever taught you to conceal your thoughts have i ever been a hard father who discouraged you when you wished to confide in him what are you thinking about do you know anything of this woman  oh father what a question i never even heard of her till i put the torn letters together i begin to wish you had not asked me to do it  so do i it never struck me that you would feel such extraordinaryi had almost said such vulgarcuriosity about a worthless letter  this roused my temper when a young lady is told that she is vulgar if she has any selfconceiti mean selfrespectshe feels insulted i said something sharp in my turn it was in the way of argument i do not know how it may be with other young persons i never reason so well myself as when i am angry  you call it a worthless letter i said and yet you think it worth preserving  have you nothing more to say to me than that he asked  nothing more i answered  he changed again after having looked unaccountably angry he now looked unaccountably relieved  i will soon satisfy you he said that i have a good reason for preserving a worthless letter miss chance my dear is not a woman to be trusted if she saw her advantage in making a bad use of my reply i am afraid she would not hesitate to do it even if she is no longer living i dont know into what vile hands my letter may not have fallen or how it might be falsified for some wicked purpose do you see now how a correspondence may become accidentally important though it is of no value in itself  i could say yes to this with a safe conscience  but there were some perplexities still left in my mind it seemed strange that miss chance should apparently have submitted to the severity of my fathers reply i should have thought i said to him that she would have sent you another impudent letteror perhaps have insisted on seeing you and using her tongue instead of her pen  she could do neither the one nor the other helena miss chance will never find out my address again i have taken good care of that  he spoke in a loud voice with a flushed faceas if it was quite a triumph to have prevented this woman from discovering his address what reason could he have for being so anxious to keep her away from him could i venture to conclude that there was a mystery in the life of a man so blameless so truly pious it shocked one even to think of it  there was a silence between us to which the housemaid offered a welcome interruption dinner was ready  he kissed me before we left the room one word more helena he said and i have done let there be no more talk between us about elizabeth chance    chapter xvii helenas diary  miss jillgall joined us at the dinnertable in a state of excitement carrying a book in her hand  i am inclined on reflection to suspect that she is quite clever enough to have discovered that i hate herand that many of the aggravating things she says and does are assumed out of retaliation for the purpose of making me angry that ugly face is a double face or i am much mistaken  to return to the dinnertable miss jillgall addressed herself with an air of playful penitence to my father  dear cousin i hope i have not done wrong helena left me all by myself when i had finished darning the curtain i really didnt know what to do so i opened all the bedroom doors upstairs and looked into the rooms in the big room with two bedsoh i am so ashamedi found this book please look at the first page  my father looked at the titlepage doctor wattss hymns well selina what is there to be ashamed of in this  oh no no its the wrong page do look at the other pagethe one that comes first before that one  my patient father turned to the blank page  ah he said quietly my other daughters name is written in itthe daughter whom you have not seen well  miss jillgall clasped her hands distractedly its my ignorance im so ashamed of dear cousin forgive me enlighten me i dont know how to pronounce your other daughters name do you call her euneece  the dinner was getting cold i was provoked into saying no we dont  she had evidently not forgiven me for leaving her by herself pardon me helena when i want information i dont apply to you i sit as it were at the feet of your learned father dear cousin is it  even my father declined to wait for his dinner any longer pronounce it as you like selina here we say eunicewith the accent on the i and with the final e sounded eunisee let me give you some soup  miss jillgall groaned oh how difficult it seems to be quite beyond my poor brains i shall ask the dear girls leave to call her euneece what very strong soup isnt it rather a waste of meat give me a little more please  i discovered another of miss jillgalls peculiarities her appetite was enormous and her ways were greedy you heard her eat her soup she devoured the food on her plate with her eyes before she put it into her mouth and she criticised our english cookery in the most impudent manner under pretense of asking humbly how it was done there was however some temporary compensation for this we had less of her talk while she was eating her dinner  with the removal of the cloth she recovered the use of her tongue and she hit on the one subject of all others which proves to be the sorest trial to my fathers patience  and now dear cousin let us talk of your other daughter our absent euneece i do so long to see her when is she coming back  in a few days more  how glad i am and do tell mewhich is she your oldest girl or your youngest  neither the one nor the other selina  oh my head my head this is even worse than the accent on the i and the final e stop i am cleverer than i thought i was you mean that the girls are twins are they both so exactly like each other that i shant know which is which what fun  when the subject of our ages was unluckily started at mrs staveleys i had slipped out of the difficulty easily by assuming the character of the eldest sisteran example of ready tact which my dear stupid eunice doesnt understand in my fathers presence it is needless to say that i kept silence and left it to him i was sorry to be obliged to do this owing to his sad state of health he is easily irritatedespecially by inquisitive strangers  i must leave you he answered without taking the slightest notice of what miss jillgall had said to him my work is waiting for me  she stopped him on his way to the door oh tell mecant i help you  thank you no  wellbut tell me one thing am i right about the twins  you are wrong  miss jillgalls demonstrative hands flew up into the air again and expressed the climax of astonishment by quivering over her head this is positively maddening she declared what does it mean  take my advice cousin dont attempt to find out what it means  he left the room miss jillgall appealed to me i imitated my fathers wise brevity of expression sorry to disappoint you selina i know no more about it than you do come upstairs  every step of the way up to the drawingroom was marked by a protest or an inquiry did i expect her to believe that i couldnt say which of us was the elder of the two that i didnt really know what my fathers motive was for this extraordinary mystification that my sister and i had submitted to be robbed as it were of our own ages and had not insisted on discovering which of us had come into the world first that our friends had not put an end to this sort of thing by comparing us personally and discovering which was the elder sister by investigation of our faces to all this i replied first that i did certainly expect her to believe whatever i might say secondly that what she was pleased to call the mystification had begun when we were both children that habit had made it familiar to us in the course of years and above all that we were too fond of our good father to ask for explanations which we knew by experience would distress him thirdly that friends did try to discover by personal examination which was the elder sister and differed perpetually in their conclusions also that we had amused ourselves by trying the same experiment before our lookingglasses and that eunice thought helena was the oldest and helena thought eunice was the oldest fourthly and finally that the reverend mr gracedieus cousin had better drop the subject unless she was bent on making her presence in the house unendurable to the reverend mr gracedieu himself  i write it with a sense of humiliation miss jillgall listened attentively to all i had to sayand then took me completely by surprise this inquisitive meddlesome restless impudent woman suddenly transformed herself into a perfect model of amiability and decorum she actually said she agreed with me and was much obliged for my good advice  a stupid young woman in my place would have discovered that this was not natural and that miss jillgall was presenting herself to me in disguise to reach some secret end of her own i am not a stupid young woman i ought to have had at my service penetration enough to see through and through cousin selina well cousin selina was an impenetrable mystery to me  the one thing to be done was to watch her i was at least sly enough to take up a book and pretend to be reading it how contemptible  she looked round the room and discovered our pretty writingtable a present to my father from his congregation after a little consideration she sat down to write a letter  when does the post go out she asked  i mentioned the hour and she began her letter before she could have written more than the first two or three lines she turned round on her seat and began talking to me  do you like writing letters my dear  yesbut then i have not many letters to write  only a few friends helena but those few worthy to be loved my own case exactly has your father told you of my troubles ah i am glad of that it spares me the sad necessity of confessing what i have suffered oh how good my friends my new friends were to me in that dull little belgian town one of them was generosity personifiedah she had suffered too a vile husband who had deceived and deserted her oh the men when she heard of the loss of my little fortune that noble creature got up a subscription for me and went round herself to collect think of what i owe to her ought i to let another day pass without writing to my benefactress am i not bound in gratitude to make her happy in the knowledge of my happinessi mean the refuge opened to me in this hospitable house  she twisted herself back again to the writingtable and went on with her letter  i have not attempted to conceal my stupidity let me now record a partial recovery of my intelligence  it was not to be denied that miss jillgall had discovered a good reason for writing to her friend but i was at a loss to understand why she should have been so anxious to mention the reason was it possibleafter the talk which had passed between usthat she had something mischievous to say in her letter relating to my father or to me was she afraid i might suspect this and had she been so communicative for the purpose of leading my suspicions astray these were vague guesses but try as i might i could arrive at no clearer view of what was passing in miss jillgalls mind what would i not have given to be able to look over her shoulder without discovery  she finished her letter and put the address and closed the envelope then she turned round toward me again  have you got a foreign postage stamp dear  if i could look at nothing else i was resolved to look at her envelope it was only necessary to go to the study and to apply to my father i returned with the foreign stamp and i stuck it on the envelope with my own hand  there was nothing to interest me in the address as i ought to have foreseen if i had not been too much excited for the exercise of a little common sense miss jillgalls wonderful friend was only remarkable by her ugly foreign namemrs tenbruggen    chapter xviii eunices diary  here i am writing my history of myself once more by my own bedside some unexpected events have happened while i have been away one of them is the absence of my sister  helena has left home on a visit to a northern town by the seaside she is staying in the house of a minister one of papas friends and is occupying a position of dignity in which i should certainly lose my head the minister and his wife and daughters propose to set up a girls scripture class on the plan devised by papa and they are at a loss poor helpless people to know how to begin helena has volunteered to set the thing going and there she is now advising everybody governing everybody encouraging everybodyissuing directions finding fault rewarding meritoh dear let me put it all in one word and say thoroughly enjoying herself  another event has happened relating to papa it so distressed me that i even forgot to think of philipfor a little while  traveling by railway i suppose because i am not used to it gives me the headache when i got to our station here i thought it would do me more good to walk home than to ride in the noisy omnibus halfway between the railway and the town i met one of the doctors he is a member of our congregation and he it was who recommended papa some time since to give up his work as a minister and take a long holiday in foreign parts  i am glad to have met with you the doctor said your sister i find is away on a visit and i want to speak to one of you about your father  it seemed that he had been observing papa in chapel from what he called his own medical point of view he did not conceal from me that he had drawn conclusions which made him feel uneasy it may be anxiety he said or it may be overwork in either case your father is in a state of nervous derangement which is likely to lead to serious resultsunless he takes the advice that i gave him when he last consulted me there must be no more hesitation about it be careful not to irritate himbut remember that he must rest you and your sister have some influence over him he wont listen to me  poor dear papa i did see a change in him for the worsethough i had only been away for so short a time  when i put my arms round his neck and kissed him he turned pale and then flushed up suddenly the tears came into his eyes oh it was hard to follow the doctors advice and not to cry too but i succeeded in controlling myself i sat on his knee and made him tell me all that i have written here about helena this led to our talking next of the new lady who is to live with us as a member of the family i began to feel less uneasy at the prospect of being introduced to this stranger when i heard that she was papas cousin and when he mentioned her name and saw how it amused me his poor worn face brightened into a smile go and find her he said and introduce yourself i want to hear eunice if you and my cousin are likely to get on well together  the servants told me that miss jillgall was in the garden  i searched here there and everywhere and failed to find her the place was so quiet it looked so deliciously pure and bright after smoky dreary london that i sat down at the further end of the garden and let my mind take me back to philip what was he doing at that moment while i was thinking of him perhaps he was in the company of other young ladies who drew all his thoughts away to themselves or perhaps he was writing to his father in ireland and saying something kindly and prettily about me or perhaps he was looking forward as anxiously as i do to our meeting next week  i have had my plans and i have changed my plans  on the railway journey i thought i would tell papa at once of the new happiness which seems to have put a new life into me it would have been delightful to make my confession to that first and best and dearest of friends but my meeting with the doctor spoiled it all after what he had said to me i discovered a risk if i ventured to tell papa that my heart was set on a young gentleman who was a stranger to him could i be sure that he would receive my confession favorably there was a chance that it might irritate himand the fault would then be mine of doing what i had been warned to avoid it might be safer in every way to wait till philip paid his visit and he and papa had been introduced to each other and charmed with each other could helena herself have arrived at a wiser conclusion i declare i felt proud of my own discretion  in this enjoyable frame of mind i was disturbed by a womans voice the tone was a tone of distress and the words reached my ears from the end of the garden please miss let me in  a shrubbery marks the limit of our little bit of pleasureground on the other side of it there is a cottage standing on the edge of the common the most goodnatured woman in the world lives here she is our laundressmarried to a stupid young fellow named molly and blessed with a plump baby as sweettempered at herself thinking it likely that the piteous voice which had disturbed me might be the voice of mrs molly i was astonished to hear her appealing to anybody perhaps to me to let her in so i passed through the shrubbery wondering whether the gate had been locked during my absence in london no it was as easy to open as ever  the cottage door was not closed  i saw our amiable laundress in the passage on her knees trying to open an inner door which seemed to be locked she had her eye at the keyhole and once again she called out please miss let me in i waited to see if the door would be openednothing happened i waited again to hear if some person inside would answernobody spoke but somebody or something made a sound of splashing water on the other side of the door  i showed myself and asked what was the matter  mrs molly looked at me helplessly she said miss eunice its the baby  what has the baby done i inquired  mrs molly got on her feet and whispered in my ear you know hes a fine child  yes  well miss hes bewitched a lady  what lady  miss jillgall  the very person i had been trying to find i asked where she was  the laundress pointed dolefully to the locked door in there  and where is your baby  the poor woman still pointed to the door im beginning to doubt miss whether it is my baby  nonsense mrs molly if it isnt yours whose baby can it be  miss jillgalls  her puzzled face made this singular reply more funny still the splashing of water on the other side of the door began again what is miss jillgall doing now i said  washing the baby miss a week ago she came in here one morning very pleasant and kind i must own she found me putting on the babys things she says what a cherub which i took as a compliment she says i shall call again tomorrow she called again so early that she found the baby in his crib you be a good soul she says and go about your work and leave the child to me i says yes miss but please to wait till ive made him fit to be seen she says thats just what i mean to do myself i stared and i think any other person would have done the same in my place if theres one thing more than another i enjoy she says its making myself useful mrs molly ive taken a fancy to your boybaby she says and i mean to make myself useful to him if you will believe me miss jillgall has only let me have one opportunity of putting my own child tidy she was late this morning and i got my chance and had the boy on my lap drying himwhen in she burst like a blast of wind and snatched the baby away from me this is your nasty temper she says i declare im ashamed of you and there she is with the door locked against me washing the child all over again herself twice ive knocked and asked her to let me in and cant even get an answer they do say theres luck in odd numbers suppose i try again mrs molly knocked and the proverb proved to be true she got an answer from miss jillgall at last if you dont be quiet and go away you shant have the baby back at all who could help iti burst out laughing miss jillgall as i supposed from the tone of her voice took severe notice of this act of impropriety whos that laughing she called out give yourself a name i gave my name the door was instantly thrown open with a bang papas cousin appeared in a disheveled state with splashes of soap and water all over her she held the child in one arm and she threw the other arm round my neck dearest euneece i have been longing to see you how do you like our baby  to the curious story of my introduction to miss jillgall i ought perhaps to add that i have got to be friends with her already i am the friend of anybody who amuses me what will helena say when she reads this    chapter xix eunices diary  when people are interested in some event that is coming do they find the dull days passed in waiting for it days which they are not able to remember when they look back this is my unfortunate case night after night i have gone to bed without so much as opening my journal there was nothing worth writing about nothing that i could recollect until the postman came today i ran downstairs when i heard his ring at the bell and stopped maria on her way to the study there among papas usual handful of letters was a letter for me  dear miss eunice    yours ever truly  i quote the passages in philips letter which most deeply interested mei am his dear miss and he is mine ever truly the other part of the letter told me that he had been detained in london and he lamented it at the end was a delightful announcement that he was coming to me by the afternoon train i ran upstairs to see how i looked in the glass  my first feeling was regret for the thousandth time i was obliged to acknowledge that i was not as pretty as helena but this passed off a cheering reflection occurred to me philip would not have found in my sisters face what seems to have interested him in my face besides there is my figure  the pity of it is that i am so ignorant about some things if i had been allowed to read novels i might judging by what papa said against them in one of his sermons have felt sure of my own attractions i might even have understood what philip really thought of me however my mind was quite unexpectedly set at ease on the subject of my figure the manner in which it happened was so amusingat least so amusing to methat i cannot resist mentioning it  my sister and i are forbidden to read newspapers as well as novels but the teachers at the girls scripture class are too old to be treated in this way when the morning lessons were over one of them was reading the newspaper to the other in the empty schoolroom i being in the passage outside putting on my cloak  it was a report of an application made to the magistrates by the lady of his worship the mayor hearing this i stopped to listen the lady of his worship what a funny way of describing a mans wife is reported to be a little too fond of notoriety and to like hearing the sound of her own voice on public occasions but this is only my writing i had better get back to the report in her address to the magistrates the mayoress stated that she had seen a disgusting photograph in the shop window of a stationer lately established in the town she desired to bring this person within reach of the law and to have all his copies of the shameless photograph destroyed the usher of the court was thereupon sent to purchase the photographon second thoughts i prefer going back to my own writing again it is so uninteresting to copy other peoples writing two of the magistrates were doing justice they looked at the photographand what did it represent the famous statue called the venus de medici one of the magistrates took this discovery indignantly he was shocked at the gross ignorance which could call the classic ideal of beauty and grace a disgusting work the other one made polite allowances he thought the lady was much to be pitied she was evidently the innocent victim of a neglected education mrs mayor left the court in a rage telling the justices she knew where to get law i shall expose venus she said to the lord chancellor  when the scripture class had broken up for the day duty ought to have taken me home curiosity led me astrayi mean led me to the stationers window  there i found our two teachers absorbed in the photograph having got to the shop first by a short cut they seemed to think i had taken a liberty whom i joined them we are here they were careful to explain to get a lesson in the ideal of beauty and grace there was quite a little crowd of townsfolk collected before the window some of them giggled and some of them wondered whether it was taken from the life for my own part gratitude to venus obliges me to own that she effected a great improvement in the state of my mind she encouraged me if that stumpy little creaturewith no waist and oh such uncertain legsrepresented the ideal of beauty and grace i had reason indeed to be satisfied with my own figure and to think it quite possible that my sweethearts favorable opinion of me was not illbestowed  i was at the bedroom window when the time approached for philips arrival quite at the far end of the road i discovered him he was on foot he walked like a king not that i ever saw a king but i have my ideal ah what a smile he gave me when i made him look up by waving my handkerchief out of the window ask for papa i whispered as he ascended the housesteps  the next thing to do was to wait as patiently as i could to be sent for downstairs maria came to me in a state of excitement oh miss what a handsome young gentleman and how beautifully dressed is he instead of finishing what she had to say she looked at me with a sly smile i looked at her with a sly smile we were certainly a couple of fools but dear me how happy sometimes a fool can be  my enjoyment of that delightful time was checked when i went into the drawingroom  i had expected to see papas face made beautiful by his winning smile he was not only serious he actually seemed to be ill at ease when he looked at me at the same time i saw nothing to make me conclude that philip had produced an unfavorable impression the truth is we were all three on our best behavior and we showed it philip had brought with him a letter from mrs staveley introducing him to papa we spoke of the staveleys of the weather of the cathedraland then there seemed to be nothing more left to talk about  in the silence that followedwhat a dreadful thing silence ispapa was sent for to see somebody who had called on business he made his excuses in the sweetest manner but still seriously when he and philip had shaken hands would he leave us together no he waited poor philip had no choice but to take leave of me papa then went out by the door that led into his study and i was left alone  can any words say how wretched i felt  i had hoped so much from that first meetingand where were my hopes now a profane wish that i had never been born was finding its way into my mind when the door of the room was opened softly from the side of the passage maria dear maria the best friend i have peeped in she whispered go into the garden miss and you will find somebody there who is dying to see you mind you let him out by the shrubbery gate i squeezed her hand i asked if she had tried the shrubbery gate with a sweetheart of her own hundreds of times miss  was it wrong for me to go to philip in the garden oh there is no end to objections perhaps i did it because it was wrong perhaps i had been kept on my best behavior too long for human endurance  how sadly disappointed he looked and how rashly he had placed himself just where he could be seen from the back windows i took his arm and led him to the end of the garden there we were out of the reach of inquisitive eyes and there we sat down together under the big mulberry tree  oh eunice your father doesnt like me  those were his first words in justice to papa and a little for my own sake too i told him he was quite wrong i said trust my fathers goodness trust his kindness as i do  he made no reply his silence was sufficiently expressive he looked at me fondly  i may be wrong but fond looks surely require an acknowledgment of some kind is a young woman guilty of boldness who only follows her impulses i slipped my hand into his hand philip seemed to like it we returned to our conversation  he began tell me dear is mr gracedieu always as serious as he is today  oh no  when he takes exercise does he ride or does he walk  papa always walks  by himself  sometimes by himself sometimes with me do you want to meet him when he goes out  yes  when he is out with me  no when he is out by himself  was it possible to tell me more plainly that i was not wanted i did my best to express indignation by snatching my hand away from him he was completely taken by surprise  eunice dont you understand me  i was as stupid and as disagreeable as i could possibly be no i dont  then let me help you he said with a patience which i had not deserved  up to that moment i had been leaning against the back of a garden chair something else now got between me and my chair it stole round my waistit held me gentlyit strengthened its holdit improved my temperit made me fit to understand him all done by what only an arm  philip went on  i want to ask your father to do me the greatest of all favorsand there is no time to lose every day i expect to get a letter which may recall me to ireland  my heart sank at this horrid prospect and in some mysterious way my head must have felt it too i mean that i found my head resting on his shoulder he went on  how am i to get my opportunity of speaking to mr gracedieu i mustnt call on him again as soon as tomorrow or next day but i might meet him out walking alone if you will tell me how to do it a note to my hotel is all i want dont tremble my sweet if you are not present at the time do you see any objection to my owning to your father that i love you  i felt his delicate consideration for mei did indeed feel it gratefully if he only spoke first how well i should get on with papa afterward the prospect before me was exquisitely encouraging i agreed with philip in everything and i waited how eagerly was only known to myself to hear what he would say to me next he prophesied next  when i have told your father that i love you he will expect me to tell him something else can you guess what it is  if i had not been confused perhaps i might have found the answer to this as it was i left him to reply to himself he did it in words which i shall remember as long as i live  dearest eunice when your father has heard my confession he will suspect that there is another confession to follow ithe will want to know if you love me my angel will my hopes be your hopes too when i answer him  what there was in this to make my heart beat so violently that i felt as if i was being stifled is more than i can tell he leaned so close to me so tenderly so delightfully close that our faces nearly touched he whispered say you love me in a kiss  his lips touched my lips pressed them dwelt on themoh how can i tell of it some new enchantment of feeling ran deliciously through and through me i forgot my own self i only knew of one person in the world he was master of my lips he was master of my heart when he whispered kiss me i kissed what a moment it was a faintness stole over me i felt as if i was going to die some exquisite death i laid myself back away from himi was not able to speak there was no need for it my thoughts and his thoughts were onehe knew that i was quite overcome he saw that he must leave me to recover myself alone i pointed to the shrubbery gate we took one long last look at each other for that day the trees hid him i was left by myself    chapter xx eunices diary  how long a time passed before my composure came back to me i cannot remember now it seemed as if i was waiting through some interval of my life that was a mystery to myself i was content to wait and feel the light evening air in the garden wafting happiness over me and all this had come from a kiss i can call the time to mind when i used to wonder why people made such a fuss about kissing  i had been indebted to maria for my first taste of paradise i was recalled by maria to the world that i had been accustomed to live in the world that was beginning to fade away in my memory already she had been sent to the garden in search of me and she had a word of advice to offer after noticing my face when i stepped out of the shadow of the tree try to look more like yourself miss before you let them see you at the teatable   papa and miss jillgall were sitting together talking when i opened the door they left off when they saw me and i supposed quite correctly as it turned out that i had been one of the subjects in their course of conversation my poor father seemed to be sadly anxious and out of sorts miss jillgall if i had been in the humor to enjoy it would have been more amusing than ever one of her funny little eyes persisted in winking at me and her heavy foot had something to say to my foot under the table which meant a great deal perhaps but which only succeeded in hurting me  my father left us and miss jillgall explained herself  i know dearest euneece that we have only been acquainted for a day or two and that i ought not perhaps to have expected you to confide in me so soon can i trust you not to betray me if i set an example of confidence ah i see i can trust you and my dear i do so enjoy telling secrets to a friend hush your father your excellent father has been talking to me about young mr dunboyne  she provokingly stopped there i entreated her to go on she invited me to sit on her knee i want to whisper she said it was too ridiculousbut i did it miss jillgalls whisper told me serious news  the minister has some reason euneece for disapproving of mr dunboyne but mind this i dont think he has a bad opinion of the young man himself he is going to return mr dunboynes call oh i do so hate formality i really cant go on talking of mr dunboyne tell me his christian name ah what a noble name how i long to be useful to him tomorrow my dear after the one oclock dinner your papa will call on philip at his hotel i hope he wont be out just at the wrong time  i resolved to prevent that unlucky accident by writing to philip if miss jillgall would have allowed it i should have begun my letter at once but she had more to say and she was stronger than i was and still kept me on her knee  it all looks bright enough so far doesnt it dear sister will you let me be your second sister i do so love you euneece thank you thank you but the gloomy side of the picture is to come next the ministerno now i am your sister i must call him papa it makes me feel so young again well then papa has asked me to be your companion whenever you go out euneece is too young and too attractive to be walking about this great town in helenas absence by herself that was how he put it slyly enough if one may say so of so good a man and he used your sister didnt he as a kind of excuse i wish your sister was as nice as you are however the point is why am i to be your companion because dear child you and your young gentleman are not to make appointments and to meet each other alone oh yesthats it your father is quite willing to return philips call he proposes as a matter of civility to mrs staveley to ask philip to dinner but mark my words he doesnt mean to let philip have you for his wife  i jumped off her lap it was horrible to hear her oh i said can you be right about it miss jillgall jumped up too she has foreign ways of shrugging her shoulders and making signs with her hands on this occasion she laid both hands on the upper part of her dress just below her throat and mysteriously shook her head  when my views are directed by my affections she assured me i never see wrong my bosom is my strong point  she has no bosom poor soulbut i understood what she meant it failed to have any soothing effect on my feelings i felt grieved and angry and puzzled all in one miss jillgall stood looking at me with her hands still on the place where her bosom was supposed to be she made my temper hotter than ever  i mean to marry philip i said  certainly my dear euneece but please dont be so fierce about it  if my father does really object to my marriage i went on it must be because he dislikes philip there can be no other reason  oh yes dearthere can  what is the reason then  that my sweet girl is one of the things that we have got to find out    the post of this morning brought a letter from my sister we were to expect her return by the next days train this was good news philip and i might stand in need of clever helenas help and we might be sure of getting it now  in writing to philip i had asked him to let me hear how papa and he had got on at the hotel i wont say how often i consulted my watch or how often i looked out of the window for a man with a letter in his hand it will be better to get on at once to the discouraging end of it when the report of the interview reached me at last twice philip had attempted to ask for my hand in marriageand twice my father had deliberately obstinately philips own words changed the subject even this was not all as if he was determined to show that miss jillgall was perfectly right and i perfectly wrong papa civil to philip as long as he did not talk of me had asked him to dine with us and philip had accepted the invitation  what were we to think of it what were we to do  i wrote back to my dear love so cruelly used to tell him that helena was expected to return on the next day and that her opinion would be of the greatest value to both of us in a postscript i mentioned the hour at which we were going to the station to meet my sister when i say we i mean miss jillgall as well as myself    we found him waiting for us at the railway i am afraid he resented papas incomprehensible resolution not to give him a hearing he was silent and sullen i could not conceal that to see this state of feeling distressed me he showed how truly he deserved to be lovedhe begged my pardon and he became his own sweet self again directly i am more determined to marry him than ever  when the train entered the station all the carriages were full i went one way thinking i had seen helena miss jillgall went the other way under the same impression philip was a little way behind me  not seeing my sister i had just turned back when a young man jumped out of a carriage opposite philip and recognized and shook hands with him i was just near enough to hear the stranger say look at the girl in our carriage philip looked what a charming creature he said and then checked himself for fear the young lady should hear him she had just handed her traveling bag and wraps to a porter and was getting out philip politely offered his hand to help her she looked my way the charming creature of my sweethearts admiration was to my infinite amusement helena herself    chapter xxi helenas diary  the day of my return marks an occasion which i am not likely to forget hours have passed since i came homeand my agitation still forbids the thought of repose  as i sit at my desk i see eunice in bed sleeping peacefully except when she is murmuring enjoyment in some happy dream to what end has my sister been advancing blindfold and who knows dragging me with her since that disastrous visit to our friends in london strange that there should be a leaven of superstition in my nature strange that i should feel fear of somethingi hardly know what  i have met somewhere perhaps in my historical reading with the expression a chain of events was i at the beginning of that chain when i entered the railway carriage on my journey home  among the other passengers there was a young gentleman accompanied by a lady who proved to be his sister they were both wellbred people the brother evidently admired me and did his best to make himself agreeable time passed quickly in pleasant talk and my vanity was flatteredand that was all my fellowtravelers were going on to london when the train reached our station the young lady sent her brother to buy some fruit which she saw in the window of the refreshmentroom the first man whom he encountered on the platform was one of his friends to whom he said something which i failed to hear when i handed my traveling bag and my wraps to the porter and showed myself at the carriage door i heard the friend say what a charming creature having nothing to conceal in a journal which i protect by a lock i may own that the strangers personal appearance struck me and that what i felt this time was not flattered vanity but gratified pride he was young he was remarkably handsome he was a distinguishedlooking man  all this happened in one moment in the moment that followed i found myself in eunices arms that odious person miss jillgall insisted on embracing me next and then i was conscious of an indescribable feeling of surprise eunice presented the distinguishedlooking gentleman to me as a friend of hersmr philip dunboyne  i had the honor of meeting your sister he said in london at mr staveleys house he went on to speak easily and gracefully of the journey i had taken and of his friend who had been my fellowtraveler and he attended us to the railway omnibus before he took his leave i observed that eunice had something to say to him confidentially before they parted this was another example of my sisters childish character she is instantly familiar with new acquaintances if she happens to like them i anticipated some amusement from hearing how she had contrived to establish confidential relations with a highlycultivated man like mr dunboyne but while miss jillgall was with us it was just as well to keep within the limits of commonplace conversation  before we got out of the omnibus i had however observed one undesirable result of my absence from home eunice and miss jillgallthe latter having no doubt finely flattered the formerappeared to have taken a strong liking to each other  two curious circumstances also caught my attention i saw a change to what i call selfassertion in my sisters manner something seemed to have raised her in her own estimation then again miss jillgall was not like her customary self she had delightful moments of silence and when eunice asked how i liked mr dunboyne she listened to my reply with an appearance of interest in her ugly face which was quite a new revelation in my experience of my fathers cousin  these little discoveries after what i had already observed at the railwaystation ought perhaps to have prepared me for what was to come when my sister and i were alone in our room but eunice whether she meant to do it or not baffled my customary penetration she looked as if she had plenty of news to tell mewith some obstacle in the way of doing it which appeared to amuse instead of annoying her if there is one thing more than another that i hate it is being puzzled i asked at once if anything remarkable had happened during eunices visit to london  she smiled mischievously i have got a delicious surprise for you my dear and i do so enjoy prolonging it tell me helena what did you propose we should both do when we found ourselves at home again  my memory was at fault eunices good spirits became absolutely boisterous she called out catch and tossed her journal into my hands across the whole length of the room we were to read each others diaries she said there is mine to begin with  innocent of any suspicion of the true state of affairs i began the reading of eunices journal if i had not seen the familiar handwriting nothing would have induced me to believe that a girl brought up in a pious household the wellbeloved daughter of a distinguished congregational minister could have written that shameless record of passions unknown to young ladies in respectable english life what to say what to do when i had closed the book was more than i felt myself equal to decide my wretched sister spared me the anxiety which i might otherwise have felt it was she who first opened her lips after the silence that had fallen on us while i was reading these were literally the words that she said  my darling why dont you congratulate me  no argument could have persuaded me as this persuaded me that all sisterly remonstrance on my part would be completely thrown away  my dear eunice i said let me beg you to excuse me i am waiting  there she interrupted meand oh in what an impudent manner she took my chin between her finger and thumb and lifted my downcast face and looked at me with an appearance of eager expectation which i was quite at a loss to understand  you have been away from home too she said do i see in this serious face some astonishing news waiting to overpower me have you found a sweetheart are you engaged to be married  i only put her hand away from me and advised her to return to her chair this perfectly harmless proceeding seemed absolutely to frighten her  oh my dear she burst out surely you are not jealous of me  there was but one possible reply to this i laughed at it is eunices head turned she kissed me  now you laugh she said i begin to understand you again i ought to have known that you are superior to jealousy but do tell me would it be so very wonderful if other girls found something to envy in my good luck just think of it such a handsome man such an agreeable man such a clever man such a rich manand not the least of his merits bytheby a man who admires you come if you wont congratulate me congratulate yourself on having such a brotherinlaw in prospect  her head was turned i drew the poor souls attention compassionately to what i had said a moment since  pardon me dear for reminding you that i have not yet refused to offer my congratulations i only told you i was waiting  for what  waiting of course to hear what my father thinks of your wonderful good luck  this explanation offered with the kindest intentions produced another change in my very variable sister i had extinguished her good spirits as i might have extinguished a light she sat down by me and sighed in the saddest manner the heart must be hard indeed which can resist the distress of a person who is dear to us i put my arm round her she was becoming once more the eunice whom i so dearly loved  my poor child i said dont distress yourself by speaking of it i understand your father objects to your marrying mr dunboyne  she shook her head i cant exactly say helena that papa does that he only behaves very strangely  am i indiscreet dear if i ask in what way fathers behavior has surprised you  she was quite willing to enlighten me it was a simple little story which to my mind sufficiently explained the strange behavior that had puzzled my unfortunate sister  there could indeed be no doubt that my father considered eunice far too childish in character as yet to undertake the duties of matrimony but with his customary delicacy and dread of causing distress to others he had deferred the disagreeable duty of communicating his opinion to mr dunboyne the adverse decision must however be sooner or later announced and he had arranged to inflict disappointment as tenderly as might be at his own table  considerately leaving eunice in the enjoyment of any vain hopes which she may have founded on the event of the dinnerparty i passed the evening until suppertime came in the study with my father  our talk was mainly devoted to the worthy people with whom i had been staying and whose new schools i had helped to found not a word was said relating to my sister or to mr dunboyne poor father looked so sadly weary and ill that i ventured after what the doctor had said to eunice to hint at the value of rest and change of scene to an overworked man oh dear me he frowned and waved the subject away from him impatiently with a wan pale hand  after supper i made an unpleasant discovery not having completely finished the unpacking of my boxes i left miss jillgall and eunice in the drawingroom and went upstairs in half an hour i returned and found the room empty what had become of them it was a fine moonlight night i stepped into the back drawingroom and looked out of the window there they were walking arminarm with their heads close together deep in talk with my knowledge of miss jillgall i call this a bad sign  an odd thought has just come to me i wonder what might have happened if i had been visiting at mrs staveleys instead of eunice and if mr dunboyne had seen me first  absurd if i was not too tired to do anything more those last lines should be scratched out    chapter xxii eunices diary  i said so to miss jillgall and i say it again here nothing will induce me to think ill of helena  my sister is a good deal tired and a little out of temper after the railway journey this is exactly what happened to me when i went to london i attribute her refusal to let me read her journal after she had read mine entirely to the disagreeable consequences of traveling by railway miss jillgall accounted for it otherwise in her own funny manner my sweet child your sisters diary is full of abuse of poor me i humored the joke dearest selina keep a diary of your own and fill it with abuse of my sister this seemed to be a droll saying at the time but it doesnt look particularly amusing now it is written down we had ginger wine at supper to celebrate helenas return although i only drank one glass i daresay it may have got into my head  however that may be when the lovely moonlight tempted us into the garden there was an end to our jokes we had something to talk about which still dwells disagreeably on my mind  miss jillgall began it  if i trust you dearest euneece with my own precious secrets shall i never never never live to repent it  i told my good little friend that she might depend on me provided her secrets did no harm to any person whom i loved  she clasped her hands and looked up at the mooni can only suppose that her sentiments overpowered her she said very prettily that her heart and my heart beat together in heavenly harmony it is needless to add that this satisfied me  miss jillgalls generous confidence in my discretion was i am afraid not rewarded as it ought to have been i found her tiresome at first  she spoke of an excellent friend a lady who had helped her at the time when she lost her little fortune by raising a subscription privately to pay the expenses of her return to england her friends namenot very attractive to english earswas mrs tenbruggen they had first become acquainted under interesting circumstances miss jillgall happened to mention that my father was her only living relative and it turned out that mrs tenbruggen was familiar with his name and reverenced his fame as a preacher when he had generously received his poor helpless cousin under his own roof miss jillgalls gratitude and sense of duty impelled her to write and tell mrs tenbruggen how happy she was as a member of our family  let me confess that i began to listen more attentively when the narrative reached this point  i drew a little picture of our domestic circle here miss jillgall said describing her letter and i mentioned the mystery in which mr gracedieu conceals the ages of you two dear girls mrs tenbruggenshall we shorten her ugly name and call her mrs t very wellmrs t is a remarkably clever woman and i looked for interesting results if she would give her opinion of the mysterious circumstance mentioned in my letter  by this time i was all eagerness to hear more  has she written to you i asked  miss jillgall looked at me affectionately and took the reply out of her pocket  listen euneece and you shall hear her own words thus she writes  your letter dear selina especially interests me by what it says about the two miss gracedieus look dear she underlines the word two why i cant explain can you ah i thought not well let us get back to the letter my accomplished friend continues in these terms  i can understand the surprise which you have felt at the strange course taken by their father as a means of concealing the difference which there must be in the ages of these young ladies many years since i happened to discover a romantic incident in the life of your popular preacher which he has his reasons as i suspect for keeping strictly to himself if i may venture on a bold guess i should say that any person who could discover which was the oldest of the two daughters would be also likely to discover the true nature of the romance in mr gracedieus lifeisnt that very remarkable euneece you dont seem to see ityou funny child pray pay particular attention to what comes next these are the closing sentences in my friends letter  if you find anything new to tell me which relates to this interesting subject direct your letter as beforeprovided you write within a week from the present time afterward my letters will be received by the english physician whose card i inclose you will be pleased to hear that my professional interests call me to london at the earliest moment that i can sparethere dear child the letter comes to an end i daresay you wonder what mrs t means when she alludes to her professional interests  no i was not wondering about anything it hurt me to hear of a strange woman exercising her ingenuity in guessing at mysteries in papas life  but miss jillgall was too eagerly bent on setting forth the merits of her friend to notice this i now heard that mrs ts marriage had turned out badly and that she had been reduced to earn her own bread her manner of doing this was something quite new to me she went about from one place to another curing people of all sorts of painful maladies by a way she had of rubbing them with her hands in belgium she was called a masseuse when i asked what this meant in english i was told medical rubber and that the fame of mrs ts wonderful cures had reached some of the medical newspapers published in london  after listening i must say for myself very patiently i was bold enough to own that my interest in what i had just heard was not quite so plain to me as i could have wished it to be  miss jillgall looked shocked at my stupidity she reminded me that there was a mystery in mrs tenbruggens letter and a mystery in papas strange conduct toward philip put two and two together darling she said and one of these days they may make four  if this meant anything it meant that the reason which made papa keep helenas age and my age unknown to everybody but himself was also the reason why he seemed to be so strangely unwilling to let me be philips wife i really could not endure to take such a view of it as that and begged miss jillgall to drop the subject she was as kind as ever  with all my heart dear but dont deceive yourselfthe subject will turn up again when we least expect it    chapter xxiii eunices diary  only two days now before we give our little dinnerparty and philip finds his opportunity of speaking to papa oh how i wish that day had come and gone  i try not to take gloomy views of things but i am not quite so happy as i had expected to be when my dear was in the same town with me if papa had encouraged him to call again we might have had some precious time to ourselves as it is we can only meet in the different showplaces in the townwith helena on one side and miss jillgall on the other to take care of us i do call it cruel not to let two young people love each other without setting third persons to watch them if i was queen of england i would have pretty private bowers made for lovers in the summer and nice warm little rooms to hold two in the winter why not what harm could come of it i should like to know  the cathedral is the place of meeting which we find most convenient under the circumstances there are delightful nooks and corners about this celebrated building in which lovers can lag behind if we had been in papas chapel i should have hesitated to turn it to such a profane use as this the cathedral doesnt so much matter  shall i own that i felt my inferiority to helena a little keenly she could tell philip so many things that i should have liked to tell him first my clever sister taught him how to pronounce the name of the bishop who began building the cathedral she led him over the crypt and told him how old it was he was interested in the crypt he talked to helena not to me of his ambition to write a work on cathedral architecture in england he made a rough little sketch in his book of our famous tomb of some king helena knew the late royal personages name and philip showed his sketch to her before he showed it to me how can i blame him when i stood there the picture of stupidity trying to recollect something that i might tell him if it was only the deans name helena might have whispered it to me i think she remembered it not iand mentioned it to philip of course i kept close by him all the time and now and then he gave me a look which raised my spirits he might have given me something better than thati mean a kisswhen we had left the cathedral and were by ourselves for a moment in a corner of the deans garden but he missed the opportunity perhaps he was afraid of the dean himself coming that way and happening to see us however i am far from thinking the worse of philip i gave his arm a little squeezeand that was better than nothing    he and i took a walk along the bank of the river today my sister and miss jillgall looking after us as usual on our way through the town helena stopped to give an order at a shop she asked us to wait for her that best of good creatures miss jillgall whispered in my ear go on by yourselves and leave me to wait for her philip interpreted this act of kindness in a manner which would have vexed me if i had not understood that it was one of his jokes he said to me miss jillgall sees a chance of annoying your sister and enjoys the prospect  well away we went together it was just what i wanted it gave me an opportunity of saying something to philip between ourselves  i could now beg of him in his interests and mine to make the best of himself when he came to dinner clever people i told him were people whom papa liked and admired i said let him see dear how clever you are and how many things you knowand you cant imagine what a high place you will have in his opinion i hope you dont think i am taking too much on myself in telling you how to behave  he relieved that doubt in a manner which i despair of describing his eyes rested on me with such a look of exquisite sweetness and love that i was obliged to hold by his arm i trembled so with the pleasure of feeling it  i do sincerely believe he said that you are the most innocent girl the sweetest truest girl that ever lived i wish i was a better man eunice i wish i was good enough to be worthy of you  to hear him speak of himself in that way jarred on me if such words had fallen from any other mans lips i should have been afraid that he had done something or thought something of which he had reason to feel ashamed with philip this was impossible  he was eager to walk on rapidly and to turn a corner in the path before we could be seen i want to be alone with you he said  i looked back we were too late helena and miss jillgall had nearly overtaken us my sister was on the point of speaking to philip when she seemed to change her mind and only looked at him instead of looking at her in return he kept his eyes cast down and drew figures on the pathway with his stick i think helena was out of temper she suddenly turned my way why didnt you wait for me she asked  philip took her up sharply if eunice likes seeing the river better than waiting in the street he said isnt she free to do as she pleases  helena said nothing more philip walked on slowly by himself not knowing what to make of it i turned to miss jillgall surely philip cant have quarreled with helena i said  miss jillgall answered in an odd offhand manner not he he is a great deal more likely to have quarreled with himself  why  suppose you ask him why  it was not to be thought of it would have looked like prying into his thoughts selina i said there is something odd about you today what is the matter i dont understand you  my poor dear you will find yourself understanding me before long i thought i saw something like pity in her face when she said that  my poor dear i repeated what makes you speak to me in that way  i dont knowim tired im an old foolill go back to the house  without another word she left me i turned to look for philip and saw that my sister had joined him while i had been speaking to miss jillgall it pleased me to find that they were talking in a friendly way when i joined them a quarrel between helena and my husband that is to beno my husband that shall bewould have been too distressing too unnatural i might almost call it  philip looked along the backward path and asked what had become of miss jillgall have you any objection to follow her example he said to me when i told him that selina had returned to the town i dont care for the banks of this river  helena who used to like the river at other times was as ready as philip to leave it now i fancy they had both been kindly waiting to change our walk till i came to them and they could study my wishes too of course i was ready to go where they pleased i asked philip if there was anything he would like to see when we got into the streets again  clever helena suggested what seemed to be a strange amusement to offer to philip lets take him to the girls school she said  it appeared to be a matter of perfect indifference to him he was what they call ironical oh yes of course deeply interesting deeply interesting he suddenly broke into the wildest good spirits and tucked my hand under his arm with a gayety which it was impossible to resist what a boy you are helena said enjoying his delightful hilarity as i did    chapter xxiv eunices diary  on entering the schoolroom we lost our gayety all in a moment something unpleasant had evidently happened  two of the eldest girls were sitting together in a corner separated from the rest and looking most wickedly sulky the teachers were at the other end of the room appearing to be ill at ease and there standing in the midst of them with his face flushed and his eyes angrythere was papa sadly unlike his gentle self in the days of his health and happiness on former occasions when the exercise of his authority was required in the school his forbearing temper always set things right when i saw him now i thought of what the doctor had said of his health on my way home from the station  papa advanced to us the moment we showed ourselves at the door  he shook handscordially shook handswith philip it was delightful to see him delightful to hear him say pray dont suppose mr dunboyne that you are intruding remain with us by all means if you like then he spoke to helena and to me still excited still not like himself you couldnt have come here my dears at a time when your presence was more urgently needed he turned to the teachers tell my daughters what has happened tell them why they see me hereshocked and distressed i dont deny it  we now heard that the two girls in disgrace had broken the rules and in such a manner as to deserve severe punishment  one of them had been discovered hiding a novel in her desk the other had misbehaved herself more seriously stillshe had gone to the theater instead of expressing any regret they had actually dared to complain of having to learn papas improved catechism they had even accused him of treating them with severity because they were poor girls brought up on charity if we had been young ladies they were audacious enough to say more indulgence would have been shown to us we should have been allowed to read stories and to see plays  all this time i had been asking myself what papa meant when he told us we could not have come to the schoolroom at a better time his meaning now appeared when he spoke to the offending girls he pointed to helena and to me  here are my daughters he said you will not deny that they are young ladies now listen they shall tell you themselves whether my rules make any difference between them and you helena eunice do i allow you to read novels do i allow you to go to the play  we said noand hoped it was over but he had not done yet he turned to helena  answer some of the questions he went on from my manual of christian obligation which the girls call my catechism he asked one of the questions if you are told to do unto others as you would they should do unto you and if you find a difficulty in obeying that divine precept what does your duty require  it is my belief that helena has the materials in her for making another joan of arc she rose and answered without the slightest sign of timidity my duty requires me to go to the minister and to seek for advice and encouragement  and if these fail  then i am to remember that my pastor is my friend he claims no priestly authority or priestly infallibility he is my fellowchristian who loves me he will tell me how he has himself failed how he has struggled against himself and what a blessed reward has followed his victorya purified heart a peaceful mind  then papa released my sister after she had only repeated two out of all the answers in christian obligation which we first began to learn when we were children he then addressed himself again to the girls  is what you have just heard a part of my catechism has my daughter been excused from repeating it because she is a young lady where is the difference between the religious education which is given to my own child and that given to you  the wretched girls still sat silent and obstinate with their heads down i tremble again as i write of what happened next papa fixed his eyes on me he said out loud euniceand waited for me to rise and answer as my sister had done  it was entirely beyond my power to get on my feet  philip had innocently i am sure discouraged me i saw displeasure i saw contempt in his face there was a dead silence in the room everybody looked at me my heart beat furiously my hands turned cold the questions and answers in christian obligation all left my memory together i looked imploringly at papa  for the first time in his life he was hard on me his eyes were as angry as ever they showed me no mercy oh what had come to me what evil spirit possessed me i felt resentment horrid undutiful resentment at being treated in this cruel way my fists clinched themselves in my lap my face felt as hot as fire instead of asking my father to excuse me i said i cant do it he was astounded as well he might be i went on from bad to worse i said i wont do it  he stooped over me he whispered i am going to ask you something i insist on your answering yes or no he raised his voice and drew himself back so that they could all see me  have you been taught like your sister he asked has the catechism that has been her religious lesson for all her life been your religious lesson for all your life too  i said yesand i was in such a rage that i said it out loud if philip had handed me his cane and had advised me to give the young hussies who were answerable for this dreadful state of things a good beating i believe i should have done it papa turned his back on me and offered the girls a last chance do you feel sorry for what you have done do you ask to be forgiven  neither the one nor the other answered him he called across the room to the teachers those two pupils are expelled the school  both the women looked horrified the elder of the two approached him and tried to plead for a milder sentence he answered in one stern word silenceand left the schoolroom without even a passing bow to philip and this after he had cordially shaken hands with my poor dear not half an hour before  i ought to have made affectionate allowance for his nervous miseries i ought to have run after him and begged his pardon there must be something wrong i am afraid in girls loving anybody but their fathers when helena led the way out by another door i ran after philip and i asked him to forgive me  i dont know what i said it was all confusion the fear of having forfeited his fondness must i suppose have shaken my mind i remember entreating helena to say a kind word for me she was so clever she had behaved so well she had deserved that philip should listen to her oh i cried out to him desperately what must you think of me  i will tell you what i think of you he said it is your father who is in fault eunicenot you nothing could have been in worse taste than his management of that trumpery affair in the schoolroom it was a complete mistake from beginning to end make your mind easy i dont blame you  are you really and truly as fond of me as ever  yes to be sure  helena seemed to be hardly as much interested in this happy ending of my anxieties as i might have anticipated she walked on by herself perhaps she was thinking of poor papas strange outbreak of excitement and grieving over it  we had only a little way to walk before we passed the door of philips hotel he had not yet received the expected letter from his fatherthe cruel letter which might recall him to ireland it was then the hour of delivery by our second post he went to look at the letterrack in the hall helena saw that i was anxious she was as kind again as ever she consented to wait with me for philip at the door  he came out to us with an open letter in his hand  from my father at last he saidand gave me the letter to read it only contained these few lines  do not be alarmed my dear boy at the change for the worse in my handwriting i am suffering for my devotion to the studious habits of a lifetime my right hand is attacked by the malady called writers cramp the doctor here can do nothing he tells me of some foreign woman mentioned in his newspaper who cures nervous derangements of all kinds by handrubbing and who is coming to london when you next hear from me i may be in london toothere the letter ended  of course i knew who the foreign woman mentioned in the newspaper was  but what does miss jillgalls friend matter to me the one important thing is that philip has not been called back to ireland here is a fortunate circumstance which perhaps means more good luck i may be mrs philip dunboyne before the year is out    chapter xxv helenas diary  they all notice at home that i am looking worn and haggard that hideous old maid miss jillgall had her malicious welcome ready for me when we met at breakfast this morning dear helena what has become of your beauty one would think you had left it in your room poor deluded eunice showed her sisterly sympathy dont joke about it selina cant you see that helena is ill  i have been ill ill of my own wickedness  but the recovery to my tranquillity will bring with it the recovery of my good looks my fatal passion for philip promises to be the utter destruction of everything that is good in me well what is good in me may not be worth keeping there is a fate in these things if i am destined to rob eunice of the one dear object of her love and hopehow can i resist the one kind thing i can do is to keep her in ignorance of what is coming by acts of affectionate deceit  besides if she suffers i suffer too in the length and breadth of england i doubt if there is a much more wicked young woman to be found than myself is it nothing to feel that and to endure it as i do  upon my word there is no excuse for me  is this sheer impudence no it is the bent of my nature i have a tendency to selfexamination accompanied by one meriti dont spare myself  there are excuses for eunice she lives in a fools paradise and she sees in her lover a radiant creature shining in the halo thrown over him by her own selfdelusion nothing of this sort is to be said for me i see philip as he is my penetration looks into the lowest depths of his characterwhen i am not in his company there seems to be a foundation of good somewhere in his nature he despises and hates himself he has confessed it to me when eunice is with himstill believing in her false sweetheart but how long do these better influences last i have only to show myself in my sisters absence and philip is mine body and soul his vanity and his weakness take possession of him the moment he sees my face he is one of those meneven in my little experience i have met with themwho are born to be led by women if eunice had possessed my strength of character he would have been true to her for life  ought i not in justice to myself to have lifted my heart high above the reach of such a creature as this certainly i ought i know it i feel it and yet there is some fascination in having him which i am absolutely unable to resist  what i ask myself has fed the new flame which is burning in me did it begin with gratified pride i might well feel proud when i found myself admired by a man of his beauty set off by such manners and such accomplishments as his or has the growth of this masterful feeling been encouraged by the envy and jealousy stirred in me when i found eunice my inferior in every respect distinguished by the devotion of a handsome lover and having a brilliant marriage in viewwhile i was left neglected with no prospect of changing my title from miss to mrs vain inquiries my wicked heart seems to have secrets of its own and to keep them a mystery to me  what has become of my excellent education i dont care to inquire i have got beyond the reach of good books and religious examples among my other blamable actions there may now be reckoned disobedience to my father i have been reading novels in secret  at first i tried some of the famous english works published at a price within the reach of small purses very well written no doubtbut with one unpardonable drawback so far as i am concerned our celebrated native authors address themselves to good people or to penitent people who want to be made good not to wicked readers like me  arriving at this conclusion i tried another experiment in a small booksellers shop i discovered some cheap translations of french novels here i found what i wantedsympathy with sin here there was opened to me a new world inhabited entirely by unrepentant people the magnificent women diabolically beautiful the satanic men dead to every sense of virtue and aliveperhaps rather dirtily aliveto the splendid fascinations of crime i know now that love is above everything but itself love is the one law that we are bound to obey how deep how consoling how admirably true the novelists of england have reason indeed to hide their heads before the novelists of france all that i have felt and have written here is inspired by these wonderful authors   i have relieved my mind and may now return to the business of my diarythe record of domestic events  an overwhelming disappointment has fallen on eunice our dinnerparty has been put off  the state of fathers health is answerable for this change in our arrangements that wretched scene at the school complicated by my sisters undutiful behavior at the time so seriously excited him that he passed a sleepless night and kept his bedroom throughout the day eunices total want of discretion added no doubt to his sufferings she rudely intruded on him to express her regret and to ask his pardon having carried her point she was at leisure to come to me and to ask how amazingly simple of her what she and philip were to do next  we had arranged it all so nicely the poor wretch began philip was to have been so clever and agreeable at dinner and was to have chosen his time so very discreetly that papa would have been ready to listen to anything he said oh we should have succeeded i havent a doubt of it our only hope helena is in you what are we to do now  wait i answered  wait she repeated hotly is my heart to be broken and what is more cruel still is philip to be disappointed i expected something more sensible my dear from you what possible reason can there be for waiting  the reasonif i could only have mentioned itwas beyond dispute i wanted time to quiet philips uneasy conscience and to harden his weak mind against outbursts of violence on eunices part which would certainly exhibit themselves when she found that she had lost her lover and lost him to me in the meanwhile i had to produce my reason for advising her to wait it was easily done i reminded her of the irritable condition of our fathers nerves and gave it as my opinion that he would certainly say no if she was unwise enough to excite him on the subject of philip in his present frame of mind  these unanswerable considerations seemed to produce the right effect on her i suppose you know best was all she said and then she left me  i let her go without feeling any distrust of this act of submission on her part it was such a common experience in my life to find my sister guiding herself by my advice but experience is not always to be trusted events soon showed that i had failed to estimate eunices resources of obstinacy and cunning at their true value  half an hour later i heard the street door closed and looked out of the window miss jillgall was leaving the house no one was with her my dislike of this person led me astray once more i ought to have suspected her of being bent on some mischievous errand and to have devised some means of putting my suspicions to the test i did nothing of the kind in the moment when i turned my head away from the window miss jillgall was a person forgottenand i was a person who had made a serious mistake    chapter xxvi helenas diary  the event of today began with the delivery of a message summoning me to my fathers study he had decidedtoo hastily as i fearedthat he was sufficiently recovered to resume his usual employments i was writing to his dictation when we were interrupted maria announced a visit from mr dunboyne  hitherto philip had been content to send one of the servants of the hotel to make inquiry after mr gracedieus health why had he now called personally noticing that father seemed to be annoyed i tried to make an opportunity of receiving philip myself let me see him i suggested i can easily say you are engaged  very unwillingly as it was easy to see my father declined to allow this mr dunboynes visit pays me a compliment he said and i must receive him i made a show of leaving the room and was called back to my chair this is not a private interview helena stay where you are  philip came inhandsomer than ever beautifully dressedand paid his respects to my father with his customary grace he was too wellbred to allow any visible signs of embarrassment to escape him but when he shook hands with me i felt a little trembling in his fingers through the delicate gloves which fitted him like a second skin was it the true object of his visit to try the experiment designed by eunice and himself and deferred by the postponement of our dinnerparty impossible surely that my sister could have practiced on his weakness and persuaded him to return to his first love i waited in breathless interest for his next words they were not worth listening to oh the poor commonplace creature  i am glad mr gracedieu to see that you are well enough to be in your study again he said the writing materials on the table attracted his attention am i one of the idle people he asked with his charming smile who are always interrupting useful employment  he spoke to my father and he was answered by my father not once had he addressed a word to meno not even when we shook hands i was angry enough to force him into taking some notice of me and to make an attempt to confuse him at the same time  have you seen my sister i asked  no  it was the shortest reply that he could choose having flung it at me he still persisted in looking at my father and speaking to my father do you think of trying change of air mr gracedieu when you feel strong enough to travel  my duties keep me here father answered and i cannot honestly say that i enjoy traveling i dislike manners and customs that are strange to me i dont find that hotels reward me for giving up the comforts of my own house how do you find the hotel here  i submit to the hotel sir they are sad savages in the kitchen they put mushroom ketchup into their soup and mustard and cayenne pepper into their salads i am halfstarved at dinnertime but i dont complain  every word he said was an offense to me with or without reason i attacked him again  i have heard you acknowledge that the landlord and landlady are very obliging people i said why dont you ask them to let you make your own soup and mix your own salad  i wondered whether i should succeed in attracting his notice after this even in these private pages my selfesteem finds it hard to confess what happened i succeeded in reminding philip that he had his reasons for requesting me to leave the room  will you excuse me miss helena he said if i ask leave to speak to mr gracedieu in private  the right thing for me to do was let me hope the thing that i did i rose and waited to see if my father would interfere he looked at philip with suspicion in his face as well as surprise may i ask he said coldly what is the object of the interview  certainly philip answered when we are alone this cool reply placed my father between two alternatives he must either give way or be guilty of an act of rudeness to a guest in his own house the choice reserved for me was narrower stilli had to decide between being told to go or going of my own accord of course i left them together  the door which communicated with the next room was pulled to but not closed on the other side of it i found eunice  listening i said in a whisper  yes she whispered back you listen too  i was so indignant with philip and so seriously interested in what was going on in the study that i yielded to temptation we both degraded ourselves we both listened  eunices base lover spoke first judging by the change in his voice he must have seen something in my fathers face that daunted him eunice heard it too hes getting nervous she whispered hell forget to say the right thing at the right time  mr gracedieu philip began i wish to speak to you  father interrupted him we are alone now mr dunboyne i want to know why you consult me in private  i am anxious to consult you sir on a subject  on what subject any religious difficulty  no  anything i can do for you in the town  not at all if you will only allow me  i am still waiting sir to know what it is about  philips voice suddenly became an angry voice once for all mr gracedieu he said will you let me speak its about your daughter  no more of it mr dunboyne my father was now as loud as philip i dont desire to hold a private conversation with you on the subject of my daughter  if you have any personal objection to me sir be so good as to state it plainly  you have no right to ask me to do that  you refuse to do it  positively  you are not very civil mr gracedieu  if i speak without ceremony mr dunboyne you have yourself to thank for it  philip replied to this in a tone of savage irony you are a minister of religion and you are an old man two privilegesand you presume on them both goodmorning  i drew back into a corner just in time to escape discovery in the character of a listener eunice never moved when philip dashed into the room banging the door after him she threw herself impulsively on his breast oh philip philip what have you done why didnt you keep your temper  did you hear what your father said to me he asked  yes dear but you ought to have controlled yourselfyou ought indeed for my sake  her arms were still round him it struck me that he felt her influence if you wish me to recover myself he said gently you had better let me go  oh how cruel philip to leave me when i am so wretched why do you want to go  you told me just now what i ought to do he answered still restraining himself if i am to get the better of my temper i must be left alone  i never said anything about your temper darling  didnt you tell me to control myself  oh yes go back to papa and beg him to forgive you  ill see him damned first  if ever a stupid girl deserved such an answer as this the girl was my sister i had hitherto with some difficulty refrained from interfering but when eunice tried to follow philip out of the house i could hesitate no longer i held her back you fool i said havent you made mischief enough already  what am i to do she burst out helplessly  do what i told you to do yesterdaywait  before she could reply or i could say anything more the door that led to the landing was opened softly and slyly and miss jillgall peeped in eunice instantly left me and ran to the meddling old maid they whispered to each other miss jillgalls skinny arm encircled my sisters waist they disappeared together  i was only too glad to get rid of them both and to take the opportunity of writing to philip i insisted on an explanation of his conduct while i was in the studyto be given within an hours time at a place which i appointed you are not to attempt to justify yourself in writing i added in conclusion let your reply merely inform me if you can keep the appointment the rest when we meet  maria took the letter to the hotel with instructions to wait  philips reply reached me without delay it pledged him to justify himself as i had desired and to keep the appointment my own belief is that the event of today will decide his future and mine    chapter xxvii eunices diary  indeed i am a most unfortunate creature everything turns out badly with me my good true friend my dear selina has become the object of a hateful doubt in my secret mind i am afraid she is keeping something from me  talking with her about my troubles i heard for the first time that she had written again to mrs tenbruggen the object of her letter was to tell her friend of my engagement to young mr dunboyne i asked her why she had done this the answer informed me that there was no knowing in the present state of my affairs how soon i might not want the help of a clever woman i ought i suppose to have been satisfied with this but there seemed to be something not fully explained yet  then again after telling selina what i heard in the study and how roughly philip had spoken to me afterward i asked her what she thought of it she made an incomprehensible reply my sweet child i mustnt think of iti am too fond of you  it was impossible to make her explain what this meant she began to talk of philip assuring me which was quite needless that she had done her best to fortify and encourage him before he called on papa when i asked her to help me in another waythat is to say when i wanted to find out where philip was at that momentshe had no advice to give me i told her that i should not enjoy a moments ease of mind until i and my dear one were reconciled she only shook her head and declared that she was sorry for me when i hit on the idea of ringing for maria this little woman so bright and quick and eager to help me at other times said i leave it to you dear and turned to the piano close to which i was sitting and played softly and badly stupid little tunes  maria did you open the door for mr dunboyne when he went away just now  no miss  nothing but illluck for me if i had been left to my own devices i should now have let the housemaid go but selina contrived to give me a hint on a strange plan of her own still at the piano she began to confuse talking to herself with playing to herself the notes went tinkle tinkleand the tongue mixed up words with the notes in this way perhaps they have been talking in the kitchen about philip  the suggestion was not lost on me i said to mariawho was standing at the other end of the room near the doordid you happen to hear which way mr dunboyne went when he left us  i know where he was miss half an hour ago  where was he  at the hotel  selina went on with her hints in the same way as before how does she knowah how does she know was the vocal part of the performance this time my clever inquiries followed the vocal part as before  how do you know that mr dunboyne was at the hotel  i was sent there with a letter for him and waited for the answer  there was no suggestion required this time the one possible question was who sent you  maria replied after first reserving a condition you wont tell upon me miss  i promised not to tell selina suddenly left off playing  well i repeated who sent you  miss helena  selina looked round at me her little eyes seemed to have suddenly become big they stared me so strangely in the face i dont know whether she was in a state of fright or of wonder as for myself i simply lost the use of my tongue maria having no more questions to answer discreetly left us together  why should helena write to philip at alland especially without mentioning it to me here was a riddle which was more than i could guess i asked selina to help me she might at least have tried i thought but she looked uneasy and made excuses  i said suppose i go to helena and ask her why she wrote to philip and selina said suppose you do dear  i rang for maria once more do you know where my sister is  just gone out miss  there was no help for it but to wait till she came back and to get through the time in the interval as i best might but for one circumstance i might not have known what to do the truth is there was a feeling of shame in me when i remembered having listened at the study door curious notions come into ones headone doesnt know how or why it struck me that i might make a kind of atonement for having been mean enough to listen if i went to papa and offered to keep him company in his solitude if we fell into pleasant talk i had a sly idea of my owni meant to put in a good word for poor philip  when i confided my design to selina she shut up the piano and ran across the room to me but somehow she was not like her old self again yet  you good little soul you are always right look at me again euneece are you beginning to doubt me oh my darling dont do that it isnt using me fairly i cant bear iti cant bear it  i took her hand i was on the point of speaking to her with the kindness she deserved from me on a sudden she snatched her hand away and ran back to the piano when she was seated on the musicstool her face was hidden from me at that moment she broke into a strange cryit began like a laugh and it ended like a sob  go away to papa dont mind meim a creature of impulseha ha ha a little hystericalthe state of the weatheri get rid of these weaknesses my dear by singing to myself i have a favorite song my heart is light my will is freego away oh for gods sake go away  i had heard of hysterics of course knowing nothing about them however by my own experience what could have happened to agitate her in this extraordinary manner  had helenas letter anything to do with it was my sister indignant with philip for swearing in my presence and had she written him an angry letter in her zeal on my behalf but selina could not possibly have seen the letterand helena who is often hard on me when i do stupid things showed little indulgence for me when i was so unfortunate as to irritate philip i gave up the hopeless attempt to get at the truth by guessing and went away to forget my troubles if i could in my fathers society  after knocking twice at the door of the study and receiving no reply i ventured to look in  the sofa in this room stood opposite the door papa was resting on it but not in comfort there were twitching movements in his feet and he shifted his arms this way and that as if no restful posture could he found for them but what frightened me was this his eyes staring straight at the door by which i had gone in had an inquiring expression as if he actually did not know me i stood midway between the door and the sofa doubtful about going nearer to him  he said who is it this to meto his own daughter he said what do you want  i really could not bear it i went up to him i said papa have you forgotten eunice  my name seemed if one may say such a thing to bring him to himself again he sat upon the sofaand laughed as he answered me  my dear child what delusion has got into that pretty little head of yours fancy her thinking that i had forgotten my own daughter i was lost in thought eunice for the moment i was what they call an absent man did i ever tell you the story of the absent man he went to call upon some acquaintance of his and when the servant said what name sir he couldnt answer he was obliged to confess that he had forgotten his own name the servant said thats very strange the absent man at once recovered himself thats it he said my name is strange droll isnt it if i had been calling on a friend today i daresay i might have forgotten my name too much to think of eunicetoo much to think of  leaving the sofa with a sigh as if he was tired of it he began walking up and down he seemed to be still in good spirits well my dear he said what can i do for you  i came here papa to see if there was anything i could do for you  he looked at some sheets of paper strung together and laid on the table they were covered with writing from his dictation in my sisters hand i ought to get on with my work he said where is helena  i told him that she had gone out and begged leave to try what i could do to supply her place  the request seemed to please him but he wanted time to think i waited noticing that his face grew gradually worried and anxious there came a vacant look into his eyes which it grieved me to see he appeared to have quite lost himself again read the last page he said pointing to the manuscript on the table i dont remember where i left off  i turned to the last page as well as i could tell it related to some publication which he was recommending to religious persons of our way of thinking  before i had read halfway through it he began to dictate speaking so rapidly that my pen was not always able to follow him my handwriting is as bad as bad can be when i am hurried to make matters worse still i was confused what he was now saying seemed to have nothing to do with what i had been reading  let me try if i can call to mind the substance of it  he began in the most strangely sudden way by asking why should there be any fear of discovery when every possible care had been taken to prevent it the danger from unexpected events was far more disquieting a man might find himself bound in honor to disclose what it had been the chief anxiety of his life to conceal for example could he let an innocent person be the victim of deliberate suppression of the truthno matter how justifiable that suppression might appear to be on the other hand dreadful consequences might follow an honorable confession there might be a cruel sacrifice of tender affection there might be a shocking betrayal of innocent hope and trust  i remember those last words just as he dictated them because he suddenly stopped there looking poor dear distressed and confused he put his hand to his head and went back to the sofa  im tired he said wait for me while i rest  in a few minutes he fell asleep it was a deep repose that came to him now and though i dont think it lasted much longer than half an hour it produced a wonderful change in him for the better when he woke he spoke quietly and kindly and when he returned to me at the table and looked at the page on which i had been writing he smiled  oh my dear what bad writing i declare i cant read what i myself told you to write no no dont be downhearted about it you are not used to writing from dictation and i daresay i have been too quick for you he kissed me and encouraged me you know how fond i am of my little girl he said i am afraid i like my eunice just the least in the world more than i like my helena ah you are beginning to look a little happier now  he had filled me with such confidence and such pleasure that i could not help thinking of my sweetheart oh dear when shall i learn to be distrustful of my own feelings the temptation to say a good word for philip quite mastered any little discretion that i possessed  i said to papa if you knew how to make me happier than i have ever been in all my life before would you do it  of course i would  then send for philip dear and be a little kinder to him this time  his pale face turned red with anger he pushed me away from him  that man again he burst out am i never to hear the last of him go away eunice you are of no use here he took up my unfortunate page of writing and ridiculed it with a bitter laugh what is this fit for he crumpled it up in his hand and tossed it into the fire  i ran out of the room in such a state of mortification that i hardly knew what i was about if some hardhearted person had come to me with a cup of poison and had said eunice you are not fit to live any longer take this i do believe i should have taken it if i thought of anything i thought of going back to selina my ill luck still pursued me she had disappeared i looked about in a helpless way completely at a loss what to do nextso stupefied i may even say that it was some time before i noticed a little threecornered note on the table by which i was standing the note was addressed to me   everdearest euneecei have tried to make myself useful to you and have failed but how can i see the sad sight of your wretchedness and not feel the impulse to try again i have gone to the hotel to find philip and to bring him back to you a penitent and faithful man wait for me and hope for great things a hundred thousand kisses to my sweet euneece  s j   wait for her after reading that note how could she expect it i had only to follow her and to find philip in another minute i was on my way to the hotel  chapter xxviii helenas diary  looking at the last entry in my journal i see myself anticipating that the event of today will decide philips future and mine this has proved prophetic all further concealment is now at an end  forced to it by fate or helped to it by chance eunice has made the discovery of her lovers infidelity in all human probability as my father says in his sermons we two sisters are enemies for life   i am not suspected as eunice is of making appointments with a sweetheart so i am free to go out alone and to go where i please philip and i were punctual to our appointment this afternoon  our place of meeting was in a secluded corner of the town park we found a rustic seat in our retirement set up one would suppose as a concession to the taste of visitors who are fond of solitude the view in front of us was bounded by the park wall and railings and our seat was prettily approached on one side by a plantation of young trees no entrance gate was near no carriage road crossed the grass a more safe and more solitary nook for conversation between two persons desiring to be alone it would be hard to find in most public parks lovers are said to know it well and to be especially fond of it toward evening we were there in broad daylight and we had the seat to ourselves  my memory of what passed between us is in some degree disturbed by the formidable interruption which brought our talk to an end  but among other things i remember that i showed him no mercy at the outset at one time i was indignant at another i was scornful i declared in regard to my object in meeting him that i had changed my mind and had decided to shorten a disagreeable interview by waiving my right to an explanation and bidding him farewell eunice as i pointed out had the first claim to him eunice was much more likely to suit him as a companion for life than i was in short i said in conclusion my inclination for once takes sides with my duty and leaves my sister in undisturbed possession of young mr dunboyne with this satirical explanation i rose to say goodby  i had merely intended to irritate him he showed a superiority to anger for which i was not prepared  be so kind as to sit down again he said quietly  he took my letter from his pocket and pointed to that part of it which alluded to his conduct when we had met in my fathers study  you have offered me the opportunity of saying a word in my own defense he went on i prize that privilege far too highly to consent to your withdrawing it merely because you have changed your mind let me at least tell you what my errand was when i called on your father loving you and you only i had forced myself to make a last effort to be true to your sister remember that helena and then sayis it wonderful if i was beside myself when i found you in the study  when you tell me you were beside yourself i said do you mean ashamed of yourself  that touched him i mean nothing of the kind he burst out after the hell on earth in which i have been living between you two sisters a man hasnt virtue enough left in him to be ashamed hes half madthats what he is look at my position i had made up my mind never to see you again i had made up my mind if i married eunice to rid myself of my own miserable life when i could endure it no longer in that state of feeling when my sense of duty depended on my speaking with mr gracedieu alone whose was the first face i saw when i entered the room if i had dared to look at you or to speak to you what do you think would have become of my resolution to sacrifice myself  what has become of it now i asked  tell me first if i am forgiven he saidand you shall know  do you deserve to be forgiven  it has been discovered by wiser heads than mine that weak people are always in extremes so far i had seen philip in the vain and violent extreme he now shifted suddenly to the sad and submissive extreme when i asked him if he deserved to be forgiven he made the humblest of all replieshe sighed and said nothing  if i did my duty to my sister i reminded him i should refuse to forgive you and send you back to eunice  your fathers language and your fathers conduct he answered have released me from that entanglement i can never go back to eunice if you refuse to forgive me neither you nor she will see anything more of philip dunboyne i promise you that are you satisfied now  after holding out against him resolutely i felt myself beginning to yield when a man has once taken their fancy what helplessly weak creatures women are i saw through his vacillating weaknessand yet i trusted him with both eyes open my lookingglass is opposite to me while i write it shows me a contemptible helena i lied and said i was satisfiedto please him  am i forgiven he asked  it is absurd to put it on record of course i forgave him what a good christian i am after all  he took my willing hand my lovely darling he said our marriage rests with you whether your father approves of it or not say the word claim me and i am yours for life  i must have been infatuated by his voice and his look my heart must have been burning under the pressure of his hand on mine was it my modesty or my selfcontrol that deserted me i let him take me in his arms again and again and again i kissed him we were deaf to what we ought to have heard we were blind to what we ought to have seen before we were conscious of a movement among the trees we were discovered my sister flew at me like a wild animal her furious hands fastened themselves on my throat philip started to his feet when he touched her in the act of forcing her back from me eunices raging strength became utter weakness in an instant her arms fell helpless at her sidesher head droopedshe looked at him in silence which was dreadful at such a moment as that he shrank from the unendurable reproach in those tearless eyes meanly he turned away from her meanly i followed him looking back for an instant i saw her step forward perhaps to stop him perhaps to speak to him the effort was too much for her strength she staggered back against the trunk of a tree like strangers walking separate one from the other we left her to her companionthe hideous traitress who was my enemy and her friend    chapter xxix helenas diary  on reaching the street which led to philips hotel we spoke to each other for the first time  what are we to do i said  leave this place he answered  together i asked  yes  to leave us for a while after what had happened might be the wisest thing which a man in philips critical position could do but if i went with himunprovided as i was with any friend of my own sex whose character and presence might sanction the step i had takeni should be lost beyond redemption is any man that ever lived worth that sacrifice i thought of my fathers house closed to me and of our friends ashamed of me i have owned in some earlier part of my journal that i am not very patient under domestic cares but the possibility of eunice being appointed housekeeper with my power in my place was more than i could calmly contemplate no i said to philip your absence at such a time as this may help us both but come what may of it i must remain at home  he yielded without an attempt to make me alter my mind there was a sullen submission in his manner which it was not pleasant to see was he despairing already of himself and of me had eunice aroused the watchful demons of shame and remorse  perhaps you are right he said gloomily goodby  my anxiety put the allimportant question to him without hesitation  is it goodby forever philip  his reply instantly relieved me god forbid  but i wanted more you still love me i persisted  more dearly than ever  and yet you leave me  he turned pale i leave you because i am afraid  afraid of what  afraid to face eunice again  the only possible way out of our difficulty that i could see now occurred to me suppose my sister can be prevailed on to give you up i suggested would you come back to us in that case  certainly  and you would ask my father to consent to our marriage  on the day of my return if you like  suppose obstacles get in our way i saidsuppose time passes and tries your patiencewill you still consider yourself engaged to me  engaged to you he answered in spite of obstacles and in spite of time  and while you are away from me i ventured to add we shall write to each other  go where i may he said you shall always hear from me  i could ask no more and he could concede no more the impression evidently left on him by eunices terrible outbreak was far more serious than i had anticipated i was myself depressed and ill at ease no expressions of tenderness were exchanged between us there was something horrible in our barren farewell we merely clasped hands at parting he went his wayand i went mine  there are some occasions when women set an example of courage to men i was ready to endure whatever might happen to me when i got home what a desperate wretch some people might say if they could look into this diary  maria opened the door she told me that my sister had already returned accompanied by miss jillgall there had been apparently some difference of opinion between them before they entered the house eunice had attempted to go on to some other place and miss jillgall had remonstrated maria had heard her say no you would degrade yourselfand with that she had led eunice indoors i understood of course that my sister had been prevented from following philip to the hotel there was probably a serious quarrel in store for me i went straight to the bedroom expecting to find eunice there and prepared to brave the storm that might burst on me there was a woman at eunices end of the room removing dresses from the wardrobe i could only see her back but it was impossible to mistake that figuremiss jillgall she laid the dresses on eunices bed without taking the slightest notice of me in significant silence i pointed to the door she went on as coolly with her occupation as if the room had been not mine but hers i stepped up to her and spoke plainly  you oblige me to remind you i said that you are not in your own room there i waited a little and found that i had produced no effect with every disposition i resumed to make allowance for the disagreeable peculiarities of your character i cannot consent to overlook an act of intrusion committed by a spy now do you understand me  she looked round her i see no third person here she said may i ask if you mean me  i mean you  will you be so good miss helena as to explain yourself  moderation of language would have been thrown away on this woman you followed me to the park i said it was you who found me with mr dunboyne and betrayed me to my sister you are a spy and you know it at this very moment you darent look me in the face  her insolence forced its way out of her at last let me record itand repay it when the time comes  quite true she replied if i ventured to look you in the face i am afraid i might forget myself i have always been brought up like a lady and i wish to show it even in the company of such a wretch as you are there is not one word of truth in what you have said of me i went to the hotel to find mr dunboyne ah you may sneer i havent got your good looksand a vile use you have made of them my object was to recall that base young man to his duty to my dear charming injured euneece the hotel servant told me that mr dunboyne had gone out oh i had the means of persuasion in my pocket the man directed me to the park as he had already directed mr dunboyne it was only when i had found the place that i heard some one behind me poor innocent euneece had followed me to the hotel and had got her directions as i had got mine god knows how hard i tried to persuade her to go back and how horribly frightened i wasno i wont distress myself by saying a word more it would be too humiliating to let you see an honest woman in tears your sister has a spirit of her own thank god she wont inhabit the same room with you she never desires to see your false face again i take the poor souls dresses and things awayand as a religious person i wait confidently wait for the judgment that will fall on you  she caught up the dresses all together some of them were in her arms some of them fell on her shoulders and one of them towered over her head smothered in gowns she bounced out of the room like a walking milliners shop i have to thank the wretched old creature for a moment of genuine amusement at a time of devouring anxiety the meanest insect they say has its use in this worldand why not miss jillgall  in half an hour more an unexpected event raised my spirits i heard from philip  on his return to the hotel he had found a telegram waiting for him mr dunboyne the elder had arrived in london and philip had arranged to join his father by the next train he sent me the address and begged that i would write and tell him my news from home by the next days post  welcome thrice welcome to mr dunboyne the elder if philip can manage under my advice to place me favorably in the estimation of this rich old man his presence and authority may do for us what we cannot do for ourselves here is surely an influence to which my father must submit no matter how unreasonable or how angry he may be when he hears what has happened i begin already to feel hopeful of the future    chapter xxx eunices diary  through the day and through the night i feel a misery that never leaves mei mean the misery of fear  i am trying to find out some harmless means of employing myself which will keep evil remembrances from me if i dont succeed my fear tells me what will happen i shall be in danger of going mad  i dare not confide in any living creature i dont know what other persons might think of me or how soon i might find myself perhaps in an asylum in this helpless condition doubt and fright seem to be driving me back to my journal i wonder whether i shall find harmless employment here  i have heard of old people losing their memories what would i not give to be old i remember oh how i remember one day after another i see philip i see helena as i first saw them when i was among the trees in the park my sweethearts arms that once held me hold my sister now she kisses him kisses him kisses him  is there no way of making myself see something else i want to get back to remembrances that dont burn in my head and tear at my heart how is it to be done  i have tried booksno i have tried going out to look at the shopsno i have tried saying my prayersno and now i am making my last effort trying my pen my black letters fall from it and take their places on the white paper will my black letters help me where can i find something consoling to write down where where  selinapoor selina so fond of me so sorry for me when i was happy she was happy too it was always amusing to hear her talk oh my memory be good to me save me from philip and helena i want to remember the pleasant days when my kind little friend and i used to gossip in the garden  no the days in the garden wont come back what else can i think of    the recollections that i try to encourage keep away from me the other recollections that i dread come crowding back still philip still helena  but selina mixes herself up with them let me try again if i can think of selina  how delightfully good to me and patient with me she was on our dismal way home from the park and how affectionately she excused herself for not having warned me of it when she first suspected that my own sister and my worst enemy were one and the same  i know i was wrong my dear to let my love and pity close my lips but remember how happy you were at the time the thought of making you miserable was more than i could endurei am so fond of you yes i began to suspect them on the day when they first met at the station and i am afraid i thought it just likely that you might be as cunning as i was and have noticed them too  oh how ignorant she must have been of my true thoughts and feelings how strangely people seem to misunderstand their dearest friends knowing as i did that i could never love any man but philip could i be wicked enough to suppose that philip would love any woman but me  i explained to selina how he had spoken to me when we were walking together on the bank of the river shall i ever forget those exquisite words i wish i was a better man eunice i wish i was good enough to be worthy of you i asked selina if she thought he was deceiving me when he said that she comforted me by owning that he must have been in earnest at the timeand then she distressed me by giving the reason why  my love you must have innocently said something to him when you and he were alone which touched his conscience when he had a conscience and made him ashamed of himself ah you were too fond of him to see how he changed for the worse when your vile sister joined you and took possession of him again it made my heart ache to see you so unsuspicious of them you asked me my poor dear if they had quarreledyou believed they were tired of walking by the river when it was you they were tired ofand you wondered why helena took him to see the school my child she was the leading spirit at the school and you were nobody her vanity saw the chance of making him compare you at a disadvantage with your clever sister i declare euneece i lose my head if i only think of it all the strong points in my character seem to slip away from me would you believe iti have neglected that sweet infant at the cottage i have even let mrs molly have her baby back again if i had the making of the laws philip dunboyne and helena gracedieu should be hanged together on the same gallows i see i shock you dont let us talk of it oh dont let us talk of it  and here am i writing of it what i had determined not to do is what i have done am i losing my senses already the very names that i was most anxious to keep out of my memory stare me in the face in the lines that i have just written philip again helena again    another day and something new that must and will be remembered shrink from it as i may this afternoon i met helena on the stairs  she stopped and eyed me with a wicked smile she held out her hand we are likely to meet often while we are in the same house she said hadnt we better consult appearances and pretend to be as fond of each other as ever  i took no notice of her hand i took no notice of her shameless proposal she tried again after all it isnt my fault if philip likes me better than he likes you dont you see that i still refused to speak to her she still persisted how black you look eunice are you sorry you didnt kill me when you had your hands on my throat  i said yes  she laughed and left me i was obliged to sit down on the stairi trembled so my own reply frightened me i tried to find out why i had said yes i dont remember being conscious of meaning anything it was as if somebody else had said yesnot i perhaps i was provoked and the word escaped me before i could stop it could i have stopped it i dont know    another sleepless night  did i pass the miserable hours in writing letters to philip and then tearing them up or did i only fancy that i wrote to him i have just looked at the fireplace the torn paper in it tells me that i did write why did i destroy my letters i might have sent one of them to philip after what has happened oh no no  having been many days away from the girls scripture class it seemed to be possible that going back to the school and the teaching might help me to escape from myself  nothing succeeds with me i found it impossible to instruct the girls as usual their stupidity soon reached the limit of my patiencesuffocated me with rage one of them a poor fat feeble creature began to cry when i scolded her i looked with envy at the tears rolling over her big round cheeks if i could only cry i might perhaps bear my hard fate with submission  i walked toward home by a roundabout way feeling as if want of sleep was killing me by inches  in the high street i saw helena she was posting a letter and was not aware that i was near her leaving the postoffice she crossed the street and narrowly escaped being run over suppose the threatened accident had really taken placehow should i have felt if it had ended fatally what a fool i am to be putting questions to myself about things that have not happened  the walking tired me i went straight home  before i could ring the bell the house door opened and the doctor came out he stopped to speak to me while i had been away he said something had happened at home he neither knew nor wished to know what which had thrown my father into a state of violent agitation the doctor had administered composing medicine my patient is asleep now he told me but remember what i said to you the last time we met a longer rest than any doctors prescription can give him is what he wants you are not looking well yourself my dear what is the matter  i told him of my wretched restless nights and asked if i might take some of the composing medicine which he had given to my father he forbade me to touch a drop of it what is physic for your father you foolish child is not physic for a young creature like you he said count a thousand if you cant sleep tonight or turn your pillow i wish you pleasant dreams he went away amused at his own humor  i found selina waiting to speak with me on the subject of poor papa  she had been startled on hearing his voice loud in anger in the fear that something serious had happened she left her room to make inquiries and saw helena on the landing of the flight of stairs beneath leaving the study after waiting till my sister was out of the way selina ventured to present herself at the study door and to ask if she could be of any use my father walking excitedly up and down the room declared that both his daughters had behaved infamously and that he would not suffer them to speak to him again until they had come to their senses on the subject of mr dunboyne he would enter into no further explanation and he had ordered rather than requested selina to leave him having obeyed she tried next to find me and had just looked into the diningroom to see if i was there when she was frightened by the sound of a fall in the room abovethat is to say in the study running upstairs again she had found him insensible on the floor and had sent for the doctor  and mind this selina continued the person who has done the mischief is the person whom i saw leaving the study what your unnatural sister said to provoke her father  that your unnatural sister will tell you herself helenas voice added she had opened the door while we were too much absorbed in our talk to hear her  selina attempted to leave the room i caught her by the hand and held her back i was afraid of what i might do if she left me by myself never have i felt anything like the rage that tortured me when i saw helena looking at us with the same wicked smile on her lips that had insulted me when we met on the stairs have we anything to be ashamed of i said to selina stay where you are  you may be of some use miss jillgall if you stay my sister suggested eunice seems to be trembling is she angry or is she ill  the sting of this was in the tone of her voice it was the hardest thing i ever had to do in my lifebut i did succeed in controlling myself  go on with what you have to say i answered and dont notice me  you are not very polite my dear but i can make allowances oh come come putting up your hands to stop your ears is too childish you would do better to express regret for having misled your father yes you did mislead him only a few days since you left him to suppose that you were engaged to philip it became my duty after that to open his eyes to the truth and if i unhappily provoked him it was your fault i was strictly careful in the language i used i said dear father you have been misinformed on a very serious subject the only marriage engagement for which your kind sanction is requested is my engagement i have consented to become mrs philip dunboyne  stop i said  why am i to stop  because i have something to say you and i are looking at each other does my face tell you what is passing in my mind  your face seems to be paler than usual she answeredthats all  no i said that is not all the devil that possessed me when i discovered you with philip is not cast out of me yet silence the sneering devil that is in you or we may both live to regret it  whether i did or did not frighten her i cannot say this only i knowshe turned away silently to the door and went out  i dropped on the sofa that horrid hungering for revenge which i felt for the first time when i knew how helena had wronged me began to degrade and tempt me again in the effort to get away from this new evil self of mine i tried to find sympathy in selina and called to her to come and sit by me she seemed to be startled when i looked at her but she recovered herself and came to me and took my hand  i wish i could comfort you she said in her kind simple way  keep my hand in your hand i told her i am drowning in dark waterand i have nothing to hold by but you  oh my darling dont talk in that way  good selina dear selina you shall talk to me say something harmlesstell me a melancholy storytry to make me cry  my poor little friend looked sadly bewildered  im more likely to cry myself she said this is so heartbreakingi almost wish i was back in the time before you came home the time when your detestable sister first showed how she hated me i was happy meanly happy in the spiteful enjoyment of provoking her oh euneece i shall never recover my spirits again all the pity in the world would not be pity enough for you so hardly treated so young so forlorn your good father too ill to help you your poor mother  i interrupted her she had interested me in something better than my own wretched self i asked directly if she had known my mother  my dear child i never even saw her  has my father never spoken to you about her  only once when i asked him how long she had been dead he told me you lost her while you were an infant and he told me no more i was looking at her portrait in the study only yesterday i think it must be a bad portrait your mothers face disappoints me  i had arrived at the same conclusion years since but i shrank from confessing it  at any rate selina continued you are not like her nobody would ever guess that you were the child of that lady with the long slanting forehead and the restless look in her eyes  what selina had said of me and my mothers portrait other friends had said there was nothing that i know of to interest me in hearing it repeatedand yet it set me pondering on the want of resemblance between my mothers face and mine and wondering not for the first time what sort of woman my mother was when my father speaks of her no words of praise that he can utter seem to be good enough for her oh me i wish i was a little more like my mother  it began to get dark maria brought in the lamp the sudden brightness of the flame struck my aching eyes as if it had been a blow from a knife i was obliged to hide my face in my handkerchief compassionate selina entreated me to go to bed rest your poor eyes my child and your weary headand try at least to get some sleep she found me very docile i kissed her and said goodnight i had my own idea  when all was quiet in the house i stole out into the passage and listened at the door of my fathers room  i heard his regular breathing and opened the door and went in the composing medicine of which i was in search was not on the table by his bedside i found it in the cupboardperhaps placed purposely out of his reach they say that some physic is poison if you take too much of it the label on the bottle told me what the dose was i dropped it into the medicine glass and swallowed it and went back to my father  very gently so as not to wake him i touched poor papas forehead with my lips i must have some of your medicine i whispered to him i want it dear as badly as you do  then i returned to my own roomand lay down in bed waiting to be composed    chapter xxxi eunices diary  my restless nights are passed in selinas room  her bed remains near the window my bed has been placed opposite near the door our nightlight is hidden in a corner so that the faint glow of it is all that we see what trifles these are to write about but they mix themselves up with what i am determined to set down in my journal and then to close the book for good and all i had not disturbed my little friends enviable repose either when i left our bedchamber or when i returned to it the night was quiet and the stars were out nothing moved but the throbbing at my temples the lights and shadows in our halfdarkened room which at other times suggest strange resemblances to my fancy failed to disturb me now i was in a darkness of my own making having bound a handkerchief cooled with water over my hot eyes there was nothing to interfere with the soothing influence of the dose that i had taken if my fathers medicine would only help me  i began badly the clock in the hall struck the quarter past the hour the halfpast the threequarters past the new hour time was awakeand i was awake with time  it was such a trial to my patience that i thought of going back to my fathers room and taking a second dose of the medicine no matter what the risk might be on attempting to get up i became aware of a change in me there was a dull sensation in my limbs which seemed to bind them down on the bed it was the strangest feeling my will said get upand my heavy limbs said no  i lay quite still thinking desperate thoughts and getting nearer and nearer to the end that i had been dreading for so many days past having been as well educated as most girls my lessons in history had made me acquainted with assassination and murder horrors which i had recoiled from reading in past happy days now returned to my memory and this time they interested instead of revolting me i counted the three first ways of killing as i happened to remember them in my books of instructiona way by stabbing a way by poison a way in a bed by suffocation with a pillow on that dreadful night i never once called to mind what i find myself remembering nowthe harmless past time when our friends used to say eunice is a good girl we are all fond of eunice shall i ever be the same lovable creature again  while i lay thinking a strange thing happened philip who had haunted me for days and nights together vanished out of my thoughts my memory of the love which had begun so brightly and had ended so miserably became a blank nothing was left but my own horrid visions of vengeance and death  for a while the strokes of the clock still reached my ears but it was an effort to count them i ended in letting them pass unheeded soon afterward the round of my thoughts began to circle slowly and more slowly the strokes of the clock died out the round of my thoughts stopped  all this time my eyes were still covered by the handkerchief which i had laid over them  the darkness began to weigh on my spirits and to fill me with distrust i found myself suspecting that there was some changeperhaps an unearthly changepassing over the room to remain blindfolded any longer was more than i could endure i lifted my handwithout being conscious of the heavy sensation which some time before had laid my limbs helpless on the bedi lifted my hand and drew the handkerchief away from my eyes  the faint glow of the nightlight was extinguished  but the room was not quite dark there was a ghastly light trembling over it like nothing that i have ever seen by day like nothing that i have ever seen by night i dimly discerned selinas bed and the frame of the window and the curtains on either side of itbut not the starlight and not the shadowy tops of the trees in the garden  the light grew fainter and fainter the objects in the room faded slowly away darkness came  it may be a saying hard to believebut when i declare that i was not frightened i am telling the truth whether the room was lighted by awful light or sunk in awful dark i was equally interested in the expectation of what might happen next i listened calmly for what i might hear i waited calmly for what i might feel a touch came first i feel it creeping on my facelike a little fluttering breeze the sensation pleased me for a while soon it grew colder and colder and colder till it froze me  oh no more i cried out you are killing me with an icy death  the deadcold touches lingered a moment longerand left me  the first sound came  it was the sound of a whisper on my pillow close to my ear my strange insensibility to fear remained undisturbed the whisper was welcome it kept me company in the dark room  it said to me do you know who i am  i answered no  it said who have you been thinking of this evening  i answered my mother  the whisper said i am your mother  oh mother command the light to come back show yourself to me  no  why not  my face was hidden when i passed from life to death my face no mortal creature may see  oh mother touch me kiss me  no  why not  my touch is poison my kiss is death  the sense of fear began to come to me now i moved my head away on the pillow the whisper followed my movement  leave me i said you are an evil spirit  the whisper answered i am your mother  you come to tempt me  i come to harden your heart daughter of mine whose blood is cool daughter of mine who tamely submitsyou have loved is it true  it is true  the man you loved has deserted you is it true  it is true  a woman has lured him away to herself a woman has had no mercy on you or on him is it true  it is true  if she lives what crime toward you will she commit next  if she lives she will marry him  will you let her live  never  have i hardened your heart against her  yes  will you kill her  show me how  there was a sudden silence i was still left in the darkness feeling nothing hearing nothing even the consciousness that i was lying on my bed deserted me i had no idea that i was in the bedroom i had no knowledge of where i was  the ghastly light that i had seen already dawned on me once more i was no longer in my bed no longer in my room no longer in the house without wonder without even a feeling of surprise i looked round the place was familiar to me i was alone in the museum of our town  the light flowed along in front of me i followed from room to room in the museum where the light led  first through the picturegallery hung with the works of modern masters then through the room filled with specimens of stuffed animals the lion and the tiger the vulture of the alps and the great albatross looked like living creatures threatening me in the supernatural light i entered the third room devoted to the exhibition of ancient armor and the weapons of all nations here the light rose higher and leaving me in darkness where i stood showed a collection of swords daggers and knives arranged on the wall in imitation of the form of a star  the whisper sounded again close at my ear it echoed my own thought when i called to mind the ways of killing which history had taught me it said kill her with the knife  no my heart failed me when i thought of the blood i hid the dreadful weapons from my view i cried out let me go let me go  again i was lost in darkness again i had no knowledge in me of where i was again after an interval the light showed me the new place in which i stood  i was alone in the burialground of our parish church the light led me on among the graves to the lonely corner in which the great yew tree stands and rising higher revealed the solemn foliage brightened by the fatal red fruit which hides in itself the seeds of death  the whisper tempted me again it followed again the train of my own thought it said kill her by poison  no revenge by poison steals its way to its end the base deceitfulness of helenas crime against me seemed to call for a day of reckoning that hid itself under no disguise i raised my cry to be delivered from the sight of the deadly tree the changes which i have tried to describe followed once more the confession of what i felt the darkness was dispelled for the third time  i was standing in helenas room looking at her as she lay asleep in her bed  she was quite still now but she must have been restless at some earlier time the bedclothes were disordered her head had sunk so low that the pillow rose high and vacant above her there colored by a tender flush of sleep was the face whose beauty put my poor face to shame there was the sister who had committed the worst of murdersthe wretch who had killed in me all that made life worth having while that thought was in my mind i heard the whisper again kill her openly the tempter mother said kill her daringly faint heart do you still want courage rouse your spirit look see yourself in the act  the temptation took a form which now tried me for the first time  as if a mirror had reflected the scene i saw myself standing by the bedside with the pillow that was to smother the sleeper in my hands i heard the whispering voice telling me how to speak the words that warned and condemned her wake you who have taken him from me wake and meet your doom  i saw her start up in bed the sudden movement disordered the nightdress over her bosom and showed the miniature portrait of a man hung round her neck  the man was philip the likeness was looking at me  so dear so lovelythose eyes that had once been the light of my heart mourned for me and judged me now they saw the guilty thought that polluted me they brought me to my knees imploring him to help me back to my better self one last mercy dear to comfort me under the loss of you let the love that was once my life be my good angel still save me philip even though you forsake mesave me from myself    there was a sudden cry  the agony of it pierced my braindrove away the ghastly lightsilenced the tempting whispers i came to myself i sawand not in a dream  helena had started up in her bed that cry of terror at the sight of me in her room at night had burst from her lips the miniature of philip hung round her neck a visible reality though my head was dizzy though my heart was sinking i had not lost my senses yet all that the night lamp could show me i still saw and i heard the sound faintly when the door of the bedchamber was opened alarmed by that piercing cry my father came hurrying into the room  not a word passed between us three the whispers that i had heard were wicked the thoughts that had been in my mind were vile had they left some poison in the air of the room which killed the words on our lips  my father looked at helena with a trembling hand she pointed to me he put his arm round me and held me up i remember his leading me awayand i remember nothing more  my last words are written i lock up this journal of miserynever i hope and pray to open it again   second period continued  events in the family related by the governor     chapter xxxii the middleaged lady  in the year 1870 i found myself compelled to submit to the demands of two hard taskmasters  advancing age and failing health reminded the governor of the prison of his duty to his successor in one unanswerable wordresign  when they have employed us and interested us for the greater part of our lives we bid farewell to our dutieseven to the gloomy duties of a prisonwith a sense of regret my view of the future presented a vacant prospect indeed when i looked at my idle life to come and wondered what i should do with it loose on the worldat my agei drifted into domestic refuge under the care of my two dear and good sons after a while never mind how long a while i began to grow restless under the heavy burden of idleness having nothing else to complain of i complained of my health and consulted a doctor that sagacious man hit on the right way of getting rid of mehe recommended traveling  this was unexpected advice after some hesitation i accepted it reluctantly  the instincts of age recoil from making new acquaintances contemplating new places and adopting new habits besides i hate railway traveling however i contrived to get as far as italy and stopped to rest at florence here i found pictures by the old masters that i could really enjoy a public park that i could honestly admire and an excellent friend and colleague of former days once chaplain to the prison now clergyman in charge of the english church we met in the gallery of the pitti palace and he recognized me immediately i was pleased to find that the lapse of years had made so little difference in my personal appearance  the traveler who advances as far as florence and does not go on to rome must be regardless indeed of the opinions of his friends let me not attempt to conceal iti am that insensible traveler over and over again i said to myself rome must be done and over and over again i put off doing it to own the truth the fascinations of florence aided by the society of my friend laid so strong a hold on me that i believe i should have ended my days in the delightful italian city but for the dangerous illness of one of my sons this misfortune hurried me back to england in dread every step of the way of finding that i had arrived too late the journey thank god proved to have been taken without need my son was no longer in danger when i reached london in the year 1875  at that date i was near enough to the customary limit of human life to feel the necessity of rest and quiet in other words my days of travel had come to their end  having established myself in my own country i did not forget to let old friends know where they might find me among those to whom i wrote was another colleague of past years who still held his medical appointment in the prison when i received the doctors reply it inclosed a letter directed to me at my old quarters in the governors rooms who could possibly have sent a letter to an address which i had left five years since my correspondent proved to be no less a person than the congregational ministerthe friend whom i had estranged from me by the tone in which i had written to him on the longpast occasion of his wifes death  it was a distressing letter to read i beg permission to give only the substance of it in this place  entreating me with touching expressions of humility and sorrow to forgive his long silence the writer appealed to my friendly remembrance of him he was in sore need of counsel under serious difficulties and i was the only person to whom he could apply for help in the disordered state of his health at that time he ventured to hope that i would visit him at his present place of abode and would let him have the happiness of seeing me as speedily as possible he concluded with this extraordinary postscript  when you see my daughters say nothing to either of them which relates in any way to the subject of their ages you shall hear why when we meet  the reading of this letter naturally reminded me of the claims which my friends noble conduct had established on my admiration and respect at the past time when we met in the prison i could not hesitate to grant his requeststrangely as it was expressed and doubtful as the prospect appeared to be of my answering the expectations which he had founded on the renewal of our intercourse answering his letter by telegraph i promised to be with him on the next day  on arriving at the station i found that i was the only traveler by a firstclass carriage who left the train a young lady remarkable by her good looks and good dressing seemed to have noticed this trifling circumstance she approached me with a ready smile i believe i am speaking to my fathers friend she said my name is helena gracedieu  here was one of the ministers two daughters and that one of the twoas i discovered the moment i shook hands with herwho was my friends own child miss helena recalled to me her mothers face infinitely improved by youth and health and by a natural beauty which that cruel and deceitful woman could never have possessed the slanting forehead and the shifting flashing eyes that i recollected in the parent were reproduced slightly reproduced i ought to say in the child as for the other features i had never seen a more beautiful nose and mouth or a more delicatelyshaped outline than was presented by the lower part of the face but miss helena somehow failed to charm me i doubt if i should have fallen in love with her even in the days when i was a foolish young man  the first question that i put as we drove from the station to the house related naturally to her father  he is very ill she began i am afraid you must prepare yourself to see a sad change nerves the mischief first showed itself the doctor tells us in derangement of his nervous system he has been i regret to tell you obstinate in refusing to give up his preaching and pastoral work he ought to have tried rest at the seaside things have gone on from bad to worse last sunday at the beginning of his sermon he broke down very very sad is it not the doctor says that precious time has been lost and he must make up his mind to resign his charge he wont hear of it you are his old friend please try to persuade him  fluently spoken the words well chosen the melodious voice reminding me of the late mrs gracedieus advantages in that respect little sighs judiciously thrown in here and there just at the right places everything let me own that could present a dutiful daughter as a pattern of proprietyand nothing let me add that could produce an impression on my insensible temperament if i had not been too discreet to rush at a hasty conclusion i might have been inclined to say her mothers child every inch of her  the interest which i was still able to feel in my friends domestic affairs centered in the daughter whom he had adopted  in her infancy i had seen the child and liked her i was the one person living since the death of mrs gracedieu who knew how the minister had concealed the sad secret of her parentage and i wanted to discover if the hereditary taint had begun to show itself in the innocent offspring of the murderess just as i was considering how i might harmlessly speak of miss helenas sister miss helena herself introduced the subject  may i ask she resumed if you were disappointed when you found nobody but me to meet you at our station  here was an opportunity of paying her a compliment if i had been a younger man or if she had produced a favorable impression on me as it was i hitif i may praise myselfon an ingenious compromise  what excuse could i have i asked for feeling disappointed  well i hear you are an official personagei ought to say perhaps a retired official personage we might have received you more respectfully if both my fathers daughters had been present at the station its not my fault that my sister was not with me  the tone in which she said this strengthened my prejudice against her it told me that the two girls were living together on no very friendly terms and it suggestedjustly or unjustly i could not then decidethat miss helena was to blame  my sister is away from home  surely miss helena that is a good reason for her not coming to meet me  i beg your pardonit is a bad reason she has been sent away for the recovery of her healthand the loss of her health is entirely her own fault  what did this matter to me i decided on dropping the subject my memory reverted however to past occasions on which the loss of my health had been entirely my own fault there was something in these personal recollections which encouraged my perverse tendency to sympathize with a young lady to whom i had not yet been introduced the young ladys sister appeared to be discouraged by my silence she said i hope you dont think the worse of me for what i have just mentioned  certainly not  perhaps you will fail to see any need of my speaking of my sister at all will you kindly listen if i try to explain myself  with pleasure  she slyly set the best construction on my perfectly commonplace reply  thank you she said the fact is my father i cant imagine why wishes you to see my sister as well as me he has written to the farmhouse at which she is now staying to tell her to come home tomorrow it is possibleif your kindness offers me an opportunitythat i may ask to be guided by your experience in a little matter which interests me my sister is rash and reckless and has a terrible temper i should be very sorry indeed if you were induced to form an unfavorable opinion of me from anything you might notice if you see us together you understand me i hope  i quite understand you  to set me against her sister in her own private intereststhere as i felt sure was the motive under which she was acting as hard as her mother as selfish as her mother and judging from those two bad qualities probably as cruel as her mother that was how i understood miss helena gracedieu when our carriage drew up at her fathers house  a middleaged lady was on the doorstep when we arrived just ringing the bell she looked round at us both being evidently as complete a stranger to my fair companion as she was to me when the servant opened the door she said  is miss jillgall at home  at the sound of that odd name miss helena tossed her head disdainfully she took no sort of notice of the strangerlady who was at the door of her fathers house this young persons contempt for miss jillgall appeared to extend to miss jillgalls friends  in the meantime the servants answer was not at home  the middle aged lady said do you expect her back soon  yes maam  i will call again later in the day  what name if you please  the lady stole another look at me before she replied  never mind the name she saidand walked away    chapter xxxiii the ministers misfortune  do you know that lady miss helena asked as we entered the house  she is a perfect stranger to me i answered  are you sure you have not forgotten her  why do you think i have forgotten her  because she evidently remembered you  the lady had no doubt looked at me twice if this meant that my face was familiar to her i could only repeat what i have already said never to my knowledge had i seen her before  leading the way upstairs miss helena apologized for taking me into her fathers bedroom he is able to sit up in an armchair she said and he might do more as i think if he would exert himself he wont exert himself very sad would you like to look at your room before you see my father it is quite ready for you we hopeshe favored me with a fascinating smile devoted to winning my heart when her interests required itwe hope you will pay us a long visit we look on you as one of ourselves  i thanked her and said i would shake hands with my old friend before i went to my room we parted at the bedroom door  it is out of my power to describe the shock that overpowered me when i first saw the minister again after the long interval of time that had separated us nothing that his daughter said nothing that i myself anticipated had prepared me for that lamentable change for the moment i was not sufficiently master of myself to be able to speak to him he added to my embarrassment by the humility of his manner and the formal elaboration of his apologies  i feel painfully that i have taken a liberty with you he said after the long estrangement between usfor which my want of christian forbearance is to blame forgive it sir and forget it i hope to show that necessity justifies my presumption in subjecting you to a wearisome journey for my sake  beginning to recover myself i begged that he would make no more excuses my interruption seemed to confuse him  i wished to say he went on that you are the one man who can understand me there is my only reason for asking to see you and looking forward as i do to your advice you remember the nightor was it the daybefore that miserable woman was hanged you were the only person present when i agreed to adopt the poor little creature stained already one may say by its mothers infamy i think your wisdom foresaw what a terrible responsibility i was undertaking you tried to prevent it well well you have been in my confidenceyou only mind nobody in this house knows that one of the two girls is not really my daughter pray stop me if you find me wandering from the point my wish is to show that you are the only man i can open my heart to she he paused as if in search of a lost idea and left the sentence uncompleted yes he went on i was thinking of my adopted child did i ever tell you that i baptized her myself and by a good scripture name tooeunice ah sir that little helpless baby is a grownup girl now of an age to inspire love and to feel love i blush to acknowledge it i have behaved with a want of selfcontrol with a cowardly weaknessno i am indeed wandering this time i ought to have told you first that i have been brought face to face with the possibility of eunices marriage and to make it worse still i cant help liking the young man he comes of a good familyexcellent manners highly educated plenty of money a gentleman in every sense of the word and poor little eunice is so fond of him isnt it dreadful to be obliged to check her dearlyloved philip the young gentlemans name is philip do you like the name i say i am obliged to cheek her sweetheart in the rudest manner when all he wants to do is to ask me modestly for my sweet eunices hand oh what have i not suffered without a word of sympathy to comfort me before i had courage enough to write to you shall i make a dreadful confession if my religious convictions had not stood in my way i believe i should have committed suicide put yourself in my place try to see yourself shrinking from a necessary explanation when the happiness of a harmless girlso dutiful so affectionatedepended on a word of kindness from your lips and that word you are afraid to speak dont take offense sir i mean myself not you why dont you say something he burst out fiercely incapable of perceiving that he had allowed me no opportunity of speaking to him good god dont you understand me after all  the signs of mental confusion in his talk had so distressed me that i had not been composed enough to feel sure of what he really meant until he described himself as shrinking from a necessary explanation hearing those words my knowledge of the circumstances helped me i realized what his situation really was  compose yourself i said i understand you at last  he had suddenly become distrustful prove it he muttered with a furtive look at me i want to be satisfied that you understand my position  this is your position i told him you are placed between two deplorable alternatives if you tell this young gentleman that miss eunices mother was a criminal hanged for murder his familyeven if he himself doesnt recoil from itwill unquestionably forbid the marriage and your adopted daughters happiness will be the sacrifice  true he said frightfully true go on  if on the other hand you sanction the marriage and conceal the truth you commit a deliberate act of deceit and you leave the lives of the young couple at the mercy of a possible discovery which might part husband and wifecast a slur on their childrenand break up the household  he shuddered while he listened to me come to the end of it he cried  i had no more to say and i was obliged to answer him to that effect  no more to say he replied you have not told me yet what i most want to know  i did a rash thing i asked what it was that he most wanted to know  cant you see it for yourself he demanded indignantly suppose you were put between those two alternatives which you mentioned just now  well  what would you do sir in my place would you own the disgraceful truthbefore the marriageor run the risk and keep the horrid story to yourself  either way my reply might lead to serious consequences i hesitated  he threatened me with his poor feeble hand it was only the anger of a moment his humor changed to supplication he reminded me piteously of bygone days you used to be a kindhearted man has age hardened you have you no pity left for your old friend my poor heart is sadly in want of a word of wisdom spoken kindly  who could have resisted this i took his hand be at ease dear minister in your place i should run the risk and keep that horrid story to myself  he sank back gently in his chair oh the relief of it he said how can i thank you as i ought for quieting my mind  i seized the opportunity of quieting his mind to good purpose by suggesting a change of subject let us have done with serious talk for the present i proposed i have been an idle man for the last five years and i want to tell you about my travels  his attention began to wander he evidently felt no interest in my travels are you sure he asked anxiously that we have said all we ought to say no he cried answering his own question i believe i have forgotten somethingi am certain i have forgotten something perhaps i mentioned it in the letter i wrote to you have you got my letter  i showed it to him he read the letter and gave it back to me with a heavy sigh not there he said despairingly not there  is the lost remembrance connected with anybody in the house i asked trying to help him does it relate by any chance to one of the young ladies  you wonderful man nothing escapes you yes the thing i have forgotten concerns one of the girls stop let me get at it by myself surely it relates to helena he hesitated his face clouded over with an expression of anxious thought yes it relates to helena he repeated but how his eyes filled with tears i am ashamed of my weakness he said faintly you dont know how dreadful it is to forget things in this way  the injury that his mind had sustained now assumed an aspect that was serious indeed the subtle machinery which stimulates the memory by means of the association of ideas appeared to have lost its working power in the intellect of this unhappy man i made the first suggestion that occurred to me rather than add to his distress by remaining silent  if we talk of your daughter i said the merest accidenta word spoken at random by you or memay be all your memory wants to rouse it  he agreed eagerly to this yes yes let me begin helena met you i think at the station of course i remember that it only happened a few hours since well he went on with a change in his manner to parental pride which it was pleasant to see did you think my daughter a fine girl i hope helena didnt disappoint you  quite the contrary having made that necessary reply i saw my way to keeping his mind occupied by a harmless subject it must however be owned i went on that your daughter surprised me  in what way  when she mentioned her name who could have supposed that youan inveterate enemy to the roman catholic churchwould have christened your daughter by the name of a roman catholic saint  he listened to this with a smile had i happily blundered on some association which his mind was still able to pursue  you happen to be wrong this time he said pleasantly i never gave my girl the name of helena and what is more i never baptized her you ought to know that years and years ago i wrote to tell you that my poor wife had made me a proud and happy father and surely i said that the child was born while she was on a visit to her brothers rectory do you remember the name of the place i told you it was a remote little village calledsuppose we put your memory to a test can you remember the name he asked with a momentary appearance of triumph showing itself poor fellow in his face  after the time that had elapsed the name had slipped my memory when i confessed this he exulted over me with an unalloyed pleasure which it was cheering to see  your memory is failing you now he said the name is long lanes and what do you think my wife didthis is so characteristic of herwhen i presented myself at her bedside instead of speaking of our own baby she reminded me of the name that i had given to our adopted daughter when i baptized the child you chose the ugliest name that a girl can have she said i begged her to remember that eunice was a name in scripture she persisted in spite of me what firmness of character i detest the name of eunice she said and now that i have a girl of my own its my turn to choose the name i claim it as my right she was beginning to get excited i allowed her to have her own way of course only let me know i said what the name is to be when you have thought of it my dear sir she had the name ready without thinking about it my baby shall be called by the name that is sweetest in my ears the name of my dear lost mother we hadwhat shall i call ita slight difference of opinion when i heard that the name was to be helena i really could not reconcile it to my conscience to baptize a child of mine by the name of a popish saint my wifes brother set things right between us a worthy good man he died not very long agoi forget the date not to detain you any longer the rector of long lanes baptized our daughter that is how she comes by her unenglish name and so it happens that her birth is registered in a village which her father has never inhabited i hope sir you think a little better of my memory now  i was afraid to tell him what i really did think  he was not fifty years old yet and he had just exhibited one of the sad symptoms which mark the broken memory of old age lead him back to the events of many years ago and as he had just proved to me he could remember well and relate coherently but let him attempt to recall circumstances which had only taken place a short time since and forgetfulness and confusion presented the lamentable result just as i have related it  the effort that he had made the agitation that he had undergone in talking to me had confirmed my fears that he would overtask his wasted strength he lay back in his chair let us go on with our conversation he murmured we havent recovered what i had forgotten yet his eyes closed and opened again languidly there was something i wanted to recall he resumed and you were helping me his weak voice died away his weary eyes closed again after waiting until there could be no doubt that he was resting peacefully in sleep i left the room    chapter xxxiv the lively old maid  a perfect stranger to the interior of the house seeing that my experience began and ended with the ministers bedchamber i descended the stairs in the character of a guest in search of domestic information  on my way down i heard the door of a room on the ground floor opened and a woman s voice below speaking in a hurry my dear i have not a moment to spare my patients are waiting for me this was followed by a confidential communication judging by the tone mind not a word about me to that old gentleman her patients were waiting for herhad i discovered a female doctor and there was some old gentleman whom she was not willing to trustsurely i was not that muchinjured man  reaching the hall just as the lady said her last words i caught a glimpse of her face and discovered the middleaged stranger who had called on miss jillgall and had promised to repeat her visit a second lady was at the door with her back to me taking leave of her friend having said goodby she turned roundand we confronted each other  i found her to be a little person wiry and active past the prime of life and ugly enough to encourage prejudice in persons who take a superficial view of their fellowcreatures looking impartially at the little sunken eyes which rested on me with a comical expression of embarrassment i saw signs that said there is some good here under a disagreeable surface if you can only find it  she saluted me with a carefullyperformed curtsey and threw open the door of a room on the ground floor  pray walk in sir and permit me to introduce myself i am mr gracedieus cousinmiss jillgall proud indeed to make the acquaintance of a gentleman distinguished in the service of his countryor perhaps i ought to say in the service of the law the governor offers hospitality to prisoners and who introduces prisoners to board and lodging with the governorthe law beautiful weather for the time of year is it not may i askhave you seen your room  the embarrassment which i had already noticed had extended by this time to her voice and her manner she was evidently trying to talk herself into a state of confidence it seemed but too probable that i was indeed the person mentioned by her prudent friend at the door  having acknowledged that i had not seen my room yet my politeness attempted to add that there was no hurry the wiry little lady was of the contrary opinion she jumped out of her chair as if she had been shot out of it pray let me make myself useful the dream of my life is to make myself useful to others and to such a man as youi consider myself honored besides i do enjoy running up and down stairs this way dear sir this way to your room  she skipped up the stairs and stopped on the first landing do you know i am a timid person though i may not look like it sometimes curiosity gets the better of meand then i grow bold did you notice a lady who was taking leave of me just now at the house door  i replied that i had seen the lady for a moment but not for the first time just as i arrived here from the station i said i found her paying a visit when you were not at home  yesand do tell me one thing more my readiness in answering seemed to have inspired miss jillgall with confidence i heard no more confessions of overpowering curiosity am i right she proceeded in supposing that miss helena accompanied you on your way here from the station  quite right  did she say anything particular when she saw the lady asking for me at the door  miss helena thought i said that the lady recognized me as a person whom she had seen before  and what did you think yourself  i thought miss helena was wrong  very extraordinary with that remark miss jillgall dropped the subject the meaning of her reiterated inquiries was now as it seemed to me clear enough she was eager to discover how i could have inspired the distrust of me expressed in the caution addressed to her by her friend  when we reached the upper floor she paused before the ministers room  i believe many years have passed she said since you last saw mr gracedieu i am afraid you have found him a sadly changed man you wont be angry with me i hope for asking more questions i owe mr gracedieu a debt of gratitude which no devotion on my part can ever repay you dont know what a favor i shall consider it if you will tell me what you think of him did it seem to you that he was not quite himself i dont mean in his looks poor deari mean in his mind  there was true sorrow and sympathy in her face i believe i should hardly have thought her ugly if we had first met at that moment thus far she had only amused me i began really to like miss jillgall now  i must not conceal from you i replied that the state of mr gracedieus mind surprised and distressed me but i ought also to tell you that i saw him perhaps at his worst the subject on which he wished to speak with me would have agitated any man in his state of health he consulted me about his daughters marriage  miss jillgall suddenly turned pale  his daughters marriage she repeated oh you frighten me  why should i frighten you  she seemed to find some difficulty in expressing herself i hardly know how to put it sir you will excuse me wont you if i say what i feel you have influencenot the sort of influence that finds places for people who dont deserve them and gets mentioned in the newspapersi only mean influence over mr gracedieu thats what frightens me how do i know oh dear im asking another question allow me for once to be plain and positive im afraid sir you have encouraged the minister to consent to helenas marriage  pardon me i answered you mean eunices marriage  no sir helena  no madam eunice  what does he mean said miss jillgall to herself  i heard her this is what i mean i asserted in my most positive manner the only subject on which the minister has consulted me is miss eunices marriage  my tone left her no alternative but to believe me she looked not only bewildered but alarmed oh poor man has he lost himself in such a dreadful way as that she said to herself i darent believe it she turned to me you have been talking with him for some time please try to remember while mr gracedieu was speaking of euneece did he say nothing of helenas infamous conduct to her sister  not the slightest hint of any such thing i assured her had reached my ears  then she cried i can tell you what he has forgotten we kept as much of that miserable story to ourselves as we could in mercy to him besides he was always fondest of euneece she would live in his memory when he had forgotten the otherthe wretch the traitress the plotter the fiend miss jillgalls good manners slipped as it were from under her she clinched her fists as a final means of expressing her sentiments the wretched english language isnt half strong enough for me she declared with a look of fury  i took a liberty may i ask what miss helena has done i said  may you ask oh heavens you must ask you shall ask mr governor if your eyes are not opened to helenas true character i can tell you what she will do she will deceive you into taking her part do you think she went to the station out of regard for the great man pooh she went with an eye to her own interests and she means to make the great man useful thank god i can stop that  she checked herself there and looked suspiciously at the door of mr gracedieus room  in the interest of our conversation she whispered we have not given a thought to the place we have been talking in do you think the minister has heard us  not if he is asleepas i left him  miss jillgall shook her head ominously the safe way is this way she said come with me    chapter xxxv the future looks gloomy  my everhelpful guide led me to my roomwell out of mr gracedieus hearing if he happened to be awakeat the other end of the passage having opened the door she paused on the threshold the decrees of that merciless english despot propriety claimed her for their own oh dear she said to herself ought i to go in  my interest as a man and what is more an old man in the coming disclosure was too serious to be trifled with in this way i took her arm and led her into my room as if i was at a dinnerparty leading her to the table is it the good or the evil fortune of mortals that the comic side of life and the serious side of life are perpetually in collision with each other we burst out laughing at a moment of grave importance to us both perfectly inappropriate and perfectly natural but we were neither of us philosophers and we were ashamed of our own merriment the moment it had ceased  when you hear what i have to tell you miss jillgall began i hope you will think as i do what has slipped mr gracedieus memory it may be safer to sayfor he is sometimes irritable poor dearwhere he wont know anything about it  with that she told the lamentable story of the desertion of eunice  in silence i listened from first to last how could i trust myself to speak as i must have spoken in the presence of a woman the cruel injury inflicted on the poor girl who had interested and touched me in the first innocent year of her lifewho had grown to womanhood to be the victim of two wretches both trusted by her both bound to her by the sacred debt of loveso fired my temper that i longed to be within reach of the man with a horsewhip in my hand seeing in my face as i suppose what was passing in my mind miss jillgall expressed sympathy and admiration in her own quaint way ah i like to see you so angry its grand to know that a man who has governed prisoners has got such a pitying heart let me tell you one thing sir you will be more angry than ever when you see my sweet girl tomorrow and mind thisit is helenas devouring vanity helenas wicked jealousy of her sisters good fortune that has done the mischief dont be too hard on philip i do believe if the truth was told he is ashamed of himself  i felt inclined to be harder on philip than ever where is he i asked  miss jillgall started oh mr governor dont show the severe side of yourself after the pretty compliment i have just paid to you what a masterful voice and what eyes dear sir what terrifying eyes i feel as if i was one of your prisoners and had misbehaved myself  i repeated my question with improvement i hope in my looks and tones dont think me obstinate my dear lady i only want to know if he is in this town  miss jillgall seemed to take a curious pleasure in disappointing me she had not forgotten my unfortunate abruptness of look and manner you wont find him here she said  perhaps he has left england  if you must know sir he is in londonwith mr dunboyne  the name startled me  in a moment more it recalled to my memory a remarkable letter addressed to me many years ago which will be found in my introductory narrative the writeran irish gentleman named dunboyne confided to me that his marriage had associated him with the murderess who had then been recently executed as brotherinlaw to that infamous woman this circumstance he had naturally kept a secret from every one including his son then a boy i alone was made an exception to the general rule because i alone could tell him what had become of the poor little girl who in spite of the disgraceful end of her mother was still his niece if the child had not been provided for he felt it his duty to take charge of her education and to watch over her prospects in the future such had been his object in writing to me and such was the substance of his letter i had merely informed him in reply that his kind intentions had been anticipated and that the childs prosperous future was assured  miss jillgalls keen observation noticed the impression that had been produced upon me mr dunboynes name seems to surprise you she said  this is the first time i have heard you mention it i answered  she looked as if she could hardly believe me surely you must have heard the name she said when i told you about poor euneece  no  well then mr gracedieu must have mentioned it  no  this second reply in the negative irritated her  at any rate she said sharply you appeared to know mr dunboynes name just now  certainly  and yet she persisted the name seemed to come upon you as a surprise i dont understand it if i have mentioned philips name once i have mentioned it a dozen times  we were completely at crosspurposes she had taken something for granted which was an unfathomable mystery to me  well i objected if you did mention his name a dozen timesexcuse me for asking the questionwhat then  good heavens cried miss jillgall do you mean to say you never guessed that philip was mr dunboynes son  i was petrified  his son dunboynes son how could i have guessed it  at a later time only the good little creature who had so innocently deceived me remembered that the mischief might have been wrought by the force of habit while he had still a claim on their regard the family had always spoken of eunices unworthy lover by his christian name and what had been familiar in their mouths felt the influence of custom before time enough had elapsed to make them think as readily of the enemy as they had hitherto thought of the friend  but i was ignorant of this and the disclosure by which i found myself suddenly confronted was more than i could support for the moment speech was beyond me  his son dunboynes son  what a position that young man had occupied unsuspected by his father unknown to himself kept in ignorance of the family disgrace he had been a guest in the house of the man who had consoled his infamous aunt on the eve of her executionwho had saved his unhappy cousin from poverty from sorrow from shame and but one human being knew this and that human being was myself  observing my agitation miss jillgall placed her own construction on it  do you know anything bad of philip she asked eagerly if its something that will prevent helena from marrying him tell me what it is i beg and pray  i knew no more of philip whom she still called by his christian name than she had told me herself there was no help for it but to disappoint her at the same time i was unable to conceal that i was ill at ease and that it might be well to leave me by myself after a look round the bedchamber to see that nothing was wanting to my comfort she made her quaint curtsey and left me with her own inimitable form of farewell oh indeed i have been here too long and im afraid i have been guilty once or twice of vulgar familiarity you will excuse me i hope this has been an exciting interviewi think i am going to cry  she ran out of the room and carried away with her some of my kindliest feelings short as the time of our acquaintance had been what a wife and what a mother was lost thereand all for want of a pretty face  left alone my thoughts inevitably reverted to dunboyne the elder and to all that had happened in mr gracedieus family since the irish gentleman had written to me in bygone years  the terrible choice of responsibilities which had preyed on the ministers mind had been foreseen by mr dunboyne when he first thought of adopting his infant niece and had warned him to dread what might happen in the future if he brought her up as a member of the family with his own boy and if the two young people became at a later period attached to each other how had the wise foresight which offered such a contrast to the poor ministers impulsive act of mercy met with its reward fate or providence call it which we may had brought dunboynes son and the daughter of the murderess together had inspired those two strangers with love and had emboldened them to plight their troth by a marriage engagement was the mans betrayal of the trust placed in him by the faithful girl to be esteemed a fortunate circumstance by the two persons who knew the true story of her parentage the minister and myself could we rejoice in an act of infidelity which had embittered and darkened the gentle harmless life of the victim or could we on the other hand encourage the ruthless deceit the hateful treachery which had put the wicked helenawith no exposure to dread if she marriedinto her wronged sisters place impossible in the one case as in the other impossible  equally hopeless did the prospect appear when i tried to determine what my own individual course of action ought to be  in my calmer moments the idea had occurred to my mind of going to dunboyne the younger and if he had any sense of shame left exerting my influence to lead him back to his betrothed wife how could i now do this consistently with my duty to the young mans father knowing what i knew and not forgetting that i had myself advised mr gracedieu to keep the truth concealed when i was equally ignorant of philip dunboynes parentage and of helena gracedieus treachery  even if events so ordered it that the marriage of eunice might yet take placewithout any interference exerted to produce that result one way or the other on my partit would be just as impossible for me to speak out now as it had been in the longpast years when i had so cautiously answered mr dunboynes letter but what would he think of me if accident led sooner or later to the disclosure which i had felt bound to conceal the more i tried to forecast the chances of the future the darker and the darker was the view that faced me  to my sinking heart and wearied mind good dame nature presented a more acceptable prospect when i happened to look out of the window of my room there i saw the trees and flowerbeds of a garden tempting me irresistibly under the cloudless sunshine of a fine day i was on my way out to recover heart and hope when a knock at the door stopped me  had miss jillgall returned when i said come in mr gracedieu opened the door and entered the room  he was so weak that he staggered as he approached me leading him to a chair i noticed a wild look in his eyes and a flush on his haggard cheeks something had happened  when you were with me in my room he began did i not tell you that i had forgotten something  certainly you did  well i have found the lost remembrance my misfortunei ought to call it the punishment for my sins is recalled to me now the worst curse that can fall on a father is the curse that has come to me i have a wicked daughter my own child sir my own child  had he been awake while miss jillgall and i had been talking outside his door had he heard her ask me if mr gracedieu had said nothing of helenas infamous conduct to her sister while he was speaking of eunice the way to the lost remembrance had perhaps been found there in any case after that bitter allusion to his wicked daughter some result must follow helena gracedieu and a day of reckoning might be nearer to each other already than i had ventured to hope  i waited anxiously for what he might say to me next    chapter xxxvi the wandering mind  for the moment the minister disappointed me  without speaking without even looking up he took out his pocketbook and began to write in it constantly interrupted either by a trembling in the hand that held the pencil or by a difficulty as i imagined in expressing thoughts imperfectly realizedhis patience gave way he dashed the book on the floor  my mind is gone he burst out oh father in heaven let death deliver me from a body without a mind  who could hear him and be guilty of the cruelty of preaching selfcontrol i picked up the pocketbook and offered to help him  do you think you can he asked  i can at least try  good fellow what should i do without you see now here is my difficulty i have got so many things to say i want to separate themor else they will all run into each other look at the book my poor friend said mournfully they have run into each other in spite of me  the entries proved to be nearly incomprehensible here and there i discovered some scattered words which showed themselves more or less distinctly in the midst of the surrounding confusion the first word that i could make out was education helped by that hint i trusted to guesswork to guide me in speaking to him it was necessary to be positive or he would have lost all faith in me  well he said impatiently  well i answered you have something to say to me about the education which you have given to your daughters  dont put them together he cried dear patient sweet eunice must not be confounded with that shedevil  hush hush mr gracedieu badly as miss helena has behaved she is your own child  i repudiate her sir think for a moment of what she has doneand then think of the religious education that i have given her heartless deceitful the most ignorant creature in the lowest dens of this town could have done nothing more basely cruel and this after years on years of patient christian instruction on my part what is religion what is education i read a horrible book once i forget who was the author it called religion superstition and education empty form i dont know upon my word i dont know that the book may notoh my tongue why dont i keep a guard over my tongue are you a father too dont interrupt me put yourself in my place and think of it heartless deceitful and my daughter give me the pocketbook i want to see which memorandum comes first  he had now wrought himself into a state of excitement which relieved his spirits of the depression that had weighed on them up to this time his harmless vanity always as i suspect a latent quality in his kindly nature had already restored his confidence with a selfsufficient smile he consulted his own unintelligible entries and made his own wild discoveries  ah yes m stands for minister i come first am i to blame am igod forgive me my many sinsam i heartless am i deceitful  my good friend not even your enemies could say that  thank you who comes next he consulted the book again her mother her sainted mother comes next people say she is like her mother was my wife heartless was the angel of my life deceitful  that i thought to myself is exactly what your wife wasand exactly what reappears in your wifes child  where does her wickedness come from he went on not from her mother not from me not from a neglected education he suddenly stepped up to me and laid his hands on my shoulders his voice dropped to hoarse moaning awestruck tones shall i tell you what it is a possession of the devil  it was so evidently desirable to prevent any continuation of such a train of thought as this that i could feel no hesitation in interrupting him  will you hear what i have to say i asked bluntly  his humor changed again he made me a low bow and went back to his chair i will hear you with pleasure he answered politely you are the most eloquent man i know with one exceptionmyself of coursemyself  it is mere waste of time i continued to regret the excellent education which your daughter has misused making that reply i was tempted to add another word of truth all education is at the mercy of two powerful counterinfluences the influence of temperament and the influence of circumstances but this was philosophy how could i expect him to submit to philosophy what we know of miss helena i went on must be enough for us she has plotted and she means to succeed stop her  just my idea he declared firmly i refuse my consent to that abominable marriage  in the popular phrase i struck while the iron was hot you must do more than that sir i told him  his vanity suddenly took the alarmi was leading him rather too undisguisedly he handed his book back to me you will find he said loftily that i have put it all down there  i pretended to find it and read an imaginary entry to this effect after what she has already done helena is capable of marrying in defiance of my wishes and commands this must be considered and provided against so far i had succeeded in flattering him but when thinking of his paternal authority i alluded next to his daughters age his eyes rested on me with a look of downright terror  no more of that he said i wont talk of the girls ages even with you  what did he mean it was useless to ask i went on with the matter in handstill deliberately speaking to him as i might have spoken to a man with an intellect as clear as my own in my experience this practice generally stimulates a weak intelligence to do its best we all know how children receive talk that is lowered or books that are lowered to their presumed level i shall take it for granted i continued that miss helena is still under your lawful authority she can only arrive at her ends by means of a runaway marriage in that case much depends on the man you told me you couldnt help liking him this was of course before you knew of the infamous manner in which he has behaved you must have changed your opinion now  he seemed to be at a loss how to reply i am afraid he said the young man was drawn into it by helena  here was miss jillgalls apology for philip dunboyne repeated in other words despising and detesting the fellow as i did i was forced to admit to myself that he must be recommended by personal attractions which it would be necessary to reckon with i tried to get some more information from mr gracedieu  the excuse you have just made for him i resumed implies that he is a weak man easily persuaded easily led  the minister answered by nodding his head  such weakness as that i persisted is a vice in itself it has led already sir to the saddest results  he admitted this by another nod  i dont wish to shock you mr gracedieu but i must recommend employing the means that present themselves you must practice on this mans weakness for the sake of the good that may come of it i hear he is in london with his father try the strong influence and write to his father there is another reason besides for doing this it is quite possible that the truth has been concealed from mr dunboyne the elder take care that he is informed of what has really happened are you looking for pen ink and paper let me offer you the writing materials which i use in traveling  i placed them before him he took up the pen he arranged the paper he was eager to begin  after writing a few words he stoppedreflectedtried againstopped againtore up the little that he had doneand began a new letter ending in the same miserable result it was impossible to witness his helplessness to see how pitiably patient he was over his own incapacity and to let the melancholy spectacle go on i proposed to write the letter authenticating it of course by his signature when he allowed me to take the pen he turned away his face ashamed to let me see what he suffered was this the same man whose great nature had so nobly asserted itself in the condemned cell poor mortality  the letter was easily written  i had only to inform mr dunboyne of his sons conduct repeating in the plainest language that i could use what miss jillgall had related to me arrived at the conclusion i contrived to make mr gracedieu express himself in these strong terms i protest against the marriage in justice to you sir as well as to myself we can neither of us content to be accomplices in an act of domestic treason of the basest kind  in silence the minister read the letter and attached his signature to it in silence he rose and took my arm i asked if he wished to go to his room he only replied by a sign i offered to sit with him and try to cheer him gratefully he pressed my hand gently he put me back from the door crushed by the miserable discovery of the decay of his own faculties what could i do what could i say nothing   miss jillgall was in the drawingroom with the necessary explanations i showed her the letter she read it with breathless interest it terrifies one to think how much depends on old mr dunboyne she said you know him what sort of man is he  i could only assure her after what i remembered of his letter to me that he was a man whom we could depend upon  miss jillgall possessed treasures of information to which i could lay no claim mr dunboyne she told me was a scholar and a writer and a rich man his views on marriage were liberal in the extreme let his son find good principles good temper and good looks in a wife and he would promise to find the money  i get these particulars said miss jillgall from dear euneece they are surely encouraging that helena may carry out mr dunboynes views in her personal appearance is i regret to say what i cant deny but as to the other qualifications how hopeful is the prospect good principles and good temper ha ha helena has the principles of jezebel and the temper of lady macbeth  after dashing off this striking sketch of character the fair artist asked to look at my letter again and observed that the address was wanting i can set this right for you she resumed thanks as before to my sweet euneece and dont be in a hurry i can make myself useful in another way oh how i do enjoy making myself useful if you trust your letter to the basket in the hall helenas lovely eyescapable of the meanest conceivable actionsare sure to take a peep at the address in that case do you think your letter would get to london i am afraid you detect a faint infusion of spitefulness in that question oh for shame ill post the letter myself    chapter xxxvii the shameless sister  for some reason which my unassisted penetration was unable to discover miss helena gracedieu kept out of my way  at dinner on the day of my arrival and at breakfast on the next morning she was present of course ready to make herself agreeable in a modest way and provided with the necessary supply of cheerful smalltalk but the meal having come to an end she had her domestic excuse ready and unostentatiously disappeared like a wellbred young lady i never met her on the stairs never found myself intruding on her in the drawingroom never caught her getting out of my way in the garden as much at a loss for an explanation of these mysteries as i was miss jillgalls interest in my welfare led her to caution me in a vague and general way  take my word for it dear mr governor she has some design on you will you allow an insignificant old maid to offer a suggestion oh thank you i will venture to advise please look back at your experience of the very worst female prisoner you ever had to deal withand be guided accordingly if helena catches you at a private interview  in less than half an hour afterward helena caught me i was writing in my room when the maidservant came in with a message miss helenas compliments sir and would you please spare her half an hour downstairs  my first excuse was of course that i was engaged this was disposed of by a second message provided beforehand no doubt for an anticipated refusal miss helena wished me to say sir that her time is your time i was still obstinate i pleaded next that my day was filled up a third message had evidently been prepared even for this emergency miss helena will regret sir having the pleasure deferred but she will leave you to make your own appointment for tomorrow persistency so inveterate as this led to a result which mr gracedieus cautious daughter had not perhaps contemplated it put me on my guard there seemed to be a chance to say the least of it that i might serve eunices interests if i discovered what the enemy had to say i locked up my writingdeclared myself incapable of putting miss helena to needless inconvenienceand followed the maid to the lower floor of the house  the room to which i was conducted proved to be empty i looked round me  if i had been told that a man lived there who was absolutely indifferent to appearances i should have concluded that his views were faithfully represented by his place of abode the chairs and tables reminded me of a railway waitingroom the shabby little bookcase was the mute record of a life indifferent to literature the carpet was of that dreadful drab color still the cherished favorite of the average english mind in spite of every protest that can be entered against it on behalf of art the ceiling recently whitewashed made my eyes ache when they looked at it on either side of the window flaccid green curtains hung helplessly with nothing to loop them up the writingdesk and the papercase viewed as specimens of woodwork recalled the readymade bedrooms on show in cheap shops the books mostly in slatecolored bindings were devoted to the literature which is called religious i only discovered three worldly publications among themdomestic cookery etiquette for ladies and hints on the breeding of poultry an ugly little clock ticking noisily in a black case and two candlesticks of base metal placed on either side of it completed the ornaments on the chimneypiece neither pictures nor prints hid the barrenness of the walls i saw no needlework and no flowers the one object in the place which showed any pretensions to beauty was a lookingglass in an elegant gilt framesacred to vanity and worthy of the office that it filled such was helena gracedieus sittingroom i really could not help thinking how like her  she came in with a face perfectly adapted to the circumstancespleased and smiling amiably deferential in consideration of the claims of her fathers guestand to my surprise in some degree suggestive of one of those incorrigible female prisoners to whom miss jillgall had referred me when she offered a word of advice  how kind of you to come so soon excuse my receiving you in my housekeepingroom we shall not be interrupted here very plainly furnished is it not i dislike ostentation and display ornaments are out of place in a room devoted to domestic necessities i hate domestic necessities you notice the lookingglass its a present i should never have put such a thing up perhaps my vanity excuses it  she pointed the last remark by a look at herself in the glass using it while she despised it yes there was a handsome face paying her its reflected complimentbut not so well matched as it might have been by a handsome figure her feet were too large her shoulders were too high the graceful undulations of a wellmade girl were absent when she walked and her bosom was to my mind unduly developed for her time of life  she sat down by me with her back to the light happening to be opposite to the window i offered her the advantage of a clear view of my face she waited for me and i waited for herand there was an awkward pause before we spoke she set the example  isnt it curious she remarked when two people have something particular to say to each other and nothing to hinder them they never seem to know how to say it you are the oldest sir why dont you begin  because i have nothing particular to say  in plain words you mean that i must begin  if you please  very well i want to know whether i have given you and miss jillgall of course as much time as you want and as many opportunities as you could desire  pray go on miss helena  have i not said enough already  not enough i regret to say to convey your meaning to me  she drew her chair a little further away from me i am sadly disappointed she said i had such a high opinion of your perfect candor i thought to myself there is such a striking expression of frankness in his face another illusion gone i hope you wont think i am offended if i say a bold word i am only a young girl to be sure but i am not quite such a fool as you take me for do you really think i dont know that miss jillgall has been telling you everything that is bad about me putting every mistake that i have made every fault that i have committed in the worst possible point of view and you have listened to herquite naturally and you are prejudiced strongly prejudiced against mewhat else could you be under the circumstances i dont complain i have purposely kept out of your way and out of miss jillgalls way in short i have afforded you every facility as the prospectuses say i only want to know if my turn has come at last once more have i given you time enough and opportunities enough  a great deal more than enough  do you mean that you have made up your mind about me without stopping to think  that is exactly what i mean an act of treachery miss helena is an act of treachery no honest person need hesitate to condemn it i am sorry you sent for me  i got up to go with an ironical gesture of remonstrance she signed to me to sit down again  must i remind you dear sir of our famous native virtue fair play is surely due to a young person who has nobody to take her part you talked of treachery just how i deny the treachery please give me a hearing  i returned to my chair  or would you prefer waiting she went out till my sister comes here later in the day and continues what miss jillgall has begun with the great advantage of being young and nicelooking  when the female mind gets into this state no wise man answers the female questions  am i to take silence as meaning go on miss helena inquired  i begged her to interpret my silence in the sense most agreeable to herself  this naturally encouraged her she made a proposal  do you mind changing places sir  just as you like miss helena  we changed chairs the light now fell full on her face had she deliberately challenged me to look into her secret mind if i could anything like the stark insensibility of that young girl to every refinement of feeling to every becoming doubt of herself to every customary timidity of her age and sex in the presence of a man who had not disguised his unfavorable opinion of her i never met with in all my experience of the world and of women  i wish to be quite mistress of myself she explained your face for some reason which i really dont know irritates me the fact is i have great pride in keeping my temper please make allowances now about miss jillgall i suppose she told you how my sister first met with philip dunboyne  yes  she also mentioned perhaps that he was a highlycultivated man  she did  now we shall get on when philip came to our town here and saw me for the first timedo you object to my speaking familiarly of him by his christian name  in the case of any one else in your position miss helena i should venture to call it bad taste  i was provoked into saying that it failed entirely as a wellmeant effort in the way of implied reproof miss helena smiled  you grant me a liberty which you would not concede to another girl that was how she viewed it we are getting on better already to return to what i was saying when philip first saw mei have it from himself mindhe felt that i should have been his choice if he had met with me before he met with my sister do you blame him  if you will take my advice i said you will not inquire too closely into my opinion of mr philip dunboyne  perhaps you dont wish me to say anymore she suggested  on the contrary pray go on if you like  after that concession she was amiability itself oh yes she assured me thats easily done and she went on accordingly philip having informed me of the state of his affections i naturally followed his example in fact we exchanged confessions our marriage engagement followed as a matter of course do you blame me  i will wait till you have done  i have no more to say  she made that amazing reply with such perfect composure that i began to fear there must have been some misunderstanding between us is that really all you have to say for yourself i persisted  her patience with me was most exemplary she lowered herself to my level not trusting to words only on this occasion she so to say beat her meaning into my head by gesticulating on her fingers as if she was educating a child  philip and i she began are the victims of an accident which kept us apart when we ought to have met togetherwe are not responsible for an accident she impressed this on me by touching her forefinger philip and i fell in love with each other at first sightwe are not responsible for the feelings implanted in our natures by an allwise providence she assisted me in understanding this by touching her middle finger philip and i owe a duty to each other and accept a responsibility under those circumstancesthe responsibility of getting married a touch on her third finger and an indulgent bow announced that the lesson was ended i am not a clever man like you she modestly acknowledged but i ask you to help us when you next see my father with some confidence you know exactly what to say to him by this time nothing has been forgotten  pardon me i said a person has been forgotten  indeed what person  your sister  a little perplexed at first miss helena reflected and recovered herself  ah yes she said i was afraid i might be obliged to trouble you for an explanationi see it now you are shocked very properly when feelings of enmity exist between near relations and you wish to be assured that i bear no malice toward eunice she is violent she is sulky she is stupid she is selfish and she cruelly refuses to live in the same house with me make your mind easy sir i forgive my sister  let me not attempt to disguise itmiss helena gracedieu confounded me  ordinary audacity is one of those forms of insolence which mature experience dismisses with contempt this girls audacity struck down all resistance for one shocking reason it was unquestionably sincere strong conviction of her own virtue stared at me in her proud and daring eyes at that time i was not aware of what i have learned since the horrid hardening of her moral sense had been accomplished by herself in her diary there has been found the confession of a secret course of readingwith supplementary reflections flowing from it which need only to be described as worthy of their source  a person capable of repentance and reform would in her place have seen that she had disgusted me not a suspicion of this occurred to miss helena i see you are embarrassed she remarked and i am at no loss to account for it you are too polite to acknowledge that i have not made a friend of you yet oh i mean to do it  no i said i think not  we shall see she replied sooner or later you will find yourself saying a kind word to my father for philip and me she rose and took a turn in the roomand stopped eying me attentively are you thinking of eunice she asked  yes  she has your sympathy i suppose  my heartfelt sympathy  i neednt ask how i stand in your estimation after that pray express yourself freely your looks confess ityou view me with a feeling of aversion  i view you with a feeling of horror  the exasperating influences of her language her looks and her tones would as i venture to think have got to the end of another mans selfcontrol before this anyway she had at last irritated me into speaking as strongly as i felt what i said had been so plainly perhaps so rudely expressed that misinterpretation of it seemed to be impossible she mistook me nevertheless the most merciless disclosure of the dreary side of human destiny is surely to be found in the failure of words spoken or written so to answer their purpose that we can trust them in our attempts to communicate with each other even when he seems to be connected by the nearest and dearest relations with his fellowmortals what a solitary creature tried by the test of sympathy the human being really is in the teeming world that he inhabits affording one more example of the impotence of human language to speak for itself my misinterpreted words had found their way to the one sensitive place in helena gracedieus impenetrable nature she betrayed it in the quivering and flushing of her hard face and in the appeal to the lookingglass which escaped her eyes the next moment my hasty reply had roused the idea of a covert insult addressed to her handsome face in other words i had wounded her vanity driven by resentment out came the secret distrust of me which had been lurking in that cold heart from the moment when we first met  i inspire you with horror and eunice inspires you with compassion she said that mr governor is not natural  may i ask why  you know why  no  you will have it  i want an explanation miss helena if that is what you mean  take your explanation then you are not the stranger you are said to be to my sister and to me your interest in eunice is a personal interest of some kind i dont pretend to guess what it is as for myself it is plain that somebody else has been setting you against me before miss jillgall got possession of your private ear  in alluding to eunice she had blundered strangely enough on something like the truth but when she spoke of herself the headlong malignity of her suspicionsmaking every allowance for the anger that had hurried her into themseemed to call for some little protest against a false assertion i told her that she was completely mistaken  i am completely right she answered i saw it  saw what  saw you pretending to be a stranger to me  when did i do that  you did it when we met at the station  the reply was too ridiculous for the preservation of any control over my own sense of humor it was wrong but it was inevitablei laughed she looked at me with a fury revealing a concentration of evil passion in her which i had not seen yet i asked her pardon i begged her to think a little before she persisted in taking a view of my conduct unworthy of her and unjust to myself  unjust to you she burst out who are you a man who has driven your trade has spies always at his commandyes and knows how to use them you were primed with private informationyou had for all i know a stolen photograph of me in your pocketbefore ever you came to our town do you still deny it oh sir why degrade yourself by telling a lie  no such outrage as this had ever been inflicted on me at any time in my life my forbearance must i suppose have been more severely tried than i was aware of myself with or without excuse for me i was weak enough to let a girls spiteful tongue sting me and worse still to let her see that i felt it  you shall have no second opportunity miss gracedieu of insulting me with that foolish reply i opened the door violently and went out  she ran after me triumphing in having roused the temper of a man old enough to have been her grandfather and caught me by the arm your own conduct has exposed you that was literally how she expressed herself i saw it in your eyes when we met at the station you the strangeryou who allowed poor ignorant me to introduce myselfyou knew me all the time knew me by sight  i shook her hand off with an inconsiderable roughness humiliating to remember its false i cried i knew you by your likeness to your mother  the moment the words had passed my lips i came to my senses again i remembered what fatal words they might prove to be if they reached the ministers ears  heard only by his daughter my reply seemed to cool the heat of her anger in an instant  so you knew my mother she said my father never told us that when he spoke of your being such a very old friend of his strange to say the least of it  i was wise enoughnow when wisdom had come too latenot to attempt to explain myself and not to give her an opportunity of saying more we are neither of us in a state of mind i answered to allow this interview to continue i must try to recover my composure and i leave you to do the same  in the solitude of my room i was able to look my position fairly in the face  mr gracedieus wife had come to me in the longpast time without her husbands knowledge tempted to a cruel resolve by the maternal triumph of having an infant of her own she had resolved to rid herself of the poor little rival in her husbands fatherly affection by consigning the adopted child to the keeping of a charitable asylum she had dared to ask me to help her i had kept the secret of her shameful visiti can honestly say for the ministers sake and now long after time had doomed those events to oblivion they were revivedand revived by me thanks to my folly mr gracedieus daughter knew what i had concealed from mr gracedieu himself  what course did respect for my friend and respect for myself counsel me to take  i could only see before me a choice of two evils to wait for eventswith the too certain prospect of a vindictive betrayal of my indiscretion by helena gracedieu or to take the initiative into my own hands and risk consequences which i might regret to the end of my life by making my confession to the minister  before i had decided somebody knocked at the door it was the maidservant again was it possible she had been sent by helena  another message  yes sir my master wishes to see you    chapter xxxviii the girls ages  had the ministers desire to see me been inspired by his daughters betrayal of what i had unfortunately said to her although he would certainly not consent to receive her personally she would be at liberty to adopt a written method of communication with him and the letter might be addressed in such a manner as to pique his curiosity if helenas vindictive purpose had been already accomplishedand if mr gracedieu left me no alternative but to present his unworthy wife in her true characteri can honestly say that i dreaded the consequences not as they might affect myself but as they might affect my unhappy friend in his enfeebled state of body and mind  when i entered his room he was still in bed  the bedcurtains were so drawn on the side nearest to the window as to keep the light from falling too brightly on his weak eyes in the shadow thus thrown on him it was not possible to see his face plainly enough from the open side of the bed to arrive at any definite conclusion as to what might be passing in his mind after having been awake for some hours during the earlier part of the night he had enjoyed a long and undisturbed sleep i feel stronger this morning he said and i wish to speak to you while my mind is clear  if the quiet tone of his voice was not an assumed tone he was surely ignorant of all that had passed between his daughter and myself  eunice will be here soon he proceeded and i ought to explain why i have sent for her to come and meet you i have reasons serious reasons mind for wishing you to compare her personal appearance with helenas personal appearance and then to tell me which of the two on a fair comparison looks the eldest pray bear in mind that i attach the greatest importance to the conclusion at which you may arrive  he spoke more clearly and collectedly than i had heard him speak yet  here and there i detected hesitations and repetitions which i have purposely passed over the substance of what he said to me is all that i shall present in this place careful as i have been to keep my record of events within strict limits i have written at a length which i was far indeed from contemplating when i accepted mr gracedieus invitation  having promised to comply with the strange request which he had addressed to me i ventured to remind him of past occasions on which he had pointedly abstained when the subject presented itself from speaking of the girls ages you have left it to my discretion i added to decide a question in which you are seriously interested relating to your daughters have i no excuse for regretting that i have not been admitted to your confidence a little more freely  you have every excuse he answered but you trouble me all the same there was something else that i had to say to youand your curiosity gets in the way  he said this with a sullen emphasis in my position the worst of evils was suspense i told him that my curiosity could wait and i begged that he would relieve his mind of what was pressing on it at the moment  let me think a little he said  i waited anxiously for the decision at which he might arrive nothing came of it to justify my misgivings leave what i have in my mind to ripen in my mind he said the mystery about the girls ages seems to irritate you if i put my good friends temper to any further trial he will be of no use to me never mind if my head swims im used to that now listen  strange as the preface was the explanation that followed was stranger yet i offer a shortened and simplified version giving accurately the substance of what i heard  the minister entered without reserve on the mysterious subject of the ages eunice he informed me was nearly two years older than helena if she outwardly showed her superiority of age any person acquainted with the circumstances under which the adopted infant had been received into mr gracedieus childless household need only compare the socalled sisters in afterlife and would thereupon identify the eldestlooking young lady of the two as the offspring of the woman who had been hanged for murder with such a misfortune as this presenting itself as a possible prospect the minister was bound to prevent the girls from ignorantly betraying each other by allusions to their ages and their birthdays after much thought he had devised a desperate means of meeting the difficultyalready made known as i am told for the information of strangers who may read the pages that have gone before mine my friends plan of proceeding had by the nature of it exposed him to injurious comment to embarrassing questions and to doubts and misconceptions all patiently endured in consideration of the security that had been attained proud of his explanation mr gracedieus vanity called upon me to acknowledge that my curiosity had been satisfied and my doubts completely set at rest  no my obstinate common sense was not reduced to submission even yet looking back over a lapse of seventeen years i asked what had happened in that long interval to justify the anxieties which still appeared to trouble my friend  this time my harmless curiosity could be gratified by a reply expressed in three wordsnothing had happened  then what in heavens name was the minister afraid of  his voice dropped to a whisper he said i am afraid of the women  who were the women  two of them actually proved to be the servants employed in mr gracedieus house at the bygone time when he had brought the child home with him from the prison to point out the absurdity of the reasons that he gave for fearing what female curiosity might yet attempt if circumstances happened to encourage it would have been a mere waste of words dismissing the subject i next ascertained that the ministers doubts extended even to the two female warders who had been appointed to watch the murderess in turn during her last days in prison i easily relieved his mind in this case one of the warders was dead the other had married a farmer in australia had we exhausted the list of suspected persons yet no there was one more left and the minister declared that he had first met with her in my official residence at the time when i was governor of the prison  she presented herself to me by name he said and she spoke rudely a miss he paused to consult his memory and this time thanks perhaps to his nights rest his memory answered the appeal i have got it he criedmiss chance  my friend had interested me in his imaginary perils at last it was just possible that he might have a formidable person to deal with now  during my residence at florence the chaplain and i had taken many a retrospective look as old men will at past events in our lives my former colleague spoke of the time when he had performed clerical duty for his friend the rector of a parish church in london neither he nor i had heard again of the miss chance of our disagreeable prison experience whom he had married to the dashing dutch gentleman mr tenbruggen we could only wonder what had become of that mysterious married pair  mr gracedieu being undoubtedly ignorant of the womans marriage it was not easy to say what the consequence might be in his excitable state if i informed him of it he would in all probability conclude that i knew more of the woman than he did i decided on keeping my own counsel for the present at least  passing at once therefore to the one consideration of any importance i endeavored to find out whether mr gracedieu and mrs tenbruggen had met or had communicated with each other in any way during the long period of separation that had taken place between the minister and myself if he had been so unlucky as to offend her she was beyond all doubt an enemy to be dreaded apart however from a misfortune of this kind she would rank in my opinion with the other harmless objects of mr gracedieus distrust  in making my inquiries i found that i had an obstacle to contend with  while he felt the renovating influence of the repose that he enjoyed the minister had been able to think and to express himself with less difficulty than usual but the reserves of strength on which the useful exercise of his memory depended began to fail him as the interview proceeded he distinctly recollected that something unpleasant had passed between that audacious woman and himself but at what dateand whether by word of mouth or by correspondencewas more than his memory could now recall he believed he was not mistaken in telling me that he had been in two minds about her at one time he was satisfied that he had taken wise measures for his own security if she attempted to annoy him but there was another and a later time when doubts and fears had laid hold of him again if i wanted to know how this had happened he fancied it was through a dream and if i asked what the dream was he could only beg and pray that i would spare his poor head  unwilling even yet to submit unconditionally to defeat it occurred to me to try a last experiment on my friend without calling for any mental effort on his own part the miss chance of former days might by a bare possibility have written to him i asked accordingly if he was in the habit of keeping his letters and if he would allow me when he had rested a little to lay them open before him so that he could look at the signatures you might find the lost recollection in that way i suggested at the bottom of one of your letters  he was in that state of weariness poor fellow in which a man will do anything for the sake of peace pointing to a cabinet in his room he gave me a key taken from a little basket on his bed look for yourself he said after some hesitationfor i naturally recoiled from examining another mans correspondencei decided on opening the cabinet at any rate  the lettersa large collectionwere to my relief all neatly folded and indorsed with the names of the writers i could run harmlessly through bundle after bundle in search of the one name that i wanted and still respect the privacy of the letters my perseverance deserved a rewardand failed to get it the name i wanted steadily eluded my search arriving at the upper shelf of the cabinet i found it so high that i could barely reach it with my hand instead of getting more letters to look over i pulled down two newspapers  one of them was an old copy of the times dating back as far as the 13th december 1858 it was carefully folded longwise with the titlepage uppermost on the first column at the lefthand side of the sheet appeared the customary announcements of births a mark with a blue pencil against one of the advertisements attracted my attention i read these lines  on the 10th inst the wife of the rev abel gracedieu of a daughter  the second newspaper bore a later date and contained nothing that interested me i naturally assumed that the advertisement in the times had been inserted at the desire of mrs gracedieu and after all that i had heard there was little difficulty in attributing the curious omission of the place in which the child had been born to the caution of her husband if mrs tenbruggen then miss chance had happened to see the advertisement in the great london newspaper mr gracedieu might yet have good reason to congratulate himself on his prudent method of providing against mischievous curiosity  i turned toward the bed and looked at him his eyes were closed was he sleeping or was he trying to remember what he had desired to say to me when the demands which i made on his memory had obliged him to wait for a later opportunity  either way there was something that quickened my sympathies in the spectacle of his helpless repose it suggested to me personal reasons for his anxieties which he had not mentioned and which i had not thought of up to this time if the discovery that he dreaded took place his household would be broken up and his position as pastor would suffer in the estimation of the flock his own daughter would refuse to live under the same roof with the daughter of an infamous woman popular opinion among his congregation judging a man who had passed off the child of other parents as his own would find that man guilty of an act of deliberate deceit  still oppressed by reflections which pointed to the future in this discouraging way i was startled by a voice outside the doora sweet sad voicesaying may i come in  the ministers eyes opened instantly he raised himself in his bed  eunice at last he cried let her in    chapter xxxix the adopted child  i opened the door  eunice passed me with the suddenness almost of a flash of light when i turned toward the bed her arms were round her fathers neck oh poor papa how ill you look commonplace expressions of fondness and no more but the tone gave them a charm that subdued me never had i felt so indulgent toward mr gracedieus unreasonable fears as when i saw him in the embrace of his adopted daughter she had already reminded me of the bygone day when a bright little child had sat on my knee and listened to the ticking of my watch  the minister gently lifted her head from his breast my darling he said you dont see my old friend love him and look up to him eunice he will be your friend too when i am gone  she came to me and offered her cheek to be kissed it was sadly pale poor souland i could guess why but her heart was now full of her father do you think he is seriously ill she whispered what i ought to have said i dont know her eyes the sweetest truest loveliest eyes i ever saw in a human face were pleading with me let my enemies make the worst of it if they likei did certainly lie and if i deserved my punishment i got it the poor child believed me now i am happier she said gratefully only to hear your voice seems to encourage me on our way here selina did nothing but talk of you she told me i shouldnt have time to feel afraid of the great man he would make me fond of him directly i said are you fond of him she said madly in love with him my dear my little friend really thinks you like her and is very proud of it there are some people who call her ugly i hope you dont agree with them  i believe i should have lied again if mr gracedieu had not called me to the bedside  how does she strike you he whispered eagerly is it too soon to ask if she shows her age in her face  neither in her face nor her figure i answered it astonishes me that you can ever have doubted it no stranger judging by personal appearance could fail to make the mistake of thinking helena the oldest of the two  he looked fondly at eunice her figure seems to bear out what you say he went on almost childish isnt it  i could not agree to that slim supple simply graceful in every movement eunices figure in the charm of first youth only waited its perfect development most men looking at her as she stood at the other end of the room with her back toward us would have guessed her age to be sixteen  finding that i failed to agree with him mr gracedieus misgivings returned you speak very confidently he said considering that you have not seen the girls together think what a dreadful blow it would be to me if you made a mistake  i declared with perfect sincerity that there was no fear of a mistake the bare idea of making the proposed comparison was hateful to me if helena and i had happened to meet at that moment i should have turned away from her by instinctshe would have disturbed my impressions of eunice  the minister signed to me to move a little nearer to him i must say it he whispered and i am afraid of her hearing me is there anything in her face that reminds you of her miserable mother  i had hardly patience to answer the question it was simply preposterous her hair was by many shades darker than her mothers hair her eyes were of a different color there was an exquisite tenderness and sincerity in their expressionmade additionally beautiful to my mind by a gentle uncomplaining sadness it was impossible even to think of the eyes of the murderess when i looked at her child eunices lower features again had none of her mothers regularity of proportion her smile simple and sweet and soon passing away was certainly not an inherited smile on the maternal side whether she resembled her father i was unable to conjecturehaving never seen him the one thing certain was that not the faintest trace in feature or expression of eunices mother was to be seen in eunice herself of the two girls helenajudging by something in the color of her hair and by something in the shade of her complexionmight possibly have suggested in those particulars only a purely accidental resemblance to my terrible prisoner of past times  the revival of mr gracedieus spirits indicated a temporary change only and was already beginning to pass away the eyes which had looked lovingly at eunice began to look languidly now his head sank on the pillow with a sigh of weak content my pleasure has been almost too much for me he said leave me for a while to rest and get used to it  eunice kissed his foreheadand we left the room    chapter xl the bruised heart  when we stepped out on the landing i observed that my companion paused she looked at the two flights of stairs below us before she descended them it occurred to me that there must be somebody in the house whom she was anxious to avoid  arrived at the lower hall she paused again and proposed in a whisper that we should go into the garden as we advanced along the backward division of the hall i saw her eyes turn distrustfully toward the door of the room in which helena had received me at last my slow perceptions felt with her and understood her eunices sensitive nature recoiled from a chance meeting with the wretch who had laid waste all that had once been happy and hopeful in that harmless young life  will you come with me to the part of the garden that i am fondest of she asked  i offered her my arm she led me in silence to a rustic seat placed under the shade of a mulberry tree i saw a change in her face as we sat downa tender and beautiful change at that moment the girls heart was far away from me there was some association with this corner of the garden on which i felt that i must not intrude  i was once very happy here she said when the time of the heartache came soon after i was afraid to look at the old tree and the bench under it but that is all over now i like to remember the hours that were once dear to me and to see the place that recalls them do you know who i am thinking of dont be afraid of distressing me i never cry now  my dear child i have heard your sad storybut i cant trust myself to speak of it  because you are so sorry for me  no words can say how sorry i am  but you are not angry with philip  not angry my poor dear i am afraid to tell you how angry i am with him  oh no you mustnt say that if you wish to be kind to meand i am sure you do wish itdont think bitterly of philip  when i remember that the first feeling she roused in me was nothing worthier of a professing christian than astonishment i drop in my own estimation to the level of a savage do you really mean i was base enough to ask that you have forgiven him  she said gently how could i help forgiving him  the man who could have been blessed with such love as this and who could have cast it away from him can have been nothing but an idiot on that groundthough i dared not confess it to eunicei forgave him too  do i surprise you she asked simply perhaps love will bear any humiliation or perhaps i am only a poor weak creature you dont know what a comfort it was to me to keep the few letters that i received from philip when i heard that he had gone away i gave his letters the kiss that bade him goodby that was the time i think when my poor bruised heart got used to the pain i began to feel that there was one consolation still left for mei might end in forgiving him why do i tell you all this i think you must have bewitched me is this really the first time i have seen you  she put her little trembling hand into mine i lifted it to my lips and kissed it sorely was i tempted to own that i had pitied and loved her in her infancy it was almost on my lips to say i remember you an easilypleased little creature amusing yourself with the broken toys which were once the playthings of my own children i believe i should have said it if i could have trusted myself to speak composedly to her this was not to be done old as i was versed as i was in the hard knowledge of how to keep the mask on in the hour of need this was not to be done  still trying to understand that i was little better than a stranger to her and still bent on finding the secret of the sympathy that united us eunice put a strange question to me  when you were young yourself she said did you know what it was to love and to be lovedand then to lose it all  it is not given to many men to marry the woman who has been the object of their first love my early life had been darkened by a sad story never confided to any living creature banished resolutely from my own thoughts for forty years past that part of my buried self had lain quiet in its graveand the chance touch of an innocent hand had raised the dead and set us face to face again did i know what it was to love and to be loved and then to lose it all too well my child too well  that was all i could say to her in the last days of my life i shrank from speaking of it when i had first felt that calamity and had felt it most keenly i might have given an answer worthier of me and worthier of her  she dropped my hand and sat by me in silence thinking had iwithout meaning it god knowshad i disappointed her  did you expect me to tell my own sad story i said as frankly and as trustfully as you have told yours  oh dont think that i know what an effort it was to you to answer me at all yes indeed i wonder whether i may ask something the sorrow you have just told me of is not the only oneis it you have had other troubles  many of them  there are times she went on when one cant help thinking of ones own miserable self i try to be cheerful but those times come now and then  she stopped and looked at me with a pale fear confessing itself in her face  you know who selina is she resumed my friend the only friend i had till you came here  i guessed that she was speaking of the quaint kindly little woman whose ugly surname had been hitherto the only name known to me  selina has i daresay told you that i have been ill she continued and that i am staying in the country for the benefit of my health  it was plain that she had something to say to me far more important than this and that she was dwelling on trifles to gain time and courage hoping to help her i dwelt on trifles too asking commonplace questions about the part of the country in which she was staying she answered absentlythen little by little impatiently the one poor proof of kindness that i could offer now was to say no more  do you know what a strange creature i am she broke out shall i make you angry with me or shall i make you laugh at me what i have shrunk from confessing to selinawhat i dare not confess to my fatheri must and will confess to you  there was a look of horror in her face that alarmed me i drew her to me so that she could rest her head on my shoulder my own agitation threatened to get the better of me for the first time since i had seen this sweet girl i found myself thinking of the blood that ran in her veins and of the nature of the mother who had borne her  did you notice how i behaved upstairs she said i mean when we left my father and came out on the landing  it was easily recollected i begged her to go on  before i went downstairs she proceeded you saw me look and listen did you think i was afraid of meeting some person and did you guess who it was i wanted to avoid  i guessed thatand i understood you  no you are not wicked enough to understand me will you do me a favor i want you to look at me  it was said seriously she lifted her head for a moment so that i could examine her face  do you see anything she asked which makes you fear that i am not in my right mind  good god how can you ask such a horrible question  she laid her head back on my shoulder with a sad little sigh of resignation i ought to have known better she said there is no such easy way out of it as that tell meis there one kind of wickedness more deceitful than another can it be hid in a person for years together and show itself when a time of sufferingno i mean when a sense of injury comes did you ever see that when you were master in the prison  i had seen itand after a moments doubt i said i had seen it  did you pity those poor wretches  certainly they deserved pity  i am one of them she said pity me if helena looks at meif helena speaks to meif i only see helena by accidentdo you know what she does she tempts me tempts me to do dreadful things tempts me the poor child threw her arms round my neck and whispered the next fatal words in my ear  the mother prepared as i was for the accursed discovery the horror of it shook me  she left me and started to her feet the inherited energy showed itself in furious protest against the inherited evil what does it mean she cried ill submit to anything ill bear my hard lot patiently if you will only tell me what it means where does this horrid transformation of me out of myself come from look at my good father in all this world there is no man so perfect as he is and oh how he has taught me there isnt a single good thing that i have not learned from him since i was a little child did you ever hear him speak of my mother you must have heard him my mother was an angel i could never be worthy of her at my bestbut i have tried i have tried the wickedest girl in the world doesnt have worse thoughts than the thoughts that have come to me since when since helenaoh how can i call her by her name as if i still loved her since my sistercan she be my sister i ask myself sometimes since my enemytheres the word for hersince my enemy took philip away from me what does it mean i have asked in my prayersand have got no answer i ask you what does it mean you must tell me you shall tell me what does it mean  why did i not try to calm her i had vainly tried to calm heri who knew who her mother was and what her mother had been  at last she had forced the sense of my duty on me the simplest way of calming her was to put her back in the place by my side that she had left it was useless to reason with her it was impossible to answer her i had my own idea of the one way in which i might charm eunice back to her sweeter self  let us talk of philip i said  the fierce flush on her face softened the swelling trouble of her bosom began to subside as that dearlyloved name passed my lips but there was some influence left in her which resisted me  no she said we had better not talk of him  why not  i have lost all my courage if you speak of philip you will make me cry  i drew her nearer to me if she had been my own child i dont think i could have felt for her more truly than i felt at that moment i only looked at her i only said  cry  the love that was in her heart rose and poured its tenderness into her eyes i had longed to see the tears that would comfort her the tears came  there was silence between us for a while it was possible for me to think  in the absence of physical resemblance between parent and child is an unfavorable influence exercised on the tendency to moral resemblance assuming the possibility of such a result as this eunice entirely unlike her mother must as i concluded have been possessed of qualities formed to resist as well as of qualities doomed to undergo the infection of evil while therefore i resigned myself to recognize the existence of the hereditary maternal taint i firmly believed in the counterbalancing influences for good which had been part of the girls birthright they had been derived perhaps from the better qualities in her fathers nature they had been certainly developed by the tender care the religious vigilance which had guarded the adopted child so lovingly in the ministers household and they had served their purpose until time brought with it the change for which the tranquil domestic influences were not prepared with the great the vital transformation which marks the ripening of the girl into the womans maturity of thought and passion a new power for good strong enough to resist the latent power for evil sprang into being and sheltered eunice under the supremacy of love love illfated and illbestowedbut love that no profanation could stain that no hereditary evil could conquerthe true love that had been and was and would be the guardian angel of eunices life  if i am asked whether i have ventured to found this opinion on what i have observed in one instance only i reply that i have had other opportunities of investigation and that my conclusions are derived from experience which refers to more instances than one  no man in his senses can doubt that physical qualities are transmitted from parents to children but inheritance of moral qualities is less easy to trace here the exploring mind finds its progress beset by obstacles that those obstacles have been sometimes overcome i do not deny moral resemblances have been traced between parents and children while however i admit this i doubt the conclusion which sees in inheritance of moral qualities a positive influence exercised on moral destiny there are inherent emotional forces in humanity to which the inherited influences must submit they are essentially influences under controlinfluences which can be encountered and forced back that we who inhabit this little planet may be the doomed creatures of fatality from the cradle to the grave i am not prepared to dispute but i absolutely refuse to believe that it is a fatality with no higher origin than can be found in our accidental obligation to our fathers and mothers   still absorbed in these speculations i was disturbed by a touch on my arm  i looked up eunices eyes were fixed on a shrubbery at some little distance from us which closed the view of the garden on that side i noticed that she was trembling nothing to alarm her was visible that i could discover i asked what she had seen to startle her she pointed to the shrubbery  look again she said  this time i saw a womans dress among the shrubs the woman herself appeared in a moment more it was helena she carried a small portfolio and she approached us with a smile    chapter xli the whispering voice  i looked at eunice she had risen startled by her first suspicion of the person who was approaching us through the shrubbery but she kept her place near me only changing her position so as to avoid confronting helena her quickened breathing was all that told me of the effort she was making to preserve her selfcontrol entirely free from unbecoming signs of hurry and agitation helena opened her business with me by means of an apology  pray excuse me for disturbing you i am obliged to leave the house on one of my tiresome domestic errands if you will kindly permit it i wish to express before i go my very sincere regret for what i was rude enough to say when i last had the honor of seeing you may i hope to be forgiven howdoyoudo eunice have you enjoyed your holiday in the country  eunice neither moved nor answered having some doubt of what might happen if the two girls remained together i proposed to helena to leave the garden and to let me hear what she had to say in the house  quite needless she replied i shall not detain you for more than a minute please look at this  she offered to me the portfolio that she had been carrying and pointed to a morsel of paper attached to it which contained this inscription   philips letters to me private helena gracedieu   i have a favor to ask she said and a proof of confidence in you to offer will you be so good as to look over what you find in my portfolio i am unwilling to give up the hopes that i had founded on our interview when i asked for it the letters will i venture to think plead my cause more convincingly than i was able to plead it for myself i wish to forget what passed between us to the last word to the last word she repeated emphaticallywith a look which sufficiently informed me that i had not been betrayed to her father yet will you indulge me she asked and offered her portfolio for the second time  a more impudent bargain could not well have been proposed to me  i was to read and to be favorably impressed by mr philip dunboynes letters and miss helena was to say nothing of that unlucky slip of the tongue relating to her mother which she had discovered to be a serious act of selfbetrayalthanks to my confusion at the time if i had not thought of eunice and of the desolate and loveless life to which the poor girl was so patiently resigned i should have refused to read miss gracedieus loveletters  but as things were i was influenced by the hope innocently encouraged by eunice herself that philip dunboyne might not be so wholly unworthy of the sweet girl whom he had injured as i had hitherto been too hastily disposed to believe to act on this view with the purpose of promoting a reconciliation was impossible unless i had the means of forming a correct estimate of the mans character it seemed to me that i had found the means a fair chance of putting his sincerity to a trustworthy test was surely offered by the letters the confidential letters which i had been requested to read to feel this as strongly as i felt it brought me at once to a decision i consented to take the portfolioon my own conditions  understand miss helena i said that i make no promises i reserve my own opinion and my own right of action  i am not afraid of your opinions or your actions she answered confidently if you will only read the letters in the meantime let me relieve my sister there of my presence i hope you will soon recover eunice in the country air  if the object of the wretch was to exasperate her victim she had completely failed eunice remained as still as a statue to all appearance she had not even heard what had been said to her helena looked at me and touched her forehead with a significant smile sad isnt it she saidand bowed and went briskly away on her household errand  we were alone again  still eunice never moved i spoke to her and produced no impression beginning to feel alarmed i tried the effect of touching her with a wild cry she started into a state of animation almost at the same moment she weakly swayed to and fro as if the pleasant breeze in the garden moved her at its will like the flowers i held her up and led her to the seat  there is nothing to be afraid of i said she has gone  eunices eyes rested on me in vacant surprise how do you know she asked i hear her but i never see her do you see her  my dear child of what person are you speaking  she answered of no person i am speaking of a voice that whispers and tempts me when helena is near  what voice eunice  the whispering voice it said to me i am your mother it called me daughter when i first heard it my father speaks of my mother the angel that good spirit has never come to me from the better world it is a mockmother who comes to mesome spirit of evil listen to this i was awake in my bed in the dark i heard the mockmother whispering close at my ear shall i tell you how she answered me when i longed for light to see her by when i prayed to her to show herself to me she said my face was hidden when i passed from life to death my face no mortal creature may see i have never seen herhow can you have seen her but i heard her again just now she whispered to me when helena was standing therewhere you are standing she freezes the life in me did she freeze the life in you did you hear her tempting me dont speak of it if you did oh not a word not a word  a man who has governed a prison may say with macbeth i have supped full with horrors hardened as i wasor ought to have beenthe effect of what i had just heard turned me cold if i had not known it to be absolutely impossible i might have believed that the crime and the death of the murderess were known to eunice as being the crime and the death of her mother and that the horrid discovery had turned her brain this was simply impossible what did it mean good god what did it mean  my sense of my own helplessness was the first sense in me that recovered i thought of eunices devoted little friend a womans sympathy seemed to be needed now i rose to lead the way out of the garden  selina will think we are lost i said let us go and find selina  not for the world she cried  why not  because i dont feel sure of myself i might tell selina something which she must never know i should be so sorry to frighten her let me stop here with you  i resumed my place at her side  let me take your hand  i gave her my hand what composing influence this simple act may or may not have exercised it is impossible to say she was quiet she was silent after an interval i heard her breathe a longdrawn sigh of relief  i am afraid i have surprised you she said helena brings the dreadful time back to me she stopped and shuddered  dont speak of helena my dear  but i am afraid you will thinkbecause i have said strange thingsthat i have been talking at random she insisted the doctor will say that if you meet with him he believes i am deluded by a dream i tried to think so myself it was of no use i am quite sure he is wrong  i privately determined to watch for the doctors arrival and to consult with him eunice went on  i have the story of a terrible night to tell you but i havent the courage to tell it now why shouldnt you come back with me to the place that i am staying at a pleasant farmhouse and such kind people you might read the account of that night in my journal i shall not regret the misery of having written it if it helps you to find out how this hateful second self of mine has come to me hush i want to ask you something do you think helena is in the house  noshe has gone out  did she say that herself are you sure  quite sure  she decided on going back to the farm while helena was out of the way we left the garden together for the first time my companion noticed the portfolio i happened to be carrying it in the hand that was nearest to her as she walked by my side  where did you get that she asked  it was needless to reply in words my hesitation spoke for me  carry it in your other hand she saidthe hand thats furthest away from me i dont want to see it do you mind waiting a moment while i find selina you will go to the farm with us wont you  i had to look over the letters in eunices own interests and i begged her to let me defer my visit to the farm until the next day she consented after making me promise to keep my appointment it was of some importance to her she told me that i should make acquaintance with the farmer and his wife and children and tell her how i liked them her plans for the future depended on what those good people might be willing to do when she had recovered her health it was impossible for her to go home again while helena remained in the house she had resolved to earn her own living if she could get employment as a governess the farmers children liked her she had already helped their mother in teaching them and there was reason to hope that their father would see his way to employing her permanently his house offered the great advantage of being near enough to the town to enable her to hear news of the ministers progress toward recovery and to see him herself when safe opportunities offered from time to time as for her salary what did she care about money anything would be acceptable if the good man would only realize her hopes for the future  it was disheartening to hear that hope at her age began and ended within such narrow limits as these no prudent man would have tried to persuade her as i now did that the idea of reconciliation offered the better hope of the two  suppose i see mr philip dunboyne when i go back to london i began what shall i say to him  say i have forgiven him  and suppose i went on that the blame really rests where you all believe it to rest with helena if that young man returns to you truly ashamed of himself truly penitent will you  she resolutely interrupted me no  oh eunice you surely mean yes  i mean no  why  dont ask me goodby till tomorrow    chapter xlii the quaint philosopher  no person came to my room and nothing happened to interrupt me while i was reading mr philip dunboynes letters  one of them let me say at once produced a very disagreeable impression on me i have unexpectedly discovered mrs tenbruggenin a postscript she is making a living as a medical rubber or masseuse and is in professional attendance on mr dunboyne the elder more of this a little further on  having gone through the whole collection of young dunboynes letters i set myself to review the differing conclusions which the correspondence had produced on my mind  i call the papers submitted to me a correspondence because the greater part of philips letters exhibit notes in pencil evidently added by helena these express for the most part the interpretation which she had placed on passages that perplexed or displeased her and they have as philips rejoinders show been employed as materials when she wrote her replies  on reflection i find myself troubled by complexities and contradictions in the view presented of this young mans character to decide positively whether i can justify to myself and to my regard for eunice an attempt to reunite the lovers requires more time for consideration than i can reasonably expect that helenas patience will allow having a quiet hour or two still before me i have determined to make extracts from the letters for my own use with the intention of referring to them while i am still in doubt which way my decision ought to incline i shall present them here to speak for themselves is there any objection to this none that i can see  in the first place those extracts have a value of their own they add necessary information to the present history of events  in the second place i am under no obligation to mr gracedieus daughter which forbids me to make use of her portfolio i told her that i only consented to receive it under reserve of my own right of actionand her assent to that stipulation was expressed in the clearest terms   extracts from mr philip dunboynes letters  first extract  you blame me dear helena for not having paid proper attention to the questions put to me in your last letter i have only been waiting to make up my mind before i replied  first question do i think it advisable that you should write to my father no my dear i beg you will defer writing until you hear from me again  second question considering that he is still a stranger to you is there any harm in your asking me what sort of man my father is no harm my sweet one but as you will presently see i am afraid you have addressed yourself to the wrong person  my father is kind in his own odd wayand learned and richa more highminded and honorable man as i have every reason to believe doesnt live but if you ask me which he prefers his books or his son i hope i do him no injustice when i answer his books his reading and his writing are obstacles between us which i have never been able to overcome this is the more to be regretted because he is charming on the few occasions when i find him disengaged if you wish i knew more about my father we are in complete agreement as usuali wish too  but there is a dear friend of yours and mine who is just the person we want to help us need i say that i allude to mrs staveley  i called on her yesterday not long after she had paid a visit to my father luck had favored her she arrived just at the time when hunger had obliged him to shut up his books and ring for something to eat mrs staveley secured a favorable reception with her customary tact and delicacy he had a fowl for his dinner she knows his weakness of old she volunteered to carve it for him  if i can only repeat what this clever woman told me of their talk you will have a portrait of mr dunboyne the eldernot perhaps a highlyfinished picture but as i hope and believe a good likeness  mrs staveley began by complaining to him of the conduct of his son i had promised to write to her and i had never kept my word she had reasons for being especially interested in my plans and prospects just then knowing me to be attached please take notice that i am quoting her own language to a charming friend of hers whom i had first met at her house to aggravate the disappointment that i had inflicted the young lady had neglected her too no letters no information perhaps my father would kindly enlighten her was the affair going on or was it broken off  my father held out his plate and asked for the other wing of the fowl it isnt a bad one for london he said wont you have some yourself  i dont seem to have interested you mrs staveley remarked  what did you expect me to be interested in my father inquired i was absorbed in the fowl favor me by returning to the subject  mrs staveley admits that she answered this rather sharply the subject sir was your sons admiration for a charming girl one of the daughters of mr gracedieu the famous preacher  my father is too wellbred to speak to a lady while his attention is absorbed by a fowl he finished the second wing and then he asked if philip was engaged to be married  i am not quite sure mrs staveley confessed  then my dear friend we will wait till we are sure  but mr dunboyne there is really no need to wait i suppose your son comes here now and then to see you  my son is most attentive in course of time he will contrive to hit on the right hour for his visit at present poor fellow he interrupts me every day  suppose he hits upon the right time tomorrow  yes  you might ask him if he is engaged  pardon me i think i might wait till philip mentions it without asking  what an extraordinary man you are  oh no noonly a philosopher  this tried mrs staveleys temper you know what a perfectly candid person our friend is she owned to me that she felt inclined to make herself disagreeable thats thrown away upon me she said i dont know what a philosopher is  let me pause for a moment dear helena i have inexcusably forgotten to speak of my fathers personal appearance it wont take long i need only notice one interesting feature which so to speak lifts his face out of the common he has an eloquent nose persons possessing this rare advantage are blest with powers of expression not granted to their ordinary fellowcreatures my fathers nose is a mine of information to friends familiarly acquainted with it it changes color like a modest young ladys cheek it works flexibly from side to side like the rudder of a ship on the present occasion mrs staveley saw it shift toward the lefthand side of his face a sigh escaped the poor lady experience told her that my father was going to hold forth  you dont know what a philosopher is he repeated be so kind as to look at me i am a philosopher  mrs staveley bowed  and a philosopher my charming friend is a man who has discovered a system of life some systems assert themselves in volumesmy system asserts itself in two words never think of anything until you have first asked yourself if there is an absolute necessity for doing it at that particular moment thinking of things when things neednt be thought of is offering an opportunity to worry and worry is the favorite agent of death when the destroyer handles his work in a lingering way and achieves premature results never look back and never look forward as long as you can possibly help it looking back leads the way to sorrow and looking forward ends in the cruelest of all delusions it encourages hope the present time is the precious time live for the passing day the passing day is all that we can be sure of you suggested just now that i should ask my son if he was engaged to be married how do we know what wear and tear of your nervous texture i succeeded in saving when i said wait till philip mentions it without asking there is the personal application of my system i have explained it in my time to every woman on the list of my acquaintance including the female servants not one of them has rewarded me by adopting my system how do you feel about it  mrs staveley declined to tell me whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude to the rest of the sex when i asked why she declared that it was my turn now to tell her what i had been doing  you will anticipate what followed she objected to the mystery in which my prospects seemed to be involved in plain english was i or was i not engaged to marry her dear eunice i said no what else could i say if i had told mrs staveley the truth when she insisted on my explaining myself she would have gone back to my father and would have appealed to his sense of justice to forbid our marriage finding me obstinately silent she has decided on writing to eunice so we parted but dont be disheartened on my way out of the house i met mr staveley coming in and had a little talk with him he and his wife and his family are going to the seaside next week mrs staveley once out of our way i can tell my father of our engagement without any fear of consequences if she writes to him the moment he sees my name mentioned and finds violent language associated with it he will hand the letter to me your business philip dont interrupt me he will say that and go back to his books there is my father painted to the life farewell for the present    remarks by h gphilips grace and gayety of style might be envied by any professional author he amuses me but he rouses my suspicion at the same time this slippery lover of mine tells me to defer writing to his father and gives no reason for offering that strange advice to the young lady who is soon to be a member of the family is this merely one more instance of the weakness of his character or now that he is away from my influence is he beginning to regret eunice already  added by the governori too have my doubts is the flippant nonsense which philip has written inspired by the effervescent good spirits of a happy young man or is it assumed for a purpose in this latter case i should gladly conclude that he was regarding his conduct to eunice with becoming emotions of sorrow and shame    chapter xliii the masterful masseuse  my next quotations will suffer a process of abridgment i intend them to present the substance of three letters reduced as follows   second extract  weak as he may be mr philip dunboyne shows in his second letter that he can feel resentment and that he can express his feelings in replying to miss helena he protests against suspicions which he has not deserved that he does sometimes think of eunice he sees no reason to deny he is conscious of errors and misdeeds whichtraceable as they are to helenas irresistible fascinationsmay perhaps be considered rather his misfortune than his fault be that as it may he does indeed feel anxious to hear good accounts of eunices health if this honest avowal excites her sisters jealousy he will be disappointed in helena for the first time  his third letter shows that this exhibition of spirit has had its effect  the imperious young lady regrets that she has hurt his feelings and is rewarded for the apology by receiving news of the most gratifying kind faithful philip has told his father that he is engaged to be married to miss helena gracedieu daughter of the celebrated congregational preacherand so on and so on has mr dunboyne the elder expressed any objection to the young lady certainly not he knows nothing of the other engagement to eunice and he merely objects on principle to looking forward how do we know says the philosopher what accidents may happen or what doubts and hesitations may yet turn up i am not to burden my mind in this matter till i know that i must do it let me hear when she is ready to go to church and i will be ready with the settlements my compliments to miss and her papa and let us wait a little dearest helenaisnt he funny  the next letter has been already mentioned  in this there occurs the first startling reference to mrs tenbruggen by name she is in london finding her way to lucrative celebrity by twisting turning and pinching the flesh of credulous persons afflicted with nervous disorders and she has already paid a few medical visits to old mr dunboyne he persists in poring over his books while mrs tenbruggen operates sometimes on his cramped right hand sometimes in the fear that his brain may have something to do with it on the back of his neck one of them frowns over her rubbing and the other frowns over his reading it would be delightfully ridiculous but for a drawback mr philip dunboynes first impressions of mrs tenbruggen do not incline him to look at that lady from a humorous point of view  helenas remarks follow as usual she has seen mrs tenbruggens name on the address of a letter written by miss jillgallwhich is quite enough to condemn mrs tenbruggen as for philip himself she feels not quite sure of him even yet no more do i third extract  the letter that follows must be permitted to speak for itself  i have flown into a passion dearest helena and i am afraid i shall make you fly into a passion too blame mrs tenbruggen dont blame me  on the first occasion when i found my father under the hands of the medical rubber she took no notice of me on the second occasionwhen she had been in daily attendance on him for a week at an exorbitant feeshe said in the coolest manner who is this young gentleman my father laid down his book for a moment only dont interrupt me again maam the young gentleman is my son philip mrs tenbruggen eyed me with an appearance of interest which i was at a loss to account for i hate an impudent woman my visit came suddenly to an end  the next time i saw my father he was alone  i asked him how he got on with mrs tenbruggen as badly as possible it appeared she takes liberties with my neck she interrupts me in my reading and she does me no good i shall end philip in applying a medical rubbing to mrs tenbruggen  a few days later i found the masterful masseuse torturing the poor old gentlemans muscles again she had the audacity to say to me well mr philip when are you going to marry miss eunice gracedieu my father looked up eunice he repeated when my son told me he was engaged to miss gracedieu he said helena philip what does this mean mrs tenbruggen was so obliging as to answer for me some mistake sir its eunice he is engaged to i confess i forgot myself how the devil do you know that i burst out mrs tenbruggen ignored me and my language i am sorry to see sir that your sons education has been neglected he seems to be grossly ignorant of the laws of politeness never mind the laws of politeness says my father you appear to be better acquainted with my sons matrimonial prospects than he is himself how is that mrs tenbruggen favored him with another ready reply my authority is a letter addressed to me by a relative of mr gracedieumy dear and intimate friend miss jillgall my fathers keen eyes traveled backward and forward between his female surgeon and his son which am i to believe he inquired i am surprised at your asking the question i said mrs tenbruggen pointed to me look at mr philip sirand you will allow him one merit he is capable of showing it when he knows he has disgraced himself without intending it i am sure my father infuriated me he looked as if he believed her out came one of the smallest and strongest words in the english language before i could stop it mrs tenbruggen you lie the illustrious rubber dropped my fathers handshe had been operating on him all the timeand showed us that she could assert her dignity when circumstances called for the exertion either your son or i sir must leave the room which is it to be she met her match in my father walking quietly to the door he opened it for mrs tenbruggen with a low bow she stopped on her way out and delivered her parting words messieurs dunboyne father and son i keep my temper and merely regard you as a couple of blackguards with that pretty assertion of her opinion she left us  when we were alone there was but one course to take i made my confession it is impossible to tell you how my father received itfor he sat down at his library table with his back to me the first thing he did was to ask me to help his memory  did you say that the father of these girls was a parson  yesa congregational minister  what does the minister think of you  i dont know sir  find out  that was all not another word could i extract from him i dont pretend to have discovered what he really has in his mind i only venture on a suggestion if there is any old friend in your town who has some influence over your father leave no means untried of getting that friend to say a kind word for us and then ask your father to write to mine this is as i see it our only chance    there the letter ends helenas notes on it show that her pride is fiercely interested in securing philip as a husband her victory over poor eunice will as she plainly intimates be only complete when she is married to young dunboyne for the rest her desperate resolution to win her way to my good graces is sufficiently intelligible now  my own impressions vary philip rather gains upon me he appears to have some capacity for feeling ashamed of himself on the other hand i regard the discovery of an intimate friendship existing between mrs tenbruggen and miss jillgall with the gloomiest views is this formidable masseuse likely to ply her trade in the country towns and is it possible that she may come to this town god forbid   of the other letters in the collection i need take no special notice i returned the whole correspondence to helena and waited to hear from her  the one recent event in mr gracedieus family worthy of record is of a melancholy nature after paying his visit today the doctor has left word that nobody but the nurse is to go near the minister this seems to indicate but too surely a change for the worse  helena has been away all the evening at the girls school she left a little note informing me of her wishes i shall expect to be favored with your decision tomorrow morning in my housekeeping room  at breakfast time the report of the poor minister was still discouraging i noticed that helena was absent from the table miss jillgall suspected that the cause was bad news from mr philip dunboyne arriving by that mornings post if you will excuse the use of strong language by a lady she said helena looked perfectly devilish when she opened the letter she rushed away and locked herself up in her own shabby room a serious obstacle as i suspect in the way of her marriage cheering isnt it as usual good selina expressed her sentiments without reserve  i had to keep my appointment and the sooner helena gracedieu and i understood each other the better  i knocked at the door it was loudly unlocked and violently thrown open helenas temper had risen to boiling heat she stammered with rage when she spoke to me  i mean to come to the point at once she said  i am glad to hear it miss helena  may i count on your influence to help me i want a positive answer  i gave her what she wanted i said certainly not  she took a crumpled letter from her pocket opened it and smoothed it out on the table with a blow of her open hand  look at that she said  i looked it was the letter addressed to mr dunboyne the elder which i had written for mr gracedieuwith the one object of preventing helenas marriage  of course i can depend on you to tell me the truth she continued  without fear or favor i answered you may depend on that  the signature to the letter mr governor is written by my father but the letter itself is in a different hand do you by any chance recognize the writing  i do  whose writing is it  mine    chapter xliv the resurrection of the past  after having identified my handwriting i waited with some curiosity to see whether helena would let her anger honestly show itself or whether she would keep it down she kept it down  allow me to return good for evil the evil was uppermost nevertheless when miss gracedieu expressed herself in these selfdenying terms you are no doubt anxious to know if philips father has been won over to serve your purpose here is philips own account of it the last of his letters that i shall trouble you to read  i looked it over the memorandum follows which i made for my own use  an eccentric philosopher is as capable as the most commonplace human being in existence of behaving like an honorable man mr dunboyne read the letter which bore the ministers signature and handed it to his son can you answer that was all he said philips silence confessed that he was unable to answer itand philip himself i may add rose accordingly in my estimation his father pointed to the writingdesk i must spare my cramped hand the philosopher resumed and i must answer mr gracedieus letter write and leave a place for my signature he began to dictate his reply sirmy son philip has seen your letter and has no defense to make in this respect he has set an example of candor which i propose to follow there is no excuse for him what i can do to show that i feel for you and agree with you shall be done at the age which this young man has reached the laws of england abolish the authority of his father if he is sufficiently infatuated to place his honor and his happiness at the mercy of a lady who has behaved to her sister as your daughter has behaved to miss eunice i warn the married couple not to expect a farthing of my money either during my lifetime or after my death your faithful servant dunboyne senior having performed his duty as secretary philip received his dismissal you may send my reply to the post his father said and you may keep mr gracedieus letter morally speaking i regard that last document as a species of mirror in which a young gentleman like yourself may see how ugly he looks this philip declared was his fathers form of farewell i handed back the letter to helena not a word passed between us in sinister silence she opened the door and left me alone in the room  that mrs gracedieu and i had met in the bygone time andthis was the only serious part of ithad met in secret would now be made known to the minister was i to blame for having shrunk from distressing my good friend by telling him that his wife had privately consulted me on the means of removing his adopted child from his house and even if i had been cruel enough to do this would he have believed my statement against the positive denial with which the woman whom he loved and trusted would have certainly met it no let the consequences of the coming disclosure be what they might i failed to see any valid reason for regretting my conduct in the past time  i found miss jillgall waiting in the passage to see me come out  before i could tell her what had happened there was a ring at the housebell the visitor proved to be mr wellwood the doctor i was anxious to speak to him on the subject of mr gracedieus health miss jillgall introduced me as an old and dear friend of the minister and left us together in the diningroom  what do i think of mr gracedieu he said repeating the first question that i put well sir i think badly of him  entering into details after that ominous reply mr wellwood did not hesitate to say that his patients nerves were completely shattered disease of the brain had as he feared been already set up as to the causes which have produced this lamentable breakdown the doctor continued mr gracedieu has been in the habit of preaching extempore twice a day on sundays and sometimes in the week as welland has uniformly refused to spare himself when he was in most urgent need of rest if you have ever attended his chapel you have seen a man in a state of fiery enthusiasm feeling intensely every word that he utters think of such exhaustion as that implies going on for years together and accumulating its wasting influences on a sensitively organized constitution add that he is tormented by personal anxieties which he confesses to no one not even to his own children and the sum of it all is that a worse case of its kind i am grieved to say has never occurred in my experience  before the doctor left me to go to his patient i asked leave to occupy a minute more of his time my object was of course to speak about eunice  the change of subject seemed to be agreeable to mr wellwood he smiled goodhumoredly  you need feel no alarm about the health of that interesting girl he said when she complained to meat her ageof not being able to sleep i should have taken it more seriously if i had been told that she too had her troubles poor little soul lovetroubles most likelybut dont forget that my professional limits keep me in the dark have you heard that she took some composing medicine which i had prescribed for her father the effect certain in any case to be injurious to a young girl was considerably aggravated by the state of her mind at the time a dream that frightened her and something resembling delirium seems to have followed and she made matters worse poor child by writing in her diary about the visions and supernatural appearances that had terrified her i was afraid of fever on the day when they first sent for me we escaped that complication and i was at liberty to try the best of all remediesquiet and change of air i have no fears for miss eunice  with that cheering reply he went up to the ministers room  all that i had found perplexing in eunice was now made clear i understood how her agony at the loss of her lover and her keen sense of the wrong that she had suffered had been strengthened in their disastrous influence by her experiment on the sleeping draught intended for her father in mind and body both the poor girl was in the condition which offered its opportunity to the lurking hereditary taint it was terrible to think of what might have happened if the allpowerful counterinfluence had not been present to save her  before i had been long alone the servantmaid came in and said the doctor wanted to see me  mr wellwood was waiting in the passage outside the ministers bedchamber he asked if he could speak to me without interruption and without the fear of being overheard i led him at once to the room which i occupied as a guest  at the very time when it is most important to keep mr gracedieu quiet he said something has happened to excitei might almost say to infuriate him he has left his bed and is walking up and down the room and i dont scruple to say he is on the verge of madness he insists on seeing you being wholly unable to control him in any other way i have consented to this but i must not allow you to place yourself in what may be a disagreeable position without a word of warning judging by his tones and his looks he seems to have no very friendly motive for wishing to see you  knowing perfectly well what had happened and being one of those impatient people who can never endure suspensei offered to go at once to mr gracedieus room the doctor asked leave to say one word more  pray be careful that you neither say nor do anything to thwart him mr wellwood resumed if he expresses an opinion agree with him if he is insolent and overbearing dont answer him in the state of his brain the one hopeful course to take is to let him have his own way pray remember that i will be within call in case of your wanting me    chapter xlv the fatal portrait  i knocked at the bedroom door  whos there  only two wordsbut the voice that uttered them hoarse and peremptory was altered almost beyond recognition if i had not known whose room it was i might have doubted whether the minister had really spoken to me  at the instant when i answered him i was allowed to pass in having admitted me he closed the door and placed himself with his back against it the customary pallor of his face had darkened to a deep red there was an expression of ferocious mockery in his eyes helenas vengeance had hurt her unhappy father far more severely than it seemed likely to hurt me the doctor had said he was on the verge of madness to my thinking he had already passed the boundary line  he received me with a boisterous affectation of cordiality  my excellent friend my admirable honorable welcome guest you dont know how glad i am to see you stand a little nearer to the light i want to admire you  remembering the doctors advice i obeyed him in silence  ah you were a handsome fellow when i first knew you he said and you have some remains of it still left do you remember the time when you were a favorite with the ladies oh dont pretend to be modest dont turn your back now you are old on what you were in the prime of your life do you own that i am right  what his object might be in saying thisif indeed he had an objectit was impossible to guess the doctors advice left me no alternative i hastened to own that he was right as i made that answer i observed that he held something in his hand which was half hidden up the sleeve of his dressinggown what the nature of the object was i failed to discover  and when i happened to speak of you somewhere he went on i forget wherea member of my congregationi dont recollect who it wastold me you were connected with the aristocracy how were you connected  he surprised me but however he had got his information he had not been deceived i told him that i was connected through my mother with the family to which he had alluded  the aristocracy he repeated a race of people who are rich without earning their money and noble because their greatgrandfathers were noble before them they live in idleness and luxuryprofligates who gratify their passions without shame and without remorse deny if you dare that this is a true description of them  it was really pitiable heartily sorry for him i pacified him again  and dont suppose i forget that you are one of them do you hear me my noble friend  there was no help for iti made another conciliatory reply  so far he resumed i dont complain of you you have not attempted to deceive meyet absolute silence is what i require next though you may not suspect it my mind is in a ferment i must try to think  to some extent at least his thoughts betrayed themselves in his actions he put the object that i had half seen in his hand into the pocket of his dressinggown and moved to the toilettable opening one of the drawers he took from it a folded sheet of paper and came back to me  a minister of the gospel he said is a sacred man and has a horror of crime you are safe so farprovided you obey me i have a solemn and terrible duty to perform this is not the right place for it follow me downstairs  he led the way out the doctor waiting in the passage was not near the stairs and so escaped notice what is it mr wellwood whispered in the same guarded way i said he has not told me yet i have been careful not to irritate him when we descended the stairs the doctor followed us at a safe distance he mended his pace when the minister opened the door of the study and when he saw us both pass in before he could follow the door was closed and locked in his face mr gracedieu took out the key and threw it through the open window into the garden below  turning back into the room he laid the folded sheet of paper on the table that done he spoke to me  i distrust my own weakness he said a dreadful necessity confronts mei might shrink from the horrid idea and if i could open the door might try to get away escape is impossible now we are prisoners together but dont suppose that we are alone there is a third person present who will judge between you and me look there  he pointed solemnly to the portrait of his wife it was a small picture very simply framed representing the face in a threequarter view and part of the figure only as a work of art it was contemptible but as a likeness it answered its purpose my unhappy friend stood before it in an attitude of dejection covering his face with his hands  in the interval of silence that followed i was reminded that an unseen friend was keeping watch outside  alarmed by having heard the key turned in the lock and realizing the embarrassment of the position in which i was placed the doctor had discovered a discreet way of communicating with me he slipped one of his visitingcards under the door with these words written on it how can i help you  i took the pencil from my pocketbook and wrote on the blank side of the card he has thrown the key into the garden look for it under the window a glance at the minister before i returned my reply showed that his attitude was unchanged without being seen or suspected i in my turn slipped the card under the door  the slow minutes followed each otherand still nothing happened  my anxiety to see how the doctors search for the key was succeeding tempted me to approach the window on my way to it the tail of my coat threw down a little tray containing pens and pencils which had been left close to the edge of the table slight as the noise of the fall was it disturbed mr gracedieu he looked round vacantly  i have been comforted by prayer he told me the weakness of poor humanity has found strength in the lord he pointed to the portrait once more my hands must not presume to touch it while i am still in doubt take it down  i removed the picture and placed it by his directions on a chair that stood midway between us to my surprise his tones faltered i saw tears rising in his eyes you may think you see a picture there he said you are wrong you see my wife herself stand here and look at my wife with me  we stood together with our eyes fixed on the portrait  without anything said or done on my part to irritate him he suddenly turned to me in a state of furious rage not a sign of sorrow he burst out not a blush of shame wretch you stand condemned by the atrocious composure that i see in your face  a first discovery of the odious suspicion of which i was the object dawned on my mind at that moment my capacity for restraining myself completely failed me i spoke to him as if he had been an accountable being once for all i said tell me what i have a right to know you suspect me of something what is it  instead of directly replying he seized my arm and led me to the table take up that paper he said there is writing on it readand let her judge between us your life depends on how you answer me  was there a weapon concealed in the room or had he got it in the pocket of his dressinggown i listened for the sound of the doctors returning footsteps in the passage outside and heard nothing my life had once depended years since on my success in heading the arrest of an escaped prisoner i was not conscious then of feeling my energies weakened by fear but that man was not mad and i was younger in those days by a good twenty years or more at my later time of life i could show my old friend that i was not afraid of himbut i was conscious of an effort in doing it  i opened the paper am i to read this to myself i asked or am i to read it aloud  read it aloud  in these terms his daughter addressed him   i have been so unfortunate dearest father as to displease you and i dare not hope that you will consent to receive me what it is my painful duty to tell you must be told in writing  grieved as i am to distress you in your present state of health i must not hesitate to reveal what it has been my misfortunei may even say my misery when i think of my motherto discover  but let me make sure in such a serious matter as this is that i am not mistaken  in those happy past days when i was still dear to my father you said you thought of writing to invite a dearlyvalued friend to pay a visit to this house you had first known him as i understood when my mother was still living many interesting things you told me about this old friend but you never mentioned that he knew or that he had even seen my mother i was left to suppose that those two had remained strangers to each other to the day of her death  if there is any misinterpretation here of what you said or perhaps of what you meant to say pray destroy what i have written without turning to the next page and forgive me for having innocently startled you by a false alarm   mr gracedieu interrupted me  put it down he cried i wont wait till you have got to the endi shall question you now give me the paper it will help me to keep this mystery of iniquity clear in my own mind  i gave him the paper  he hesitatedand looked at the portrait once more turn her away from me he said i cant face my wife  i placed the picture with its back to him  he consulted the paper reading it with but little of the confusion and hesitation which my experience of him had induced me to anticipate had the mad excitement that possessed him exercised an influence in clearing his mind resembling in some degree the influence exercised by a storm in clearing the air whatever the right explanation may be i can only report what i saw i could hardly have mastered what his daughter had written more readily if i had been reading it myself  helena tells me he began that you said you knew her by her likeness to her mother is that true  quite true  and you made an excuse for leaving hersee here it is written down you made an excuse and left her when she asked for an explanation  i did  he consulted the paper again  my daughter saysno i wont be hurried and i wont be interruptedshe says you were confused is that so  it is so let your questions wait for a moment i wish to tell you why i was confused  havent i said i wont be interrupted do you think you can shake my resolution he referred to the paper again i have lost the place its your faultfind it for me  the evidence which was intended to convict me was the evidence which i was expected to find i pointed it out to him  his natural courtesy asserted itself in spite of his anger he said thank you and questioned me the moment after as fiercely as ever go back to the time sir when we met in your rooms at the prison did you know my wife then  certainly not  did you and she see each otherha ive got it nowdid you see each other after i had left the town no prevarication you own to telling helena that you knew her by her likeness to her mother you must have seen her mother where  i made another effort to defend myself he again refused furiously to hear me it was useless to persist whatever the danger that threatened me might be the sooner it showed itself the easier i should feel i told him that mrs gracedieu had called on me after he and his wife had left the town  do you mean to tell me he cried that she came to you  i do  after that answer he no longer required the paper to help him he threw it from him on the floor  and you received her he said without inquiring whether i knew of her visit or not guilty deception on your partguilty deception on her part oh the hideous wickedness of it  when his mad suspicion that i had been his wifes lover betrayed itself in this way i made a last attempt in the face of my own conviction that it was hopeless to place my conduct and his wifes conduct before him in the true light  mrs gracedieus object was to consult me before i could say the next words i saw him put his hand into the pocket of his dressinggown  an innocent man he sternly declared would have told me that my wife had been to see himyou kept it a secret an innocent woman would have given me a reason for wishing to go to youshe kept it a secret when she left my house she kept it a secret when she came back  mr gracedieu i insist on being heard your wifes motive  he drew from his pocket the thing that he had hidden from me this time there was no concealment he let me see that he was opening a razor it was no time for asserting my innocence i had to think of preserving my life when a man is without firearms what defense can avail against a razor in the hands of a madman a chair was at my side it offered the one poor means of guarding myself that i could see i laid my hand on it and kept my eye on him  he paused looking backward and forward between the picture and me  which of them shall i kill first he said to himself the man who was my trusted friend or the woman whom i believed to be an angel on earth he stopped once more in a state of fierce selfconcentration debating what he should do the woman he decided wretch fiend harlot how i loved her  with a yell of fury he pounced on the pictureripped the canvas out of the frameand cut it malignantly into fragments as they dropped from the razor on the floor he stamped on them and ground them under his foot go wife of my bosom he cried with a dreadful mockery of voice and lookgo and burn everlastingly in the place of torment his eyes glared at me your turn now he saidand rushed at me with his weapon ready in his hand i hurled the chair at his right arm the razor dropped on the floor i caught him by the wrist like a wild animal he tried to bite me with my free handif i had known how to defend myself in any other way i would have taken that waywith my free hand i seized him by the throat forced him back and held him against the wall my grasp on his throat kept him quiet but the dread of seriously injuring him so completely overcame me that i forgot i was a prisoner in the room and was on the point of alarming the household by a cry for help  i was still struggling to preserve my selfcontrol when the sound of footsteps broke the silence outside i heard the key turn in the lock and saw the doctor at the open door    chapter xlvi the cumbersome ladies  i cannot prevail upon myself to dwell at any length on the events that followed  we secured my unhappy friend and carried him to his bed it was necessary to have men in attendance who could perform the duty of watching him the doctor sent for them while i went downstairs to make the best i could of the miserable news which it was impossible entirely to conceal all that i could do to spare miss jillgall i did i was obliged to acknowledge that there had been an outbreak of violence and that the portrait of the ministers wife had been destroyed by the minister himself of helenas revenge on me i said nothing it had led to consequences which even her merciless malice could not have contemplated there were no obstacles in the way of keeping secret the attempt on my life but i was compelled to own that mr gracedieu had taken a dislike to me which rendered it necessary that my visit should be brought to an end i hastened to add that i should go to the hotel and should wait there until the next day in the hope of hearing better news  of the multitude of questions with which poor miss jillgall overwhelmed meof the wild words of sorrow and alarm that escaped herof the desperate manner in which she held by my arm and implored me not to go away when i must see for myself that she was a person entirely destitute of presence of mindi shall say nothing the undeserved suffering that is inflicted on innocent persons by the sins of others demands silent sympathy and to that extent at least i can say that i honestly felt for my quaint and pleasant little friend  in the evening the doctor called on me at the hotel the medical treatment of his patient had succeeded in calming the maddened brain under the influence of sleep if the night passed quietly better news might be hoped for in the morning  on the next day i had arranged to drive to the farm being resolved not to disappoint eunice but i shrank from the prospect of having to distress her as i had already distressed miss jillgall the only alternative left was to repeat the sad story in writing subject to the concealments which i had already observed this i did and sent the letter by messenger overnight so that eunice might know when to expect me  the medical report in the morning justified some hope mr gracedieu had slept well and there had been no reappearance of insane violence on his waking but the doctors opinion was far from encouraging when we spoke of the future he did not anticipate the cruel necessity of placing the minister under restraintunless some new provocation led to a new outbreak the misfortune to be feared was imbecility  i was just leaving the hotel to keep my appointment with eunice when the waiter announced the arrival of a young lady who wished to speak with me before i could ask if she had mentioned her name the young lady herself walked inhelena gracedieu  she explained her object in calling on me with the exasperating composure which was peculiarly her own no parallel to it occurs to me in my official experience of shameless women  i dont wish to speak of what happened yesterday so far as i know anything about it she began it is quite enough for me that you have been obliged to leave the house and to take refuge in this hotel i have come to say a word about the future are you honoring me with your attention  i signed to her to go on if i had answered in words i should have told her to leave the room  at first she resumed i thought of writing but it occurred to me that you might keep my letter and show it to philip by way of lowering me in his good opinion as you have lowered me in the good opinion of his father my object in coming here is to give you a word of warning if you attempt to make mischief next between philip and myself i shall hear of itand you know what to expect when you have me for an enemy it is not worth while to say any more we understand each other i hope  she was determined to have a replyand she got it  not quite yet i said i have been hitherto as becomes a gentleman always mindful of a womans claims to forbearance you will do well not to tempt me into forgetting that you are a woman by prolonging your visit now miss helena gracedieu we understand each other she made me a low curtsey and answered in her finest tone of irony i only desire to wish you a pleasant journey home  i rang for the waiter show this lady out i said  even this failed to have the slightest effect on her she sauntered to the door as perfectly at her ease as if the room had been hersnot mine  i had thought of driving to the farm shall i confess it my temper was so completely upset that active movement of some kind offered the one means of relief in which i could find refuge the farm was not more than five miles distant and i had been a good walker all my life after making the needful inquiries i set forth to visit eunice on foot  my way through the town led me past the ministers house i had left the door some fifty yards behind me when i saw two ladies approaching they were walking in the friendliest manner arm in arm as they came nearer i discovered miss jillgall her companion was the middleaged lady who had declined to give her name when we met accidentally at mr gracedieus door  hysterically impulsive miss jillgall seized both my hands and overwhelmed me with entreaties that i would go back with her to the house i listened rather absently the middleaged lady happened to be nearer to me now than on either of the former occasions on which i had seen her there was something in the expression of her eyes which seemed to be familiar to me but the effort of my memory was not helped by what i observed in the other parts of her face the irongray hair the baggy lower eyelids the fat cheeks the coarse complexion and the double chin were features and very disagreeable features too which i had never seen at any former time  do pray come back with us miss jillgall pleaded we were just talking of you i and my friend there she stopped evidently on the point of blurting out the name which she had been forbidden to utter in my hearing  the lady smiled her provokingly familiar eyes rested on me with a humorous enjoyment of the scene  my dear she said to miss jillgall caution ceases to be a virtue when it ceases to be of any use the governor is beginning to remember me and the inevitable recognitionwith his quickness of perceptionis likely to be a matter of minutes now she turned to me in more ways than one sir women are hardly used by nature as they advance in years they lose more in personal appearance than the men do you are whitehaired and pray excuse me you are too fat and allow me to take another liberty you stoop at the shouldersbut you have not entirely lost your good looks i am no longer recognizable allow me to prompt you as they say on the stage i am mrs tenbruggen  as a man of the world i ought to have been capable of concealing my astonishment and dismay she struck me dumb  mrs tenbruggen in the town the one woman whose appearance mr gracedieu had dreaded and justly dreaded stood before mefree as a friend of his kinswoman to enter his house at the very time when he was a helpless man guarded by watchers at his bedside my first clear idea was to get away from both the women and consider what was to be done next i bowedand begged to be excusedand said i was in a hurry all in a breath  hearing this the best of genial old maids was unable to restrain her curiosity where are you going she asked  too confused to think of an excuse i said i was going to the farm  to see my dear euneece miss jillgall burst out oh we will go with you mrs tenbruggens politeness added immediately with the greatest pleasure    chapter xlvii the journey to the farm  my first ungrateful impulse was to get rid of the two cumbersome ladies who had offered to be my companions it was needless to call upon my invention for an excuse the truth as i gladly perceived would serve my purpose i had only to tell them that i had arranged to walk to the farm  lean wiry and impetuous miss jillgall received my excuse with the sincerest approval of it as a new idea nothing could be more agreeable to me she declared i have been a wonderful walker all my life she turned to her friend we will go with him my dear wont we  mrs tenbruggens reception of this proposal inspired me with hope she asked how far it was to the farm five miles she repeated and five miles back again unless the farmer lends us a cart my dear selina you might as well ask me to walk to the north pole you have got rid of one of us mr governor she added pleasantly and the other if you only walk fast enough you will leave behind you on the road if i believed in luckwhich i donti should call you a fortunate man  but companionable selina would not hear of a separation she asked in her most irresistible manner if i objected to driving instead of walking her hearts dearest wish she said was to make her bosom friend and myself better acquainted with each other to conclude she reminded me that there was a cabstand in the next street  perhaps i might have been influenced by my distrust of mrs tenbruggen or perhaps by my anxiety to protect eunice it struck me that i might warn the defenseless girl to be on her guard with mrs tenbruggen to better purpose if eunice was in a position to recognize her in any future emergency that might occur to my mind this dangerous woman was doubly formidableand for a good reason she was the bosom friend of that innocent and unwary person miss jillgall so i amiably consented to forego my walk yielding to the superior attraction of mrs tenbruggens company on that day the sunshine was tempered by a delightful breeze if we had been in the biggest and worstgoverned city on the civilised earth we should have found no public vehicle open to the air which could offer accommodation to three people being only in a country town we had a light fourwheeled chaise at our disposal as a matter of course  no wise man expects to be mercifully treated when he is shut into a carriage with a mature single lady inflamed by curiosity i was not unprepared for miss jillgall when she alluded for the second time to the sad events which had happened in the house on the previous dayand especially to the destruction by mr gracedieu of the portrait of his wife  why didnt he destroy something else she pleaded piteously it is such a disappointment to me i never liked that picture myself of course i ought to have admired the portrait of the wife of my benefactor but nothat disagreeable painted face was too much for me i should have felt inexpressibly relieved if i could have shown it to elizabeth and heard her say that she agreed with me  perhaps i saw it when i called on you mrs tenbruggen suggested where did the picture hang  my dear i received you in the diningroom and the portrait hung in mr gracedieus study  what they said to each other next escaped my attention quite unconsciously miss jillgall had revealed to me a danger which neither the minister nor i had discovered though it had conspicuously threatened us both on the wall of the study the act of mad destruction which if i had possessed the means of safely interfering i should certainly have endeavored to prevent now assumed a new and startling aspect if mrs tenbruggen really had some motive of her own for endeavoring to identify the adopted child the preservation of the picture must have led her straight to the end in view the most casual opportunity of comparing helena with the portrait of mrs gracedieu would have revealed the likeness between mother and daughterand that result attained the identification of eunice with the infant whom the miss chance of those days had brought to the prison must inevitably have followed it was perhaps natural that mr gracedieus infatuated devotion to the memory of his wife should have blinded him to the betrayal of helenas parentage which met his eyes every time he entered his study but that i should have been too stupid to discover what he had failed to see was a wound dealt to my selfesteem which i was vain enough to feel acutely  mrs tenbruggens voice cheery and humorous broke in on my reflections with an odd question  mr governor do you ever condescend to read novels  its not easy to say mrs tenbruggen how grateful i am to the writers of novels  ah i read novels too but i blush to confessdo i blushthat i never thought of feeling grateful till you mentioned it selina and i dont complain of your preferring your own reflections to our company on the contrary you have reminded us agreeably of the heroes of fiction when the author describes them as being absorbed in thought for some minutes mr governor you have been a hero absorbed as i venture to guess in unpleasant remembrances of the time when i was a single lady you have not forgotten how badly i behaved and what shocking things i said in those bygone days am i right  you are entirely wrong  it is possible that i may have spoken a little too sharply anyway faithful selina interceded for her friend oh dear sir dont be hard on elizabeth she always means well mrs tenbruggen as facetious as ever made a grateful return for a small compliment she chucked miss jillgall under the chin with the air of an amorous old gentleman expressing his approval of a pretty servantgirl it was impossible to look at the two in their relative situations without laughing but mrs tenbruggen failed to cheat me into altering my opinion of her innocent miss jillgall clapped her ugly hands and said isnt she good company  mrs tenbruggens social resources were not exhausted yet she suddenly shifted to the serious side of her character  perhaps i have improved a little she said as i have advanced in years the sorrows of an unhappy married life may have had a purifying influence on my nature my husband and i began badly mr tenbruggen thought i had money and i thought mr tenbruggen had money he was taken in by me and i was taken in by him when he repeated the words of the marriage service most impressively read by your friend the chaplain with all my worldly goods i thee endowhis eloquent voice suggested one of the largest incomes in europe when i promised and vowed in my turn the delightful prospect of squandering my rich husbands money made quite a new woman of me i declare solemnly when i said i would love honor and obey mr t i looked as if i really meant it wherever he is now poor dear he is cheating somebody such a handsome gentlemanlike man selina and oh mr governor such a blackguard  having described her husband in those terms she got tired of the subject we were now favored with another view of this manysided woman she appeared in her professional character  ah what a delicious breeze is blowing out here in the country she said will you excuse me if i take off my gloves i want to air my hands she held up her hands to the breeze firm muscular deadly white hands in my professional occupation she explained i am always rubbing tickling squeezing tapping kneading rolling striking the muscles of patients selina do you know the movements of your own joints flexion extension abduction adduction rotation circumduction pronation supination and the lateral movements be proud of those accomplishments my dear but beware of attempting to become a masseuse there are drawbacks in that vocationand i am conscious of one of them at this moment she lifted her hands to her nose pah my hands smell of other peoples flesh the delicious country air will blow it awaythe luxury of purification her fingers twisted and quivered and got crooked at one moment and straight again at another and showed themselves in succession singly and flew into each other fiercely interlaced and then spread out again like the sticks of a fan until it really made me giddy to look at them as for miss jillgall she lifted her poor little sunken eyes rapturously to the sky as if she called the homiest sunlight to witness that this was the most lovable woman on the face of the earth  but elderly female fascination offers its allurements in vain to the rough animal man suspicion of mrs tenbruggens motives had established itself firmly in my mind why had the popular masseuse abandoned her brilliant career in london and plunged into the obscurity of a country town an opportunity of clearing up the doubt thus suggested seemed to have presented itself now is it indiscreet to ask i said if you are here in your professional capacity  her cunning seized its advantage and put a sly question to me do you wish to be one of my patients yourself  that is unfortunately impossible i replied i have arranged to return to london  immediately  tomorrow at the latest  artful as she was mrs tenbruggen failed to conceal a momentary expression of relief which betrayed itself partly in her manner partly in her face she had ascertained to her own complete satisfaction that my speedy departure was an event which might be relied on  but i have not yet answered you she resumed to tell the truth i am eager to try my hands on you massage as i practice it would lighten your weight and restore your figure i may even say would lengthen your life you will think of me one of these days wont you in the meanwhileyes i am here in my professional capacity several interesting cases and one very remarkable person brought to deaths door by the doctors a rich man who is liberal in paying his fees there is my quarrel with london and londoners some of their papers medical newspapers of course declare that my fees are exorbitant and there is a tendency among the patientsi mean the patients who are rolling in richesto follow the lead of the newspapers i am no worm to be trodden on in that way the london people shall wait for me until they miss meand when i do go back they will find the fees increased my fingers and thumbs mr governor are not to be insulted with impunity  miss jillgall nodded her head at me it was an eloquent nod admire my spirited friend was the interpretation i put on it  at the same time my private sentiments suggested that mrs tenbruggens reply was too perfectly satisfactory viewed as an explanation my suspicions were by no means set at rest and i was resolved not to let the subject drop yet speaking of mr gracedieu and of the chances of his partial recovery i said do you think the minister would benefit by massage  i havent a doubt of it if you can get rid of the doctor  you think he would be an obstacle in the way  there are some medical men who are honorable exceptions to the general rule and he may be one of them mrs tenbruggen admitted dont be too hopeful as a doctor he belongs to the most tyrannical tradesunion in existence may i make a personal remark  certainly  i find something in your mannerpray dont suppose that i am angrywhich looks like distrust i mean distrust of me  miss jillgalls ever ready kindness interfered in my defense oh no elizabeth you are not often mistaken but indeed you are wrong now look at my distinguished friend i remember my copy book when i was a small creature learning to write in england there were first lines that we copied in big letters and one of them said distrust is mean i know a young person whose name begins with h who is one mass of meanness butexcellent selina paused and pointed to me with a gesture of triumphno meanness there  mrs tenbruggen waited to hear what i had to say scornfully insensible to miss jillgalls wellmeant interruption  you are not altogether mistaken i told her i cant say that my mind is in a state of distrust but i own that you puzzle me  how if you please  may i presume that you remember the occasion when we met at mr gracedieus housedoor you saw that i failed to recognize you and you refused to give your name when the servant asked for it a few days afterward i heard you quite accidentally forbid miss jillgall to mention your name in my hearing i am at a loss to understand it  before she could answer me the chaise drew up at the gate of the farmhouse mrs tenbruggen carefully promised to explain what had puzzled me at the first opportunity if it escapes my memory she said pray remind me of it  i determined to remind her of it whether i could depend on her to tell me the truth might be quite another thing    chapter xlviii the decision of eunice  eunice ran out to meet us and opened the gate she was instantly folded in miss jillgalls arms on her release she came to me eager for news of her fathers health when i had communicated all that i thought it right to tell her of the doctors last report she noticed mrs tenbruggen the appearance of a stranger seemed to embarrass her i left miss jillgall to introduce them to each other  darling euneece you remember mrs tenbruggens name i am sure elizabeth this is my sweet girl i mentioned her in my letters to you  i hope she will be my sweet girl when we know each other a little better may i kiss you dear you have lovely eyes but i am sorry to see that they dont look like happy eyes you want mamma tenbruggen to cheer you what a charming old house  she put her arm round eunices waist and led her to the house door her enjoyment of the creepers that twined their way up the pillars of the porch was simply perfection as a piece of acting when the farmers wife presented herself mrs tenbruggen was so irresistibly amiable and took such flattering notice of the children that the harmless british matron actually blushed with pleasure im sure maam you must have children of your own she said mrs tenbruggen cast her eyes on the floor and sighed with pathetic resignation a sweet little family and all cruelly swept away by death if the performance meant anything it did most assuredly mean that  what wonderful selfpossession somebody whispered in my ear the children in the room were healthy wellbehaved little creaturesbut the name of the innocent one among them was selina  before dinner we were shown over the farm  the good woman of the house led the way and miss jillgall and i accompanied her the children ran on in front of us still keeping possession of eunice mrs tenbruggen followed at some distance behind i looked back after no very long interval and saw that a separation had taken place mrs tenbruggen passed me not looking so pleasantly as usual joined the children and walked with two of them hand in hand a pattern of maternal amiability i dropped back a little and gave eunice an opportunity of joining me having purposely left her to form her own opinion without any adverse influence exercised on my part  is that lady a friend of yours she asked no only an acquaintance what do you think of her  i thought i should like her at first she was so kind and seemed to take such an interest in me but she said such strange thingsasked if i was reckoned like my mother and which of us was the eldest my sister or myself and whether we were my fathers only two children and if one of us was more his favorite than the other what i could tell her i did tell but when i said i didnt know which of us was the oldest she gave me an impudent tap on the cheek and said i dont believe you child and left me how can selina be so fond of her dont mention it to any one else i hope i shall never see her again  i will keep your secret eunice and you must keep mine i entirely agree with you  you agree with me in disliking her  heartily  we could say no more at that time our friends in advance were waiting for us we joined them at once  if i had felt any doubt of the purpose which had really induced mrs tenbruggen to leave london all further uncertainty on my part was at an end she had some vile interest of her own to serve by identifying mr gracedieus adopted childbut what the nature of that interest might be it was impossible to guess the future when i thought of it now filled me with dismay a more utterly helpless position than mine it was not easy to conceive to warn the minister in his present critical state of health was simply impossible my relations with helena forbade me even to approach her and as for selina she was little less than a mere tool in the hands of her wellbeloved friend what in gods name was i to do  at dinnertime we found the master of the house waiting to bid us welcome  personally speaking he presented a remarkable contrast to the typical british farmer he was neither big nor burly he spoke english as well as i did and there was nothing in his dress which would have made him a fit subject for a picture of rustic life when he spoke he was able to talk on subjects unconnected with agricultural pursuits nor did i hear him grumble about the weather and the crops it was pleasant to see that his wife was proud of him and that he was what all fathers ought to be his childrens best and dearest friend why do i dwell on these details relating to a man whom i was not destined to see again only because i had reason to feel grateful to him when my spirits were depressed by anxiety he made my mind easy about eunice as long as she remained in his house  the social arrangements when our meal was over fell of themselves into the right train  miss jillgall went upstairs with the mother and the children to see the nursery and the bedrooms mrs tenbruggen discovered a bond of union between the farmer and herself they were both skilled players at backgammon and they sat down to try conclusions at their favorite game without any wearisome necessity for excuses or stratagems eunice took my arm and led me to the welcome retirement of her own sittingroom  i could honestly congratulate her when i heard that she was established at the farm as a member of the family while she was governess to the children she was safe from dangers that might have threatened her if she had been compelled by circumstances to return to the ministers house  the entry in her journal which she was anxious that i should read was placed before me next  i followed the poor childs account of the fearful night that she had passed with an interest that held me breathless to the end a terrible dream which had impressed a sense of its reality on the sleeper by reaching its climax in somnambulismthis was the obvious explanation no doubt and a rational mind would not hesitate to accept it but a rational mind is not a universal gift even in a country which prides itself on the idolworship of fact those good friends who are always better acquainted with our faults failings and weaknesses than we can pretend to be ourselves had long since discovered that my nature was superstitious and my imagination likely to mislead me in the presence of events which encouraged it well i was weak enough to recoil from the purely rational view of all that eunice had suffered and heard and seen on the fateful night recorded in her journal good and evil walk the ways of this unintelligible world on the same free conditions if we cling as many of us do to the comforting belief that departed spirits can minister to earthly creatures for goodcan be felt moving in us in a train of thought and seen as visible manifestations in a dreamwith what pretense of reason can we deny that the same freedom of supernatural influence which is conceded to the departed spirit working for good is also permitted to the departed spirit working for evil if the grave cannot wholly part mother and child when the mothers life has been good does eternal annihilation separate them when the mothers life has been wicked no if the departed spirit can bring with it a blessing the departed spirit can bring with it a curse i dared not confess to eunice that the influence of her murderessmother might as i thought possible have been supernaturally present when she heard temptation whispering in her ear but i dared not deny it to myself all that i could say to satisfy and sustain her i did say and when i declaredwith my whole heart declaredthat the noble passion which had elevated her whole being and had triumphed over the sorest trials that desertion could inflict would still triumph to the end i saw hope in that brave and true heart showing its bright promise for the future in eunices eyes  she closed and locked her journal by common consent we sought the relief of changing the subject eunice asked me if it was really necessary that i should return to london  i shrank from telling her that i could be of no further use to her father while he regarded me with an enmity which i had not deserved but i saw no reason for concealing that it was my purpose to see philip dunboyne  you told me yesterday i reminded her that i was to say you had forgiven him do you still wish me to do that  indeed i do  have you thought of it seriously are you sure of not having been hurried by a generous impulse into saying more than you mean  i have been thinking of it she said through the wakeful hours of last nightand many things are plain to me which i was not sure of in the time when i was so happy he has caused me the bitterest sorrow of my life but he cant undo the good that i owe to him he has made a better girl of me in the time when his love was mine i dont forget that miserably as it has ended i dont forget that  her voice trembled the tears rose in her eyes it was impossible for me to conceal the distress that i felt the noble creature saw it no she said faintly i am not going to cry dont look so sorry for me her hand pressed my hand gentlyshe pitied me when i saw how she struggled to control herself and did control herself i declare to god i could have gone down on my knees before her  she asked to be allowed to speak of philip again and for the last time  when you meet with him in london he may perhaps ask if you have seen eunice  my child he is sure to ask  break it to him gentlybut dont let him deceive himself in this world he must never hope to see me again  i triedvery gentlyto remonstrate at your age and at his age i said surely there is hope  there is no hope she pressed her hand on her heart i know it i feel it here  oh eunice its hard for me to say that  i will try to make it easier for you say that i have forgiven himand say no more    chapter xlix the governor on his guard  after leaving eunice my one desire was to be alone i had much to think of and i wanted an opportunity of recovering myself on my way out of the house in search of the first solitary place that i could discover i passed the room in which we had dined the door was ajar before i could get by it mrs tenbruggen stepped out and stopped me  will you come in here for a moment she said the farmer has been called away and i want to speak to you  very unwillinglybut how could i have refused without giving offensei entered the room  when you noticed my keeping my name from you mrs tenbruggen began while selina was with us you placed me in an awkward position our little friend is an excellent creature but her tongue runs away with her sometimes i am obliged to be careful of taking her too readily into my confidence for instance i have never told her what my name was before i married wont you sit down  i had purposely remained standing as a hint to her not to prolong the interview the hint was thrown away i took a chair  selinas letters had informed me she resumed that mr gracedieu was a nervous invalid when i came to england i had hoped to try what massage might do to relieve him the cure of their popular preacher might have advertised me through the whole of the congregational sect it was essential to my success that i should present myself as a stranger i could trust time and change and my married name certainly not known to mr gracedieu to keep up my incognito he would have refused to see me if he had known that i was once miss chance  i began to be interested  here was an opportunity perhaps of discovering what the minister had failed to remember when he had been speaking of this woman and when i had asked if he had ever offended her i was especially careful in making my inquiries  i remember how you spoke to mr gracedieu i said when you and he met long ago in my rooms but surely you dont think him capable of vindictively remembering some thoughtless words which escaped you sixteen or seventeen years since  i am not quite such a fool as that mr governor what i was thinking of was an unpleasant correspondence between the minister and myself before i was so unfortunate as to meet with mr tenbruggen i obtained a chance of employment in a public institution on condition that i included a clergyman among my references knowing nobody else whom i could apply to i rashly wrote to mr gracedieu and received one of those cold and cruel refusals which only the strictest religious principle can produce i was mortally offended at the time and if your friend the minister had been within my reach she paused and finished the sentence by a significant gesture  well i said he is within your reach now  and out of his mind she added besides ones sense of injury doesnt last except in novels and plays through a series of years i dont pity himand if an opportunity of shaking his high position among his admiring congregation presented itself i daresay i might make a mischievous return for his letter to me in the meanwhile we may drop the subject i suppose you understand now why i concealed my name from you and why i kept out of the house while you were in it  it was plain enough of course if i had known her again or had heard her name i might have told the minister that mrs tenbruggen and miss chance were one and the same and if i had seen her and talked with her in the house my memory might have shown itself capable of improvement having politely presented the expression of my thanks i rose to go  she stopped me at the door  one word more she said while selina is out of the way i need hardly tell you that i have not trusted her with the ministers secret you and i are as i take it the only people now living who know the truth about these two girls and we keep our advantage  what advantage i asked  dont you know  i dont indeed  no more do i female folly and a slip of the tongue i am old and ugly but i am still a woman about miss eunice somebody has told the pretty little fool never to trust strangers you would have been amused if you had heard that sly young person prevaricating with me in one respect her appearance strikes me she is not like either the wretch who was hanged or the poor victim who was murdered can she be the adopted child or is it the other sister whom i have not seen yet oh come come dont try to look as if you didnt know that is really too ridiculous  you alluded just now i answered to our advantage in being the only persons who know the truth about the two girls well mrs tenbruggen i keep my advantage  in other words she rejoined you leave me to make the discovery myself well my friend i mean to do it    in the evening my hotel offered to me the refuge of which i stood in need i could think for the first time that day without interruption  being resolved to see philip i prepared myself for the interview by consulting my extracts once more the letter in which mrs tenbruggen figures inspired me with the hope of protection for mr gracedieu attainable through no less a person than helena herself  to begin with she would certainly share philips aversion to the masseuse and her dislike of miss jillgall would just as possibly extend to miss jillgalls friend the hostile feeling thus set up might be trusted to keep watch on mrs tenbruggens proceedings with a vigilance not attainable by the coarser observation of a man in the event of an improvement in the ministers health i should hear of it both from the doctor and from miss jillgall and in that case i should instantly return to my unhappy friend and put him on his guard  i started for london by the early train in the morning  my way home from the terminus took me past the hotel at which the elder mr dunboyne was staying i called on him he was reported to be engaged that is to say immersed in his books the address on one of philips letters had informed me that he was staying at another hotel pursuing my inquiries in this direction i met with a severe disappointment mr philip dunboyne had left the hotel that morning for what destination neither the landlord nor the waiter could tell me  the next days post brought with it the information which i had failed to obtain miss jillgall wrote informing me in her strongest language that philip dunboyne had returned to helena indignant selina added helena means to make him marry her and i promise you she shall fail if i can stop it  in taking leave of eunice i had given her my address had warned her to be careful if she and mrs tenbruggen happened to meet again and had begged her to write to me or to come to me if anything happened to alarm her in my absence  in two days more i received a line from eunice written evidently in the greatest agitation  philip has discovered me he has been here and has insisted on seeing me i have refused the good farmer has so kindly taken my part i can write no more    chapter l the news from the farm  when i next heard from miss jillgall the introductory part of her letter merely reminded me that philip dunboyne was established in the town and that helena was in daily communication with him i shall do selina no injustice if my extract begins with her second page  you will sympathize i am sure she writes with the indignation which urged me to call on philip and tell him the way to the farmhouse think of helena being determined to marry him whether he wants to or not i am afraid this is bad grammar but there are occasions when even a cultivated lady fails in her grammar and almost envies the men their privilege of swearing when they are in a rage my state of mind is truly indescribable grief mingles with anger when i tell you that my sweet euneece has disappointed me for the first time since i had the happiness of knowing and admiring her what can have been the motive of her refusal to receive her penitent lover is it pride we are told that satan fell through pride euneece satanic impossible i feel inclined to go and ask her what has hardened her heart against a poor young man who bitterly regrets his own folly do you think it was bad advice from the farmer or his wife in that case i shall exert my influence and take her away you would do the same wouldnt you  i am ashamed to mention the poor dear minister in a postscript the truth is i dont very well know what i am about mr gracedieu is quiet sleeps better than he did eats with a keener appetite gives no trouble but alas that glorious intellect is in a state of eclipse do not suppose because i write figuratively that i am not sorry for him he understands nothing he remembers nothing he has my prayers  you might come to us again if you would only be so kind it would make no difference now the poor man is so sadly altered i must add most reluctantly that the doctor recommends your staying at home between ourselves he is little better than a coward fancy his saying no we must not run that risk yet i am barely civil to him and no more  in any other affair excuse me for troubling you with a second postscript my sympathy with euneece would have penetrated her motives i should have felt with her feelings but i have never been in love no gentleman gave me the opportunity when i was young now i am middleaged neglect has done its dreary workmy heart is an extinct crater figurative again i had better put my pen away and say farewell for the present  miss jillgall may now give place to eunice the same days post brought me both letters  i should be unworthy indeed of the trust which this affectionate girl has placed in me if i failed to receive her explanation of her conduct toward philip dunboyne as a sacred secret confided to my fatherly regard in those later portions of her letter which are not addressed to me confidentially eunice writes as follows   i get newsand what heartbreaking newsof my father by sending a messenger to selina it is more than ever impossible that i can put myself in the way of seeing helena again she has written to me about philip in a tone so shockingly insolent and cruel that i have destroyed her letter philips visit to the farm discovered i dont know how seems to have infuriated her she accuses me of doing all that she might herself have done in my place and threatens meno i am afraid of the wicked whisperings of that second self of mine if i think of it they were near to tempting me when i read helenas letter but i thought of what you said after i had shown you my journal and your words took my memory back to the days when i was happy with philip the trial and the terror passed away  consolation has come to me from the best of good women mrs staveley writes as lovingly as my mother might have written if death had spared her i have replied with all the gratitude that i really feel but without taking advantage of the services which she offers mrs staveley has it in her mind as you had it in your mind to bring philip back to me does she forget do you forget that helena claims him but you both mean kindly and i love you both for the interest that you feel in me  the farmers wifedear good soulhardly understands me so well as her husband does she confesses to pitying philip he is so wretched she says and dear heart how handsome and what nice winning manners i dont think i should have had your courage in your place to tell the truth i should have jumped for joy when i saw him at the door and i should have run down to let him inand perhaps been sorry for it afterward if you really wish to forget him my dear i will do all i can to help you  these are trifling things to mention but i am afraid you may think i am unhappyand i want to prevent that  i have so much to be thankful for and the children are so fond of me whether i teach them as well as i might have done if i had been a more learned girl may perhaps be doubtful they do more for their governess i am afraid than their governess does for them when they come into my room in the morning and rouse me with their kisses the hour of waking which used to be so hard to endure after philip left me is now the happiest hour of my day   with that reassuring view of her life as a governess the poor childs letter comes to an end    chapter li the triumph of mrs tenbruggen  miss jillgall appears again after an interval on the field of my extracts my pleasant friend deserves this time a serious reception she informs me that mrs tenbruggen has begun the inquiries which i have the best reason to dreadfor i alone know the end which they are designed to reach  the arrival of this news affected me in two different ways  it was discouraging to find that circumstances had not justified my reliance on helenas enmity as a counterinfluence to mrs tenbruggen on the other hand it was a relief to be assured that my return to london would serve rather than compromise the interests which it was my chief anxiety to defend i had foreseen that mrs tenbruggen would wait to set her enterprise on foot until i was out of her way and i had calculated on my absence as an event which would at least put an end to suspense by encouraging her to begin  the first sentences in miss jillgalls letter explain the nature of her interest in the proceedings of her friend and are on that account worth reading  things are sadly changed for the worse selina writes but i dont forget that philip was once engaged to euneece and that mr gracedieus extraordinary conduct toward him puzzled us all the mode of discovery which dear elizabeth suggested by letter at that time appears to be the mode which she is following now when i asked why she said philip may return to euneece the minister may recoverand will be all the more likely to do so if he tries massage in that case he will probably repeat the conduct which surprised you and your natural curiosity will ask me again to find out what it means am i your friend selina or am i not this was so delightfully kind and so irresistibly conclusive that i kissed her in a transport of gratitude with what breathless interest i have watched her progress toward penetrating the mystery of the girls ages it is quite needless to tell you    mrs tenbruggens method of keeping miss jillgall in ignorance of what she was really about and miss jillgalls admirable confidence in the integrity of mrs tenbruggen being now set forth on the best authority an exact presentation of the state of affairs will be completed if i add a word more relating to the positions actually occupied toward mrs tenbruggens enterprise by my correspondent and myself  on her side miss jillgall was entirely ignorant that one of the two girls was not mr gracedieus daughter but his adopted child on my side i was entirely ignorant of mrs tenbruggens purpose in endeavoring to identify the daughter of the murderess speaking of myself individually let me add that i only waited the event to protect the helpless onesmy poor demented friend and the orphan whom his mercy received into his heart and his home  miss jillgall goes on with her curious story as follows    always desirous of making myself useful i thought i would give my dear elizabeth a hint which might save time and trouble why not begin i suggested by asking the governor to help you that wonderful woman never forgets anything she had already applied to you without success  in my next attempt to be useful i did violence to my most cherished convictions by presenting the wretch helena to the admirable elizabeth that the former would be cold as ice in her reception of any friend of mine was nothing wonderful mrs tenbruggen passed it over with the graceful composure of a woman of the world in the course of conversation with helena she slipped in a question might i ask if you are older than your sister the answer was of course i dont know and here for once the most deceitful girl in existence spoke the truth  when we were alone again elizabeth made a remark if personal appearance could decide the question she said the disagreeable young woman is the oldest of the two the next thing to be done is to discover if looks are to be trusted in this case  my friends lawyer received confidential instructions not shown to me which seems rather hard to trace the two miss gracedieus registers of birth elizabeth described this proceeding not very intelligibly to my mind as a means of finding out which of the girls could be identified by name as the elder of the two  the report arrived this morning i was only informed that the result in one case had entirely defeated the inquiries in the other case elizabeth had helped her agent by referring him to a birth advertised in the customary columns of the times newspaper even here there was a fatal obstacle the name of the place in which mr gracedieus daughter had been born was not added as usual i still tried to be useful had my friend known the ministers wife my friend had never even seen the ministers wife and as if by a fatality her portrait was no longer in existence i could only mention that helena was like her mother but elizabeth seemed to attach very little importance to my evidence if i may call it by so grand a name people have such strange ideas about likenesses she said and arrive at such contradictory conclusions one can only trust ones own eyes in a matter of that kind  my friend next asked me about our domestic establishment we had only a cook and a housemaid if they were old servants who had known the girls as children they might be made of some use our luck was as steadily against us as ever they had both been engaged when mr gracedieu assumed his new pastoral duties after having resided with his wife at her native place  i asked elizabeth what she proposed to do next  she deferred her answer until i had first told her whether the visit of the doctor might be expected on that day i could reply to this in the negative elizabeth thereupon made a startling request she begged me to introduce her to mr gracedieu  i said surely you have forgotten the sad state of his mind no she knew perfectly well that he was imbecile i want to try she explained if i can rouse him for a few minutes  by massage i inquired  she burst out laughing massage my dear doesnt act in that way it is an elaborate process pursued patiently for weeks together but my hands have more than one accomplishment at their fingerends oh make your mind easy i shall do no harm if i do no good take me selina to the minister  we went to his room dont blame me for giving way i am too fond of elizabeth to be able to disappoint her  it was a sad sight when we went in he was quite happy playing like a child at cupandball the attendant retired at my request i introduced mrs tenbruggen he smiled and shook hands with her he said are you a christian or a pagan you are very pretty how many times can you catch the ball in the cup the effort to talk to her ended there he went on with his game and seemed to forget that there was anybody in the room it made my heart ache to remember what he wasand to see him now  elizabeth whispered leave me alone with him  i dont know why i did such a rude thingi hesitated  elizabeth asked me if i had no confidence in her i was ashamed of myself i left them together  a long halfhour passed feeling a little uneasy i went upstairs again and looked into the room he was leaning back in his chair his plaything was on the floor and he was looking vacantly at the light that came in through the window i found mrs tenbruggen at the other end of the room in the act of ringing the bell nothing in the least out of the ordinary way seemed to have happened when the attendant had answered the bell we left the room together mr gracedieu took no notice of us  well i said how has it ended  quite calmly my noble elizabeth answered in total failure  what did you say to him after you sent me away  i tried in every possible way to get him to tell me which of his two daughters was the oldest  did he refuse to answer  he was only too ready to answer first he said helena was the oldestthen he corrected himself and declared that eunice was the oldestthen he said they were twinsthen he went back to helena and eunice now one was the oldest and now the other he rang the changes on those two names i cant tell you how often and seemed to think it a better game than cupandball  what is to be done  nothing is to be done selina  what i cried you give it up  my heroic friend answered i know when i am beaten my deari give it up she looked at her watch it was time to operate on the muscles of one of her patients away she went on her glorious mission of massage without a murmur of regret what strength of mind but oh dear what a disappointment for poor little me on one thing i am determined if i find myself getting puzzled or frightened i shall instantly write to you  with that expression of confidence in me selinas narrative came to an end i wish i could have believed as she did that the object of her admiration had been telling her the truth  a few days later mrs tenbruggen honored me with a visit at my house in the neighborhood of london thanks to this circumstance i am able to add a postscript which will complete the revelations in miss jillgalls letter  the illustrious masseuse having much to conceal from her faithful selina was well aware that she had only one thing to keep hidden from me namely the advantage which she would have gained if her inquiries had met with success  i thought i might have got at what i wanted she told me by mesmerizing our reverend friend he is as weak as a woman i threw him into hysterics and had to give it up and quiet him or he would have alarmed the house you look as if you dont believe in mesmerism  my looks mrs tenbruggen exactly express my opinion mesmerism is a humbug  you amusing old tory shall i throw you into a state of trance no ill give you a shock of another kinda shock of surprise i know as much as you do about mr gracedieus daughters what do you think of that  i think i should like to hear you tell me which is the adopted child  helena to be sure  her manner was defiant her tone was positive i doubted both under the surface of her assumed confidence i saw something which told me that she was trying to read my thoughts in my face many other women had tried to do that they succeeded when i was young when i had reached the wrong side of fifty my face had learned discretion and they failed  how did you arrive at your discovery i asked i know of nobody who could have helped you  i helped myself sir i reasoned it out a wonderful thing for a woman to do isnt it i wonder whether you could follow the process  my reply to this was made by a bow i was sure of my command over my face but perfect control of the voice is a rare power here and there a great actor or a great criminal possesses it  mrs tenbruggens vanity took me into her confidence in the first place she said helena is plainly the wicked one of the two i was not prejudiced by what selina had told me of her i saw it and felt it before i had been five minutes in her company if lying tongues ever provoke her as lying tongues provoked her mother she will follow her mothers example very well nowin the second placethough it is very slight there is a certain something in her hair and her complexion which reminds me of the murderess there is no other resemblance i admit in the third place the girls names point to the same conclusion mr gracedieu is a protestant and a dissenter would he call a child of his own by the name of a roman catholic saint no he would prefer a name in the bible eunice is his child and helena was once the baby whom i carried into the prison do you deny that  i dont deny it  only four words but they were deceitfully spoken and the deceitpracticed in eunices interest it is needless to saysucceeded mrs tenbruggens object in visiting me was attained i had confirmed her belief in the delusion that helena was the adopted child  she got up to take her leave i asked if she proposed remaining in london no she was returning to her country patients that night  as i attended her to the housedoor she turned to me with her mischievous smile i have taken some trouble in finding the clew to the ministers mystery she said dont you wonder why  if i did wonder i answered would you tell me why  she laughed at the bare idea of it another lesson she said to assist a helpless man in studying the weaker sex i have already shown you that a woman can reason learn next that a woman can keep a secret goodby god bless you  of the events which followed mrs tenbruggens visit it is not possible for me i am thankful to say to speak from personal experience ought i to conclude with an expression of repentance for the act of deception to which i have already pleaded guilty i dont know yes the force of circumstances does really compel me to say it and say it seriouslyi declare on my word of honor i dont know     third period 1876 helenas diary resumed    chapter lii helenas diary resumed  while my father remains in his present helpless condition somebody must assume a position of command in this house there cannot be a moments doubt that i am the person to do it  in my agitated state of mind sometimes doubtful of philip sometimes hopeful of him i find mrs tenbruggen simply unendurable a female doctor is under any circumstances a creature whom i detest she is at her very best a bad imitation of a man the medical rubber is worse than this she is a bad imitation of a mountebank her grinning goodhumor adopted no doubt to please the fools who are her patients and her impudent enjoyment of hearing herself talk make me regret for the first time in my life that i am a young lady if i belonged to the lowest order of the population i might take the first stick i could find and enjoy the luxury of giving mrs tenbruggen a good beating  she literally haunts the house encouraged of course by her wretched little dupe miss jillgall only this morning i tried what a broad hint would do toward suggesting that her visits had better come to an end  really mrs tenbruggen i said i must request miss jillgall to moderate her selfish enjoyment of your company for your own sake your time is too valuable in a professional sense to be wasted on an idle woman who has no sympathy with your patients waiting for relief perhaps and waiting in vain  she listened to this all smiles and goodhumor my dear do you know how i might answer you if i was an illnatured woman  i have no curiosity to hear it mrs tenbruggen  i might ask you she persisted to allow me to mind my own business but i am incapable of making an ungrateful return for the interest which you take in my medical welfare let me venture to ask if you understand the value of time  are you going to say much more mrs tenbruggen  i am going to make a sensible remark my child if you feel tired permit mehere is a chair father time dear miss gracedieu has always been a good friend of mine because i know how to make the best use of him the author of the famous saying tempus fugit you understand latin of course was i take leave to think an idle man the more i have to do the readier time is to wait for me let me impress this on your mind by some interesting examples the greatest conqueror of the centurynapoleonhad time enough for everything the greatest novelist of the centurysir walter scotthad time enough for everything at my humble distance i imitate those illustrious men and my patients never complain of me  have you done i asked  yes dearfor the present  you are a clever woman mrs tenbruggen and you know it you have an eloquent tongue and you know it but you are something else which you dont seem to be aware of you are a bore  she burst out laughing with the air of a woman who thoroughly enjoyed a good joke i looked back when i left the room and saw the friend of father time in the easy chair opening our newspaper  this is a specimen of the customary encounter of our wits i place it on record in my journal to excuse myself to myself when she left us at last later in the day i sent a letter after her to the hotel not having kept a copy of it let me present the substance like a sermon under three heads i begged to be excused for speaking plainly i declared that there was a total want of sympathy between us on my side and i proposed that she should deprive me of future opportunities of receiving her in this house the reply arrived immediately in these terms your letter received dear girl i am not in the least angry partly because i am very fond of you partly because i know that you will ask me to come back again p s philip sends his love  this last piece of insolence was unquestionably a lie philip detests her they are both staying at the same hotel but i happen to know that he wont even look at her if they meet by accident on the stairs  people who can enjoy the melancholy spectacle of human nature in a state of degradation would be at a loss which exhibition to preferan ugly old maid in a rage or an ugly old maid in tears miss jillgall presented herself in both characters when she heard what had happened to my mind mrs tenbruggens bosomfriend is a creature not fit to be seen or heard when she loses her temper i only told her to leave the room to my great amusement she shook her bony fist at me and expressed a frantic wish oh if i was rich enough to leave this wicked house i wonder whether there is insanity as well as poverty in miss jillgalls family   last night my mind was in a harassed state philip was as usual the cause of it  perhaps i acted indiscreetly when i insisted on his leaving london and returning to this place but what else could i have done it was not merely my interest it was an act of downright necessity to withdraw him from the influence of his hateful fatherwhom i now regard as the one serious obstacle to my marriage there is no prospect of being rid of mr dunboyne the elder by his returning to ireland he is trying a new remedy for his crippled handelectricity i wish it was lightning to kill him if i had given that wicked old man the chance i am firmly convinced he would not have let a day pass without doing his best to depreciate me in his sons estimation besides there was the risk if i had allowed philip to remain long away from me of losingno while i keep my beauty i cannot be in such danger as thatlet me say of permitting time and absence to weaken my hold on him however sullen and silent he may be when we meetand i find him in that condition far too ofteni can sooner or later recall him to his brighter self my eyes preserve their charm my talk can still amuse him and better even than that i feel the answering thrill in him which tells me how precious my kisses arenot too lavishly bestowed but the time when i am obliged to leave him to himself is the time that i dread how do i know that his thoughts are not wandering away to eunice he denies it he declares that he only went to the farmhouse to express his regret for his own thoughtless conduct and to offer her the brotherly regard due to the sister of his promised wife can i believe it oh what would i not give to be able to believe it how can i feel sure that her refusal to see him was not a cunning device to make him long for another interview and plan perhaps in private to go back and try again marriage nothing will quiet these frightful doubts of mine nothing will reward me for all that i have suffered nothing will warm my heart with the delightful sense of triumph over eunice but my marriage to philip and what does he say when i urge it on himyes i have fallen as low as that in the despair which sometimes possesses me he has his answer always the same and always ready how are we to live where is the money the maddening part of it is that i cannot accuse him of raising objections that dont exist we are poorer than ever here since my fathers illnessand philips allowance is barely enough to suffice him as a single man oh how i hate the rich  it was useless to think of going to bed how could i hope to sleep with my head throbbing and my thoughts in this disturbed state i put on my comfortable dressinggown and sat down to try what reading would do to quiet my mind  i had borrowed the book from the library to which i have been a subscriber in secret for some time past it was an old volume full of what we should now call gossip relating strange adventures and scandalous incidents in family history which had been concealed from public notice  one of these last romances in real life caught a strong hold on my interest  it was a strange case of intended poisoning which had never been carried out a young married lady of rank whose name was concealed under an initial letter had suffered some unendurable wrong which was not mentioned at the hands of her husbands mother the wife was described as a woman of strong passions who had determined on a terrible revenge by taking the life of her motherinlaw there were difficulties in the way of her committing the crime without an accomplice to help her and she decided on taking her maid an elderly woman into her confidence the poison was secretly obtained by this person and the safest manner of administering it was under discussion between the mistress and the maid when the door of the room was suddenly opened the husband accompanied by his brother rushed in and charged his wife with plotting the murder of his mother the young lady she was only twentythree must have been a person of extraordinary courage and resolution she saw at once that her maid had betrayed her and with astonishing presence of mind she turned on the traitress and said to her husband there is the wretch who has been trying to persuade me to poison your mother as it happened the old ladys temper was violent and overbearing and the maid had complained of being illtreated by her in the hearing of the other servants the circumstances made it impossible to decide which of the two was really the guilty woman the servant was sent away and the husband and wife separated soon afterward under the excuse of incompatibility of temper years passed and the truth was only discovered by the deathbed confession of the wife a remarkable story which has made such an impression on me that i have written it in my journal i am not rich enough to buy the book   for the last two days i have been confined to my room with a bad feverish coldcaught as i suppose by sitting at an open window reading my book till nearly three oclock in the morning i sent a note to philip telling him of my illness on the first day he called to inquire after me on the second day no visit and no letter here is the third dayand no news of him as yet i am better but not fit to go out let me wait another hour and if that exertion of patience meets with no reward i shall send a note to the hotel no news of philip i have sent to the hotel the servant has just returned bringing me back my note the waiter informed her that mr dunboyne had gone away to london by the morning train no apology or explanation left for me  can he have deserted me i am in such a frenzy of doubt and rage that i can hardly write that horrible question is it possibleoh i feel it is possible that he has gone away with eunice do i know where to find them if i did know what could i do i feel as if i could kill them both    chapter liii helenas diary resumed  after the heat of my anger had cooled i made two discoveries one cost me a fee to a messenger and the other exposed me to the insolence of a servant i pay willingly in my purse and my pride when the gain is peace of mind through my messenger i ascertained that eunice had never left the farm through my own inquiries answered by the waiter with an impudent grin i heard that philip had left orders to have his room kept for him what misery our stupid housemaid might have spared me if she had thought of putting that question when i sent her to the hotel  the rest of the day passed in vain speculations on philips motive for this sudden departure what poor weak creatures we are i persuaded myself to hope that anxiety for our marriage had urged him to make an effort to touch the heart of his mean father shall i see him tomorrow and shall i have reason to be fonder of him than ever   we met again today as usual he has behaved infamously  when i asked what had been his object in going to london i was told that it was a matter of business he made that idiotic excuse as coolly as if he really thought i should believe it i submitted in silence rather than mar his return to me by the disaster of a quarrel but this was an unlucky day a harder trial of my selfcontrol was still to come without the slightest appearance of shame philip informed me that he was charged with a message from mrs tenbruggen she wanted some irish lace and would i be so good as to tell her which was the best shop at which she could buy it  was he really in earnest you i said who distrusted and detested heryou are on friendly terms with that woman  he remonstrated with me my dear helena dont speak in that way of mrs tenbruggen we have both been mistaken about her that good creature has forgiven the brutal manner in which i spoke to her when she was in attendance on my father she was the first to propose that we should shake hands and forget it my darling dont let all the good feeling be on one side you have no idea how kindly she speaks of you and how anxious she is to help us to be married come come meet her halfway write down the name of the shop on my card and i will take it back to her  sheer amazement kept me silent i let him go on he was a mere child in the hands of mrs tenbruggen she had only to determine to make a fool of him and she could do it  but why did she do it what advantage had she to gain by insinuating herself in this way into his good opinion evidently with the intention of urging him to reconcile us to each other how could we two poor young people be of the smallest use to the fashionable masseuse  my silence began to irritate philip i never knew before how obstinate you could be he said you seem to be doing your besti cant imagine whyto lower yourself in my estimation  i held my tongue i assumed my smile it is all very well for men to talk about the deceitfulness of women what chance i should like to ask somebody who knows about it do the men give us of making our lives with them endurable except by deceit i gave way of course and wrote down the address of the shop  he was so pleased that he kissed me yes the most fondly affectionate kiss that he had given me for weeks past was my reward for submitting to mrs tenbruggen she is old enough to be his mother and almost as ugly as miss jillgalland she has made her interests his interests already   on the next day i fully expected to receive a visit from mrs tenbruggen she knew better than that i only got a polite little note thanking me for the address and adding an artless concession i earn more money than i know what to do with and i adore irish lace  the next day came and still she was careful not to show herself too eager for a personal reconciliation a splendid nosegay was sent to me with another little note a tribute dear helena offered by one of my grateful patients too beautiful a present for an old woman like me i agree with the poet sweets to the sweet a charming thought of shakespeares is it not i should like to verify the quotation would you mind leaving the volume for me in the hall if i call tomorrow  well done mrs tenbruggen she doesnt venture to intrude on miss gracedieu in the drawingroom she only wants to verify a quotation in the hall oh goddess of humility if there is such a person how becomingly you are dressed when your milliner is an artful old woman  while this reflection was passing through my mind miss jillgall came insaw the nosegay on the tableand instantly pounced on it oh for me for me she cried i noticed it this morning on elizabeths table how very kind of her she plunged her inquisitive nose into the poor flowers and looked up sentimentally at the ceiling the perfume of goodness she remarked mingled with the perfume of flowers when you have quite done with it i said perhaps you will be so good as to return my nosegay your nosegay she exclaimed there is mrs tenbruggens letter i replied if you would like to look at it she did look at it all the bile in her body flew up into her eyes and turned them green she looked as if she longed to scratch my face i gave the flowers afterward to maria miss jillgalls nose had completely spoiled them   it would have been too ridiculous to have allowed mrs tenbruggen to consult shakespeare in the hall i had the honor of receiving her in my own room we accomplished a touching reconciliation and we quite forgot shakespeare  she troubles me she does indeed trouble me  having set herself entirely right with philip she is determined on performing the same miracle with me her reform of herself is already complete her vulgar humor was kept under strict restraint she was quiet and wellbred and readier to listen than to talk this change was not presented abruptly she contrived to express her friendly interests in philip and in me by hints dropped here and there assisted in their effort by answers on my part into which i was tempted so skillfully that i only discovered the snare set for me on reflection what is it i ask again that she has in view in taking all this trouble where is her motive for encouraging a loveaffair which miss jillgall must have denounced to her as an abominable wrong inflicted on eunice money even if there was a prospect of such a thing in our case cannot be her object it is quite true that her success sets her above pecuniary anxiety spiteful feeling against eunice is out of the question they have only met once and her opinion was expressed to me with evident sincerity your sister is a nice girl but she is like other nice girlsshe doesnt interest me there is eunices character drawn from the life in few words in what an irritating position do i find myself placed never before have i felt so interested in trying to look into a persons secret mind and never before have i been so completely baffled  i had written as far as this and was on the point of closing my journal when a third note arrived from mrs tenbruggen  she had been thinking about me at intervals she wrote all through the rest of the day and kindly as i had received her she was conscious of being the object of doubts on my part which her visit had failed to remove might she ask leave to call on me in the hope of improving her position in my estimation an appointment followed for the next day  what can she have to say to me which she has not already said is it anything about philip i wonder    chapter liv helenas diary resumed  at our interview of the next day mrs tenbruggens capacity for selfreform appeared under a new aspect she dropped all familiarity with me and she stated the object of her visit without a superfluous word of explanation or apology  i thought this a remarkable effort for a woman and i recognized the merit of it by leaving the lions share of the talk to my visitor in these terms she opened her business with me  has mr philip dunboyne told you why he went to london  he made a commonplace excuse i answered business he said took him to london i know no more  you have a fair prospect of happiness miss helena when you are marriedyour future husband is evidently afraid of you i am not afraid of you and i shall confide to your private ear something which you have an interest in knowing the business which took young mr dunboyne to london was to consult a competent person on a matter concerning himself the competent person is the sagacious not to say sly old gentlemanwhom we used to call the governor you know him i believe  yes but i am at a loss to imagine why philip should have consulted him  have you ever heard or read miss helena of such a thing as an old mans fancy  i think i have  well the governor has taken an old mans fancy to your sister they appeared to understand each other perfectly when i was at the farmhouse  excuse me mrs tenbruggen that is what i know already why did philip go to the governor  she smiled if anybody is acquainted with the true state of your sisters feelings the governor is the man i sent mr dunboyne to consult himand there is the reason for it  this open avowal of her motives perplexed and offended me after declaring herself to be interested in my marriageengagement had she changed her mind and resolved on favoring philips return to eunice what right had he to consult anybody about the state of that girls feelings my feelings form the only subject of inquiry that was properly open to him i should have said something which i might have afterward regretted if mrs tenbruggen had allowed me the opportunity fortunately for both of us she went on with her narrative of her own proceedings  philip dunboyne is an excellent fellow she continued i really like himbut he has his faults he sadly wants strength of purpose and like weak men in general he only knows his own mind when a resolute friend takes him in hand and guides him i am his resolute friend i saw him veering about between you and eunice and i decided for his sakemay i say for your sake alsoon putting an end to that mischievous state of indecision you have the claim on him you are the right wife for him and the governor was as i thought likely from what i had myself observed the man to make him see it i am not in anybodys secrets it was pure guesswork on my part and it has succeeded there is no more doubt now about miss eunices sentiments the question is settled  in my favor  certainly in your favoror i should not have said a word about it  was philips visit kindly received or did the old wretch laugh at him  my dear miss gracedieu the old wretch is a man of the world and never makes mistakes of that sort before he could open his lips he had to satisfy himself that your lover deserved to be taken into his confidence on the delicate subject of eunices sentiments he arrived at a favorable conclusion i can repeat philips questions and the governors answers after putting the young man through a stiff examination just as they passed may i inquire sir if she has spoken to you about me she has often spoken about you did she seem to be angry with me she is too good and too sweet to be angry with you do you think she will forgive me she has forgiven you did she say so herself yes of her own free will why did she refuse to see me when i called at the farm she had her own reasonsgood reasons has she regretted it since certainly not is it likely that she would consent if i proposed a reconciliation i put that question to her myself how did she take it sir she declined to take it you mean that she declined a reconciliation yes are you sure she was in earnest i am positively sure that last answer seems by young dunboynes own confession to have been enough and more than enough for him he got up to goand then an odd thing happened after giving him the most unfavorable answers the governor patted him paternally on the shoulder and encouraged him to hope before we say goodby mr philip one word more if i was as young as you are i should not despair there is a sudden change of front who can explain it  the governors mischievous resolution to reconcile philip and eunice explained it of course with the best intentions perhaps mrs tenbruggen had helped that design by bringing the two men together go on i said i am prepared to hear next that philip has paid another visit to my sister and has been received this time  i must say this for mrs tenbruggen she kept her temper perfectly  he has not been to the farm she said but he has done something nearly as foolish he has written to your sister  and he has received a favorable reply of course  she put her hand into the pocket of her dress  there is your sisters reply she said  any persons who have had a crushing burden lifted unexpectedly and instantly from off their minds will know what i felt when i read the reply in the most positive language eunice refused to correspond with philip or to speak with him the concluding words proved that she was in earnest you are engaged to helena consider me as a stranger until you are married after that time you will be my brotherinlaw and then i may pardon you for writing to me  nobody who knows eunice would have supposed that she possessed those two valuable qualitiescommonsense and proper pride it is pleasant to feel that i can now send cards to my sister when i am mrs philip dunboyne  i returned the letter to mrs tenbruggen with the sincerest expressions of regret for having doubted her i have been unworthy of your generous interest in me i said i am almost ashamed to offer you my hand  she took my hand and gave it a good heady shake  are we friends she asked in the simplest and prettiest manner then let us be easy and pleasant again she went on will you call me elizabeth and shall i call you helena very well now i have got something else to say another secret which must be kept from philip i call him by his name now you see for a few days more your happiness my dear must not depend on his miserly old father he must have a little income of his own to marry on among the hundreds of unfortunate wretches whom i have relieved from torture of mind and body there is a grateful minority small small but there they are i have influence among powerful people and i am trying to make philip private secretary to a member of parliament when i have succeeded you shall tell him the good news  what a vile humor i must have been in at the time not to have appreciated the delightful gayety of this good creature i went to the other extreme now and behaved like a gushing young miss fresh from school i kissed her  she burst out laughing what a sacrifice she cried a kiss for me which ought to have been kept for philip bytheby do you know what i should do helena in your place i should take our handsome young man away from that hotel  i will do anything that you advise i said  and you will do well my child in the first place the hotel is too expensive for philips small means in the second place two of the chambermaids have audaciously presumed to be charming girls and the men my dearwell well i will leave you to find that out for yourself in the third place you want to have philip under your own wing domestic familiarity will make him fonder of you than ever keep him out of the sort of company that he meets with in the billiardroom and the smokingroom you have got a spare bed here i know and your poor father is in no condition to use his authority make philip one of the family  this last piece of advice staggered me i mentioned the proprieties mrs tenbruggen laughed at the proprieties  make selina of some use she suggested while you have got her in the house propriety is rampant why condemn poor helpless philip to cheap lodgings time enough to cast him out to the featherbed and the fleas on the night before your marriage besides i shall be in and out constantlyfor i mean to cure your father the tongue of scandal is silent in my awful presence an atmosphere of virtue surrounds mamma tenbruggen think of it    chapter lv helenas diary resumed  i did think of it philip came to us and lived in our house  let me hasten to add that the protest of propriety was duly entered on the day before my promised husband arrived standing in the doorwaynothing would induce her to take a chair or even to enter the roommiss jillgall delivered her opinion on philips approaching visit mrs tenbruggen reported it in her pocketbook as if she was representing a newspaper at a public meeting here it is copied from her notes  miss helena gracedieu my first impulse under the present disgusting circumstances was to leave the house and earn a bare crust in the cheapest garret i could find in the town but my grateful heart remembers mr gracedieu my poor afflicted cousin was good to me when i was helpless i cannot forsake him when he is helpless at whatever sacrifice of my own selfrespect i remain under this roof so dear to me for the ministers sake i notice miss that you smile i see my once dear elizabeth the friend who has so bitterly disappointed me she stopped and put her handkerchief to her eyes and went on againthe friend who has so bitterly disappointed me taking satirical notes of what i say i am not ashamed of what i say the virtue which will not stretch a little where the motive is good is feeble virtue indeed i shall stay in the house and witness horrors and rise superior to them goodmorning miss gracedieu goodmorning elizabeth she performed a magnificent curtsey and as mrs tenbruggens experience of the stage informed me made a very creditable exit   a week has passed and i have not opened my diary  my days have glided away in one delicious flow of happiness philip has been delightfully devoted to me his fervent courtship far exceeding any similar attentions which he may once have paid to eunice has shown such variety and such steadfastness of worship that i despair of describing it my enjoyment of my new life is to be feltnot to be coldly considered and reduced to an imperfect statement in words  for the first time i feel capable if the circumstances encouraged me of acts of exalted virtue for instance i could save my country if my country was worth it i could die a martyr to religion if i had a religion in one word i am exceedingly well satisfied with myself the little disappointments of life pass over me harmless i do not even regret the failure of good mrs tenbruggens efforts to find an employment for philip worthy of his abilities and accomplishments the member of parliament to whom she had applied has chosen a secretary possessed of political influence that is the excuse put forward in his letter to mrs tenbruggen wretched corrupt creature if he was worth a thought i should pity him he has lost philips services   three days more have slipped by the aspect of my heaven on earth is beginning to alter  perhaps the author of that wonderful french novel lame damnee is right when he tells us that human happiness is misery in masquerade it would be wrong to say that i am miserable but i may be on the way to it i am anxious  today when he did not know that i was observing him i discovered a preoccupied look in philips eyes he laughed when i asked if anything had happened to vex him was it a natural laugh he put his arm round me and kissed me was it done mechanically i daresay i am out of humor myself i think i had a little headache morbid probably i wont think of it any more  it has occurred to me this morning that he may dislike being left by himself while i am engaged in my household affairs if this is the case intensely as i hate her utterly as i loathe the idea of putting her in command over my domestic dominions i shall ask miss jillgall to take my place as housekeeper  i was away today in the kitchen regions rather longer than usual when i had done with my worries philip was not to be found maria looking out of one of the bedroom windows instead of doing her work had seen mr dunboyne leave the house it was possible that he had charged miss jillgall with a message for me i asked if she was in her room no she too had gone out it was a fine day and philip had no doubt taken a strollbut he might have waited till i could join him there were some orders to be given to the butcher and the greengrocer i too left the house hoping to get rid of some little discontent caused by thinking of what had happened returning by the way of high streeti declare i can hardly believe it even nowi did positively see miss jillgall coming out of a pawnbrokers shop  the direction in which she turned prevented her from seeing me she was quite unaware that i had discovered her and i have said nothing about it since but i noticed something unusual in the manner in which her watchchain was hanging and i asked her what oclock it was she said you have got your own watch i told her my watch had stopped so has mine she said there is no doubt about it now she has pawned her watch what for she lives here for nothing and she has not had a new dress since i have known her why does she want money  philip had not returned when i got home another mysterious journey to london no after an absence of more than two hours he came back  naturally enough i asked what he had been about he had been taking a long walk for his healths sake no to think to think of what well i might be surprised to hear it but his idle life was beginning to weigh on his spirits he wanted employment had he thought of an employment not yet which way had he walked anyway he had not noticed where he went these replies were all made in a tone that offended me besides i observed there was no dust on his boots after a week of dry weather and his walk of two hours did not appear to have heated or tired him i took an opportunity of consulting mrs tenbruggen  she had anticipated that i should appeal to her opinion as a woman of the world  i shall not set down in detail what she said some of it humiliated me and from some of it i recoiled the expression of her opinion came to this in the absence of experience a certain fervor of temperament was essential to success in the art of fascinating men either my temperament was deficient or my intellect overpowered it it was natural that i should suppose myself to be as susceptible to the tender passion as the most excitable woman living delusion my helena amiable delusion had i ever observed or had any friend told me that my pretty hands were cold hands i had beautiful eyes expressive of vivacity of intelligence of every feminine charm except the one inviting charm that finds favor in the eyes of a man she then entered into particulars which i dont deny showed a true interest in helping me i was ungrateful sulky selfopinionated dating from that days talk with mrs tenbruggen my new friendship began to show signs of having caught a chill but i did my best to follow her instructionsand failed  it is perhaps true that my temperament is overpowered by my intellect or it is possibly truer still that the fire in my heart when it warms to love is a fire that burns low my belief is that i surprised philip instead of charming him he responded to my advances but i felt that it was not done in earnest not spontaneously had i any right to complain was i in earnest was i spontaneous we were making love to each other under false pretenses oh what a fool i was to ask for mrs tenbruggens advice  a humiliating doubt has come to me suddenly has his heart been inclining to eunice again after such a letter as she has written to him impossible   three events since yesterday which i consider trifling as they may be intimations of something wrong  first miss jillgall who at one time was eager to take my place has refused to relieve me of my housekeeping duties secondly philip has been absent again on another long walk thirdly when philip returned depressed and sulky i caught miss jillgall looking at him with interest and pity visible in her skinny face what do these things mean   i am beginning to doubt everybody not one of them philip included cares for mebut i can frighten them at any rate yesterday evening i dropped on the floor as suddenly as if i had been shot a fit of some sort the doctor honestly declared that he was at a loss to account for it he would have laid me under an eternal obligation if he had failed to bring me back to life again  as it is i am more clever than the doctor what brought the fit on is well known to me ragefurious overpowering deadly ragewas the cause i am now in the coldblooded state which can look back at the event as composedly as if it had happened to some other girl suppose that girl had let her sweetheart know how she loved him as she had never let him know it before suppose she opened the door again the instant after she had left the room eager poor wretch to say once more for the fiftieth time my angel i love you suppose she found her angel standing with his back toward her so that his face was reflected in the glass and suppose she discovered in that face so smiling and so sweet when his head had rested on her bosom only the moment before the most hideous expression of disgust that features can betray there could be no doubt of it i had made my poor offering of love to a man who secretly loathed me i wonder that i survived my sense of my own degradation well i am alive and i know him in his true character at last am i a woman who submits when an outrage is offered to her what will happen next who knows i am in a fine humor what i have just written has set me laughing at myself helena gracedieu has one merit at leastshe is a very amusing person   i slept last night  this morning i am strong again calm wickedly capable of deceiving mr philip dunboyne as he has deceived me he has not the faintest suspicion that i have discovered him i wish he had courage enough to kill somebody how i should enjoy hiring the nearest window to the scaffold and seeing him hanged  miss jillgall is in better spirits than ever she is going to take a little holiday and the cunning creature makes a mystery of it goodby miss helena i am going to stay for a day or two with a friend what friend who cares   last night i was wakeful in the darkness a daring idea came to me today i have carried out the idea something has followed which is well worth entering in my diary  i left the room at the usual hour for attending to my domestic affairs the obstinate cook did me a service she was insolent she wanted to have her own way i gave her her own way in less than five minutes i was on the watch in the pantry which has a view of the house door my hat and my parasol were waiting for me on the table in case of my going out too  in a few minutes more i heard the door opened mr philip dunboyne stepped out he was going to take another of his long walks  i followed him to the street in which the cabs stand he hired the first one on the rank an open chaise while i kept myself hidden in a shop door  the moment he started on his drive i hired a closed cab double your fare i said to the driver whatever it may be if you follow that chaise cleverly and do what i tell you  he nodded and winked at me a wickedlooking old fellow just the man i wanted  we followed the chaise    chapter lvi helenas diary resumed  when we had left the town behind us the coachman began to drive more slowly in my ignorance i asked what this change in the pace meant he pointed with his whip to the open road and to the chaise in the distance  if we keep too near the gentleman miss he has only got to look back and hell see we are following him the safe thing to do is to let the chaise get on a bit we cant lose sight of it out here  i had felt inclined to trust in the drivers experience and he had already justified my confidence in him this encouraged me to consult his opinion on a matter of some importance to my present interests i could see the necessity of avoiding discovery when we had followed the chaise to its destination but i was totally at a loss to know how it could be done my wily old man was ready with his advice the moment i asked for it  wherever the chaise stops miss we must drive past it as if we were going somewhere else i shall notice the place while we go by and you will please sit back in the corner of the cab so that the gentleman cant see you  well i said and what next  next miss i shall pull up wherever it may be out of sight of the driver of the chaise he bears an excellent character i dont deny it but ive known him for yearsand we had better not trust him i shall tell you where the gentleman stopped and you will go back to the place on foot of course and see for yourself whats to be done specially if there happens to be a lady in the case no offense miss its in my experience that theres generally a lady in the case anyhow you can judge for yourself and youll know where to find me waiting when you want me again  suppose something happens i suggested that we dont expect  i shant lose my head miss whatever happens  all very well coachman but i have only your word for it in the irritable state of my mind the mans confident way of thinking annoyed me  begging your pardon my young lady youve got if i may say so what they call a guarantee when i was a young man i drove a cab in london for ten years will that do  i suppose you mean i answered that you have learned deceit in the wicked ways of the great city  he took this as a compliment thank you miss thats it exactly  after a long drive or so it seemed to my impatience we passed the chaise drawn up at a lonely house separated by a front garden from the road in two or three minutes more we stopped where the road took a turn and descended to lower ground the farmhouse which we had left behind us was known to the driver he led the way to a gate at the side of the road and opened it for me  in your place miss he said slyly the private way back is the way i should wish to take try it by the fields turn to the right when you have passed the barn and youll find yourself at the back of the house he stopped and looked at his big silver watch halfpast twelve he said the chawbaconsi mean the farmhouse servants misswill be at their dinner all in your favor so far if the dog happens to be loose dont forget that his names grinder call him by his name and pat him before he has time enough to think and hell let you be when you want me here youll find me waiting for orders  i looked back as i crossed the field the driver was sitting on the gate smoking his pipe and the horse was nibbling the grass at the roadside two happy animals without a burden on their minds  after passing the barn i saw nothing of the dog far or near no living creature appeared the servants must have been at dinner as the coachman had foreseen arriving at a wooden fence i opened a gate in it and found myself on a bit of waste ground on my left there was a large duckpond on my right i saw the fowlhouse and the pigstyes before me was a high impenetrable hedge and at some distance behind itan orchard or a garden as i supposed filling the intermediate spacerose the back of the house i made for the shelter of the hedge in the fear that some one might approach a window and see me once sheltered from observation i might consider what i should do next it was impossible to doubt that this was the house in which eunice was living neither could i fail to conclude that philip had tried to persuade her to see him on those former occasions when he told me he had taken a long walk  as i crouched behind the hedge i heard voices approaching on the other side of it at last fortune had befriended me the person speaking at the moment was miss jillgall and the person who answered her was philip  i am afraid dear mr philip you dont quite understand my sweet euneece honorable high minded delicate in her feelings and oh so unselfish i dont want to alarm you but when she hears you have been deceiving helena  upon my word miss jillgall you are so provoking i have not been deceiving helena havent i told you what discouraging answers i got when i went to see the governor havent i shown you eunices reply to my letter you cant have forgotten it already  oh yes i have why should i remember it dont i know poor euneece was in your mind all the time  youre wrong again eunice was not in my mind all the time i was hurti was offended by the cruel manner in which she had treated me and what was the consequence so far was i from deceiving helenashe rose in my estimation by comparison with her sister  oh come come mr philip that wont do helena rising in anybodys estimation ha ha ha  laugh as much as you like miss jillgall you wont laugh away the facts helena loved me helena was true to me dont be hard on a poor fellow who is half distracted what a man finds he can do on one day he finds he cant do on another try to understand that a change does sometimes come over ones feelings  bless my soul mr philip thats just what i have been understanding all the time i know your mind as well as you know it yourself you cant forget my sweet euneece  i tell you i tried to forget her on my word of honor as a gentleman i tried to forget her in justice to helena is it my fault that i failed eunice was in my mind as you said just now oh my friendfor you are my friend i am surepersuade her to see me if its only for a minute  was there ever a mans mind in such a state of confusion as this first i rise in his precious estimation and eunice drops then eunice rises and i drop idiot mischievous idiot even selina seemed to be disgusted with him when she spoke next  mr philip you are hard and unreasonable i have tried to persuade her and i have made my darling cry nothing you can say will induce me to distress her again go back you very undetermined mango back to your helena  too late  nonsense  i say too late if i could have married helena when i first went to stay in the house i might have faced the sacrifice as it is i cant endure her and i tell you this in confidence she has herself to thank for what has happened  is that really true  quite true  tell me what she did  oh dont talk of her persuade eunice to see me i shall come back again and again and again till you bring her to me  please dont talk nonsense if she changes her mind i will bring her with pleasure if she still shrinks from it i regard euneeces feelings as sacred take my advice dont press her leave her time to think of you and to pity youand that true heart may be yours again if you are worthy of it  worthy of it what do you mean  are you quite sure my young friend that you wont go back to helena  go back to her i would cut my throat if i thought myself capable of doing it  how did she set you against her did the wretch quarrel with you  it might have been better for both of us if she had done that oh her fulsome endearments what a contrast to the charming modesty of eunice if i was rich i would make it worth the while of the first poor fellow i could find to rid me of helena by marrying her i dont like saying such a thing of a woman but if you will have the truth  well mr philipand what is the truth  helena disgusts me    chapter lvii helenas diary resumed  so it was all settled between them philip is to throw me away like one of his bad cigars for this unanswerable reason helena disgusts me and he is to persuade eunice to take my place and be his wife yes if i let him do it  i heard no more of their talk with that last worst outrage burning in my memory i left the place  on my way back to the carriage the dog met me truly a grand creature i called him by his name and patted him he licked my hand something made me speak to him i said if i was to tell you to tear mr philip dunboyne to pieces would you do it the great goodnatured brute held out his paw to shake hands well well i was not an object of disgust to the dog  but the coachman was startled when he saw me again he said something i did not know what it was and he produced a pocketflask containing some spirits i suppose perhaps he thought i was going to faint he little knew me i told him to drive back to the place at which i had hired the cab and earn his money he earned it  on getting home i found mrs tenbruggen walking up and down the diningroom deep in thought she was startled when we first confronted each other you look dreadfully ill she said  i answered that i had been out for a little exercise and had overfatigued myself and then changed the subject does my father seem to improve under your treatment i asked  very far from it my dear i promised that i would try what massage would do for him and i find myself compelled to give it up  why  it excites him dreadfully  in what way  he has been talking wildly of events in his past life his brain is in some condition which is beyond my powers of investigation he pointed to a cabinet in his room and said his past life was locked up there i asked if i should unlock it he shook with fear he said i should let out the ghost of his dead brotherinlaw have you any idea of what he meant  the cabinet was full of old letters i could tell her thatand could tell her no more i had never heard of his brotherinlaw another of his delusions no doubt did you ever hear him speak mrs tenbruggen went on of a place called low lanes  she waited for my reply to this last inquiry with an appearance of anxiety that surprised me i had never heard him speak of low lanes  have you any particular interest in the place i asked  none whatever  she went away to attend on a patient i retired to my bedroom and opened my diary again and again i read that remarkable story of the intended poisoning and of the manner in which it had ended i sat thinking over this romance in real life till i was interrupted by the announcement of dinner  mr philip dunboyne had returned in miss jillgalls absence we were alone at the table my appetite was gone i made a pretense of eating and another pretense of being glad to see my devoted lover i talked to him in the prettiest manner as a hypocrite he thoroughly matched me he was gallant he was amusing if baseness like ours had been punishable by the law a prison was the right place for both of us  mrs tenbruggen came in again after dinner still not quite easy about my health how flushed you are she said let me feel your pulse i laughed and left her with mr philip dunboyne  passing my fathers door i looked in anxious to see if he was in the excitable state which mrs tenbruggen had described yes the effect which she had produced on himhow she knows besthad not passed away yet he was still talking the attendant told me it had gone on for hours together on my approaching his chair he called out which are you eunice or helena when i had answered him he beckoned me to come nearer i am getting stronger every minute he said we will go traveling tomorrow and see the place where you were born  where had i been born he had never told me where had he mentioned the place in mrs tenbruggens hearing i asked the attendant if he had been present while she was in the room yes he had remained at his post he had also heard the allusion to the place with the odd name had mr gracedieu said anything more about that place nothing more the poor ministers mind had wandered off to other things he was wandering now sometimes he was addressing his congregation sometimes he wondered what they would give him for supper sometimes he talked of the flowers in the garden and then he looked at me and frowned and said i prevented him from thinking  i went back to my bedroom and opened my diary and read the story again  was the poison of which that resolute young wife proposed to make use something that acted slowly and told the doctors nothing if they looked for it after death  would it be running too great a risk to show the story to the doctor and try to get a little valuable information in that way it would be useless he would make some feeble joke he would say girls and poisons are not fit company for each other  but i might discover what i want to know in another way i might call on the doctor after he has gone out on his afternoon round of visits and might tell the servant i would wait for his masters return nobody would be in my way i might get at the medical literature in the consultingroom and find the information for myself  a knock at my door interrupted me in the midst of my plans mrs tenbruggen againstill in a fidgety state of feeling on the subject of my health which is it she said pain of body my dear or pain of mind i am anxious about you  my dear elizabeth your sympathy is thrown away on me as i have told you already i am overtirednothing more  she was relieved to hear that i had no mental troubles to complain of fatigue she remarked sets itself right with rest did you take a very long walk  yes  beyond the limits of the town of course philip has been taking a walk in the country too he doesnt say that he met you  these clever people sometimes overreach themselves how she suggested it to me i cannot pretend to have discovered but i did certainly suspect that she had led philip while they were together downstairs into saying to her what he had already said to miss jillgall i was so angry that i tried to pump my excellent friend as she had been trying to pump mea vulgar expression but vulgar writing is such a convenient way of writing sometimes my first attempt to entrap the masseuse failed completely she coolly changed the subject  have i interrupted you in writing she asked pointing to my diary  no i was idling over what i have written alreadyan extraordinary story which i copied from a book  may i look at it  i pushed the open diary across the table if i was the object of any suspicions which she wanted to confirm it would be curious to see if the poisoning story helped her its a piece of family history i said i think you will agree with me that it is really interesting  she began to read as she went on not all her power of controlling herself could prevent her from turning pale this change of color in such a woman a little alarmed me when a girl is devoured by deadly hatred of a man does the feeling show itself to other persons in her face i must practice before the glass and train my face into a trustworthy state of discipline  coarse melodrama mrs tenbruggen declared mere sensation no analysis of character a madeup story  well made up surely i answered  i dont agree with you her voice was not quite so steady as usual she asked suddenly if my clock was rightand declared that she should be late for an appointment on taking leave she pressed my hand stronglyeyed me with distrustful attention and said very emphatically take care of yourself helena pray take care of yourself  i am afraid i did a very foolish thing when i showed her the poisoning story has it helped the wily old creature to look into my inmost thoughts  impossible   today miss jillgall returned looking hideously healthy and spitefully cheerful although she tried to conceal it while i was present i could see that philip had recovered his place in her favor after what he had said to her behind the hedge at the farm she would be relieved from all fear of my becoming his wife and would joyfully anticipate his marriage to eunice there are thoughts in me which i dont set down in my book i only say we shall see  this afternoon i decided on visiting the doctor the servant was quite sorry for me when he answered the door his master had just left the house for a round of visits i said i would wait the servant was afraid i should find waiting very tedious i reminded him that i could go away if i found it tedious at last the polite old man left me  i went into the consultingroom and read the backs of the medical books ranged round the walls and found a volume that interested me there was such curious information in it that i amused myself by making extracts using the first sheets of paper that i could find they had printed directions at the top which showed that the doctor was accustomed to write his prescriptions on them we had many too many of his prescriptions in our house  the servants doubts of my patience proved to have been well founded i got tired of waiting and went home before the doctor returned  from morning to night nothing has been seen of mrs tenbruggen today nor has any apology for her neglect of us been received fond as she is of writing little notes has that story in my diary driven her away let me see what tomorrow may bring forth   today has brought forthnothing mrs tenbruggen still keeps away from us it looks as if my diary had something to do with the mystery of her absence  i am not in good spirits today my nervesif i have such things which is more than i know by my own experiencehave been a little shaken by a horrid dream the medical information which my thirst for knowledge absorbed in the doctors consultingroom turned traitorarmed itself with the grotesque horrors of nightmareand so thoroughly frightened me that i was on the point of being foolish enough to destroy my notes i thought better of it and my notes are safe under lock and key  mr philip dunboyne is trying to pave the way for his flight from this house he speaks of friends in london whose interest will help him to find the employment which is the object of his ambition in a few days more he said i shall ask for leave of absence  instead of looking at me his eyes wandered to the window his fingers played restlessly with his watchchain while he spoke i thought i would give him a chance a last chance of making the atonement that he owes to me this shows shameful weakness on my part does my own resolution startle me or does the wretch appealto what to my pity it cannot be my love i am positively sure that i hate him well i am not the first girl who had been an unanswerable riddle to herself  is there any other motive for your departure i asked  what other motive can there be he replied i put what i had to say to him in plainer words still tell me philip are you beginning to wish that you were a free man again  he still prevaricated was this because he is afraid of me or because he is not quite brute enough to insult me to my face i tried again for the third and last time i almost put the words into his mouth  i fancy you have been out of temper lately i said you have not been your own kinder and better self is this the right interpretation of the change that i think i see in you  he answered i have not been very well lately  and that is all  yesthat is all  there was no more to be said i turned away to leave the room he followed me to the door after a momentary hesitation he made the attempt to kiss me i only looked at himhe drew back from me in silence i left the new judas standing alone while the shades of evening began to gather over the room    third period continued  events in the family related by miss jillgall    chapter lviii danger  if anything of importance happens i trust to you to write an account of it and to send the writing to me i will come to you at once if i see reason to believe that my presence is required those lines in your last kind reply to me rouse my courage dear mr governor and sharpen the vigilance which has always been one of the strong points in my character every suspicious circumstance which occurs in this house will be so to speak seized on by my pen and will find itself so to speak again placed on its trial before your unerring judgment let the wicked tremble i mention no names  taking up my narrative where it came to an end when i last wrote i have to say a word first on the subject of my discoveries in regard to philips movements  the advertisement of a private inquiry office which i read in a newspaper put the thing into my head i provided myself with money to pay the expenses byi blush while i write itpawning my watch this humiliation of my poor self has been rewarded by success skilled investigation has proved that our young man has come to his senses again exactly as i supposed on each occasion when he was suspiciously absent from the house he has been followed to the farm i have been staying there myself for a day or two in the hope of persuading eunice to relent the hope has not yet been realized but philips devotion assisted by my influence will yet prevail let me not despair  whether helena knows positively that she has lost her wicked hold on philip i cannot say it seems hardly possible that she could have made the discovery just yet the one thing of which i am certain is that she looks like a fiend  philip has wisely taken my advice and employed pious fraud he will get away from the wretch who has tempted him once and may tempt him again under pretense of using the interest of his friends in london to find a place under government he has not been very well for the last day or two and the execution of our project is in consequence delayed  i have news of mrs tenbruggen which will i think surprise you  she has kept away from us in a most unaccountable manner i called on her at the hotel and heard she was engaged with her lawyer on the next day she suddenly returned to her old habits and paid the customary visit i observed a similar alteration in her state of feeling she is now coldly civil to helena and she asks after eunice with a maternal interest touching to seei said to her elizabeth you appear to have changed your opinion of the two girls since i saw you she answered with a delightful candor which reminded me of old times completely i said a woman of your intellectual caliber dear doesnt change her mind without a good reason for it elizabeth cordially agreed with me i ventured to be a little more explicit you have no doubt made some interesting discovery elizabeth agreed again and i ventured again i suppose i may not ask what the discovery is no selina you may not ask  this is curious but it is nothing to what i have got to tell you next just as i was longing to take her to my bosom again as my friend and confidante elizabeth has disappeared and alas alas there is a reason for it which no sympathetic person can dispute  i have just received some overwhelming news in the form of a neat parcel addressed to myself  there has been a scandal at the hotel that monster in human form elizabeths husband is aware of his wifes professional fame has heard of the large sums of money which she earns as the greatest living professor of massage has been long on the lookout for her and has discovered her at last he has not only forced his way into her sittingroom at the hotel he insists on her living with him again her money being the attraction it is needless to say if she refuses he threatens her with the law the barbarous law which to use his own coarse expression will restore his conjugal rights  all this i gather from the narrative of my unhappy friend which forms one of the two inclosures in her parcel she has already made her escape ha the man doesnt live who can circumvent elizabeth the english court of law isnt built which can catch her when she roams the free and glorious continent  the vastness of this amazing womans mind is what i must pause to admire in the frightful catastrophe that has befallen her she can still think of philip and euneece she is eager to hear of their marriage and renounces helena with her whole heart i too was deceived by that cunning young woman she writes beware of her selina unless i am much mistaken she is going to end badly take care of philip take care of euneece if you want help apply at once to my favorite hero in real life the governor i dont presume to correct elizabeths language i should have called you the idol of the women  the second inclosure contains as i suppose a wedding present it is carefully sealedit feels no bigger than an ordinary letterand it contains an inscription which your highlycultivated intelligence may be able to explain i copy it as follows  to be inclosed in another envelope addressed to mr dunboyne the elder at percys private hotel london and delivered by a trustworthy messenger on the day when mr philip dunboyne is married to miss eunice gracedieu placed meanwhile under the care of miss selina jillgall  why is this mysterious letter to be sent to philips father i wonder whether that circumstance will puzzle you as it has puzzled me  i have kept my report back so as to send you the last news relating to philips state of health to my great regret his illness seems to have made a serious advance since yesterday when i ask if he is in pain he says it isnt exactly pain i feel as if i was sinking sometimes i am giddy and sometimes i find myself feeling thirsty and sick i have no opportunity of looking after him as i could wish for helena insists on nursing him assisted by the housemaid maria is a very good girl in her way but too stupid to be of much use if he is not better tomorrow i shall insist on sending for the doctor   he is no better and he wishes to have medical help helena doesnt seem to understand his illness it was not until philip had insisted on seeing him that she consented to send for the doctor  you had some talk with this experienced physician when you were here and you know what a clever man he is when i tell you that he hesitates to say what is the matter with philip you will feel as much alarmed as i do i will wait to send this to the post until i can write in a more definite way   two days more have passed the doctor has put two very strange questions to me  he asked first if there was anybody staying with us besides the regular members of the household i said we had no visitor he wanted to know next if mr philip dunboyne had made any enemies since he has been living in our town i said none that i knew ofand i took the liberty of asking what he meant he answered to this that he has a few more inquiries to make and that he will tell me what he means tomorrow   for gods sake come here as soon as you possibly can the whole burden is thrown on meand i am quite unequal to it  i received the doctor today in the drawingroom to my amazement he begged leave to speak with me in the garden when i asked why he answered i dont want to have a listener at the door come out on the lawn where we can be sure that we are alone  when we were in the garden he noticed that i was trembling  rouse your courage miss jillgall he said in the ministers helpless state there is nobody whom i can speak to but yourself  i ventured to remind him that he might speak to helena as well as to myself  he looked as black as thunder when i mentioned her name all he said was no but oh if you had heard his voiceand he so gentle and sweettempered at other timesyou would have felt as i did that he had helena in his mind  now listen to this he went on everything that my art can do for mr philip dunboyne while i am at his bedside is undone while i am away by some other person he is worse today than i have seen him yet  oh sir do you think he will die  he will certainly die unless the right means are taken to save him and taken at once it is my duty not to flinch from telling you the truth i have made a discovery since yesterday which satisfies me that i am right somebody is trying to poison mr dunboyne and somebody will succeed unless he is removed from this house  i am a poor feeble creature the doctor caught me or i should have dropped on the grass it was not a faintingfit i only shook and shivered so that i was too weak to stand up encouraged by the doctor i recovered sufficiently to be able to ask him where philip was to be taken to he said to the hospital no poisoner can follow my patient there persuade him to let me take him away when i call again in an hours time  as soon as i could hold a pen i sent a telegram to you pray pray come by the earliest train i also telegraphed to old mr dunboyne at the hotel in london  it was impossible for me to face helena i own i was afraid the cook kindly went upstairs to see who was in philips room it was the housemaids turn to look after him for a while i went instantly to his bedside  there was no persuading him to allow himself to be taken to the hospital i am dying he said if you have any pity for me send for euneece let me see her once more let me hear her say that she forgives me before i die  i hesitated it was too terrible to think of euneece in the same house with her sister her life might be in danger philip gave me a look a dreadful ghastly look if you refuse he said wildly the grave wont hold me ill haunt you for the rest of your life  she shall hear that you are ill i answeredand ran out of the room before he could speak again  what i had promised to write i did write but placed between euneeces danger and philips danger my heart was all for euneece would helena spare her if she came to philips bedside in such terror as i never felt before in my life i added a word more entreating her not to leave the farm i promised to keep her regularly informed on the subject of philips illness and i mentioned that i expected the governor to return to us immediately do nothing i wrote without his advice my letter having been completed i sent the cook away with it in a chaise she belonged to the neighborhood and she knew the farmhouse well nearly two hours afterward i heard the chaise stop at the door and ran out impatient to hear how my sweet girl had received my letter god help us all when i opened the door the first person whom i saw was euneece herself    chapter lix defense  one surprise followed another after i had encountered euneece at the door  when my fondness had excused her for setting the wellmeant advice in my letter at defiance i was conscious of expecting to see her in tears eager distressingly eager to hear what hope there might be of philips recovery i saw no tears i heard no inquiries she was pale and quiet and silent not a word fell from her when we met not a word when she kissed me not a word when she led the way into the nearest roomthe diningroom it was only when we were shut in together that she spoke  which is philips room she asked  instead of wanting to know how he was she desired to know where he was i pointed toward the back diningroom which had been made into a bedroom for philip he had chosen it himself when he first came to stay with us because the window opened into the garden and he could slip out and smoke at any hour of the day or night when he pleased  who is with him now was the next strange thing this sadlychanged girl said to me  maria is taking her turn i answered she assists in nursing philip  where is euneece got no further than that her breath quickened her color faded away i had seen people look as she was looking now when they suffered under some sudden pain before i could offer to help her she rallied and went on where she began again is the other nurse  you mean helena i said  i mean the poisoner  when i remind you dear mr governor that my letter had carefully concealed from her the horrible discovery made by the doctor your imagination will picture my state of mind she saw that i was overpowered her sweet nature so strangely frozen up thus far melted at last you dont know what i have heard she said you dont know what thoughts have been roused in me she left her chair and sat on my knee with the familiarity of the dear old times and took the letter that i had written to her from her pocket  look at it yourself she said and tell me if anybody could read it and not see that you were concealing something my dear i have driven round by the doctors housei have seen himi have persuaded him or perhaps i ought to say surprised him into telling me the truth but the kind old man is obstinate he wouldnt believe me when i told him i was on my way here to save philips life he said my child you will only put your own life in jeopardy if i had not seen that danger i should never have told you of the dreadful state of things at home go back to the good people at the farm and leave the saving of philip to me  he was right euneece entirely right  no dear he was wrong i begged him to come here and judge for himself and i ask you to do the same  i was obstinate go back i persisted go back to the farm  can i see philip she asked  i have heard some insolent men say that women are like cats if they mean that we do figuratively speaking scratch at times i am afraid they are not altogether wrong an irresistible impulse made me say to poor euneece this is a change indeed since you refused to receive philip  is there no change in the circumstances she asked sadly isnt he ill and in danger  i begged her to forgive me i said i meant no harm  i gave him up to my sister she continued when i believed that his happiness depended not on me but on her i take him back to myself when he is at the mercy of a demon who threatens his life come selina let us go to philip  she put her arm round me and made me get up from my chair i was so easily persuaded by her that the fear of what helenas jealousy and helenas anger might do was scarcely present in my thoughts the door of communication was locked on the side of the bedchamber i went into the hall to enter philips room by the other door she followed waiting behind me i heard what passed between them when maria went out to her  where is miss gracedieu  resting upstairs miss in her room  look at the clock and tell me when you expect her to come down here  i am to call her miss in ten minutes more  wait in the diningroom maria till i come back to you  she joined me i held the door open for her to go into philips room it was not out of curiosity the feeling that urged me was sympathy when i waited a moment to see their first meeting she bent over the poor pallid trembling suffering man and raised him in her arms and laid his head on her bosom my philip she murmured those words in a kiss i closed the door i had a good cry and oh how it comforted me  there was only a minute to spare when she came out of the room maria was waiting for her euneece said as quietly as ever go and call miss gracedieu  the girl looked at her and sawi dont know what maria became alarmed but she went up the stairs and returned in haste to tell us that her young mistress was coming down  the faint rustling of helenas dress as she left her room reached us in the silence i remained at the open door of the diningroom and maria approached and stood near me we were both frightened euneece stepped forward and stood on the mat at the foot of the stairs waiting her back was toward me i could only see that she was as still as a statue the rustling of the dress came nearer oh heavens what was going to happen my teeth chattered in my head i held by marias shoulder drops of perspiration showed themselves on the girls forehead she stared in vacant terror at the slim little figure posted firm and still on the mat  helena turned the corner of the stairs and waited a moment on the last landing and saw her sister  you here she said what do you want  there was no reply helena descended until she reached the last stair but one there she stopped her staring eyes grew large and wild her hand shook as she stretched it out feeling for the banister she staggered as she caught at it and held herself up the silence was still unbroken something in me stronger than myself drew my steps along the hall nearer and nearer to the stair till i could see the face which had struck that murderous wretch with terror  i looked  no it was not my sweet girl it was a horrid transformation of her i saw a fearful creature with glittering eyes that threatened some unimaginable vengeance her lips were drawn back they showed her clinched teeth a burning red flush dyed her face the hair of her head rose little by little slowly and most dreadful sight of all she seemed in the stillness of the house to be listening to something if i could have moved i should have fled to the first place of refuge i could find if i could have raised my voice i should have cried for help i could do neither the one nor the other i could only look look look held by the horror of it with a hand of iron  helena must have roused her courage and resisted her terror i heard her speak  let me by  no  slowly steadily in a whisper euneece made that reply  helena tried once morestill fighting against her own terror i knew it by the trembling of her voice  let me by she repeated i am on my way to philips room  you will never enter philips room again  who will stop me  i will  she had spoken in the same steady whisper throughoutbut now she moved i saw her set her foot on the first stair i saw the horrid glitter in her eyes flash close into helenas face i heard her say  poisoner go back to your room  silent and shuddering helena shrank away from herdaunted by her glittering eyes mastered by her lifted hand pointing up the stairs  helena slowly ascended till she reached the landing she turned and looked down she tried to speak the pointing hand struck her dumb and drove her up the next flight of stairs she was lost to view only the small rustling sound of the dress was to be heard growing fainter and fainter then an interval of stillness then the noise of a door opened and closed again then no sound morebut a change to be seen the transformed creature was crouching on her knees still and silent her face covered by her hands i was afraid to approach her i was afraid to speak to her after a time she rose suddenly swiftly with her head turned away from me she opened the door of philips roomand was gone  i looked round there was only maria in the lonely hall shall i try to tell you what my sensations were it may sound strangely but it is truei felt like a sleeper who has halfawakened from a dream    chapter lx discovery  a little later on that eventful day when i was most in need of all that your wisdom and kindness could do to guide me came the telegram which announced that you were helpless under an attack of gout as soon as i had in some degree got over my disappointment i remembered having told euneece in my letter that i expected her kind old friend to come to us with the telegram in my hand i knocked softly at philips door  the voice that bade me come in was the gentle voice that i knew so well philip was sleeping there by his bedside with his hand resting in her hand was euneece so completely restored to her own sweet self that i could hardly believe what i had seen not an hour since she talked of you when i showed her your message with affectionate interest and regret look back my admirable friend at what i have written on the two or three pages which precede this and explain the astounding contrast if you can  i was left alone to watch by philip while euneece went away to see her father soon afterward maria took my place i had been sent for to the next room to receive the doctor  he looked careworn and grieved i said i was afraid he had brought bad news with him  the worst possible news he answered a terrible exposure threatens this family and i am powerless to prevent it  he then asked me to remember the day when i had been surprised by the singular questions which he had put to me and when he had engaged to explain himself after he had made some inquiries why and how he had set those inquiries on foot was what he had now to tell i will repeat what he said in his own words as nearly as i can remember them while he was in attendance on philip he had observed symptoms which made him suspect that digitalis had been given to the young man in doses often repeated cases of attempted poisoning by this medicine were so rare that he felt bound to put his suspicions to the test by going round among the chemistss shopsexcepting of course the shop at which his own prescriptions were made upand asking if they had lately dispensed any preparation of digitalis ordered perhaps in a larger quantity than usual at the second shop he visited the chemist laughed why doctor he said have you forgotten your own prescription after this the prescription was asked for and produced it was on the paper used by the doctorpaper which had his address printed at the top and a notice added telling patients who came to consult him for the second time to bring their prescriptions with them then there followed in writing tincture of digitalis one ouncewith his signature at the end not badly imitated but a forgery nevertheless the chemist noticed the effect which this discovery had produced on the doctor and asked if that was his signature he could hardly as an honest man have asserted that a forgery was a signature of his own writing so he made the true reply and asked who had presented the prescription the chemist called to his assistant to come forward did you tell me that you knew by sight the young lady who brought this prescription the assistant admitted it did you tell me she was miss helena gracedieu i did are you sure of not having made any mistake quite sure the chemist then said i myself supplied the tincture of digitalis and the young lady paid for it and took it away with her you have had all the information that i can give you sir and i may now ask if you can throw any light on the matter our good friend thought of the poor minister so sorely afflicted and of the famous name so sincerely respected in the town and in the country round and said he could not undertake to give an immediate answer the chemist was excessively angry you know as well as i do he said that digitalis given in certain doses is a poison and you cannot deny that i honestly believed myself to be dispensing your prescription while you are hesitating to give me an answer my character may suffer i may be suspected myself he ended in declaring he should consult his lawyer the doctor went home and questioned his servant the man remembered the day of miss helenas visit in the afternoon and the intention that she expressed of waiting for his masters return he had shown her into the parlor which opened into the consultingroom no other visitor was in the house at that time or had arrived during the rest of the day the doctors own experience when he got home led him to conclude that helena had gone into the consultingroom he had entered that room for the purpose of writing some prescriptions and had found the leaves of paper that he used diminished in number after what he had heard and what he had discovered to say nothing of what he suspected it occurred to him to look along the shelves of his medical library he found a volume treating of poisons with a slip of paper left between the leaves the poison described at the place so marked being digitalis and the paper used being one of his own prescriptionpapers if as i fear a legal investigation into helenas conduct is a possible event the doctor concluded there is the evidence that i shall be obliged to give when i am called as a witness  it is my belief that i could have felt no greater dismay if the long arm of the law had laid its hold on me while he was speaking i asked what was to be done  if she leaves the house at once the doctor replied she may escape the infamy of being charged with an attempt at murder by poison and in her absence i can answer for philips life i dont urge you to warn her because that might be a dangerous thing to do it is for you to decide as a member of the family whether you will run the risk  i tried to speak to him of euneece and to tell him what i had already related to yourself he was in no humor to listen to me keep it for a fitter time he answered and think of what i have just said to you with that he left me on his way to philips room  mental exertion was completely beyond me can you understand a poor middleaged spinster being frightened into doing a dangerous thing that may seem to be nonsense but if you ask why i took a morsel of paper and wrote the warning which i was afraid to communicate by word of mouthwhy i went upstairs with my knees knocking together and opened the door of helenas room just wide enough to let my hand pass throughwhy i threw the paper in and banged the door to again and ran downstairs as i have never run since i was a little girli can only say in the way of explanation what i have said already i was frightened into doing it  what i have written thus far i shall send to you by tonights post  the doctor came back to me after he had seen philip and spoken with euneece he was very angry and i must own not without reason philip had flatly refused to let himself be removed to the hospital and euneecea mere girlhad declared that she would be answerable for consequences the doctor warned me that he meant to withdraw from the case and to make his declaration before the magistrates at my entreaties he consented to return in the evening and to judge by results before taking the terrible step that he had threatened  while i remained at home on the watch keeping the doors of both rooms locked eunice went out to get philips medicine she came back followed by a boy carrying a portable apparatus for cooking all that philip wants and all that we want she explained we can provide for ourselves give me a morsel of paper to write on  unhooking the little pencil attached to her watchchain she paused and looked toward the door somebody listening she whispered let them listen she wrote a list of necessaries in the way of things to eat and things to drink and asked me to go out and get them myself i dont doubt the servants she said speaking distinctly enough to be heard outside but i am afraid of what a poisoners cunning and a poisoners desperation may do in a kitchen which is open to her i went away on my erranddiscovering no listener outside i need hardly say on my return i found the door of communication with philips room closed but no longer locked we can now attend on him in turn she said without opening either of the doors which lead into the hall at night we can relieve each other and each of us can get sleep as we want it in the large armchair in the diningroom philip must be safe under our charge or the doctor will insist on taking him to the hospital when we want marias help from time to time we can employ her under our own superintendence have you anything else selina to suggest  there was nothing left to suggest young and inexperienced as she was how i asked had she contrived to think of all this she answered simply im sure i dont know my thoughts came to me while i was looking at philip  soon afterward i found an opportunity of inquiring if helena had left the house she had just rung her bell and maria had found her quietly reading in her room hours afterward when i was on the watch at night i heard philips door softly tried from the outside her dreadful purpose had not been given up even yet  the doctor came in the evening as he had promised and found an improvement in philips health i mentioned what precautions we had taken and that they had been devised by euneece are you going to withdraw from the case i asked i am coming back to the case he answered tomorrow morning  it had been a disappointment to me to receive no answer to the telegram which i had sent to mr dunboyne the elder the next days post brought the explanation in a letter to philip from his father directed to him at the hotel here this showed that my telegram giving my address at this house had not been received mr dunboyne announced that he had returned to ireland finding the air of london unendurable after the seabreezes at home if philip had already married his father would leave him to a life of genteel poverty with helena gracedieu if he had thought better of it his welcome was waiting for him  little did mr dunboyne know what changes had taken place since he and his son had last met and what hope might yet present itself of brighter days for poor euneece i thought of writing to him but how would that crabbed old man receive a confidential letter from a lady who was a stranger  my doubts were set at rest by philip himself he asked me to write a few lines of reply to his father declaring that his marriage with helena was broken offthat he had not given up all hope of being permitted to offer the sincere expression of his penitence to euneeceand that he would gladly claim his welcome as soon as he was well enough to undertake the journey to ireland when he had signed the letter i was so pleased that i made a smart remark i said this is a treaty of peace between father and son  when the doctor arrived in the morning and found the change for the better in his patient confirmed he did justice to us at last he spoke kindly and even gratefully to euneece no more allusions to the hospital as a place of safety escaped him he asked me cautiously for news of helena i could only tell him that she had gone out at her customary time and had returned at her customary time he did not attempt to conceal that my reply had made him uneasy  are you still afraid that she may succeed in poisoning philip i asked  i am afraid of her cunning he said if she is charged with attempting to poison young dunboyne she has some system of defense you may rely on it for which we are not prepared there in my opinion is the true reason for her extraordinary insensibility to her own danger  two more days passed and we were still safe under the protection of lock and key  on the evening of the second day which was a monday maria came to me in great tribulation on inquiring what was the matter i received a disquieting reply miss helena is tempting me she is so miserable at being prevented from seeing mr philip and helping to nurse him that it is quite distressing to see her at the same time miss its hard on a poor servant she asks me to take the key secretly out of the door and lend it to her at night for a few minutes only im really afraid i shall be led into doing it if she goes on persuading me much longer  i commended maria for feeling scruples which proved her to be the best of good girls and promised to relieve her from all fear of future temptation this was easily done euneece kept the key of philips door in her pocket and i kept the key of the diningroom door in mine    chapter lxi atrocity  on the next day a tuesday in the week an event took place which euneece and i viewed with distrust early in the afternoon a young man called with a note for helena it was to be given to her immediately and no answer was required  maria had just closed the house door and was on her way upstairs with the letter when she was called back by another ring at the bell our visitor was the doctor he spoke to maria in the hall  i think i see a note in your hand was it given to you by the young man who has just left the house  yes sir  if hes your sweetheart my dear i have nothing more to say  good gracious doctor how you do talk i never saw the young man before in my life  in that case maria i will ask you to let me look at the address aha mischief  the moment i heard that i threw open the diningroom door curiosity is not easily satisfied when it hears it wants to see when it sees it wants to know every lady will agree with me in this observation  pray come in i said  one minute miss jillgall my girl when you give miss helena that note try to get a sly look at her when she opens it and come and tell me what you have seen he joined me in the diningroom and closed the door the other day he went on when i told you what i had discovered in the chemists shop i think i mentioned a young man who was called to speak to a question of identityan assistant who knew miss helena gracedieu by sight  yes yes  that young man left the note which maria has just taken upstairs  who wrote it doctor and what does it say  questions naturally asked miss jillgalland not easily answered where is eunice her quick wit might help us  she had gone out to buy some fruit and flowers for philip  the doctor accepted his disappointment resignedly let us try what we can do without her he said that young mans master has been in consultation you may remember why with his lawyer and helena may be threatened by an investigation before the magistrates if this wild guess of mine turns out to have hit the mark the poisoner upstairs has got a warning  i asked if the chemist had written the note foolish enough of me when i came to think of it the chemist would scarcely act a friendly part toward helena when she was answerable for the awkward position in which he had placed himself perhaps the young man who had left the warning was also the writer of the warning the doctor reminded me that he was all but a stranger to helena we are not usually interested he remarked in a person whom we only know by sight  remember that he is a young man i ventured to say this was a strong hint but the doctor failed to see it he had evidently forgotten his own youth i made another attempt  and vile as helena is i continued we cannot deny that this disgrace to her sex is a handsome young lady  he saw it at last womans wit he cried you have hit it miss jillgall the young fool is smitten with her and has given her a chance of making her escape  do you think she will take the chance  for all our sakes i pray god she may but i dont feel sure about it  why  recollect what you and eunice have done you have shown your suspicion of her without an attempt to conceal it if you had put her in prison you could not have more completely defeated her infernal design do you think she is a likely person to submit to that without an effort to be even with you  just as he said those terrifying words maria came back to us he asked at once what had kept her so long upstairs  the girl had evidently something to say which had inflated her if i may use such an expression with a sense of her own importance  please to let me tell it sir she answered in my own way miss helena turned as pale as ashes when she opened the letter and then she took a turn in the room and then she looked at me with a smilewell miss i can only say that i felt that smile in the small of my back i tried to get to the door she stopped me she says wheres miss eunice i says gone out she says is there anybody in the drawingroom i says no miss she says tell miss jillgall i want to speak to her and say i am waiting in the drawingroom its every word of it true and if a poor servant may give an opinion i dont like the look of it  the doctor dismissed maria whatever it is he said to me you must go and hear it  i am not a courageous woman i expressed myself as being willing to go to her if the doctor went with me he said that was impossible she would probably refuse to speak before any witness and certainly before him but he promised to look after philip in my absence and to wait below if it really so happened that i wanted him i need only ring the bell and he would come to me the moment he heard it such kindness as this roused my courage i suppose at any rate i went upstairs  she was standing by the fireplace with her elbow on the chimneypiece and her head resting on her hand i stopped just inside the door waiting to hear what she had to say in this position her sideface only was presented to me it was a ghastly face the eye that i could see turned wickedly on me when i came inthen turned away again otherwise she never moved i confess i trembled but i did my best to disguise it  she broke out suddenly with what she had to say i wont allow this state of things to go on any longer my horror of an exposure which will disgrace the family has kept me silent wrongly silent so far philips life is in danger i am forgetting my duty to my affianced husband if i allow myself to be kept away from him any longer open those locked doors and relieve me from the sight of you open the doors i say or you will both of youyou the accomplice she the wretch who directs yourepent it to the end of your lives  in my own mind i asked myself if she had gone mad but i only answered i dont understand you  she said again you are eunices accomplice  accomplice in what i asked  she turned her head slowly and faced me i shrank from looking at her  all the circumstances prove it she went on i have supplanted eunice in philips affection she was once engaged to marry him i am engaged to marry him now she is resolved that he shall never make me his wife he will die if i delay any longer he will die if i dont crush her like the reptile she is she comes hereand what does she do keeps him prisoner under her own superintendence who gets his medicine she gets it who cooks his food she cooks it the doors are locked i might be a witness of what goes on and i am kept out the servants who ought to wait on him are kept out she can do what she likes with his medicine she can do what she likes with his food she is infuriated with him for deserting her and promising to marry me give him back to my care or dreadful as it is to denounce my own sister i shall claim protection from the magistrates  i lost all fear of her i stepped close up to the place at which she was standing i cried out of what in gods name do you accuse your sister  she answered i accuse her of poisoning philip dunboyne  i ran out of the room i rushed headlong down the stairs the doctor heard me and came running into the hall i caught hold of him like a madwoman euneece my breath was gone i could only say euneece  he dragged me into the diningroom there was wine on the sideboard which he had ordered medically for philip he forced me to drink some of it it ran through me like fire it helped me to speak now tell me he said what has she done to eunice  she brings a horrible accusation against her i answered  what is the accusation i told him  he looked me through and through take care he said no hysterics no exaggeration you may lead to dreadful consequences if you are not sure of yourself if its really true say it again i said it againquietly this time  his face startled me it was white with rage he snatched his hat off the hall table  what are you going to do i asked  my duty he was out of the house before i could speak to him again    third period concluded  troubles and triumphs of the family related by the governor    chapter lxii the sentence pronounced  martyrs to gout know by sad experience that they suffer under one of the most capricious of maladies an attack of this disease will shift in the most unaccountable manner from one part of the body to another or it will release the victim when there is every reason to fear that it is about to strengthen its hold on him or having shown the fairest promise of submitting to medical treatment it will cruelly lay the patient prostrate again in a state of relapse adverse fortune in my case subjected me to this last and worst trial of endurance two months passedmonths of pain aggravated by anxietybefore i was able to help eunice and miss jillgall personally with my sympathy and advice  during this interval i heard regularly from the friendly and faithful selina  terror and suspense courageously endured day after day seem to have broken down her resistance poor soul when eunices good name and eunices tranquillity were threatened by the most infamous of false accusations from that time miss jillgalls method of expressing herself betrayed a gradual deterioration i shall avoid presenting at a disadvantage a correspondent who has claims on my gratitude if i give the substance only of what she wroteassisted by the newspaper which she sent to me while the legal proceedings were in progress   honest indignation does sometimes counsel us wisely when the doctor left miss jillgall in anger and in haste he had determined on taking the course from which as a humane man and a faithful friend he had hitherto recoiled it was no time now to shrink from the prospect of an exposure the one hope of successfully encountering the vindictive wickedness of helena lay in the resolution to be beforehand with her in the appeal to the magistrates with which she had threatened eunice and miss jillgall the doctors sworn information stated the whole terrible case of the poisoning ranging from his first suspicions and their confirmation to helenas atrocious attempt to accuse her innocent sister of her own guilt so firmly were the magistrates convinced of the serious nature of the case thus stated that they did not hesitate to issue their warrant among the witnesses whose attendance was immediately secured by the legal adviser to whom the doctor applied were the farmer and his wife  helena was arrested while she was dressing to go out her composure was not for a moment disturbed i was on my way she said coolly to make a statement before the justices the sooner they hear what i have to say the better  the attempt of this shameless wretch to turn the tables on poor eunicesuggested as i afterward discovered by the record of family history which she had quoted in her journalwas defeated with ease the farmer and his wife proved the date at which eunice had left her place of residence under their roof the doctors evidence followed he proved by the production of his professional diary that the discovery of the attempt to poison his patient had taken place before the day of eunices departure from the farm and that the first improvement in mr philip dunboynes state of health had shown itself after that young ladys arrival to perform the duties of a nurse to the wise precautions which she had takenperverted by helena to the purpose of a false accusationthe doctor attributed the preservation of the young mans life  having produced the worst possible impression on the minds of the magistrates helena was remanded her legal adviser had predicted this result but the vindictive obstinacy of his client had set both experience and remonstrance at defiance  at the renewed examination the line of defense adopted by the prisoners lawyer proved to bemistaken identity  it was asserted that she had never entered the chemists shop also that the assistant had wrongly identified some other lady as miss helena gracedieu also that there was not an atom of evidence to connect her with the stealing of the doctors prescriptionpaper and the forgery of his writing other assertions to the same purpose followed on which it is needless to dwell the case for the prosecution was happily in competent hands with the exception of one witness crossexamination afforded no material help to the evidence for the defense  the chemist swore positively to the personal appearance of helena as being the personal appearance of the lady who had presented the prescription his assistant pressed on the question of identity broke down under crossexaminationpurposely as it was whispered serving the interests of the prisoner but the victory so far gained by the defense was successfully contested by the statement of the next witness a respectable tradesman in the town he had seen the newspaper report of the first examination and had volunteered to present himself as a witness a member of mr gracedieus congregation his pew in the chapel was so situated as to give him a view of the ministers daughters occupying their pew he had seen the prisoner on every sunday for years past and he swore that he was passing the door of the chemists shop at the moment when she stepped out into the street having a bottle covered with the customary white paper in her hand the doctor and his servant were the next witnesses called they were severely crossexamined some of their statementsquestioned technically with successreceived unexpected and powerful support due to the discovery and production of the prisoners diary the entries guardedly as some of them were written revealed her motive for attempting to poison philip dunboyne proved that she had purposely called on the doctor when she knew that he would be out that she had entered the consultingroom and examined the medical books had found to use her own written words a volume that interested her and had used the prescriptionpapers for the purpose of making notes the notes themselves were not to be found they had doubtless been destroyed enough and more than enough remained to make the case for the prosecution complete the magistrates committed helena gracedieu for trial at the next assizes  i arrived in the town as well as i can remember about a week after the trial had taken place  found guilty the prisoner had been recommended to mercy by the jurypartly in consideration of her youth partly as an expression of sympathy and respect for her unhappy father the judge a father himself passed a lenient sentence she was condemned to imprisonment for two years the careful matron of the jail had provided herself with a bottle of smellingsalts in the fear that there might be need for it when helena heard her sentence pronounced not the slightest sign of agitation appeared in her face or her manner she lied to the last asserting her innocence in a firm voice and returning from the dock to the prison without requiring assistance from anybody  relating these particulars to me in a state of ungovernable excitement good miss jillgall ended with a little confession of her own which operated as a relief to my overburdened mind after what i had just heard  i wouldnt own it she said to anybody but a dear friend one thing in the dreadful disgrace that has fallen on us i am quite at a loss to account for think of mr gracedieus daughter being one of those criminal creatures on whom it was once your terrible duty to turn the key why didnt she commit suicide  my dear lady no thoroughly wicked creature ever yet committed suicide selfdestruction when it is not an act of madness implies some acuteness of feelingsensibility to remorse or to shame or perhaps a distorted idea of making atonement there is no such thing as remorse or shame or hope of making atonement in helenas nature  but when she comes out of prison what will she do  dont alarm yourself my good friend she will do very well  oh hush hush poetical justice mr governor  poetical fiddlesticks miss jillgall    chapter lxiii the obstacle removed  when the subject of the trial was happily dismissed my first inquiry related to eunice the reply was made with an ominous accompaniment of sighs and sad looks eunice had gone back to her duties as governess at the farm hearing this i asked naturally what had become of philip  melancholy news again was the news that i now heard  mr dunboyne the elder had died suddenly at his house in ireland while philip was on his way home when the funeral ceremony had come to an end the will was read it had been made only a few days before the testators death and the clause which left all his property to his son was preceded by expressions of paternal affection at a time when philip was in sore need of consolation after alluding to a letter received from his son the old man added i always loved him without caring to confess it i detest scenes of sentiment kissings embracings tears and that sort of thing but philip has yielded to my wishes and has broken off a marriage which would have made him as well as me wretched for life after this i may speak my mind from my grave and may tell my boy that i loved him if the wish is likely to be of any use i will add on the chancegod bless him  does philip submit to separation from eunice i asked does he stay in ireland  not he poor fellow he will be here tomorrow or next day when i last wrote miss jillgall continued i told him i hoped to see you again soon if you cant help us i mean with eunice that unlucky young man will do some desperate thing he will join those madmen at large who disturb poor savages in africa or go nowhere to find nothing in the arctic regions  whatever i can do miss jillgall shall be gladly done is it really possible that eunice refuses to marry him after having saved his life  a little patience please mr governor let philip tell his own story if i try to do it i shall only cryand we have had tears enough lately in this house  further consultation being thus deferred i went upstairs to the ministers room  he was sitting by the window in his favorite armchair absorbed in knitting the person who attended on him a goodnatured patient fellow had been a sailor in his younger days and had taught mr gracedieu how to use the needles you see it amuses him the man said kindly dont notice his mistakes he thinks there isnt such another in the world for knitting as himself you can see sir how he sticks to it he was so absorbed over his employment that i had to speak to him twice before i could induce him to look at me the utter ruin of his intellect did not appear to have exercised any disastrous influence over his bodily health on the contrary he had grown fatter since i had last seen him his complexion had lost the pallor that i rememberedthere was color in his cheeks  dont you remember your old friend i said he smiled and nodded and repeated the words  yes yes my old friend it was only too plain that he had not the least recollection of me his memory is gone the man said when he puts away his knitting at night i have to find it for him in the morning but there hes happyenjoys his victuals likes sitting out in the garden and watching the birds theres been a deal of trouble in the family sir and it has all passed over him like a wet sponge over a slate the old sailor was right if that wreck of a man had been capable of feeling and thinking his daughters disgrace would have broken his heart in a world of sin and sorrow is peaceable imbecility always to be pitied i have known men who would have answered without hesitation it is to be envied and where some persons might say was the poor ministers reward for the act of mercy which had saved eunice in her infancy where it ought to be a man who worthily performs a good action finds his reward in the action itself   at breakfast on the next day the talk touched on those passages in helenas diary which had been produced in court as evidence against her  i expressed a wish to see what revelation of a depraved nature the entries in the diary might present and my curiosity was gratified at a fitter time i may find an opportunity of alluding to the impression produced on me by the diary in the meanwhile the event of philips return claims notice in the first place  the poor fellow was so glad to see me that he shook hands as heartily as if we had known each other from the time when he was a boy  do you remember how kindly you spoke to me when i called on you in london he asked if i have repeated those words oncebut perhaps you dont remember them you said if i was as young as you are i should not despair well i have said that to myself over and over again for a hundred times at least eunice will listen to you sir when she will listen to nobody else this is the first happy moment i have had for weeks past  i suppose i must have looked glad to hear that anyway philip shook hands with me again  miss jillgall was present the gentlehearted old maid was so touched by our meeting that she abandoned herself to the genial impulse of the moment and gave philip a kiss the outraged claims of propriety instantly seized on her she blushed as if the longlost days of her girlhood had been found again and ran out of the room  now mr philip i said i have been waiting at miss jillgalls suggestion to get my information from you there is something wrong between eunice and yourself what is it and who is to blame  her vile sister is to blame he answered that reptile was determined to sting us and she has done it he cried starting to his feet and walking up and down the room urged into action by his own unendurable sense of wrong i say she has done it after eunice has saved medone it when eunice was ready to be my wife  how has she done it  between grief and indignation his reply was involved in a confusion of vehementlyspoken words which i shall not attempt to reproduce eunice had reminded him that her sister had been publicly convicted of an infamous crime and publicly punished for it by imprisonment if i consent to marry you she said i stain you with my disgrace that shall never be with this resolution she had left him i have tried to convince her philip said that she will not be associated with her sisters disgrace when she bears my name i have promised to take her far away from england among people who have never even heard of her sister miss jillgall has used her influence to help me all in vain there is no hope for us but in you i am not thinking selfishly only of myself she tries to conceal itbut oh she is brokenhearted ask the farmers wife if you dont believe me judge for yourself sir gofor gods sake go to the farm  i made him sit down and compose himself  you may depend on my going to the farm i answered i shall write to eunice today and follow my letter tomorrow he tried to thank me but i would not allow it before i consent to accept the expression of your gratitude i said i must know a little more of you than i know now this is only the second occasion on which we have met let us look back a little mr philip dunboyne you were eunices affianced husband and you broke faith with her that was a rascally action how do you defend it  his head sank i am ashamed to defend it he answered  i pressed him without mercy you own yourself i said that it was a rascally action  use stronger language against me even than that siri deserve it  in plain words i went on you can find no excuse for your conduct  in the past time he said i might have found excuses  but you cant find them now  i must not even look for them now  why not  i owe it to eunice to leave my conduct at its worst with nothing saidby meto defend it  what has eunice done to have such a claim on you as that  eunice has forgiven me  it was gratefully and delicately said ought i to have allowed this circumstance to weigh with me i ask in return had i never committed any faults as a fellowmortal and fellowsinner had i any right to harden my heart against an expression of penitence which i felt to be sincere in its motive  but i was bound to think of eunice i did think of her before i ventured to accept the positionthe critical position as i shall presently showof philips friend  after more than an hour of questions put without reserve and of answers given without prevarication i had traveled over the whole ground laid out by the narratives which appear in these pages and had arrived at my conclusionso far as philip dunboyne was concerned  i found him to be a man with nothing absolutely wicked in himbut with a nature so perilously weak in many respects that it might drift into wickedness unless a stronger nature was at hand to bold it back married to a wife without force of character the probabilities would point to him as likely to yield to examples which might make him a bad husband married to a wife with a will of her own and with true love to sustain hera wife who would know when to take the command and how to take the commanda wife who finding him tempted to commit actions unworthy of his better self would be farsighted enough to perceive that her husbands sense of honor might sometimes lose its balance without being on that account hopelessly depravedthen and in these cases only the probabilities would point to philip as a man likely to be the better and the happier for his situation when the bonds of wedlock had got him  but the serious question was not answered yet  could i feel justified in placing eunice in the position toward philip which i have just endeavored to describe i dared not allow my mind to dwell on the generosity which had so nobly pardoned him or on the force of character which had bravely endured the bitterest disappointment the cruelest humiliation the one consideration which i was bound to face was the sacred consideration of her happiness in her life to come  leaving philip with a few words of sympathy which might help him to bear his suspense i went to my room to think  the time passedand i could arrive at no positive conclusion either waywith or without philipthe contemplation of eunices future harassed me with doubt even if i had conquered my own indecision and had made up my mind to sanction the union of the two young people the difficulties that now beset me would not have been dispersed knowing what i alone knew i could certainly remove eunices one objection to the marriage in other words i had only to relate what had happened on the day when the chaplain brought the minister to the prison and the obstacle of their union would be removed but without considering philip it was simply out of the question to do this in mercy to eunice herself what was helenas disgrace compared with the infamy which stained the name of the poor girls mother the other alternative of telling her part of the truth only was before me if i could persuade myself to adopt it i failed to persuade myself my morbid anxiety for her welfare made me hesitate again human patience could endure no more rashness prevailed and prudence yieldedi left my decision to be influenced by the coming interview with eunice  the next day i drove to the farm philips entreaties persuaded me to let him be my companion on one conditionthat he waited in the carriage while i went into the house  i had carefully arranged my ideas and had decided on proceeding with the greatest caution before i ventured on saying the allimportant words which once spoken were not to be recalled the worst of those anxieties under which the delicate health of mr gracedieu had broken down was my anxiety now could i reconcile it to my conscience to permit a man innocent of all knowledge of the truth to marry the daughter of a condemned murderess without honestly telling him what he was about to do did i deserve to be pitied did i deserve to be blamedmy mind was still undecided when i entered the house  she ran to meet me as if she had been my daughter she kissed me as if she had been my daughter she fondly looked up at me as if she had been my daughter at the sight of that sweet young face so sorrowful and so patiently enduring sorrow all my doubts and hesitations everything artificial about me with which i had entered the room vanished in an instant  after she had thanked me for coming to see her i saw her tremble a little the uppermost interest in her heart was forcing its way outward to expression try as she might to keep it back have you seen philip she asked the tone in which she put that question decided mei was resolved to let her marry him impulse yes impulse asserting itself inexcusably in a man at the end of his life i ought to have known better than to have given way very likely but am i the only mortal who ought to have known betterand did not  when eunice asked if i had seen philip i owned that he was outside in the carriage before she could reproach me i went on with what i had to say my child i know what a sacrifice you have made and i should honor your scruples if you had any reason for feeling them  any reason for feeling them she turned pale as she repeated the words  an idea came to me i rang for the servant and sent her to the carriage to tell philip to come in my dear i am not putting you to any unfair trial i assured her i am going to prove that i love you as truly as if you were my own child  when they were both present i resolved that they should not suffer a moment of needless suspense standing between them i took eunices hand and laid my other hand on philips shoulder and spoke out plainly  i am here to make you both happy i said i can remove the only obstacle to your marriage and i mean to do it but i must insist on one condition give me your promise philip that you will ask for no explanations and that you will be satisfied with the one true statement which is all that i can offer to you  he gave me his promise without an instants hesitation  philip grants what i ask i said to eunice do you grant it too  her hand turned cold in mine but she spoke firmly when she said yes  i gave her into philips care it was his privilege to console and support her it was my duty to say the decisive words  rouse your courage dear eunice you are no more affected by helenas disgrace than i am you are not her sister her father is not your father her mother was not your mother i was present in the time of your infancy when mr gracedieus fatherly kindness received you as his adopted child this i declare to you both on my word of honor is the truth  how she bore it i am not able to say my foolish old eyes were filling with tears i could just see plainly enough to find my way to the door and leave them together  in my reckless state of mind i never asked myself if time would be my accomplice and keep the part of the secret which i had not revealedor be my enemy and betray me the chances either way were perhaps equal the deed was done    chapter lxiv the truth triumphant  the marriage was deferred at eunices request as an expression of respect to the memory of philips father  when the time of delay had passed it was arranged that the wedding ceremony should be heldafter due publication of bannsat the parish church of the london suburb in which my house was situated miss jillgall was bridesmaid and i gave away the bride before we set out for the church eunice asked leave to speak with me for a moment in private  dont think she said that i am forgetting my promise to be content with what you have told me about myself i am not so ungrateful as that but i do want before i consent to be philips wife to feel sure that i am not quite unworthy of him is it because i am of mean birth that you told me i was mr gracedieus adopted childand told me no more  i could honestly satisfy her so far certainly not i said  she put her arms round my neck do you say that she asked to make my mind easy or do you say it on your word of honor  on my word of honor  we arrived at the church let miss jillgall describe the marriage in her own inimitable way  no wedding breakfast when you dont want to eat it no wedding speeches when nobody wants to make them and nobody wants to hear them and no false sentiment shedding tears and reddening noses on the happiest day in the whole year a model marriage i could desire nothing better if i had any prospect of being a bride myself  they went away for their honeymoon to a quiet place by the seaside not very far from the town in which eunice had passed some of the happiest and the wretchedest days in her life she persisted in thinking it possible that mr gracedieu might recover the use of his faculties at the last and might wish to see her on his deathbed his adopted daughter she gently reminded me is his only daughter now the doctor shook his head when i told him what eunice had said to meand the sad truth must be told the doctor was right  miss jillgall returned on the weddingday to take care of the good man who had befriended her in her hour of need  before the end of the week i heard from her and was disagreeably reminded of an incident which we had both forgotten absorbed as we were in other and greater interests at the time  mrs tenbruggen had again appeared on the scene she had written to miss jillgall from paris to say that she had heard of old mr dunboynes death and that she wished to have the letter returned which she had left for delivery to philips father on the day when philip and eunice were married i had my own suspicions of what that letter might contain and i regretted that miss jillgall had sent it back without first waiting to consult me my misgivings thus excited were increased by more news of no very welcome kind mrs tenbruggen had decided on returning to her professional pursuits in england massage now the fashion everywhere had put money into her pocket among the foreigners and her husband finding that she persisted in keeping out of his reach had consented to a compromise he was ready to submit to a judicial separation in consideration of a little income which his wife had consented to settle on him under the advice of her lawyer  some days later i received a delightful letter from philip and eunice reminding me that i had engaged to pay them a visit at the seaside my room was ready for me and i was left to choose my own day i had just begun to write my reply gladly accepting the invitation when an ominous circumstance occurred my servant announced a lady and i found myself face to face withmrs tenbruggen  she was as cheerful as ever and as eminently agreeable as ever  i have heard it all from selina she said philips marriage to eunice i shall go and congratulate them of course and the catastrophe how dramatic of helena gracedieu i warned selina that miss helena would end badly to tell the truth she frightened me i dont deny that i am a mischievous woman when i find myself affronted quite capable of taking my revenge in my own small spiteful way but poison and murderah the frightful subject let us drop it and talk of something that doesnt make my hair its really my own hair stand on end has selina told you that i have got rid of my charming husband on easy pecuniary terms oh you know that very well i will tell you something that you dont know mr governor i have found you out  may i venture to ask how  when i guessed which was which of those two girls she answered and guessed wrong you deliberately encouraged the mistake very clever but you overdid it from that moment though i kept it to myself i began to fear i might be wrong do you remember low lanes my dear sir a charming old church i have had another consultation with my lawyer his questions led me into mentioning how it happened that i heard of low lanes after looking again at his memorandum of the birth advertised in the newspaper without naming the placehe proposed trying the church register at low lanes need i tell you the result i know as well as you do that philip has married the adopted child he has had a motherinlaw who was hanged and what is more he has the honor through his late father of being otherwise connected with the murderess by marriageas his aunt  bewilderment and dismay deprived me of my presence of mind how did you discover that i was foolish enough to ask  do you remember when i brought the baby to the prison she said the fatheras i mentioned at the timehad been a dear and valued friend of mine no person could be better qualified to tell me who had married his wifes sister if that lady had been living i should never have been troubled with the charge of the child any more questions  only one is philip to hear of this  oh for shame i dont deny that philip insulted me grossly in one way and that philips late father insulted me grossly in another way but mamma tenbruggen is a christian she returns good for evil and wouldnt for the world disturb the connubial felicity of mr and mrs philip dunboyne  the moment the woman was out of my house i sent a telegram to philip to say that he might expect to see me that night i caught the last train in the evening and i sat down to supper with those two harmless young creatures knowing i must prepare the husband for what threatened them and weakly deferring it when i found myself in their presence until the next day eunice was in some degree answerable for this hesitation on my part no one could look at her husband and fail to see that he was a supremely happy man but i detected signs of care in the wifes face  before breakfast the next morning i was out on the beach trying to decide how the inevitable disclosure might be made eunice joined me now when we were alone i asked if she was really and completely happy quietly and sadly she answered not yet  i hardly knew what to say my face must have expressed disappointment and surprise  i shall never be quite happy she resumed till i know what it is that you kept from me on that memorable day i dont like having a secret from my husbandthough it is not my secret  remember your promise i said  i dont forget it she answered i can only wish that my promise would keep back the thoughts that come to me in spite of myself  what thoughts  there is something as i fear in the story of my parents which you are afraid to confide to me why did mr gracedieu allow me to believe and leave everybody to believe that i was his own child  my dear i relieved your mind of those doubts on the morning of your marriage  no i was only thinking of myself at that time my motherthe doubt of her is the doubt that torments me now  what do you mean  she put her arm in mine and held by it with both hands  the mockmother she whispered do you remember that dreadful vision that horrid whispering temptation in the dead of night was it a mockmother oh pity me i dont know who my mother was one horrid thought about her is a burden on my mind if she was a good woman you who love me would surely have made me happy by speaking of her  those words decided me at last could she suffer more than she had suffered already if i trusted her with the truth i ran the risk there was a time of silence that filled me with terror the interval passed she took my hand and put it to her heart does it beat as if i was frightened she asked   no it was beating calmly  does it relieve your anxiety  it told me that i had not surprised her that unforgotten vision of the night had prepared her for the worst after the time when i had told her that she was an adopted child i know i said that those whispered temptations overpowered you again when you and helena met on the stairs and you forbade her to enter philips room and i know that love had conquered once more when you were next seen sitting by philips bedside tell mehave you any misgivings now is there fear in your heart of the return of that tempting spirit in you in the time to come  not while philip lives  there where her love wasthere her safety was and she knew it she suddenly left me i asked where she was going  to tell philip was the reply  she was waiting for me at the door when i followed her to the house  is it done i said  it is done she answered  what did he say  he said my darling if i could be fonder of you than ever i should be fonder of you now  i have been blamed for being too ready to confide to philip the precious trust of eunices happiness if that reply does not justify me where is justification to be found     postscript  later in the day mrs tenbruggen arrived to offer her congratulations she asked for a few minutes with philip alone as a cat elaborates her preparations for killing a mouse so the human cat elaborated her preparations for killing philips happiness he remained uninjured by her teeth and her claws somebody she said has told you of it already and philip answered yes my wife  for some months longer mr gracedieu lingered one morning he said to eunice i want to teach you to knit sit by me and see me do it his hands fell softly on his lap his head sank little by little on her shoulder she could just hear him whisper how pleasant it is to sleep never was deaths dreadful work more gently done  our married pair live now on the paternal estate in ireland and miss jillgall reigns queen of domestic affairs i am still strong enough to pass my autumn holidays in that pleasant house  at times my memory reverts to helena gracedieu and to what i discovered when i had seen her diary  how little i knew of that terrible creature when i first met with her and fancied that she had inherited her mothers character it was weak indeed to compare the mean vices of mrs gracedieu with the diabolical depravity of her daughter here the doctrine of hereditary transmission of moral qualities must own that it has overlooked the fertility for growth of good and for growth of evil equally which is inherent in human nature there are virtues that exalt us and vices that degrade us whose mysterious origin is not in our parents but in ourselves when i think of helena i ask myself where is the trace which reveals that the first murder in the world was the product of inherited crime  the criminal left the prison on the expiration of her sentence so secretly that it was impossible to trace her some months later miss jillgall received an illustrated newspaper published in the united states she showed me one of the portraits in it  do you recognize the illustrious original she asked with indignant emphasis on the last two words i recognized helena now read her new title miss jillgall continued  i read the reverend miss gracedieu  the biographical notice followed here is an extract this eminent lady the victim of a shocking miscarriage of justice in england is now the distinguished leader of a new community in the united states we hail in her the great intellect which asserts the superiority of woman over man in the first french revolution the attempt made by men to found a rational religion met with only temporary success it was reserved for the mightier spirit of woman to lay the foundations more firmly and to dedicate one of the noblest edifices in this city to the worship of pure reason readers who wish for further information will do well to provide themselves with the reverend miss gracedieus orationsthe tenth edition of which is advertised in our columns  i once asked you miss jillgall reminded me what helena would do when she came out of prison and you said she would do very well oh mr governor solomon was nothing to you
