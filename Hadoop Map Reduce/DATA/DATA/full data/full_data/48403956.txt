48403956	samuel taylor coleridges    bibliographia epistolaris    comprising 33 letters  and being  the biographical supplement of coleridges biographia literaria  with additional letters etc edited by  a turnbull     vol 1       on the whole this was surely the mightiest genius since milton in     poetry there is not his like when he rose to his full power he was     a philosopher the immensity of whose mind cannot be gauged by     anything he has left behind a critic the subtlest and most     profound of his time yet these vast and varied powers flowed away     in the shifting sands of talk and what remains is but what the few     landlocked pools are to the receding ocean which has left them     casually behind without sensible diminution of its     waters      academy 3d october 1903     preface  the work known as the biographical supplement of the biographia literaria of s t coleridge and published with the latter in 1847 was begun by henry nelson coleridge and finished after his death by his widow sara coleridge the first part concluding with a letter dated 5th november 1796 is the more valuable portion of the biographical supplement what follows written by sara coleridge is more controversial than biographical and does not continue like the first part to make coleridge tell his own life by inserting letters in the narrative of 33 letters quoted in the whole work 30 are contained in the section written by henry nelson coleridge of these 11 were drawn from cottles early recollections seven being letters to josiah wade four to joseph cottle and the remainder are sixteen letters to poole one to benjamin flower one to charles e heath and one to henry martin  from this i think it is evident that henry nelson coleridge intended what was published as a supplement to the biographia literaria to be a life of coleridge either supplementary to the biographia literaria or as an independent narrative in which most of the letters published by cottle in 1837 and unpublished letters to poole and other correspondents were to form the chief material sara coleridge in finishing the fragment did not attempt to carry out the original intention of her husband a few letters in cottle were perhaps not acceptable to her taste and in rejecting them she perhaps resolved to reject all remaining letters in cottle she thus finished the fragmentary life of coleridge left by her husband in her own way  but henry nelson coleridge had begun to build on another plan his intention was simply to string all coleridges letters available on a slim biographical thread and thus produce a work in which the poet would have been made to tell his own life his beginning with the five biographical letters to thomas poole is a proof of this he took these as his starting point and as far as he went his life of coleridge thus constructed is the most reliable of all the early biographies of coleridge  this edition of the biographical supplement is meant to carry out as far as possible the original project of its author the whole of his narrative has been retained and also what sara coleridge added to his writing and all the noncopyright letters of coleridge available from other sources have been inserted into the narrative and additional biographical matter explanatory of the letters has been given 1 by this retention of authentic sources i have produced as faithful a picture of the poetphilosopher coleridge as can be got anywhere for coleridge always paints his own character in his letters those desirous of a fuller picture may peruse along with this work the letters published in the collection of 1895 the place of which in the narrative is indicated in footnotes  footnote what has been added is enclosed in square brackets   the letters are drawn from the

poetae by e h coleridge 1895  1   the letters of coleridge have slowly come to light coleridge was always fond of letterwriting and at several periods of his career he was more active in letterwriting than at others he commenced the publication of his letters himself the epistolary form was as dear to him in prose as the ballad or odic form in verse from his earliest publications we can see he loved to launch a poem with a letter to the editor or to the recipient as preface the mathematical problem one of his juvenile facetiae in rhyme was thus heralded with a letter addressed to his brother george explaining the import of the doggerel his first printed poem to fortune dykes campbells edition of the poems p 27 was also prefaced by a short letter to the editor of the morning chronicle among coleridges letters are several of this sort and each affords a glimpse into his character those with the raven and talleyrand to lord grenville are characteristic specimens of his drollery and irony  coleridges greatest triumphs in letterwriting were gained in the field of politics his two letters to fox his letters on the spaniards and those to judge fletcher are his highest specimens of epistolary eloquence and constitute him the rival of rousseau as an advocate of some great truth in a letter addressed to a public personage in clearness of thought and virile precision of language they surpass the most of anything that coleridge has written they never wander from the point at issue the evolution of their ideas is perfect their idiom the purest motherenglish written since the refined vocabulary of hooker jeremy taylor and harrington was coined  besides the political letters coleridge published during his lifetime four important letters of great length written during his sojourn in germany three of these appeared in the friend of 1809 and indeed were the finest part of that periodical and one was first made public in the amulet of 1829 six letters published in blackwoods magazine of 182021 and a few others of less importance brought up the number of letters published by coleridge to 46 the following is a list of them   7th nov 1793 to fortune ed morning

followed in 1837 with his early recollections in which  84 letters or fragments of letters made their appearance  gillman in 1838 published 11 letters or fragments 4 of which had already appeared in the works of allsop and cottle and in the friend leaving a contribution of    7   the gentlemans magazine followed in 1838 with letters to daniel stuart  17  cottle in 1847 recast his early recollections and called his work reminiscences of coleridge and southey and added the splendid wedgwood series of 19 letters and a few others of less importance in all  25  the biographical supplement to the 1847 edition of the biographia literaria contained 33 letters 11 of which were from cottle leaving a contribution of  22  in 1850 coleridges essays on his own times consisting of his magazine and newspaper articles contained in the preface p 91 a fragment of a letter to poole  1  making  252   published up to 1850 by coleridge himself and his three early biographers and these continued to be quoted and alluded to by writers on coleridge until 1895 when mr e h coleridge gave to the world a collection of 260 letters  meantime numerous biographies memoirs and magazines continued to throw in a contribution now and then the following as far as i have been able to ascertain is the number of letters or fragments of letters contributed by the various works enumerated

these there are privately printed letters and letters not yet published to be taken account of the chief collection of these is letters from the lake poets edited by e h coleridge containing 87 letters to daniel stuart some of which are republished in the letters 1895 the remainder of letters not published from the information given by mr e h coleridge in his preface i make out to be about 300  nor does this exhaust the list of letters written by coleridge in aingers collection of the letters of charles lamb are 62 letters by lamb to coleridge most of which are in answer to letters received we may therefore estimate the letters of coleridge to lamb at not less than 62 in dorothy wordsworths grasmere journal there are no less than 32 letters to the wordsworths1 mentioned as having been received during the period 18001803 not represented among the letters in professor knights life of wordsworth the total number of letters known to have been written by coleridge is therefore between 1100 and 1200 other correspondents of coleridge not appearing among the recipients of letters in publications are probably as follows  v le grice  sam le grice  t f middleton  robert allen  robert lovell  ch lloyd jr  john cruickshank  dr beddoes  edmund irving  mr clarkson  mrs clarkson except one small fragment in diary of h c robinson  footnote 1 the letters to lamb and miss wordsworth do not now exist   the letters of coleridge taken as a whole are one of the most important contributions to english letterwriting they are gradually coming to light and with every letter or group of letters put forth the character and intellectual development of coleridge is becoming clearer his poems and prose works great as these are are not comprehensible without a study of his letters which join together the insulated fragments of that grand scheme of truth which he called his system table talk 12th sept 1831 and 26th june 1834 coleridge in his letters has written his own life for his life after all was a life of thought and his finest thoughts and his most ambitious aspirations are given expression to in his letters to his numerous friends and the true biography of coleridge is that in which his letters are made the main source of the narrative a biographia epistolaris is what we want of such a man  coleridges letters are often bizarre in construction and quite regardless of the conventions of style and abound in the most curious freaks of emphasis and imagery they resemble the letters of cowper in that they were not written for publication and like cowpers they have a character of their own but they far surpass the epistles of the poet of olney in spiritual vision and intellectuality the eighteenth century from pope and swift down to cowper is extremely  rich in letterwriting bolingbroke lord chesterfield lady mary wortley montagu gray mason johnson beattie burns and gibbon among literary personages have contributed to the great epistolick art as dr johnson called it and this list does not include the letters of the politicians horace walpole junius and others the eighteenth century in fact was a letterwriting age and while the bulk of the poetry of its 300 poets with the exception of a few masterpieces of monumental quality has gradually gone out of fashion its letters have risen into greater repute even among the poets whose verse is still read there is a hesitation in public opinion as to whether the verses or letters are superior there are readers not a few who would not scruple to place cowpers letters above his poems who believe that grays letters are much more akin to the modern spirit than the elegy and the ode to eton college and who think that swifts flyleaves to his friends will outlive the fame of gulliver and the tale of a tub  coleridge who stands between the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries was like the poets of the former age a multiform letterwriter he was often seized with letterwriting when unable to write poetry or execute those unpublished masterpieces in the composition of some of which he was engaged  coleridges letters are of the utmost importance as a part of the literature of the opening of the nineteenth century it is in the letters that we see better than elsewhere the germs of the speculations which afterwards came to fruition between 1817 and 1850 when the poetical and critical principles of the lake school gradually took the place of the classicism of the eighteenth century and the theology of broad churchism began to displace the old theology and the school of paley in evidences and locke in philosophy gave way before the inroad of transcendentalism  as the record of the phases of an intellectual development the letters of coleridge stand very high and indeed i do not know anything equal to them except it be the journal of amiel  the resemblance between coleridge and amiel is very striking both valetudinarians and barely understood by the friends with whom they came into contact they took refuge in the inner shrine of introspection and clothed the most abstruse ideas in the most beautiful forms of language and imagery that is only not poetry because it is not verse while one wrote the story of his own intellectual development in secret and retained the record of it hidden from all eyes the other scattered his to the winds in the shape of letters which thus widely distributed kept his secret until they were gathered together by later hands the letters of coleridge as a collection is one of the most engaging psychological studies of the history of an individual mind  the text of the letters in the present volume is reproduced from the original sources the biographical supplement cottle gillman allsop and the life and correspondence of robert southey fuller texts of some of the letters will be found in letters of s t c of 1895 litchfields tom wedgwood and other recent publications one of the objects of the present work is to preserve the text of the letters as presented in these authentic sources of the life of coleridge  letters nos 44 45 and 46 from charles lamb and the lloyds by mr e v lucas smith elder and co no 130 from anima poetae w heinemann are printed here by arrangement with the poets grandson ernest hartley coleridge esq to whom my sincere thanks are also due for his kindness in reading the proofs mr coleridge of course is not responsible for any of the opinions expressed in this work but he has taken great pains in putting me right regarding certain views of others who had written on coleridge and also on some of the mistakes made by henry nelson coleridge and sara coleridge who had insufficient data on the matters on which they wrote and definite information on which indeed could not be ascertainable

while here thou fedst upon etherial beams   as if thou hadst not a terrestrial birth   beyond material objects was thy sight   in the clouds woven was thy lucid robe   ah who can tell how little for this sphere   that frame was fitted of empyreal fire 1   samuel taylor coleridge was the youngest child of the reverend john coleridge chaplainpriest and vicar of the parish of ottery st mary in the county of devon and master of the free grammar or kings school as it is called founded by henry viii in that town his mothers maiden name was ann bowdon he was born at ottery on the 21st of october 1772 about eleven oclock in the forenoon as his father the vicar has with rather unusual particularity entered it in the register  john coleridge who was born in 1719 and finished his education at sidneysussex college cambridge2 was a country clergyman and schoolmaster of no ordinary kind he was a good greek and latin scholar a profound hebraist and according to the measure of his day an accomplished mathematician he was on terms of literary friendship with samuel badcock and by his knowledge of hebrew rendered material assistance to dr kennicott in his well known critical works some curious papers on theological and antiquarian subjects appear with his signature in the early numbers of the gentlemans magazine between the years 1745 and 1780 almost all of which have been inserted in the interesting volumes of selections made several years ago from that work in 1768 he published miscellaneous dissertations arising from the 17th and 18th chapters of the book of judges in which a very learned and ingenious attempt is made to relieve the character of micah from the charge of idolatry ordinarily brought against it and in 1772 appeared a critical latin grammar which his son called his best work and which is not wholly unknown even now to the inquisitive by the proposed substitution of the terms prior possessive attributive posterior interjective and qualequarequidditive for the vulgar names of the cases this little grammar however deserves a philologers perusal and is indeed in many respects a very valuable work in its kind he also published a latin exercise book and a sermon his school was celebrated and most of the country gentlemen of that generation belonging to the south and east parts of devon had been his pupils judge buller was one the amiable character and personal eccentricities of this excellent man are not yet forgotten amongst some of the elders of the parish and neighbourhood and the latter as is usual in such cases have been greatly exaggerated he died suddenly in the month of october 1781 after riding to ottery from plymouth to which latter place he had gone for the purpose of embarking his son francis as a midshipman for india many years afterwards in 1797 s t coleridge commenced a series of letters to his friend thomas poole of nether stowey in the county of somerset in which he proposed to give an account of his life up to that time five only were written and unfortunately they stop short of his residence at cambridge this series will properly find a place here  footnote 1 from a sonnet to coleridge by sir egerton brydgeswritten 16th feb 1837 s c  footnote 2 he was matriculated at sidney a sizar on the 18th of march 1748 but does not appear to have taken any degree at the university s c   letter 1 to mr poole  my dear poole  i could inform the dullest author how he might write an interesting book let him relate the events of his own life with honesty not disguising the feelings that accompanied them i never yet read even a methodists experience in the gospel magazine without receiving instruction and amusement and i should almost despair of that man who could peruse the life of john woolman without an amelioration of heart as to my life it has all the charms of varietyhigh life and low life vices and virtues great folly and some wisdom however what i am depends on what i have been and you my best friend have a right to the narration to me the task will be a useful one it will renew and deepen my reflections on the past and it will perhaps make you behold with no unforgiving or impatient eye those weaknesses and defects in my character which so many untoward circumstances have concurred in planting there  my family on my mothers side can be traced up i know not how far the bowdons inherited a good farm and house thereon in the exmoor country in the reign of elizabeth as i have been told and to my knowledge they have inherited nothing better since that time my grandfather was in the reign of george i a considerable woollen trader in southmolton so that i suppose when the time comes i shall be allowed to pass as a sansculotte without much opposition my father received a better education than the rest of his family in consequence of his own exertions not of his superiour advantages when he was not quite sixteen years of age my grandfather by a series of misfortunes was reduced to great distress my father received the half of his last crown and his blessing and walked off to seek his fortune after he had proceeded a few miles he sate him down on the side of the road so overwhelmed with painful thoughts that he wept audibly a gentleman passed by who knew him and inquiring into his sorrow took him home and gave him the means of maintaining himself by placing him in a school at this time he commenced being a severe and ardent student he married his first wife by whom he had three daughters all now alive while his first wife lived having scraped up money enough he at the age of twenty walked to cambridge entered himself at sidney college distinguished himself in hebrew and mathematics and might have had a fellowship if he had not been married he returned and settled as a schoolmaster in southmolton where his wife died in 1760 he was appointed chaplainpriest and master of the school at ottery st mary and removed to that place and in august 1760 mr buller the father of the present judge procured for him the living from lord chancellor bathurst by my mother his second wife he had ten children of whom i am the youngest born october 20th1 1772  these facts i received from my mother but i am utterly unable to fill them up by any further particulars of times or places or names here i shall conclude my first letter because i cannot pledge myself for the accuracy of the accounts and i will not therefore mingle it with that for the truth of which in the minutest parts i shall hold myself responsible you must regard this letter as a first chapter devoted to dim traditions of times too remote to be pierced by the eye of investigation  yours affectionately s t coleridge  feb 1797 monday  footnote 1 a mistake should be october 21st    letter 2 to mr poole  my dear poole  my father vicar of and schoolmaster at ottery st mary devon was a good mathematician and well versed in the greek latin and hebrew languages he published or rather attempted to publish several works1st miscellaneous dissertations arising from the 17th and 18th chapters of the book of judges 2d sententiae excerptcae for the use of his own school and 3d his best work a critical latin grammar in the preface to which he proposes a bold innovation in the names of the cases my fathers new nomenclature was not likely to become popular although it must be allowed to be both sonorous and expressive exempli gratia he calls the ablative case the quarequalequidditive case he made the world his confidant with respect to his learning and ingenuity and the world seems to have kept the secret very faithfully his various works uncut unthumbed were preserved free from all pollution in the family archives where they may still be for anything that i know this piece of good luck promises to be hereditary for all my compositions have the same amiable homestaying propensity the truth is my father was not a firstrate genius he was however a firstrate christian which is much better i need not detain you with his character in learning goodheartedness absentness of mind and excessive ignorance of the world he was a perfect parson adams   my mother was an admirable economist and managed exclusively my  eldest brothers name was john he was a captain in the east india  companys service a successful officer and a brave one as i have  heard he died in india in 1786 my second brother william went to  pembroke college oxford he died a clergyman in 1780 just on the eve  of his intended marriage my brother james has been in the army since  the age of fifteen and has married a woman of fortune one of the old  duke family of otterton in devon edward the wit of the family went  to pembroke college and is now a clergyman george also went to  pembroke he is in orders likewise and now has the same school a very  flourishing one which my father had he is a man of reflective mind  and elegant talent he possesses learning in a greater degree than any  of the family excepting myself his manners are grave and hued over  with a tender sadness in his moral character he approaches every way  nearer to perfection than any man i ever yet knew he is worth us all  luke herman was a surgeon a severe student and a good man he died in  1790 leaving one child a lovely boy still alive 1 my only sister  ann died at twentyone a little after my brother luke  rest gentle shade and wait thy makers will then rise unchangd and be an angel still  francis syndercombe went out to india as a midshipman under admiral graves he accidentally met his brother john on board ship abroad who took him ashore and procured him a commission in the companys army he died in 1792 aged twentyone a lieutenant in consequence of a fever brought on by excessive fatigue at and after the siege of seringapatam and the storming of a hill fort during all which his conduct had been so gallant that his commanding officer particularly noticed him and presented him with a gold watch which my mother now has all my brothers are remarkably handsome but they were as inferiour to francis as i am to them he went by the name of the handsome coleridge the tenth and last child was samuel taylor the subject and author of these epistles  from october 1772 to october 1773 baptized samuel taylor my godfathers name being samuel taylor esquire i had another called evans and two godmothers both named munday  from october 1773 to october 1774 in this year i was carelessly left by my nurse ran to the fire and pulled out a live coal and burned myself dreadfully while my hand was being drest by mr young i spoke for the first time so my mother informs me and said nasty dr young the snatching at fire and the circumstance of my first words expressing hatred to professional menare they at all ominous this year i went to school my schoolmistress the very image of shenstones was named old dame key she was nearly related to sir joshua reynolds  from october 1774 to 1775 i was inoculated which i mention because i distinctly remember it and that my eyes were bound at which i manifested so much obstinate indignation that at last they removed the bandage and unaffrighted i looked at the lancet and suffered the scratch at the close of this year i could read a chapter in the bible  here i shall end because the remaining years of my life all assisted to form my particular mindthe first three years had nothing in them that seems to relate to it  god bless you and your sincere s t coleridge  sunday march 1797   footnote 1 william hart coleridge bishop of barbadoes and the leeward islands  he was appointed to that see in 1824 retired from it in 1842 and afterwards accepted the wardenship of st augustines college canterbury s c he died in 1849    a letter from francis s coleridge to his sister has been preserved in  the family in which a particular account is given of the chance  meeting of the two brothers in india mentioned shortly in the  preceding letter there is something so touching and romantic in the  incident that the reader will it is hoped pardon the insertion of the  original narrative here   dear nancy   you are very right i have neglected my absent friends but do not  think i have forgot them and indeed it would be ungrateful in me if i  did not write to them   you may be sure nancy i thank providence for bringing about that  meeting which has been the cause of all my good fortune and happiness  which i now in fulness enjoy it was an affectionate meeting and i  will inform you of the particulars there was in our ship one captain  mordaunt who had been in india before when we came to bombay finding  a number of his friends there he went often ashore the day before the  fleet sailed he desired one captain welsh to go aboard with him who  was an intimate friend of your brothers i will said welsh and  will write a note to coleridge to go with us upon this captain  mordaunt recollecting me said there was a young midshipman a  favourite of captain hicks of that name on board upon that they  agreed to inform my brother of it which they did soon after and all  three came on board i was then in the lower deck and though you  wont believe it i was sitting upon a gun and thinking of my brother  that is whether i should ever see or hear anything of him when seeing  a lieutenant who had been sent to inform me of my brothers being on  board i got up off the gun but instead of telling me about my  brother he told me that captain hicks was very angry with me and  wanted to see me captain hicks had always been a father to me and  loved me as if i had been his own child i therefore went up shaking  like an aspen leaf to the lieutenants apartments when a gentleman  took hold of my hand i did not mind him at first but looked round for  the captain but the gentleman still holding my hand i looked and  what was my surprise when i saw him too full to speak and his eyes  full of tears whether crying is catching i know not but i began a  crying too though i did not know the reason till he caught me in his  arms and told me he was my brother and then i found i was paying  nature her tribute for i believe i never cried so much in my life  there is a saying in robinson crusoe i remember very well  vizsudden joy like grief confounds at first we directly went ashore  having got my discharge and having took a most affectionate leave of  captain hicks i left the ship for good and all  my situation in the army is that i am one of the oldest ensigns and before you get this must in all probability be a lieutenant how many changes there have been in my life and what lucky ones they have been and how young i am still i must be seven years older before i can properly style myself a man and what a number of officers do i command who are old enough to be my father already    letter 3 to mr poole  october 9th 1797  my dearest poole  from march to octobera long silence but it is possible that i may have been preparing materials for future letters and the time cannot be considered as altogether subtracted from you  from october 1775 to october 1778 these three years i continued at the reading school because i was too little to be trusted among my fathers schoolboys after breakfast i had a halfpenny given me with which i bought three cakes at the bakers shop close by the school of my old mistress and these were my dinner every day except saturday and sunday when i used to dine at home and wallowed in a beef and pudding dinner i am remarkably fond of beans and bacon and this fondness i attribute to my fathers giving me a penny for having eaten a large quantity of beans on saturday for the other boys did not like them and as it was an economic food my father thought my attachment to it ought to be encouraged he was very fond of me and i was my mothers darling in consequence whereof i was very miserable for molly who had nursed my brother francis and was immoderately fond of him hated me because my mother took more notice of me than of frank and frank hated me because my mother gave me now and then a bit of cake when he had nonequite forgetting that for one bit of cake which i had and he had not he had twenty sops in the pan and pieces of bread and butter with sugar on them from molly from whom i received only thumps and ill names  so i became fretful and timorous and a telltale and the schoolboys drove me from play and were always tormenting me and hence i took no pleasure in boyish sports but read incessantly i read through all giltcover little books that could be had at that time and likewise all the uncovered tales of tom hickathrift jack the giant killer and the like and i used to lie by the wall and mope and my spirits used to come upon me suddenly and in a floodand then i was accustomed to run up and down the churchyard and act over again all i had been reading on the docks the nettles and the rank grass at six years of age i remember to have read belisarius robinson crusoe and philip quarles and then i found the arabian nights entertainments one tale of which the tale of a man who was compelled to seek for a pure virgin made so deep an impression on me i had read it in the evening while my mother was at her needle that i was haunted by spectres whenever i was in the dark and i distinctly recollect the anxious and fearful eagerness with which i used to watch the window where the book lay and when the sun came upon it i would seize it carry it by the wall and bask and read my father found out the effect which these books had produced and burned them  so i became a dreamer and acquired an indisposition to all bodily activity and i was fretful and inordinately passionate and as i could not play at anything and was slothful i was despised and hated by the boys and because i could read and spell and had i may truly say a memory and understanding forced into almost unnatural ripeness i was flattered and wondered at by all the old women and so i became very vain and despised most of the boys that were at all near my own age and before i was eight years old i was a character sensibility imagination vanity sloth and feelings of deep and bitter contempt for almost all who traversed the orbit of my understanding were even then prominent and manifest  from october 1778 to 1779 that which i began to be from three to six i continued to be from six to nine in this year i was admitted into the grammar school and soon outstripped all of my age i had a dangerous putrid fever this year my brother george lay ill of the same fever in the next room my poor brother francis i remember stole up in spite of orders to the contrary and sat by my bedside and read popes homer to me frank had a violent love of beating me but whenever that was superseded by any humour or circumstances he was always very fond of me and used to regard me with a strange mixture of admiration and contempt strange it was not for he hated books and loved climbing fighting playing and robbing orchards to distraction my mother relates a story of me which i repeat here because it must be reckoned as my first piece of witduring my fever i asked why lady northcote our neighbour did not come and see me my mother said she was afraid of catching the fever i was piqued and answered ah mamma the four angels round my bed ant afraid of catching it i suppose you know the old prayer            matthew mark luke and john           bless the bed that i lie on           four good angels round me spread           two at my feet and two at my head  this prayer i said nightly and most firmly believed the truth of it frequently have i halfawake and halfasleep my body diseased and fevered by my imaginationseen armies of ugly things bursting in upon me and these four angels keeping them off  in my next i shall carry on my life to my fathers death  god bless you my dear poole  and your affectionate st coleridge  in a note written in after life mr coleridge speaks of this period of his life in the following terms  being the youngest child i possibly inherited the weakly state of health of my father who died at the age of sixtytwo before i had reached my ninth year and from certain jealousies of old molly my brother franks dotingly fond nurseand if ever child by beauty and loveliness deserved to be doted on my brother francis was that childand by the infusion of her jealousies into my brothers mind i was in earliest childhood huffed away from the enjoyments of muscular activity in play to take refuge at my mothers side on my little stool to read my little book and to listen to the talk of my elders i was driven from life in motion to life in thought and sensation i never played except by myself and then only acted over what i had been reading or fancying or half one half the other with a stick cutting down weeds and nettles as one of the seven champions of christendom alas i had all the simplicity all the docility of the little child but none of the childs habits i never thought as a child never had the language of a child 1  footnote 1 gillmans life of coleridge p 10   letter 4  to mr poole  dear poole  from october 1779 to 1781 i had asked my mother one evening to cut my cheese entire so that i might toast it this was no easy matter it being a crumbly cheese my mother however did it i went into the garden for something or other and in the mean time my brother frank minced my cheese to disappoint the favourite i returned saw the exploit and in an agony of passion flew at frank he pretended to have been seriously hurt by my blow flung himself on the ground and there lay with outstretched limbs i hung over him mourning and in a great fright he leaped up and with a horselaugh gave me a severe blow in the face i seized a knife and was running at him when my mother came in and took me by the arm i expected a flogging and struggling from her i ran away to a little hill or slope at the bottom of which the otter flows about a mile from ottery there i staid my rage died away but my obstinacy vanquished my fears and taking out a shilling book which had at the end morning and evening prayers i very devoutly repeated themthinking at the same time with a gloomy inward satisfactionhow miserable my mother must be i distinctly remember my feelings when i saw a mr vaughan pass over the bridge at about a furlongs distance and how i watched the calves in the fields beyond the river it grew dark and i fell asleep it was towards the end of october and it proved a stormy night i felt the cold in my sleep and dreamed that i was pulling the blanket over me and actually pulled over me a dry thornbush which lay on the ground near me in my sleep i had rolled from the top of the hill till within three yards of the river which flowed by the unfenced edge of the bottom i awoke several times and finding myself wet and cold and stiff closed my eyes again that i might forget it  in the meantime my mother waited about half an hour expecting my return when the sulks had evaporated i not returning she sent into the churchyard and round the town not found several men and all the boys were sent out to ramble about and seek me in vain my mother was almost distracted and at ten oclock at night i was cried by the crier in ottery and in two villages near it with a reward offered for me no one went to bedindeed i believe half the town were up all the night to return to myself about five in the morning or a little after i was broad awake and attempted to get up and walk but i could not move i saw the shepherds and workmen at a distance and cried but so faintly that it was impossible to hear me thirty yards off and there i might have lain and diedfor i was now almost given over the ponds and even the river near which i was lying having been dragged but providentially sir stafford northcote who had been out all night resolved to make one other trial and came so near that he heard me crying he carried me in his arms for nearly a quarter of a mile when we met my father and sir stafford northcotes servants i remember and never shall forget my fathers face as he looked upon me while i lay in the servants armsso calm and the tears stealing down his face for i was the child of his old age my mother as you may suppose was outrageous with joy meantime in rushed a young lady crying outi hope youll whip him mrs coleridge this woman still lives at ottery and neither philosophy nor religion has been able to conquer the antipathy which i feel towards her whenever i see her i was put to bed and recovered in a day or so but i was certainly injured for i was weakly and subject to ague for many years after  my fatherwho had so little parental ambition in him that but for my mothers pride and spirit he would certainly have brought up his other sons to tradeshad nevertheless resolved that i should be a parson i read every book that came in my way without distinction and my father was fond of me and used to take me on his knee and hold long conversations with me i remember when eight years old walking with him one winter evening from a farmers house a mile from ottery and he then told me the names of the stars and how jupiter was a thousand times larger than our world and that the other twinkling stars were suns that had worlds rolling round them and when i came home he showed me how they rolled round i heard him with a profound delight and admiration but without the least mixture of wonder or incredulity for from my early reading of fairy tales and about genii and the like my mind had been habituated to the vast and i never regarded my senses in any way as the criteria of my belief i regulated all my creeds by my conceptions not by my sight even at that age ought children to be permitted to read romances and stories of giants magicians and genii i know all that has been said against it but i have formed my faith in the affirmative i know no other way of giving the mind a love of the great and the whole those who have been led to the same truths step by step through the constant testimony of their senses seem to me to want a sense which i possess they contemplate nothing but parts and all parts are necessarily little and the universe to them is but a mass of little things it is true the mind may become credulous and prone to superstition by the former methodbut are not the experimentalists credulous even to madness in believing any absurdity rather than believe the grandest truths if they have not the testimony of their own senses in their favour i have known some who have been rationally educated as it is styled they were marked by a microscopic acuteness but when they looked at great things all became a blank and they saw nothing and denied that anything could be seen and uniformly put the negative of a power for the possession of a power and called the want of imagination judgment and the never being moved to rapture philosophy  towards the latter end of september 1781 my father went to plymouth with my brother francis who was to go out as midshipman under admiral graves who was a friend of my fathers he settled frank as he wished and returned on the 4th of october 1781 he arrived at exeter about six oclock and was pressed to take a bed there by the friendly family of the harts but he refused and to avoid their entreaties he told them that he had never been superstitious but that the night before he had had a dream which had made a deep impression on him he dreamed that death had appeared to him as he is commonly painted and had touched him with his dart well he returned home and all his family i excepted were up he told my mother his dream but he was in high health and good spirits and there was a bowl of punch made and my father gave a long and particular account of his travel and that he had placed frank under a religious captain and so forth at length he went to bed very well and in high spirits a short time after he had lain down he complained of a pain in his bowels to which he was subject from wind my mother got him some peppermint water which he took and after a pause he said i am much better now my dearand lay down again in a minute my mother heard a noise in his throat and spoke to him but he did not answer and she spoke repeatedly in vain her shriek awaked me and i saidpapa is dead i did not know my fathers return but i knew that he was expected how i came to think of his death i cannot tell but so it was dead he was some said it was gout in the heartprobably it was a fit of apoplexy he was an israelite without guile simple generous and taking some scripture texts in their literal sense he was conscientiously indifferent to the good and the evil of this world god love you and  st coleridge   he was buried at ottery on the 10th of october 1781 o that i might so pass away said coleridge thirty years afterwards if like him i were an israelite without guile the image of my father very reverend kind learned simplehearted father is a religion to me  at his fathers death coleridge was nearly nine years old he continued with his mother at ottery till the spring of 1782 when he was sent to london to wait the appointed time for admission into christs hospital to which a presentation had been procured from mr john way through the influence of his fathers old pupil sir francis buller ten weeks he lived in london with an uncle and was entered in the books on the 8th of july 1782      letter 5  to mr poole  from october 1781 to october 1782 after the death of my father we of course changed houses and i remained with my mother till the spring of 1782 and was a day scholar to parson warren my fathers successor he was not very deep i believe and i used to delight my poor mother by relating little instances of his deficiency in grammar knowledgeevery detraction from his merits seeming an oblation to the memory of my father especially as warren did certainly pulpitize much better somewhere i think about april 1782 judge buller who had been educated by my father sent for me having procured a christs hospital presentation i accordingly went to london and was received and entertained by my mothers brother mr bowdon he was generous as the air and a man of very considerable talents but he was fond as others have been of his bottle he received me with great affection and i staid ten weeks at his house during which i went occasionally to judge bullers my uncle was very proud of me and used to carry me from coffeehouse to coffeehouse and tavern to tavern where i drank and talked and disputed as if i had been a man nothing was more common than for a large party to exclaim in my hearing that i was a prodigy and so forth so that while i remained at my uncles i was most completely spoilt and pampered both mind and body  at length the time came and i donned the blue coat and yellow stockings and was sent down to hertford a town twenty miles from london where there are about three hundred of the younger bluecoat boys at hertford i was very happy on the whole for i had plenty to eat and drink and we had pudding and vegetables almost every day i remained there six weeks and then was drafted up to the great school in london where i arrived in september 1782 and was placed in the second ward then called jefferies ward and in the under grammar school there are twelve wards or dormitories of unequal sizes beside the sick ward in the great school and they contained altogether seven hundred boys of whom i think nearly onethird were the sons of clergymen there are five schoolsmathematical grammar drawing reading and writingall very large buildings when a boy is admitted if he reads very badly he is either sent to hertford or to the reading school boys are admissible from seven to twelve years of age if he learns to read tolerably well before nine he is drafted into the lower grammar school if not into the writing school as having given proof of unfitness for classical studies if before he is eleven he climbs up to the first form of the lower grammar school he is drafted into the head grammar school if not at eleven years of age he is sent into the writing school where he continues till fourteen or fifteen and is then either apprenticed or articled as a clerk or whatever else his turn of mind or of fortune shall have provided for him two or three times a year the mathematical master beats up for recruits for the kings boys as they are called and all who like the navy are drafted into the mathematical and drawing schools where they continue till sixteen or seventeen years of age and go out as midshipmen and schoolmasters in the navy the boys who are drafted into the head grammar school remain there till thirteen and then if not chosen for the university go into the writing school  each dormitory has a nurse or matron and there is a head matron to superintend all these nurses the boys were when i was admitted under excessive subordination to each other according to rank in school and every ward was governed by four monitorsappointed by the steward who was the supreme governor out of schoolour temporal lordand by four markers who wore silver medals and were appointed by the head grammar master who was our supreme spiritual lord the same boys were commonly both monitors and markers we read in classes on sundays to our markers and were catechised by them and under their sole authority during prayers etc all other authority was in the monitors but as i said the same boys were ordinarily both the one and the other our diet was very scanty every morning a bit of dry bread and some bad small beer every evening a larger piece of bread and cheese or butter whichever we liked for dinneron sunday boiled beef and broth monday bread and butter and milk and water tuesday roast mutton wednesday bread and butter and rice milk thursday boiled beef and broth friday boiled mutton and broth saturday bread and butter and peaseporridge our food was portioned and excepting on wednesdays i never had a belly full our appetites were damped never satisfied and we had no vegetables 1   footnote

the free charities of humanity  coleridge continued eight years at christs hospital it was a very curious and important part of his life giving him bowyer for his teacher and lamb for his friend 1  footnote 1 a few particulars of this most remarkable and amiable man the wellknown author of essays of elia rosamund gray poems and other works will interest most readers of the biographia  he was born on the 18th of february 1775 in the inner temple died 27th december 1834 about five months after his friend coleridge who continued in habits of intimacy with him from their first acquaintance till his death in july of the same year in one of the most exquisite of all the essays of elia the old benchers of the middle temple works vol ii p 188 lamb has given the characters of his father and of his fathers master samuel salt the few touches descriptive of this gentlemans unrelenting bachelorhoodwhich appears in the sequel to have been a persistent mournerhoodand the forty years hopeless passion of mild susan pwhich very permanence redeems and almost dignifies is in the authors sweetest vein of mingled humour and pathos wherein the latter as the stronger ingredient predominates  mr lamb never married for as is recorded in the memoir on the death of his parents he felt himself called upon by duty to repay to his sister a the solicitude with which she had watched over his infancy to her from the age of twentyone he devoted his existence seeking thenceforth no connection which could interfere with her supremacy in his affections or impair his ability to sustain and to comfort

abilities she wrote mrs leicesters school which mr c used warmly to praise for delicacy of taste and tenderness of feeling  miss lamb still survives in the words of mr talfourd to mourn the severance of a lifelong association as free from every alloy of selfishness as remarkable for moral beauty as this world ever witnessed in brother and sister i have felt desirous to place in relief as far as might be such an interesting unionto show how blest a fraternal marriage may be and what sufficient helpmates a brother and sister have been to each other marriages of this kind would perhaps be more frequent but for the want of some pledge or solid warranty of continuance equivalent to that which rivets wedlock between husband and wife without the vow and the bond formal or virtual no society from the least to the greatest will hold together many persons are so constituted that they cannot feel rest or satisfaction of spirit without a single supreme object of tender affection in whose heart they are conscious of holding a like supremacywho has common hopes loves and interests with themselves without this the breezes do not refresh nor the sunbeams gladden them a share in ever so many kind hearts does not suffice to their happiness they must have the whole of one as no one else has any part of it whatever love of another kind that heart may still reserve for others there is no reason why a brother and sister might not be to each other this secondselfthis dearer halfthough such an attachment is beyond mere fraternal love and must have something in it of choice and election superadded to the natural tie but it is seldom found to exist because the durable cement is wantingthe sense of security and permanence without which the body of affection cannot be consolidated nor the heart commit itself to its whole capacity of emotion i believe that many a brother and sister spend their days in uncongenial wedlock or in a restless faintly expectantsinglehood who might form a comfortable couple could they but make up their minds early to take each other for better for worse  two other poems of mr c besides the one in which his sister is mentioned are addressed to mr

patient soul through evil and pain   and strange calamity  in the next poem he is called wildeyed boy the two epithets wildeyed and gentlehearted will recall charles lamb to the minds of all who knew him personally mr talfourd seems to think that the special delight in the country ascribed to him by my father was a distinction scarcely merited i rather imagine that his indifference to it was a sort of mock apparel in which it was his humour at times to invest himself i have been told that when visiting the lakes he took as much delight in the natural beauties of the region as might be expected from a man of his taste and sensibility b    subfootnote b    thou wert a scorner of the field my friend   but more in show than truth    from mr ws poem to a good man of most dear memory quoted in p   323  mr coleridges expression recorded in the table talk that he looked on the degraded men and things around him like moonshine on a dunghill that shines and takes no pollution partly alludes to that tolerance of moral evil both in men and books which was so much remarked in charles lamb and was in so good a man really remarkable his toleration of it in books is conspicuous in the view he takes of the writings of congreve and wycherley in his essay on the artificial comedy of the last century works vol ii p 322 and in many of his other literary criticisms his toleration of it in menat least his faculty of merging some kinds and degrees of it in concomitant good or even beholding certain errors rather as objects of interest or of a meditative pity and tenderness than of pure aversion and condemnation mr talfourd has feelingly described in his memoir vol ii p 3269 not only to opposite opinions he says and devious habits of thought was lamb indulgent he discovered the soul of goodness in things evil so vividly that the surrounding evil disappeared from his mental vision this characteristic of his mind is not to be identified with the idolizing propensity common to many ardent and imaginative spirits he not only loved his friends in spite of their errors as mr talfourd observes but loved them errors and all which implies that he was not unconscious of their existence he saw the failings as plainly as any one else nay fixed his gentle but discerning eye upon them whereas the idolizers behold certain objects in a bedarkening blaze of light or rather of lightconfounding brightness the multiplied and heightened reflection of whatever is best in them to the obscurity or transmutation of all their defects whence it necessarily follows that the world presents itself to their eyes divided like a chessboard into black and white compartmentsa moral and intellectual chequerwork not that they love to make darkness but that they luxuriate too eagerly in light and their overmuchness toward some men involves an overlittleness towards others whom they involuntarily contrast in all their poor and peccant reality with gorgeous idealisms the larger half of mankind is exiled for them into a hemisphere of shadow as dim cold and negative as the unlit portion of the crescent moon lambs general tendency though he too could warmly admire was in a different direction he was ever introducing streaks and gleams of light into darkness rather than drowning certain objects in floods of it and this i think proceeded in him from indulgence toward human nature rather than from indifference to evil to his friend the disposition to exalt and glorify coexisted in a very remarkable manner with a power of severe analysis of character and poignant exhibition of ita power which few possess without exercising it some time or other to their own sorrow and injury the consequence to mr coleridge was that he sometimes seemed untrue to himself when he had but brought forward one after another perfectly real and sincere moods of his mind  in his fine poem commemorating the deaths of several poets mr wordsworth thus joins my fathers name with that of his almost lifelong friend    nor has the rolling year twice measured   from sign to sign its steadfast course   since every mortal power of coleridge   was frozen at its marvellous source   the rapt one of the godlike forehead   the heaveneyed creature sleeps in earth   and lamb the frolic and the gentle   has vanished from his lonely hearth  s c footnote 1 ends main text resumes  numerous retrospective notices by himself and others exist of this period but none of his really boyish letters have been preserved the exquisite essay intitled christs hospital five and thirty years ago by lamb is principally founded on that delightful writers recollections of the boy coleridge and that boys own subsequent descriptions of his school days coleridge is lambs poor friendless boymy parents and those who should care for me were far away those few acquaintances of theirs which they could reckon upon being kind to me in the great city after a little forced notice which they had the grace to take of me on my first arrival in town soon grew tired of my holiday visits they seemed to them to recur too often though i thought them few enough and one after another they all failed me and i felt myself alone among six hundred playmates o the cruelty of separating a poor lad from his early homestead the yearnings which i used to have toward it in those unfledged years how in my dreams would my native town far in the west come back with its church its trees and faces how i would wake weeping and in the anguish of my heart exclaim upon sweet calne in wiltshire  yet it must not be supposed that coleridge was an unhappy boy he was naturally of a joyous temperament and in one amusement swimming he excelled and took singular delight indeed he believed and probably with truth that his health was seriously injured by his excess in bathing coupled with such tricks as swimming across the new river in his clothes and drying them on his back and the like but reading was a perpetual feast to him from eight to fourteen he writes i was a playless daydreamer a helluo librorum my appetite for which was indulged by a singular incident a stranger who was struck by my conversation made me free of a circulating library in king street cheapsidehere he proceeds i read through the catalogue folios and all whether i understood them or did not understand them running all risks in skulking out to get the two volumes which i was entitled to have daily conceive what i must have been at fourteen i was in a continual low fever my whole being was with eyes closed to every object of present sense to crumple myself up in a sunny comer and read read readfancy myself on robinson crusoes island finding a mountain of plumcake and eating a room for myself and then eating it into the shapes of tables and chairshunger and fancymy talents and superiority he continues made me for ever at the head in my routine of study though utterly without the desire to be so without a spark of ambition and as to emulation it had no meaning for me but the difference between me and my formfellows in our lessons and exercises bore no proportion to the measureless difference between me and them in the wide wild wilderness of useless unarranged book knowledge and book thoughts thank heaven it was not the age for getting up prodigies but at twelve or fourteen i should have made as pretty a juvenile prodigy as was ever emasculated and ruined by fond and idle wonderment thank heaven i was flogged instead of being flattered however as i climbed up the school my lot was somewhat alleviated

turnedsamuel taylor coleridgelogician metaphysician   bard   s t coleridge entered at jesus college cambridge the 5th of february 1791 he did not go into residence till october 1791  the poems he wrote about this time and during his first vacation at college are rather conventional and give few indications of his future deft handling of verse his mathematical problem sent to his brother george is a piece of droll nonsense but the letter accompanying it is much better than the verse it reads as follows  letter 6 to george coleridge with a poem entitled a mathematical problem  dear brother  i have often been surprised that mathematics the quintessence of truth should have found admirers so few and so languid frequent consideration and minute scrutiny have at length unravelled the cause viz that though reason is feasted imagination is starved whilst reason is luxuriating in its proper paradise imagination is wearily travelling on a dreary desert to assist reason by the stimulus of imagination is the design of the following production in the execution of it much may be objectionable the verse particularly in the introduction of the ode may be accused of unwarrantable liberties but they are liberties equally homogeneal with the exactness of mathematical disquisition and the boldness of pindaric daring i have three strong champions to defend me against the attacks of

without success for the greek ode on astronomy the prize for which was gained by dr keate the original is not known to exist but the reader may see what is probably a very free version of it by mr

senate house whilst sitting on one of the benches extended his hands and clapped them the proctor in a loud voice demanded who had committed this indecorum silence ensued the proctor in an elevated tone said to a young man sitting near coleridge twas you sir the reply was as prompt as the accusation for immediately holding out the stump of his right arm it appeared that he had lost his handi

13 and some other little pieces he returned to cambridge in october but in the following month in a moment of despondency and vexation of spirit occasioned principally by some debts not amounting to £100 he suddenly left his college and went to london in a few days he was reduced to want and observing a recruiting advertisement he resolved to get bread and overcome a prejudice at the same time by becoming a soldier he accordingly applied to the sergeant and after some delay was marched down to reading where he regularly enlisted as a private in the 15th light dragoons on the 3d of december 1793 he kept his initials under the names of silas tomkyn comberbacke i sometimes he writes in a letter compare my own life with that of steele yet o how unlikeled to this from having myself also for a brief time borne arms and written private after my name or rather another name for being at a loss when suddenly asked my name i answered cumberback and verily my habits were so little equestrian that my horse i doubt not was of that opinion coleridge continued four months a light dragoon during which time he saw and suffered much he rode his horse ill and groomed him worse but he made amends by nursing the sick and writing letters for the sound his education was detected by one of his officers captain nathaniel ogle who observed the wordseheu quam infortunii miserrimum est fuisse felicemfreshly written in pencil on the stablewall or door and ascertained that comberbacke was the writer but the termination of his military career was brought about by a chance recognition in the street his family was apprized of his situation and after some difficulty he was duly discharged on the both of april 1794 at hounslow  coleridge now returned to cambridge and remained there till the commencement of the summer vacation but the adventures of the preceding six months had broken the continuity of his academic life and given birth to new views of future exertion his acquaintance with frend had materially contributed to his adoption of the system called unitarianism which he now openly professed and this alone made it imperative on his conscience to decline availing himself of any advantages dependent on his entering into holy orders or subscribing the articles of the english church he lived nevertheless to see and renounce his error and to leave on record his deep and solemn faith in the catholic doctrine of trinal unity and the redemption of man through the sacrifice of christ both god and man indeed his unitarianism such as it was was not of the ordinary quality i can truly saywere coleridges words in after lifethat i never falsified the scripture i always told the unitarians that their interpretations of the scripture were intolerable upon any principles of sound criticism and that if they were to offer to construe the will of a neighbour as they did that of their maker they would be scouted out of society i said then plainly and openly that it was clear enough that john and paul were not unitarians but at that time i had a strong sense of the repugnancy of the doctrine of vicarious atonement to the moral being and i thought nothing could counterbalance that what care i i said for the platonisms of john or the rabbinisms of paulmy conscience revolts that was the ground of my unitarianismtable talk bohn library edition p 290  at the commencement of the long vacation in june 1794 coleridge went to oxford on a visit to an old schoolfellow intending probably to proceed afterwards to his mother at ottery but an accidental introduction to robert southey then an undergraduate at balliol college first delayed and ultimately prevented the completion of this design and became in its consequences the hinge on which a large part of coleridges after life was destined to turn  the first letter to southey was written from gloucester on 6th july 1794 and it shows the degree of intimacy on which the two undergraduates stood at this time they had met only about a month before for southey writes on 12th june to his friend grosvenor bedford allen is with us daily and his friend from cambridge coleridge whose poems you will

my stars verily southey i like not oxford nor the inhabitants of it i would say thou art a nightingale among owls but thou art so songless and heavy towards night that i will rather liken thee to the matin lark thy nest is in a blighted cornfield where the sleepy poppy nods its redcowled head and the weakeyed mole plies his dark work but thy soaring is even unto heaven or let me add for my

the country bare and unhedged presenting nothing but stone fences dreary to the eye and scorching to the touch at ross we took up our quarters at the kings arms once the house of mr kyrle the celebrated man of ross i gave the windowshutter a few verses which i shall add to the end of the letter the walk from llangunnog to bala over the mountains was most wild and romantic there are immense and rugged clefts in the mountains which in winter must form cataracts most tremendous now there is just enough sunglittering water dashed down over them to soothe not disturb the ear i climbed up a precipice on which was a large thorntree and slept by the side of one of them near two hours  at bala i was apprehensive that i had caught the itch from a welsh democrat who was charmed with my sentiments he bruised my hand with a grasp of ardour and i trembled lest some discontented citizens of the animalcular republic might have emigrated shortly after in came a clergyman well dressed and with him four other gentlemen i was asked for a public character i gave dr priestley the clergyman whispered his neighbour who it seems is the apothecary of the parishrepublicans accordingly when the

to calm the tempest by observing that however different our political opinions might be the appearance of a clergyman assured me that we were all christians though i found it rather difficult to reconcile the last sentiment with the spirit of christianity pho quoth the clergyman christianity why we ant at church now are we the gentlemans sentiment was a very good one because it shows him to be sincere in his principles welsh politics however could not prevail over welsh hospitality they all shook hands with me except the parson and said i was an openspeaking honesthearted fellow though i

wrexham the tower is most magnificent and in the church is a white marble monument of lady middleton superior mea quidem sententia to anything in westminster abbey it had entirely escaped my memory that wrexham was the residence of a miss e evans a young lady with whom in happier days i had been in habits of fraternal correspondence she lives with her grandmother as i was standing at the window of the inn she passed by and with her to my utter astonishment her sister mary evans quam afflictim et perdite amabamyea even to anguish they both started and gave a short cry almost a faint shriek i sickened and well nigh fainted but instantly retired had i appeared to recognise her my fortitude would not have supported me    vivit sed mihi non vivitnova forte marita   ah dolor alterius nunc a

anxiously doubtless they think themselves deceived by some face strikingly like me god bless her her image is in the sanctuary of my bosom and never can it be torn from thence but by the strings that grapple my heart to life this circumstance made me quite ill i had been wandering among the wildwood scenery and terrible graces of the welsh mountains to wear away not to revive the images of the pastbut love is a local anguish i am fifty miles distant and am not half so miserable  at denbigh is the finest ruined castle in the kingdom it surpassed everything i could have conceived i wandered there two hours in a still evening feeding upon melancholy two well dressed young men were roaming there i will play my flute here said the first it will have a romantic effect bless thee man of genius and sensibility i silently exclaimed he sate down amid the most awful part of the ruins the moon just began to make her rays predominant over the lingering daylight i preattuned my feelings to emotionand the romantic youth instantly struck up the sadly pleasing tunes of miss careythe british lion is my signa roaring trade i drive on c  three miles from denbigh on the road to st asaph is a fine bridge with one arch of great great grandeur stand at a little distance and through it you see the woods waving on the hillbank of the river in a most lovely point of view  a beautiful prospect is always more picturesque when seen at some little distance through an arch i have frequently thought of michael taylors way of viewing a landscape between his thighs under the arch was the most perfect echo i ever heard hucks sang sweet echo with great effect  at holywell i bathed in the famous st winifreds well it is an excellent cold bath at rudland is a fine ruined castle abergeley is a large village on the seacoast walking on the sea sands i was surprised to see a number of fine women bathing promiscuously with men and boys perfectly naked doubtless the citadels of their chastity are so impregnably strong that they need not the ornamental bulwarks of modesty but seriously speaking where sexual distinctions are least observed men and women live together in the greatest purity concealment sets the imagination aworking and as it were cantharadizes our desires  just before i quitted cambridge i met a countryman with a strange walkingstick five feet in length i eagerly bought it and a most faithful servant it has proved to me my sudden affection for it has mellowed into settled friendship on the morning of our leaving abergeley just before our final departure i looked for my stick in the place in which i had left it over night it was gone i alarmed the house no one knew any thing of it in the flurry of anxiety i sent for the crier of the town and gave him the following to cry about the town and the beach which he did with a gravity for which i am indebted to his stupidity  missing from the bee inn abergeley a curious walkingstick on one side it displays the head of an eagle the eyes of which represent rising suns and the ears turkish crescents on the other side is the portrait of the owner in woodwork beneath the head of the eagle is a welsh wig and around the neck of the stick is a queen elizabeths ruff in tin all down it waves the line of beauty in very ugly carving if any gentleman or lady has fallen in love with the above described stick and secretly carried off the same he or she is hereby earnestly admonished to conquer a passion the continuance of which must prove fatal to his or her honesty and if the said stick has slipped into such gentlemans or ladys hand through inadvertence he or she is required to rectify the mistake with all convenient speed god save the king  abergeley is a fashionable welsh watering place and so singular a proclamation excited no small crowd on the beach among the rest a lame old gentleman in whose hands was descried my dear stick the old gentleman who lodged at our inn felt great confusion and walked homewards the solemn crier before him and a various cavalcade behind him i kept the muscles of my face in tolerable subjection he made his lameness an apology for borrowing my stick supposed he should have returned before i had wanted it c c thus it ended except that a very handsome young lady put her head out of a coachwindow and begged my permission to have the bill which i had delivered to the crier i acceded to the request with a compliment that lighted up a blush on her cheek and a smile on her lip  we passed over a ferry to aberconway we had scarcely left the boat ere we descried brookes and berdmore with whom we have joined parties nor do we mean to separate our tour through anglesea to caernarvon has been repaid by scarcely one object worth seeing tomorrow we visit snowdon brookes berdmore and myself at the imminent hazard of our lives scaled the very summit of penmaenmaur it was a most dreadful expedition i will give you the account in some future letter  i sent for bowless works while at oxford how was i shocked every omission and every alteration disgusted taste and mangled sensibility surely some oxford toad had been squatting at the poets ear and spitting into it the cold venom of dulness it is not bowles he is still the same the added poems will prove it descriptive dignified tender sublime the sonnets added are exquisite abba thule has marked beauties and the little poem at southampton is a diamond in whatever light you place it it reflects beauty and splendour the shakespeare is sadly unequal to the rest yet in whose poems except those of bowles would it not have been excellent direct to me to be left at the post office bristol and tell me everything about yourself how you have spent the vacation c  believe me with gratitude and fraternal friendship  your obliged s t coleridge  footnote 1 long portions of this letter appear in a letter to southey of 15 september 1794 see letters p 74  footnote 2 hucks published in 1795 an account of the holiday entitled tour in north wales  on his return from this excursion coleridge went by appointment to bristol for the purpose of meeting southey whose person and conversation had excited in him the most lively admiration this was at the end of august or beginning of september southey whose mother then lived at bath came over to bristol accordingly to receive his new friend who had left as deep an impression on him and in that city introduced coleridge to robert lovell a young quaker then recently married to mary fricker and residing in the old market after a short stay at bristol where he first saw sarah fricker mrs lovells elder sister coleridge accompanied southey on his return to bath there he remained for some weeks principally engaged in making love and in maturing with his friend the plan which he had for some time cherished of a social community to be established in america upon what he termed a pantisocratical basis  much discussion has taken place regarding the origin of pantisocracy most writers on the subject attributing the scheme to coleridge a perusal of the letters of southey however leads to a different conclusion southey was enamoured during his stay at oxford with plato and especially with the republic of the greek philosopher and he frequently quotes from the work or refers to its principles in his correspondence with grosvenor and horace w bedford between 11th november 1793 and 12th june 1794 before his meeting with southey no trace of ideal republicanism appears in the letters of coleridge his leaning notwithstanding this was already towards republicanism and the friendship struck up between him and southey was a natural consequence of flint coming into contact with steel the next two letters to southey indicate the fiery nature of the young republicans    letter 9 to southey  6 sept 1794  the day after my arrival i finished the first act i transcribed it the next morning franklin of pembroke coll cam a cidevant grecian of our schoolso we call the first boys called on me and persuaded me to go with him and breakfast with dyer author of the complaints of the poor a subscription c c i went explained our system he was enraptured pronounced it impregnable he is intimate with dr priestley and doubts not that the doctor will join us he showed me some poetry and i showed him part of the first act which i happened to have about me he liked it hugely it was a nail that would drive every night i meet a most intelligent young man who has spent the last five years of his life in america and is lately come from thence as an agent to sell land he was of our school i had been kind to him he remembers it and comes regularly every evening to benefit by conversation he says he says £2000 will do that he doubts not we can contract for our passage under £400 that we shall buy the land a great deal cheaper when we arrive at america than we could do in england or why he adds am i sent over here that twelve men may easily clear 300 acres in four or five months and that for 600 dollars a thousand acres may be cleared and houses built on them he recommends the susquehanna from its excessive beauty and its security from hostile indians every possible assistance will be given us we may get credit for the land for ten years or more as we settle upon that literary characters make money there c c he never saw a bison in his life but has heard of them they are quite backwards the mosquitos are not so bad as our gnats and after you have been there a little while they dont trouble you much    letter 10 to

because he would not answer for his own sanity sitting so near a madman of genius he told me that the strength of my imagination had intoxicated my reason and that the acuteness of my reason had given a directing influ ence to my imagination four months ago the remark would not have been more elegant than just now it is nothing 1  footnote 1 this letter is given in full in letters no xxxiv   these letters show that pantisocracy was now the all absorbing topic  the following letter written at this time by coleridge to mr charles heath of monmouth is a curious evidence of his earnestness upon this subject     letter 11 to charles heath of monmouth 1  1794  sir  your brother has introduced my name to you i shall therefore offer no apology for this letter a small but liberalized party have formed a scheme of emigration on the principles of an abolition of individual property of their political creed and the arguments by which they support and elucidate it they are preparing a few copiesnot as meaning to publish them but for private distribution in this work they will have endeavoured to prove the exclusive justice of the system and its practicability nor will they have omitted to sketch out the code of contracts necessary for the internal regulation of the society all of which will of course be submitted to the improvements and approbation of each component member as soon as the work is printed one or more copies shall be transmitted to you of the characters of the individuals who compose the party i find it embarrassing to speak yet vanity apart i may assert with truth that they have each a sufficient strength of head to make the virtues of the heart respectable and that they are all highly charged with that enthusiasm which results from strong perceptions of moral rectitude called into life and action by ardent feelings with regard to pecuniary matters it is found necessary if twelve men with their families emigrate on this system that £2000 should be the aggregate of their contributionsbut infer not from hence that each mans quota is to be settled with the littleness of arithmetical accuracy no all will strain every nerve and then i trust the surplus money of some will supply the deficiencies of others the minutiae of topographical information we are daily endeavouring to acquire at present our plan is to settle at a distance but at a convenient distance from coopers town on the banks of the susquehanna this however will be the object of future investigation for the time of emigration we have fixed on next march in the course of the winter

bristol and there commenced man  the whole spring and summer of this year he devoted to public lectures at bristol making in the intervals several excursions in somersetshire one memorial of which remains in the lines composed while climbing brockley combe it was in one of these excursions that mr coleridge and mrwordsworth first met at the house of mr pinney 1 the first six of those lectures constituted a course presenting a comparative view of the civil war under charles i and the french revolution three of them or probably the substance of four or five were published at bristol in the latter end of 1795 the first two together with the title of conciones ad populum and the third with that of the plot discovered the eloquent passage in conclusion of the first of these addresses was written by mr southey the tone throughout them all is vehemently hostile to the policy of the great minister of that day but it is equally opposed to the spirit and maxims of jacobinism it was late in life that after a reperusal of these conciones coleridge wrote on a blank page of one of them the following wordsexcept the two or three pages involving the doctrine of philosophical necessity and unitarianism i see little or nothing in these outbursts of my youthful zeal to retract and with the exception of some flamecoloured epithets applied to persons as to mr pitt and others or rather to personificationsfor such they really were to meas little to regret  another course of six lectures followed on revealed religion its corruptions and its political views the prospectus statesthat these lectures are intended for two classes of men christians and infidelsthe former that they may be able to give a reason for the hope that is in themthe latter that they may not determine against christianity from arguments applicable to its corruptions only nothing remains of these addresses nor of two detached lectures on the slave trade and the hair powder tax which were delivered in the interval between the two principal courses they were all very popular amongst the opponents of the governments and those on religion in particular were highly applauded by his unitarian auditors

been requested to attend and while ruminating on the subject i received from mr c the following communication  footnote 1 letter li is our no 14 lii is dated 13 november 1795    letter 15 to cottle  dec 1795  my dear friend  i am fearful that you felt hurt at my not mentioning to you the proposed watchman and from my not requesting you to attend the meeting my dear friend my reasons were these all who met were expected to become subscribers to a fund i knew there would be enough without you and i knew and felt how much money had been drawn from you lately  god almighty love you  s t c   it is unknown says cottle when the following letter was received although quite certain that it was not the evening in which mr coleridge wrote his ode to the departing year and it is printed in this place at something of an uncertainty the probable date is 1 january 1796    letter 16 to cottle  january 1st 1796  my dear cottle  i have been forced to disappoint not only you but dr beddoes on an affair of some importance last night i was induced by strong and joint solicitation to go to a cardclub to which mr morgan belongs and after the playing was over to sup and spend the remainder of the night having made a previous compact that i should not drink however just on the verge of twelve i was desired to drink only one wine glass of punch in honour of the departing year and after twelve one other in honour of the new year though the glasses were very small yet such was the effect produced during my sleep that i awoke unwell and in about twenty minutes after had a relapse of my bilious complaint i am just now recovered and with care i doubt not shall be as well as ever tomorrow if i do not see you then it will be from some relapse which i have no reason thank heaven to anticipate  yours affectionately  s t coleridge   the mr morgan referred to in the above letter was john james morgan with whom coleridge afterwards lived in london at hammersmith and at calne dr beddoes was the founder of the pneumatic institution and the friend of the wedgwoods and humphry davy and it was he who was instrumental in introducing coleridge to these acquaintances  the monthly anxiety of a magazine justly alarmed coleridge on the 7th of october yet in the december following he courageously engaged to conduct a weekly political miscellany this was the watchman of which the following prospectus was in that month printed and circulated  to supply at once the places of a review newspaper and annual register  on tuesday the ist of march 1796 will be published no 1 price fourpence of a miscellany to be continued every eighth day under the name of the watchman by samuel taylor coleridge this miscellany will be comprised in two sheets or thirtytwo pages closely printed in 8vo the type long primer its contents 1a history of the domestic and foreign policy of the preceding days 2the speeches in both houses of parliament and during the recess select parliamentary speeches from the commencement of the reign of charles i to the present æra with notes historical and biographical 3original essays and poetry 4review of interesting and important publications its advantages 1 there being no advertisements a greater quantity of original matter will be given and the speeches in parliament will be less abridged 2 from its form it may be bound up at the end of a year and become an annual register 3 this last circumstance may induce men of letters to prefer this miscellany to more perishable publications as the vehicle of their effusions 4 whenever the ministerial and opposition prints differ in their accounts of occurrences etc such difference will always be faithfully stated  mr c went to bristol in the beginning of december for the purpose of arranging the preliminaries of this undertaking and at the close of the month he set off upon the tour mentioned in chapter x of the biographia literaria to collect subscribers it will be remembered that he was at this time a professed unitarian and the project of becoming a minister of that persuasion seems to have passed through his head he had previously preached for the first time two sermons at mr jardines chapel in bath the subjects being the corn laws and the hair powder tax he appeared in the pulpit in a blue coat and white waistcoat and according to mr cottles testimony who was present coleridge delivered himself languidly and disappointed every one but there is no doubt that he subsequently preached upon many occasions with very remarkable effect the following extracts are from letters written by mr c in the month of january 1796 during his tour to his early and lasting friend mr josiah wade of bristol and may serve as a commentary on parts of the accounts given of the same tour in the biographia literaria   letter 17 to josiah wade  worcester january 1796  my dear wade  we were five in number and twentyfive in quantity the moment i entered the coach i stumbled on a huge projection which might be called a belly with the same propriety that you might name mount atlas a molehill heavens that a man should be unconscionable enough to enter a stage coach who would want elbow room if he were walking on salisbury plain  the said citizen was a most violent aristocrat but a pleasant humorous fellow in other respects and remarkably well informed in agricultural science so that the time passed pleasantly enough we arrived at worcester at halfpast two i of course dined at the inn where i met mr stevens after dinner i christianized myself that is washed and changed and marched in finery and clean linen to high street with regard to business there is no chance of doing anything at worcester the aristocrats are so numerous and the influence of the clergy is so extensive that mr barr thinks no bookseller will venture to publish the watchman   s t coleridge  psi hope and trust the young citizeness is well and also mrs wade give my love to the latter and a kiss for me to miss bratinella    letter 18  birmingham january 1796  my dear friend   my exertions here have been incessant for in whatever company i go i am obliged to be the figurante of the circle yesterday i preached twice and indeed performed the whole service morning and afternoon there were about 1400 persons present and my sermons great part extempore were preciously peppered with politics i have here at least double the number of subscribers i had expected     it was at birmingham that coleridge met the tallow chandler whom he has immortalized in his biographia literaria the sketch of the taperman of lights is one of the masterpieces of english humour   letter 19 to josiah wade  nottingham january 1796  my dear friend  you will perceive by this letter i have changed my route from birmingham on friday last four oclock in the morning i proceeded to derby stayed there till monday morning and am now at nottingham from nottingham i go to sheffield from sheffield to manchester from manchester to liverpool from liverpool to london from london to bristol ah what a weary way my poor crazy ark has been tossed to and fro on an ocean of business and i long for the mount ararat on which it is to rest at birmingham i was extremely unwell a violent cold in my head and limbs confined me for two days business succeeded very wellabout a hundred subscribers i think  at derby also i succeeded tolerably well mr joseph strutt the successor of sir richard arkwright tells me i may count on forty or fifty in derby derby is full of curiositiesthe cotton and silk mills wright the painter and dr darwinl the every thing but christian dr darwin possesses perhaps a greater range of knowledge than any other man in europe and is the most inventive of philosophical men he thinks in a new train on all subjects but religion he bantered me on the subject of religion i heard all his arguments and told him it was infinitely consoling to me to find that the arguments of so great a man adduced against the existence of a god and the evidences of revealed religion were such as had startled me at fifteen but had become the objects of my smile at twenty not one new objectionnot even an ingenious one he boasted that he had never read one book in favour of such stuff but that he had read all the works of infidels  what would you think mr wade of a man who having abused and ridiculed you should openly declare that he had heard all that your enemies had to say against you but had scorned to inquire the truth from any one of your friends would you think him an honest man i am sure you would not yet such are all the infidels whom i have known they talk of a subject yet are proud to confess themselves profoundly ignorant of it dr darwin would have been ashamed to reject huttons theory of the earth without having minutely examined ityet what is it to us how the earth was made a thing impossible to be known this system the doctor did not reject without having severely studied it but all at once he makes up his mind on such important subjects as whether we be the outcasts of a blind idiot called nature2 or the children of an all wise and infinitely good godwhether we spend a few miserable years on this earth and then sink into a clod of the valley or endure the anxieties of mortal life only to fit us for the enjoyment of immortal happiness these subjects are unworthy a philosophers investigation he deems that there is a certain self evidence in infidelity and becomes an atheist by intuition well did st paul say ye have an evil heart of unbelief     what lovely children mr barr of worcester has after church in the evening they sat round and sang hymns so sweetly that they overpowered me it was with great difficulty that i abstained from weeping aloud and the infant in mrs bs arms leaned forward and stretched his little arms and stared and smiled it seemed a picture of heaven where the different orders of the blessed join different voices in one melodious hallelujah and the babe looked like a young spirit just that moment arrived in heaven startled at the seraphic songs and seized at once with wonder and rapture     from your affectionate friend  s t coleridge  footnote 1 erasmus darwin 17311802  footnote 2 see poem human life written about 1815    letter 20  sheffield january 1796  my very dear friend  i arrived at this place late last night by the mail from nottingham where i have been treated with kindness and friendship of which i can give you but a faint idea i preached a charity sermon there last sunday i preached in coloured clothes with regard to the gown at birmingham of which you inquire i suffered myself to be overpersuaded first of all my sermon being of so political a tendency had i worn my blue coat it would have impugned edwards they would have said he had stuck a political lecturer in his pulpit secondly the society is of all sortssocinians arians trinitarians etc and i must have shocked a multitude of prejudices and thirdly there is a difference between an inn and a place of residence in the first your example is of little consequence in a single instance only it ceases to operate as example and my refusal would have been imputed to affectation or an unaccommodating spirit  assuredly i would not do it in a place where i intended to preach often and even in the vestry at birmingham when they at last persuaded me i told them i was acting against my better knowledge and should possibly feel uneasy afterwards so these accounts of the matter you must consider as reasons and palliations concluding i plead guilty my lord indeed i want firmness i perceive i do i have that within me which makes it difficult to say no repeatedly to a number of persons who seem uneasy and anxious     my kind remembrances to mrs wade god bless her and you and like a bad shilling slipped in between two guineas your faithful and affectionate friend s t coleridge  note 1 letter liii is our 19    letter 21  manchester january 7 1796 my dear friend  i arrived at manchester last night from sheffield to which place i shall only send about thirty numbers i might have succeeded there at least equally well with the former towns but i should injure the sale of the iris the editor of which paper a very amiable and ingenious young man of the name of james montgomery1 is now in prison for a libel on a bloodyminded magistrate there of course i declined publicly advertising or disposing of the watch man in that town  this morning i called on mr  with hs letter mr  received me as a rider and treated me with insolence that was really amusing from its novelty overstocked with these articles  people always setting up some new thing or other  i read the star and another paper what could i want with this paper which is nothing morewell well ill consider of it to these entertaining bons mots i returned the following reparteegood morning sir     god bless you s t c  footnote 1 the poet 17711854   mr c went to liverpool and was as successful there as elsewhere generally in procuring subscribers to the watchman the late dr crompton found him out and became his friend and patron his exertions however at liverpool were suddenly stopped by news of the critical state of mrs cs health and a pressing request that he would immediately return to bristol whither mrs c had now gone from clevedon coleridge accordingly gave up his plan of visiting london and left liverpool on his homeward trip from lichfield he wrote to mr wade the following letter    letter 22  lichfield january 1796  my dear friend     i have succeeded very well here at lichfield belcher bookseller birmingham sutton nottingham pritchard derby and thomson manchester are the publishers in every number of the watchman there will be printed these words published in bristol by the author s t coleridge and sold etc  i verily believe no poor fellows ideapot ever bubbled up so vehemently with fears doubts and difficulties as mine does at present heaven grant it may not boil over and put out the fire i am almost heartless my past life seems to me like a dream a feverish dreamall one gloomy huddle of strange actions and dimdiscovered motivesfriendships lost by indolence and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibility the present hour i seem in a quickset hedge of embarrassments for shame i ought not to mistrust god but indeed to hope is far more difficult than to fear bulls have horns lions have talons   the fox and statesman subtle wiles ensure the cit and polecat stink and are secure toads with their venom doctors with their drug the priest and hedgehog in their robes are snug oh nature cruel stepmother and hard to thy poor naked fenceless child the bard no horns but those by luckless hymen worn and those alas not amalthaeas horn with naked feelings and with aching pride he bears the unbroken blast on every side vampire booksellers drain him to the heart and scorpion critics cureless venom dart      s t c   coleridge on his return to bristol resided for a short time on redcliff hill in a house occupied by mrs cs mother he had procured upwards of a thousand subscribers names to the watchman and had certainly some ground for confidence in his future success his tour had been a triumph and the impression made by his personal demeanour and extraordinary eloquence was unprecedented and such as was never effaced from the recollection of those who met with him at this period he seems to have employed the interval between his arrival in bristol and the 1st of marchthe day fixed for the appearance of the watchmanin preparing for that work and also in getting ready the materials of his first volume of poems the copyright of which was purchased by mr cottle for thirty guineas coleridge was a student all his life he was very rarely indeed idle in the common sense of the term but he was constitutionally indolent averse from continuous exertion externally directed and consequently the victim of a procrastinating habit the occasion of innumerable distresses to himself and of endless solicitude to his friends and which materially impaired though it could not destroy the operation and influence of his wonderful abilities hence also the fits of deep melancholy which from time to time seized his whole soul during which he seemed an imprisoned man without hope of liberty in february 1796 whilst his volume was in the press he wrote the following letter to mr cottle     letter 23  my dear cottle  i have this night and tomorrow for you being alone and my spirits calm i shall consult my poetic honour and of course your interest more by staying at home than by drinking tea with you i should be happy to see my poems out even by next week and i shall continue in stirrups that is shall not dismount my pegasus till monday morning at which time you will have to thank god for having done with your affectionate friend always but author evanescent  s t c  the last letter is one of many short notes to cottle explaining why he was not making progress with the proposed volume of poems the next is the concluding letter of the series still apologizing for the delay     letter 24 to cottle  stowey feb 1796  my dear cottle  i feel it much and very uncomfortable that loving you as a brother and feeling pleasure in pouring out my heart to you i should so seldom be able to write a letter to you unconnected with business and uncontaminated with excuses and apologies i give every moment i can spare from my garden and the reviews ie from my potatoes and meat to the poem religious musings but i go on slowly for i torture the poem and myself with corrections and what i write in an hour i sometimes take two or three days in correcting you may depend on it the poem and prefaces will take up exactly the number of pages i mentioned and i am extremely anxious to have the work as perfect as possible and which i cannot do if it be finished immediately the religious musings i have altered monstrously since i read them to you and received your criticisms i shall send them to you in my next the sonnets i will send you with the musings god love you  from your affectionate friend  s t coleridge  shortly afterwards mistaking the object of a message from mr cottle for an application for copy for the press coleridge wrote the following letter with reference to the painful subject    letter 25  redcliff hill february 22 1796  my dear sir  it is my duty and business to thank god for all his dispensations and to believe them the best possible but indeed i think i should have been more thankful if he had made me a journeyman shoemaker instead of an author by trade i have left my friends i have left plenty i have left that ease which would have secured a literary immortality and have enabled me to give to the public works conceived in moments of inspiration and polished with leisurely solicitude and alas for what have i left them forwho deserted me in the hour of distress and for a scheme of virtue impracticable and romantic so i am forced to write for breadwrite the flights of poetic enthusiasm when every minute i am hearing a groan from my wife groans and complaints and sickness the present hour i am in a quickset hedge of embarrassment and whichever way i turn a thorn runs into me the future is cloud and thick darkness poverty perhaps and the thin faces of them that want bread looking up to me nor is this all my happiest moments for composition are broken in upon by the reflection that i must make haste i am too late i am already months behind i have received my pay beforehando wayward and desultory spirit of genius ill canst thou brook a taskmaster the tenderest touch from the hand of obligation wounds thee like a scourge of scorpions  i have been composing in the fields this morning and came home to write down the first rude sheet of my preface when i heard that your man had brought a note from you i have not seen it but i guess its contents i am writing as fast as i can depend on it you shall not be out of pocket for me i feel what i owe you and independently of this i love you as a friendindeed so much that i regret seriously regret that you have been my copyholder  if i have written petulantly forgive me god knows i am sore all over god bless you and believe me that setting gratitude aside i love and esteem you and have your interest at heart full as much as my own  s t coleridge 1  on the 1st of march 1796 the watchman was published it ended with the tenth number on the 13th of may following in march mr c removed to a house in oxford street in kingsdown and thence wrote the following letter to mr poole  1 letter liv is our 25     letter 26  30th march 1796  my dear poole  for the neglect in the transmission of the watchman you must blame george burnett who undertook the business i however will myself see it sent this week with the preceding numbers i am greatly obliged to you for your communicationon the slave trade in no vit appears in this number i am anxious to receive more from you and likewise to know what you dislike in the watchman and what you like but particularly the former you have not given me your opinion of the plot discovered  since you last saw me i have been well nigh distracted the repeated and most injurious blunders of my printer out of doors and mrs coleridges danger at homeadded to the gloomy prospect of so many mouths to open and shut like puppets as i move the string in the eating and drinking waybut why complain to you misery is an article with which every market is so glutted that it can answer no ones purpose to export it  i have received many abusive letters postpaid thanks to the friendly malignants but i am perfectly callous to disapprobation except when it tends to lessen profit then indeed i am all one tremble of sensibility marriage having taught me the wonderful uses of that vulgar commodity yclept bread the watchman succeeds so as to yield a breadandcheesish profit mrs coleridge is recovering apace and deeply regrets that she was deprived of the pleasure of seeing you we are in our new house where there is a bed at your service whenever you will please to delight us with a visit surely in spring you might force a few days into a sojourning with us  dear poole you have borne yourself towards me most kindly with respect to my epistolary ingratitude but i know that you forbade yourself to feel resentment towards me because you had previously made my neglect ingratitude a generous temper endures a great deal from one whom it has obliged deeply  my poems are finished i will send you two copies the moment they are published in no iii of the watchman there are a few lines entitled the hour when we shall meet again dim hour that sleepst on pillowing clouds afar which i think you will like i have received two or three letters from different anonymi requesting me to give more poetry one of them writes thus   sir i detest your principles your prose i think very so so but your poetry is so beautiful that i take in your watchman solely on account of it in justice therefore to me and some others of my stamp i entreat you to give us more verse and less democratic scurrility your admirernot esteemer   have you read over dr lardner on the logos it is i think scarcely possible to read it and not be convinced i find that the watchman comes more easy to me so that i shall begin about my christian lectures meaning a publication of the course given in the preceding year i will immediately order for you unless you immediately countermand it count rumfords essays in no v of the watchman you will see why that number contained a critique on the essays i have enclosed dr beddoess late pamphlets neither of them as yet published the doctor sent them to me my dutiful love to your excellent mother whom believe me i think of frequently and with a pang of affection god bless you ill try and contrive to scribble a line and half every time the man goes with the watchman to you  nb the essay on fasting i am ashamed ofin no ii of the watchmanbut it is one of my misfortunes that i am obliged to publish ex tempore as well as compose god bless you  s t coleridge1  footnote 1 letter lv is our 26    two days afterwards mr coleridge wrote to mr b flower then the editor of the cambridge intelligencer with whom he had been acquainted at the university     letter 27  april 1 1796  dear sir  i transmitted to you by mr b a copy of my conciones ad populum and of an address against the bills meaning the plot discovered i have taken the liberty of enclosing ten of each carriage paid which you may perhaps have an opportunity of disposing of for meif not give them away the one is an eighteenpenny affairthe other ninepence i have likewise enclosed the numbers which have been hitherto published of the watchmansome of the poetry may perhaps be serviceable to you in your paper that sonnet on the rejection of mr wilberforces bill in your chronicle the week before last was written by southey author of joan of arc a year and a half ago and sent to me per letterhow it appeared with the late signature let the plagiarist answer i have sent a copy of my poemsthey were not yet publishedwill you send them to lunn and deighton and ask of them whether they would choose to have their names on the title page as publishers and would you permit me to have yours robinson and i believe cadell will be the london publishers be so kind as to send an immediate answer  please to present one of each of my pamphlets to mr hallthe late robert hall the baptist i wish i could reach the perfection of his style i think his style the best in the english language if he have a rival it is mrs barbauld  you have of course seen bishop watsons apology for the bible it is a complete confutation of paine but that was no difficult matter the most formidable infidel is lessing the author of emilia galottii ought to have written was for he is dead his book is not yet translated and is entitled in german fragments of an anonymous author it unites the wit of voltaire with the subtlety of hume and the profound erudition of our lardner i had some thoughts of translating it with an answer but gave it up lest men whose tempers and hearts incline them to disbelief should get hold of it and though the answers are satisfactory to my own mind they may not be equally so to the minds of others  i suppose you have heard that i am married i was married on the 4th of october  i rest all my poetical credit on the religious musings farewell with high esteem yours sincerely  s t coleridge   benjamin flower the editor of the cambridge intelligencer printed the first published version of the monody on chatterton in his edition of the rowley poems 1794 he was also to have been the publisher of the imitations of the latin poets of which coleridge spoke so often at this time our next letter is from the watchman of 1 april in answer to a correspondent godwin whom coleridge had hailed in one of his sonnets in the morning chronicle 10 january 1795 as one formed to illume a sunless world by his political justice 1793 is here attacked with some virulence in after years coleridge held a better opinion of godwin and wrote some of his finest letters to him    letter 28 to caius gracchus  you have attacked me because i ventured to disapprove of mr godwins works i notice your attack because it affords me an opportunity of expressing more fully my sentiments respecting those principlesi must not however wholly pass over the former part of your letter the sentence implicating them with party and calumniating opinions is so inaccurately worded that i must guess at your meaning in my first essay i stated that literary works were generally reviewed by personal friends or private enemies of the authors this i know to be fact and does the spirit of meekness forbid us to tell the truth the passage in my review of mr burkes late pamphlet you have wilfully misquoted with respect to the work in question is an addition of your own that work in question i myself considered as mere declamation and therefore deemed it wofully inferior to the former production of the venerable fanaticin what manner i could add to my numerous ideal trophies by quoting a beautiful passage from the pages which i was reviewing i am ignorant perhaps the spirit of vanity lurked in the use of the word iere i begin the task of blame it is pleasant to observe with what absurd anxiety this little monosyllable is avoided sometimes the present writer appears as its substitute sometimes the modest author adopts the style of royalty swelling and multiplying himself into we and sometimes to escape the egotistic phrases of in my opinion or as i think he utters dogmas and positively assertsexempli gratia it is a work which etc you deem me inconsistent because having written in praise of the metaphysician i afterwards appear to condemn the essay on political justice would an eulogist of medical men be inconsistent if he should write against vendors of what he deemed poisons without even the formality of a since or a for or a because you make an unqualified assertion that this essay will be allowed by all except the prejudiced to be a deep metaphysical work though abstruse etc etc caius gracchus must have been little accustomed to abstruse disquisitions if he deem mr godwins work abstrusea chief and certainly not a small merit is its perspicuous and popular language my chapter on modern patriotism is that which has irritated you you condemn me as prejudicedo this enlightened age when it can be seriously charged against an essayist that he is prejudiced in favour of gratitude conjugal fidelity filial affection and the belief of god and a hereafter     of smart pretty fellows in bristol are numbers some   who so modish are grown that they think plain sense cumbersome   and lest they should seem to be queer or ridiculous   they affect to believe neither god nor old nicholas1   i do consider mr godwins principles as vicious and his book as a pander to sensuality once i thought otherwisenay even addressed a complimentary sonnet to the author in the morning chronicle of which i confess with much moral and poetical contrition that the lines and the subject were equally bad i have since studied his work and long before you had sent me your contemptuous challenge had been preparing an examination of it which will shortly appear in the watchman in a series of essays you deem me an enthusiastan enthusiast i presume because i am not quite convinced with yourself and mr godwin that mind will be omnipotent over matter that a plough will go into the field and perform its labour without the presence of the agriculturist that man may be immortal in this life and that death is an act of the willyou conclude with wishing that the watchman for the future may be conducted with less prejudice and greater liberalityi ought to be considered in two charactersas editor of the miscellany and as a frequent contributor in the latter i contribute what i believe to be the truth let him who thinks it error contribute likewise that where the poison is there the antidote may be in my former that is as the editor i leave to the public the business of canvassing the nature of the principles and assume to myself the power of admitting or rejecting any communications according to my best judgment of their style and ingenuity the miscellany is open to all ingenious men whatever their opinions may be whether they be the disciples of filmer of locke of paley or of godwin one word more of the spirit of meekness i meant by this profession to declare my intention of attacking things without expressing malignity to persons i am young and may occasionally write with the intemperance of a young mans zeal let me borrow an apology from the great and excellent dr hartley who of all men least needed it i can truly say that my free and unreserved manner of speaking has flowed from the sincerity and earnestness of my heart but i will not undertake to justify all that i have said some things may be too hasty and censorious or however be unbecoming my age and station i heartily wish that i could have observed the true medium

fasts i am ashamed of it was conceived in the spirit and clothed in the harsh scoffing of an infidel you wish to have one long essayso should i wish but so do not my subscribers wish i feel the perplexities of my undertaking increase daily in london and bristol the watchman is read for its original matterthe news and debates barely tolerated the people of liverpool manchester and birmingham etc take it as a newspaper and regard the essays and poems as intruders unwished for and unwelcome in short each subscriber instead of regarding himself as a point in the circumference entitled to some one diverging ray considers me as the circumference and himself as the centre to which all the rays ought to converge to tell you the truth i do not think the watchman will succeed hitherto i have scarcely sold enough to pay the expensesno wonder when i tell you that on the 200 which parsons in paternoster row sells weekly he gains eight shillings more than i do nay i am convinced that at the end of the half year he will have cleared considerably more by his 200 than i by the proprietorship of the whole work  colson has been indefatigable in my service and writes with such zeal for my interests and such warmth of sorrow for my sufferings as if he wrote with fire and tears god bless him i wish above all things to realize a school i could be well content to plod from morning to night if only i could secure a secure competence but to toil incessantly for uncertain bread weighs me down to earth  your nightdream has been greatly admired dr beddoes spoke in high commendation of it your thoughts on elections i will insert whenever parliament is dissolved i will insert them as the opinions of a sensible correspondent entering my individual protest against giving a vote in any way or for any person if you had an estate in the swamps of essex you could not prudently send an aguish man there to be your managerhe would be unfit for ityou could not honestly send a hale hearty man there for the situation would to a moral certainty give him the ague so with the parliamenti will not send a rogue there and i would not send an honest man for it is twenty to one that he will become a rogue  count rumfords essays you shall have by the next parcel i thank you for your kind permission with respect to books i have sent down to you elegiac stanzas by bowles they were given to me but are altogether unworthy of bowles i have sent you beddoess essay on the merits of william pitt you may either keep it and i will get another for myself on your account or if you see nothing in it to libraryize it send it me back next thursday or whenever you have read it my own poems you will welcome i pin all my poetical credit on the religious musings in the poem you so much admired in the

of the latter to him throughout the whole affair was expressed in the following manner on a blank leaf in a copy of the work     letter 30  dear cottle  on the blank leaf of my poems i can most appropriately write my acknowledgments to you for your too disinterested conduct in the purchase of them indeed if ever they should acquire a name and character it might be truly said the world owed them to you had it not been for you none perhaps of them would have been published and some not written  your obliged and affectionate friend  s t coleridge  bristol april 15 1796   another project of coleridge to earn a small sum to tide over financial difficulties was to rumfordise the cities of england coleridge reviewed rumfords essays in the watchman of 2nd april count rumford count of the holy roman empire had cleared certain cities of austria of beggars and vagabonds and had established garden cities for the soldiery practising agricultural pursuits and engaging in remunerative occupations during their nonattendance at drill what part of the rumfordising coleridge proposed to apply to his native country does not appear from the letter   letter 31 to cottle  apl 1796  my ever dear cottle  since i last conversed with you on the subject i have been thinking over again the plan i suggested to you concerning the application of count rumfords plan to the city of bristol i have arranged in my mind the manner and matter of the pamphlet which would be three sheets and might be priced at one shilling    considerations   addressed to the inhabitants of bristol   on a subject of importance   unconnected with politics    by s t c   now i have by me the history of birmingham and the history of manchester by observing the names revenues and expenditures of their different charities i could easily alter the calculations of the bristol address and at a trifling expense and a few variations the same work might be sent to manchester and birmingham considerations addressed to the inhabitants of birmingham etc i could so order it that by writing to a particular friend at both places the pamphlet should be thought to have been written at each place as it certainly would be for each place i think therefore 750 might be printed in all now will you undertake this either to print it and divide the profits or which indeed i should prefer would you give me three guineas for the copyright i would give you the first sheet on thursday the second on the monday following the third on the thursday following to each pamphlet i would annex the alterations to be made when the press was stopped at 250  god love you  s t c   cottle says regarding this project i presented mr c with the three guineas but forbore the publication     letter 32 to mr cottle  april 1796  my ever dear cottle  i will wait on you this evening at nine oclock till which hour i am on watch your wednesdays invitation i of course accept but i am rather sorry that you should add this expense to former liberalities  two editions of my poems would barely repay you is it not possible to get 25 or 30 of the poems ready by tomorrow as parsons of paternoster row has written to me pressingly about them people are perpetually asking after them all admire the poetry in the watchman he says i can send them with 100 of the first number which he has written for i think if you were to send half a dozen joans of arc 4to £1 1s 0d on sale or return it would not be amiss to all the places in the north we will send my poems my conciones and the joans of arc together per waggon you shall pay the carriage for the london and birmingham parcels i for the sheffield derby nottingham manchester and liverpool  with regard to the poems i mean to give away i wish to make it a common interest that is i will give away a sheet full of sonnets one to mrs barbauld one to wakefield one to dr beddoes one to wranghama college acquaintance of minean admirer of me and a pitier of my principlesone to george augustus pollen esq one to c lamb one to wordsworth one to my brother george and one to dr parr these sonnets i mean to write on the blank leaf respectively of each copy     god bless you and  s t coleridge   the sonnets says mr cottle never arrived but a pamphlet of 16 pages containing 28 sonnets was printed the only extant copy of which is in the dyce collection poems 1893 p 544     letter 33 to mr poole  6th may 1796  my very dear friend  the heart is a little relieved when vexation converts itself into anger but from this privilege i am utterly precluded by my own epistolary sins and negligences yet in very troth thou must be a hardhearted fellow to let me trot for four weeks together every thursday to the bear innto receive no letter i have sometimes thought that milton the carrier did not deliver my last parcel but he assures me he did  this morning i received a truly fraternal letter from your brother richard of sherborne containing good and acceptable advice he deems my religious musings too metaphysical for common readers i answerthe poem was not written for common readers in so miscellaneous a collection as i have presented to the public singula cuique should be the motto there are however instances of vicious affectation in the phraseology of that poemunshudderd unaghasted for example not in the poem now good writing is produced more effectually by rapidly glancing the language as it already exists than by a hasty recourse to the mint of invention the religious musings has more mind than the introduction of b ii of joan of arc destiny of nations poet w i p 98 but its versification is not equally rich it has more passages of sublimity but it has not that diffused air of severe dignity which characterizes my epic slice have i estimated my own performances rightly   with regard to my own affairs they are as bad as the most rampant philodespot could wish in the moment of cursing after no xii i shall cease to cry the state of the political atmosphere it is not pleasant thomas poole to have worked fourteen weeks for nothingfor nothing nay to have given to the public in addition to that toil £45 when i began the watchman i had £40 worth of paper given to me yet with this i shall not have received a farthing at the end of the quarter to be sure i have been somewhat fleeced and overreached by my london publisher in short my tradesmens bills for the watchman including what paper i have bought since the seventh number the printing etc amount exactly to £5 more than the whole of my receipts o watchman thou hast watched in vainsaid the prophet ezekiel when i suppose he was taking a prophetic glimpse of my sorrowsallowed cheeks  my plans are reduced to twothe first unpracticablethe second not likely to succeed  plan 1 i am studying german and in about six weeks shall be able to read that language with tolerable fluency now i have some thoughts of making a proposal to robinson the great london bookseller of translating all the works of schiller which would make a portly quarto on condition that he should pay my journey and my wifes to and from jena a cheap german university where schiller resides and allow me two guineas each quarto sheet which would maintain me if i could realize this scheme i should there study chemistry and anatomy and bring over with me all the works of semler and michaelis the german theologians and of kant the great german metaphysician on my return i would commence a school for either young men at £105 each proposing to perfect them in the following studies in this order1 man as an animalincluding the complete knowledge of anatomy chemistry mechanics and optics2 man as an intellectual beingincluding the ancient metaphysics the system of locke and hartleyof the scotch philosophersand the new kantean system3 man as a religious beingincluding an historic summary of all religions and of the arguments for and against natural and revealed religion then proceeding from the individual to the aggregate of individuals and disregarding all chronology except that of mind i should perfect them 1in the history of savage tribes 2of semibarbarous nations 3of nations emerging from semibarbarism 4of civilized states 5of luxurious states 6of revolutionary states 7of colonies during these studies i should intermix the knowledge of languages and instruct my scholars in belles lettres and the principles of composition  now seriously do you think that one of my scholars thus perfected would make a better senator than perhaps any one member in either of our housesbright bubbles of the ageebullient brain gracious heaven that a scheme so big with advantage to this kingdomtherefore to europetherefore to the worldshould be demolishable by one monosyllable from a booksellers mouth  my second plan is to become a dissenting minister and adjure politics and casual literature preaching for hire is not right because it must prove a strong temptation to continue to profess what i may have ceased to believe if ever maturer judgment with wider and deeper reading should lessen or destroy my faith in christianity but though not right in itself it may become right by the greater wrongness of the only alternativethe remaining in neediness and uncertainty that in the one case i should be exposed to temptation is a mere contingency that under necessitous circumstances i am exposed to great and frequent temptations is a melancholy certainty  write my dear poole or i will crimp all the rampant billingsgate of burke to abuse you count rumford is being reprinted  god bless you and  s t coleridge   on friday the 13th of may 1796 the tenth and last number of the watchman appearedthe author having wisely accelerated the termination of a hopeless undertaking the plan of which was as injudicious as the execution of it by him for any length of time impracticable of the 324 pages of which the watchman consists not more than a hundred contain original matter by coleridge and this is perhaps more remarkable as a test of the marvellous spring of his mind almost immediately afterwards than for any very striking merit of its own still however the nascent philosopher may be discovered in parts and the essay on the slave trade in the fourth number may be justly distinguished as comprising a perfect summary of the arguments applicable on either side of that question  in the meantime mr poole had been engaged in circulating a proposal amongst a few common friends for purchasing a small annuity and presenting it to mr coleridge the plan was not in fact carried into execution1 but it was communicated to mr c by mr poole and the following letter refers to it  footnote 1 an error a subscription annuity of £35 or £40 was collected and paid to coleridge in 1796 and 1797     letter 34 to mr poole  12th may 1796  poole the spirit who counts the throbbings of the solitary heart knows that what my feelings ought to be such they are if it were in my power to give you anything which i have not already given i should be oppressed by the letter now before me but no i feel myself rich in being poor and because i have nothing to bestow i know how much i have bestowed perhaps i shall not make myself intelligible but the strong and unmixed affection which i bear to you seems to exclude all emotions of gratitude and renders even the principle of esteem latent and inert its presence is not perceptible though its absence could not be endured  concerning the scheme itself i am undetermined not that i am ashamed to receivegod forbid i will make every possible exertion my industry shall be at least commensurate with my learning and talentsif these do not procure for me and mine the necessary comforts of life i can receive as i would bestow and in either casereceiving or bestowingbe equally grateful to my almighty benefactor i am undetermined thereforenot because i receive with pain and reluctance butbecause i suspect that you attribute to others your own enthusiasm of benevolence as if the sun should saywith how rich a purple those opposite windows are burning but with gods permission i shall talk with you on this subject by the last page of no x you will perceive that i have this day dropped the watchman on monday morning i will go per caravan to bridgewater where if you have a horse of tolerable meekness unemployed you will let him meet me  i should blame you for the exaggerated terms in which you have spoken of me in the proposal did i not perceive the motive you wished to make it appear an

the month of june 1796 was spent in bristol and some negotiation took place as to mr cs settling in nottingham the particulars of which the editor is unable to state on the 4th of july mr coleridge writes to mr poole    letter 36 to mr poole  4th july 1796  my very dear poole  do not attribute it to indolence that i have not written to you suspense has been the real cause of my silence day after day i have confidently expected some decisive letter and as often have been disappointed certainly i shall have one tomorrow noon and then i will write thus i contemplated the time of my silence in its small component parts forgetful into what a sum total they were swelling as i have heard nothing from nottingham notwithstanding i have written a pressing letter i have by the advice of cottle and dr beddoes accepted a proposal of mr perrys the editor of the morning chronicleaccepted it with a heavy and reluctant heart on thursday perry was at bristol for a few hours just time enough to attend the dying moments of his associate in the editorship mr grey whom dr beddoes attended perry desired dr b to inform me that if i would come up to london and write for him he would make me a regular compensation adequate to the maintenance of myself and mrs coleridge and requested an immediate answer by the post mr estlin and charles danvers and mr wade are or were all out of towni had no one to advise with except dr beddoes and cottle dr b thinks it a good opening on account of greys death but i rather think that the intention is to employ me as a mere hackney without any share of the profits however as i am doing nothing and in the prospect of doing nothing settled i was afraid to give way to the omenings of my heart and accordingly i accepted his proposal in general terms requesting a line from him expressing the particulars both of my proposed occupation and stipend this i shall receive tomorrow i suppose and if i do i think of hiring a horse for a couple of days and galloping down to you to have all your advice which indeed if it should be for rejecting the proposals i might receive by post but if for finally accepting them we could not interchange letters in a time sufficiently short for perrys needs and so he might procure another person possibly at all events i should not like to leave this part of englandperhaps for everwithout seeing you once more i am very sad about it for i love bristol and i do not love london and besides local and temporary politics have become my aversion they narrow the understanding and at least acidulate the heart but those two giants yclept bread and cheese bend me into compliance i must do something if i go farewell philosophy farewell the muse farewell my literary fame  my poems have been reviewed the monthly has cataracted panegyric on me the critical cascaded it and the analytical dribbled it with civility as to the british critic they durst not condemn and they would not praiseso contented themselves with commending me as a poet and allowed me tenderness of sentiment and elegance of fiction i am so anxious and uneasy that i really cannot write any further my kind and fraternal love to your sister and my filial respects to your dear mother and believe me to be in my head heart and soul yours most sincerely  s t coleridge   the editor can find no further trace of the proposed connection with the morning chronicle but almost immediately after the date of the preceding letter mr coleridge received an invitation from mrs evans then of barley near derby to visit her with a view to his undertaking the education of her sons he and mrs c accordingly went to barley where the matter was arranged to the satisfaction of both parties and mr c returned to bristol alone with the intention of visiting his mother and brother at ottery before leaving the south of england for what promised to be a long absence but this project like others ended in nothing the other guardians of mrs es sons considered a public education proper for them and the announcement of this resolution to mr c at bristol stopped his further progress and recalled him to darley after a stay of some ten days he left darley with mrs c and visited mr thomas hawkes at mosely near birmingham and thence he wrote to mr poole     letter 37 to mr poole  august 1796  my beloved friend  i was at matlock the place monodized by bowles when your letter arrived at darley and i did not receive it till near a week afterwards my very dear poole i wrote to you the whole truth after the first moment i was perfectly composed and from that moment to the present have continued calm and lighthearted i had just quitted you and i felt myself rich in your love and esteem and you do not know how rich i feel myself o ever found the same and trusted and beloved  the last sentences of your letter affected me more than i can well describe words and phrases which might perhaps have adequately expressed my feelings the coldblooded children of this world have anticipated and exhausted in their unmeaning gabble of flattery i use common expressions but they do not convey common feelings my heart has thanked you i preached on faith yesterday i said that faith was infinitely better than good works as the cause is greater than the effectas a fruitful tree is better than its fruits and as a friendly heart is of far higher value than the kindnesses which it naturally and necessarily prompts it is for that friendly heart that i now have thanked you and which i so eagerly accept for with regard to settlement i am likely to be better off now than before as i shall proceed to tell you  i arrived at darley on the sunday monday i spent at darley on the tuesday mrs coleridge miss willett and i went in mrs evanss carriage to matlock where we stayed till saturday sunday we spent at darley and on monday sara mrs evans and myself visited oakover a seat famous for a few firstrates of raffael and titian thence to ilam a quiet vale hung round with wood beautiful beyond expression and thence to dovedale a place beyond expression tremendously sublime here in a cavern at the head of a divine little fountain we dined on cold meat and returned to darley quite worn out with the succession of sweet sensations on tuesday we were employed in packing up and on wednesday we were to have set off but on the wednesday dr crompton who had just returned from liverpool called on me and made me the following proposalthat if i would take a house in derby and open a dayschool confining my number to twelve scholars he would send three of his children on these termstill my number should be completed he would allow me £100 a year for themwhen the number should be complete he would give £21 a year for each of themthe children to be with me from nine to twelve and from two to fivethe last two hours to be employed with their writing or drawingmaster who would be paid by the parents he has no doubt but that i shall complete my number almost instantly now 12 x 20 guineas  £252 and my mornings and evenings at my own disposal  good things so i accepted the offer it being understood that if anything better offered i should accept it there was not a house to be got in derby but i engaged with a man for a house now building and which is to be completed by the 8th of october for £12 a year and the landlord to pay all the taxes except the poor rates the landlord is rather an intelligent fellow and has promised me to rumfordize the chimneys the plan is to commence in november the intermediate time i spend at bristol at which place i shall arrive by the blessing of god on monday night next this week i spend with mr hawkes at mosely near birmingham in whose shrubbery i now write i arrived here on friday having left derby on friday i preached here yesterday  if sara will let me i shall see you for a few days in the course of a month direct your next letter to s t c oxford street bristol my love to your dear mother and sister and believe me affectionately your ever faithful friend  s t coleridge  i shall write to my mother and brothers tomorrow   at the same time mr c wrote to mr wade in terms similar to the above adding that at matlock the time was completely filled up with seeing the country eating concerts etc     letter 38  sept 1796  i was the first fiddlenot in the concertsbut every where else and the company would not spare me twenty minutes together sunday i dedicated to the drawing up my sketch of education which i meant to publish to try to get a school he speaks of the thrice lovely valley of ilam a vale hung with beautiful woods all round except just at its entrance where as you stand at the other end of the valley you see a bare bleak mountain standing as it were to guard the entrance it is without exception the most beautiful place i ever visited  he concludesi have seen a letter from mr william roscoe author of the life of lorenzo the magnificent a work in two 4to volumes of which the whole first edition sold in a month it was addressed to mr edwards the minister here and entirely related to me of me and my compositions he writes in terms of high admiration and concludes by desiring mr edwards to let him know my situation and prospects and saying that if i would come and settle at liverpool he thought a comfortable situation might be procured for me this day edwards will write to him   whilst at birmingham on the watchman tour mr c had been introduced to mr charles lloyd the eldest son of mr lloyd an eminent banker of that place at mosely they met again and the result of an intercourse for a few days together was an ardent desire on the part of lloyd to domesticate himself permanently with a man whose conversation was to him a revelation from heaven nothing however was settled on this occasion and mr and mrs c returned to bristol in the beginning of september on the 24th of september he writes to mr poole    letter 39 to mr poole  24th september 1796  my dear very dear poole  the heart thoroughly penetrated with the flame of virtuous friendship is in a state of glory but lest it should be exalted above measure there is given to it a thorn in the flesh i mean that where the friendship of any person forms an essential part of a mans happiness he will at times be pestered with the little jealousies and solicitudes of imbecile humanity since we last parted i have been gloomily dreaming that you did not leave me so affectionately as you were wont to do pardon this littleness of heart and do not think the worse of me for it indeed my soul seems so mantled and wrapped round with your love and esteem that even a dream of losing but the smallest fragment of it makes me shiver as if some tender part of my nature were left uncovered and in nakedness  last week i received a letter from lloyd informing me that his parents had given their joyful concurrence to his residence with me but that if it were possible that i could be absent from home for three or four days his father wished particularly to see me i consulted mrs coleridge who advised me to go accordingly on saturday night i went by the mail to birmingham and was introduced to the father who is a mild man very liberal in his ideas and in religion an allegorizing quaker1 i mean that all the apparently irrational parts of his sect he allegorizes into significations which for the most part you or i might assent to we became well acquainted and he expressed himself thankful to heaven that his son was about to be with me he said he would write to me concerning money matters after his son had been some time under my roof  on tuesday morning i was surprised by a letter from mr maurice our medical attendant informing me that mrs c was delivered on monday 19th september 1796 halfpast two in the morning of a son and that both she and the child were uncommonly well i was quite annihilated with the suddenness of the information and retired to my room to address myself to my maker but i could only offer up to him the silence of stupified feelings i hastened home and charles lloyd returned with me when i first saw the child i did not feel that thrill and overflowing of affection which i expected i looked on it with a melancholy gaze my mind was intensely contemplative and my heart only sad but when two hours after i saw it at the bosom of its motheron her armand her eye tearful and watching its little featuresthen i was thrilled and melted and gave it the kiss of a father     the baby seems strong and the old nurse has overpersuaded my wife to discover a likeness to me in its faceno great compliment to me for in truth i have seen handsomer babies in my lifetime its name is david hartley coleridge i hope that ere he be a man if god destines him for continuance in this life his head will be convinced of and his heart saturated with the truths so ably supported by that great master of christian philosophy  charles lloyd wins upon me hourly his heart is uncommonly pure his affections delicate and his benevolence enlivened but not sicklied by sensibility he is assuredly a man of great genius but it must be in a teteatete with one whom he loves and esteems that his colloquial powers openand this arises not from reserve or want of simplicity but from having been placed in situations where for years together he met with no congenial minds and where the contrariety of his thoughts and notions to the thoughts and notions of those around him induced the necessity of habitually suppressing his feelings his joy and gratitude to heaven for the circumstance of his domestication with me i can scarcely describe to you and i believe his fixed plans are of being always with me his father told me that if he saw that his son had formed habits of severe economy he should not insist upon his adopting any profession as then his fair share of his the fathers wealth would be sufficient for him  my dearest poole can you conveniently receive lloyd and me in the course of a week i have much very much to say to you and to consult with you about for my heart is heavy respecting derby and my feelings are so dim and huddled that though i can i am sure communicate them to you by my looks and broken sentences i scarcely know how to convey them in a letter c lloyd also wishes much to know you personally i shall write on the other side of the paper two of his sonnets composed by him in one evening at birmingham the latter of them alludes to the conviction of the truth of christianity which he had received from me let me hear from you by post immediately and give my kind love to your sister and dear mother and likewise my love to that young man with the soulbeaming face which i recollect much better than i do his name mr thomas ward of over stowey god bless you my dear friend and believe me with deep affection yours  s t coleridge2  footnote 1 the relationship of coleridge and the lloyds is told fully in charles lamb and the lloyds by e v lucas 1898  footnote 2 letter lx is our 39   the reader of coleridges poems will remember the beautiful lines to a young friend on his proposing to domesticate with the author they were written at this time and addressed to lloyd and it may be easily conceived what a deep impression of delight they would make on a mind and temperament so refined and enthusiastic as his the sonnet to a friend who asked how i felt when the nurse first presented my infant to meis the metrical version of a passage in the foregoing letter a short time before the birth of little hartley c mr southey had returned to bristol from portugal and was in lodgings nearly opposite to mr coleridges house in oxford street there had been a quarrel between them on the occasion of the abandonment of the american scheme which was first announced by mr southey and he and coleridge had ceased to have any intercourse but a years absence had dissipated all angry feelings and after mr cs return from birmingham in the end of september southey took the first step and sent over a slip of paper with a word or two of conciliation1 this was immediately followed by an interview and in an hours time these two extraordinary youths were arm in arm again they were indeed of essentially opposite tempers powers and habits yet each well knew and appreciated the otherperhaps even the more deeply from the contrast between them circumstances separated them in after life but mr coleridge recorded his testimony to southeys character in the biographia literaria and in his will referred to it as expressive of his latest convictions  in aingers letters of charles lamb will be found a series of letters by lamb to coleridge on various matters literary and domestic which affords a good insight into the doings of coleridge at this time the following beautiful letter by coleridge was written on the occasion of the death of lambs mother  footnote 1 the paper contained a sentence in english from schillers conspiracy of fiesco at genoa fiesko fiesko du sumst einen platz in meiner brust den das menschengeschlecht dreifach genommen nicht mehr besetzen wird fiesco fiesco thou leavest a void in my bosom which the human race thrice told will never fill up act v sc 16 s c     letter 40 to charles lamb1  29 sept 1796  your letter my friend struck me with a mighty horror it rushed upon me and stupified my feelings you bid me write you a religious letter i am not a man who would attempt to insult the greatness of your anguish by any other consolation heaven knows that in the easiest fortunes there is much dissatisfaction and weariness of spirit much that calls for the exercise of patience and resignation but in storms like these that shake the dwelling and make the heart tremble there is no middle way between despair and the yielding up of the whole spirit unto the guidance of faith and surely it is a matter of joy that your faith in jesus has been preserved the comforter that should relieve you is not far from you but as you are a christian in the name of that saviour who was filled with bitterness and made drunken with wormwood i conjure you to have recourse in frequent prayer to his god and your god 2 the god of mercies and father of all comfort your poor father is i hope almost senseless of the calamity the unconscious instrument of divine providence knows it not and your mother is in heaven it is sweet to be roused from a frightful dream by the song of birds and the gladsome rays of the morning ah how infinitely more sweet to be awakened from the blackness and amazement of a sudden horror by the glories of god manifest and the hallelujahs of angels  as to what regards yourself i approve altogether of your abandoning what you justly call vanities i look upon you as a man called by sorrow and anguish and a strange desolation of hopes into quietness and a soul set apart and made peculiar to god we cannot arrive at any portion of heavenly bliss without in some measure imitating christ and they arrive at the largest inheritance who imitate the most difficult parts of his character and bowed down and crushed under foot cry in fulness of faith father thy will be done  i wish above measure to have you for a little while hereno visitants shall blow on the nakedness of your feelingsyou shall be quiet and your spirit may be healed i see no possible objection unless your fathers helplessness prevent you and unless you are necessary to him if this be not the case i charge you write me that you will come  i charge you my dearest friend not to dare to encourage gloom or despairyou are a temporary sharer in human miseries that you may be an eternal partaker of the divine nature i charge you if by any means it be possible come to me  i remain your affectionate  s t coleridge3  of the next letter cottle saysa second edition of mr coleridges poems being demanded i was under no obligation the copyright being mine in publishing a second edition to make mr coleridge any payment alterations or additions being optional with him but in his circumstances and to show that my desire was to consider mr c even more than myself i promised him on the sale of the second edition of 500 twenty guineas the following was his reply not viewing the subject quite in the right light but this was of little consequence   footnote 1 the letter to which this is an answer is no viii of canon aingers letters of lamb  footnote 2 vide st john ch xx ver 17  footnote 3 letter lxi is our 40     letter 41 to cottle  stowey oct 18th 1796  my dear cottle  i have no mercenary feelings i verily believe but i hate bartering at any time and with any person with you it is absolutely intolerable i clearly perceive that by giving me twenty guineas on the sale of the second edition you will get little or nothing by the additional poems unless they should be sufficiently popular to reach a third edition which soars above our1 wildest expectations the only advantage you can derive therefore from the purchase of them on such terms is simply that my poetry is more likely to sell when the whole may be had in one volume price 5 shillings than when it is scattered in two volumes the one 4 shillings the other possibly 3 shillings in short you will get nothing directly but only indirectly from the probable circumstance that these additional poems added to the former will give a more rapid sale to the second edition than could otherwise be expected and cause it possibly to be reviewed at large add to this that by omitting every thing political i widen the sphere of my readers so much for you now for myself you must see cottle that whatever money i should receive from you would result from the circumstances that would give me the same or moreif i published them on my own account i mean the sale of the poems i can therefore have no motive to make such conditions with you except the wish to omit poems unworthy of me and the circumstance that our separate properties would aid each other by the union and whatever advantage this might be to me it would of course be equally so to you the only difference between my publishing the poems on my own account and yielding them up to you the only difference i say independent of the above stated differences is that in one case i retain the property for ever in the other case i lose it after two editions  however i am not solicitous to have any thing omitted except the sonnet to lord stanhope and the ludicrous poem1 only i should like to publish the best pieces together and those of secondary splendour at the end of the volume and think this is the best quietus of the whole affair  yours affectionately  s t coleridge  footnote 1 my in early recollections

my writing to you but all together they do not amount to a reason i have seen a narrownecked bottle so full of water that when turned up side down not a drop has fallen outsomething like this has been the case with me my heart has been full yea crammed with anxieties about my residence near you i so ardently desire it that any disappointment would chill all my faculties like the fingers of death and entertaining wishes so irrationally strong i necessarily have daymair dreams that something will prevent itso that since i quitted you i have been gloomy as the month which even now has begun to lower and rave on us i verily believe or rather i have no doubt that i should have written to you within the period of my promise if i had not pledged myself for a certain gift of my muse to poor tommy and alas she has been too sunk on the ground in dimmest heaviness to permit me to trifle yet intending it hourly i deferred my letter a la mode the procrastinator ah me i wonder not that the

and rousseau put valchiusa and petrarch i do not particularly admire rousseau bishop taylor old baxter david hartley and the bishop of cloyne are my men  the following sonnet transcribed in the foregoing letter has not been printed it puts in he says no claim to poetry but it is a most faithful picture of my feelings on a very interesting event see the letter to mr poole of 24th september 1796 this sonnet shows in a remarkable way how little the unitarianism which mr c professed at this time operated on his fundamental feelings as a catholic christian     on receiving a letter informing me of the birth of a son    when they did greet me father sudden awe   weighd down my spirit i retird and knelt   seeking the throne of grace but inly felt   no heavenly visitation upwards

streamd down my face   and now once more o lord to thee i bend   lover of souls and groan for future grace   that ere my babe youths perilous maze have trod   thy overshadowing spirit may descend   and he be born again a child of god   it was not till the summer of 1797 that the second edition of mr cs poems actually appeared before which time he had seen occasion to make many alterations in the proposed arrangement of and had added some of his most beautiful compositions to the collection it is curious however that he never varied the diction of the sonnet to schiller in the particular to which he refers in the preceding letter 2  footnote 1 afterwards included among the minor poems of mr ss c  footnote 2 see dykescampbells edition of coleridges poems p 572    letter 43 to mr poole  5

to tell you all my thoughts in their first birth and to hear yours to be mingling identities with you as it werethe visionweaving fancy has indeed often pictured such things but hope never dared

through the way of a wildernessthe cloud that had been guiding me to a land flowing with milk and honeythe milk of innocence the honey of friendship  i wanted such a letter as yours for i am very unwell on wednesday night i was seized with an intolerable pain from my right temple to the tip of my right shoulder including my right eye cheek jaw and that side of the throat i was nearly frantic and ran about the house almost naked endeavouring by every means to excite sensation in different parts of my body and so to weaken the enemy by creating a division it continued from one in the morning till halfpast five and left me pale and fainty it came on fitfully but not so violently several times on thursday and began severer threats towards night but i took between 60 and 70 drops of laudanum and sopped the cerberus just as his mouth began to open on friday it only niggled as if the chief had departed as from a conquered place and merely left a small garrison behind or as if he had evacuated the corsica and a few straggling pains only remained but this morning he returned in full force and his name is legion giantfiend of a hundred hands with a shower of arrowy deathpangs he transpierced me and then he became a wolf and lay gnawing my bonesi am not mad most noble festus but in sober sadness i have suffered this day more bodily pain than i had before a conception of my right cheek has certainly been placed with admirable exactness under the focus of some invisible burningglass which concentrated all the rays of a tartarean sun my medical attendant decides it to be altogether nervous and that it originates either in severe application or excessive anxiety  my beloved poole in excessive anxiety i believe it might originate i have a blister under my right ear and i take 25 drops of laudanum every five hours the ease and spirits gained by which have enabled me to write to you this flighty but not exaggerating account with a gloomy wantonness of imagination i had been coquetting with the hideous possibles of disappointment i drank fears like wormwoodyeamade myself drunken with bitterness for my evershaping and distrustful mind still mingled galldrops till out of the cup of hope i almost poisoned myself with despair  your letter is dated 2 november i wrote to you on the 1st your sister was married on that day and on that day i several times felt my heart overflowed with such tendernesses for her as made me repeatedly ejaculate prayers in her behalf such things are strange it may be superstition to think about such correspondences but it is a superstition which softens the heart and leads to no evil we will call on your dear sister as soon as i am quite well and in the mean time i will write a few lines to her  i am anxious beyond measure

fathers in the last chapter as a young man of great genius was born feb 12th 1775 died at versailles jan 15th 1839 he published sonnets and other poems in conjunction with my father and mr lamb in 1797 and these and mr lambs were published together apart from my fathers the year afterwards while lamb says sergeant talfourd was enjoying habits of the closest intimacy with coleridge in london he was introduced by him to a young poet whose name has often been associated with his charles lloydthe son of a wealthy banker at birmingham who had recently cast off the trammels of the society of friends and smitten with the love of poetry had become a student at the university of cambridge there he had been attracted to coleridge by the fascination of his discourse and having been admitted to his regard was introduced by him to lamb lloyd was endeared both to lamb and coleridge by a very amiable disposition and a pensive cast of thought but his intellect had little resemblance to that of either he wrote indeed pleasing verses and with great facilitya facility fatal to excellence but his mind was chiefly remarkable for the fine power of analysis which distinguishes his london and other of his later compositions in this power of discriminating and distinguishing carried to a pitch almost of painfulnesslloyd has scarcely ever been equalled and his poems though rugged in point of versification will be found by those who will read them with the calm attention they require replete with critical and moral suggestions of the highest value  besides three or four volumes of poetry mr lloyd wrote novelsedmund oliver published soon after he became acquainted with my father and isabel of later date after his marriage he settled at the lakes at brathay the beautiful river brathay near ambleside says mr de quincey lived charles lloyd and he could not in candour be considered a common man he was somewhat too rousseauish but he had in conversation very extraordinary powers for analysis of a certain kind applied to the philosophy of manners and the most delicate nuances of social life and his translations of alfieri together with his own poems shew him to have been an accomplished scholar  my mother has often told me how amiable mr lloyd was as a youth how kind to her little hartley how well content with cottage accommodation how painfully sensitive in all that related to the affections i remember him myself as he was in middle life when he and his excellent wife were most friendly to my brothers who were schoolfellows with their sons i did not at that time fully appreciate mr lloyds intellectual character but was deeply impressed by the exceeding refinement and sensibility marked in his countenance and mannersfor he was a gentleman of the old school without its formalityby the fluent elegance of his discourse and above all by the eloquent pathos with which he described his painful mental experiences and wild waking dreams caused by a deranged state of the nervous system le ciel nous vend toujours les biens quil nous prodigue nervous derangement is a dear price to pay even for genius and sensibility too often even if not the direct effect of these privileges it is the accompanying drawback hypochondria may almost be called the intellectual mans malady  the duke dormond which was written 24 years before its publication in 1822 that is in 1798 soon after mr lloyds residence at stowey has great merit as a dramatic poem in the delineation of character and states of mind the plot is forced and unnatural not only that but what is worse in point of effect it is tediously subjective and we feel the actions of the piece to be improbable while the feelings are true to nature yet there is tragic effect in the scenes of the denouement i understand what it was in mr lloyds mind which mr de quincey calls rousseauish he dwelt a good deal on the temptations to which human nature is subject when passions not in themselves unworthy become from circumstances sins if indulged and the source of sin and misery but the effect of this piece is altogether favourable to virtue and to the parent and nurse of virtue a pious conviction of the moral government of the world the play contains an anatomy of passion not a picture of it in a concrete form such as the works of richardson and of rousseau present a picture fitted to excite feelings of baneful effect upon the mind rather than to awaken thought which counteracts all such mischief indeed i think no man would have sought my fathers daily society who was not predominantly given to reflection what is very striking in this play is the character of the heroine whose earnest and scrupulous devotion to her mother occasions the partial estrangement of her lover dormond and in its consequences an overwhelming misery which overturns her reason and causes her death and thus through remorse works the conversion of those guilty persons of the drama who have been slaves to passion but are not all enslaved nor wholly vile strong is the contrast which this play presents in its exhibition of the female character with that of the celebrated french and german writers who have treated similar subjects men writei have heard a painter say men even paintas they feel and as they are goethes margaret has been thought equal to shakespeares ophelia and desdemona in some respects it is so but it is like a pot of sweet ointment into which some tainting matter has fallen i think no englishman of goethes genius and sensibility would have described a maiden whom it was his intention to represent though frail on one point yet lovely and gentlehearted as capable of being induced to give her poor old mother a sleeping potion it will do her no harm but the riskaffection gives the wisdom of the serpent where there would else be but the simplicity of the dove a true englishman would have felt that such an act so bold and undaughterly blighted at once the lily flower making it put on darkness and fall into the portion of weeds and outworn faces in mr lloyds youthful drama even the dissipated marchioness who tempts and yields to temptation is made to play a noble part in the end won back from sin by generous feeling and strong sense and the description of julia villeneuves tender care of her mother is so characteristic of the author that i cannot help quoting a part of it here though it is not among the powerful parts of the play  describing how her aged parents extreme infirmity rendered her incapable without a sacrifice of leaving the small dwelling to which she had been accustomed and how this had prevented her even from hinting her lovers proposal for their union julia says                              though blind she loved this little spot a happy wife there lived she with her lord it was a home in which an only brother long since dead and i were educated twas to her as the whole world its scanty garden plot the hum of bees hived there which still she heard on a warm summers day the scent of flowers the honeysuckle which trailed around its porch its orchard field and trees her universe i knew she could not long be spared to me her sufferings when alleviated best were most acute and i could best perform that sacred task i wished to lengthen out by consecrating to her every moment her being to myself etc                           could i leave her i might have seen hersuch was dormonds plea each day but who her evening hours could cheer her long and solitary evening hours talk her or haply sing her to her sleep read to her smooth her pillow lastly make morning seem morning with a daughters welcome for mornings light neer visited her eyes well i refused to quit her dormond grew absent reserved nay splenetic and petulant he left the province nor has he once sent a kind enquiry so t alleviate his heavy absence   beritola is italian in form as much as wielands oberon but the spirit is that of the englishman charles lloyd it contains the same vivid descriptions of mental suffering the same reflective display of the lovers passion the same sentiments of deep domestic tenderness uttered as from the heart and with a special air of reality as the duke dormond and the authors productions in general the versification is rather better than that of his earlier poems but the want of ease and harmony in the flow of the verse is a prevailing defect in mr lloyds poetry and often makes it appear prosaic even where the thought is not so this pathetic sonnet is one of a very interesting set on the death of priscilla farmer the authors maternal grandmother included in the joint volume     oh she was almost speechless nor could hold   awakening converse with me i shall bless   no more the modulated tenderness   of that dear voice alas twas shrunk and cold   her honourd face yet when i sought to speak   through her halfopend eyelids she did send   faint looks that said i would be yet thy friend   and o my chokd breast een on that shrunk cheek   i saw one slow tear roll my hand she took   placing it on her hearti heard her sigh   tis too too much twas loves last agony   i tore me from her twas her latest look   her latest accentsoh my heart retain   that look those accents till we meet again                                     s c  meantime coleridge had written to charles lloyds father three letters about his son highly interesting as glimpses of his own character these letters were first published in charles lamb and the lloyds by e v lucas they are as follows     letter 44 to charles lloyd sen  dear sir  as the father of charles lloyd you are of course in some measure interested in any alteration of my schemes of life and i feel it a kind of duty to give you my reasons for any such alteration i have declined my derby connection and determined to retire once for all and utterly from cities and towns and am about to take a cottage and half a dozen acres of land in an enchanting situation about eight miles from bridgewater my reasons arethat i have cause to believe my health would be materially impaired by residing in a town and by the close confinement and anxieties incident to the education of children that as my days would be dedicated to dr cromptons children and my evenings to a course of study with my admirable young friend i should have scarcely a snatch of time for literary occupation and above all because i am anxious that my children should be bred up from earliest infancy in the simplicity of peasants their food dress and habits completely rustic i never shall and i never will have any fortune to leave them i will leave them therefore hearts that desire little heads that know how little is to be desired and hands and arms accustomed to earn that little i am peculiarly delighted with the 2ist verse of the 4th chapter of tobit and fear not my son that we are made poor for thou hast much wealth if thou fear god and depart from all sin and do that which is pleasing in his sight indeed if i live in cities my children if it please the allgood to preserve the one i have and to give me more my children i say will necessarily become acquainted with politicians and politicsa set of men and a kind of study which i deem highly unfavourable to all christian graces i have myself erred greatly in this respect but i trust i have now seen my error i have accordingly snapped my squeaking babytrumpet of sedition and have hung up its fragments in the chamber of penitences  your son and i are happy in our connectionour opinions and feelings are as nearly alike as we can expect and i rely upon the goodness of the allgood that we shall proceed to make each other better and wiser charles lloyd is greatly averse from the common run of societyand so am ibut in a city i could scarcely avoid it and this too has aided my decision in favour of my rustic scheme we shall reside near a very dear friend of mine a man versed from childhood in the toils of the garden and the field and from whom i shall receive every addition to my comfort which an earthly friend and adviser can give  my wife requests to be remembered to you if the word remember can be properly used you will mention my respects to your wife and your children and believe that i am with no mean esteem and regard  your friend  s t coleridge  saturday 15th oct 1796     letter 45 to charles lloyd sen  dear sir  i received your letter and thank you for that interest which you take in my welfare the reasons which you urge against my present plan are mostly wellfounded but they would apply equally against any other scheme of life which my conscience would permit me to adopt i might have a situation as a unitarian minister i might have lucrative offices as an active politician but on both of these the voice within puts a firm and unwavering negative nothing remains for me but schoolmastership in a large town or my present plan to the success of both and indeed even to my subsisting in either health and the possession of my faculties are necessary requisites while i possess these requisites i know i can maintain myself and family in the country the task of educating children suits not the activity of my mind and the anxieties and confinement incident to it added to the living in a town or city would to a moral certainty ruin that health and those faculties which as i said before are necessary to my gaining my livelihood in any way undoubtedly without fortune or trade or profession it is impossible that i should be in any situation in which i must not be dependent on my own health and exertions for the bread of my family i do not regret itit will make me feel my dependence on the almighty and it will prevent my affections from being made earthly altogether i praise god in all things and feel that to his grace alone it is owing that i am enabled to praise him in all things you think my scheme monastic rather than christian can he be deemed monastic who is married and employed in rearing his childrenwho personally preaches the truth to his friends and neighbours and who endeavours to instruct tho absent by the press in what line of life could i be more actively employed and what titles that are dear and venerable are there which i shall not possess god permit my present resolutions to be realised shall i not be an agriculturist an husband a father and a priest after the order of peace an hireless priest christianity teaches us to let our lights shine before men it does sobut it likewise bids us say our father lead us not into temptation which how can he say with a safe conscience who voluntarily places himself in those circumstances in which if he believe christ he must acknowledge that it would be easier for a camel to go thro the eye of a needle than for him to enter into the kingdom of heaven does not that man mock god who daily prays against temptations yet daily places himself in the midst of the most formidable i meant to have written a few lines only respecting myself because i have much and weighty matter to write concerning my friend charles lloyd but i have been seduced into many words from the importance of the general truths on which i build my conduct  while your son remains with me he will of course be acquiring that knowledge and those powers of intellect which are necessary as the foundation of excellence in all professions rather than the immediate science of any languages will engross one or two hours in every day the elements of chemistry geometry mechanics and optics the remaining hours of study after tolerable proficiency in these we shall proceed to the study of man and of meni mean metaphysics and historyand finally to a thorough examination of the jewish and christian dispensations their doctrines and evidences an examination necessary for all men but peculiarly so to your son if he be destined for a medical man a physician who should be even a theist still more a christian would be a rarity indeed i do not know oneand i know a great many physicians they are shallow animals having always employed their minds about body and gut they imagine that in the whole system of things there is nothing but gut and body     i hope your health is confirmed and that your wife and children are well present my wellwishes you are blessed with children who are pure in heartadd to this health competence social affections and employment and you have a complete idea of human happiness  believe me  with esteem and friendlyheartedness  your obliged  s t coleridge  monday november 14th 1796     letter 46 to charles lloyd sen  dear sir  i think it my duty to acquaint you with the nature of my connection with your son if he be to stay with me i can neither be his tutor or fellowstudent nor in any way impart a regular system of knowledge my days i shall devote to the acquirement of practical husbandry and horticulture that as to beg i am ashamed i may at least be able to dig and my evenings will be fully employed in fulfilling my engagements with the critical review and new monthly magazine if therefore your son occupy a room in my cottage he will be there merely as a lodger and friend and the only money i shall receive from him will be the sum which his board and lodging will cost me and which by an accurate calculation i find will amount to half a guinea a week exclusive of his washing porter cyder spirits in short any potation beyond tablebeerthese he must provide himself with i shall keep no servant  i must add that charles lloyd must furnish his own bedroom it is not in my power to do it myself without running into debt from which may heaven amid its most angry dispensations preserve me  when i mentioned the circumstances which rendered my literary engagement impracticable when i say i first mentioned them to charles lloyd and described the severe process of simplification which i had determined to adopt i never dreamt that he would have desired to continue with me and when at length he did manifest such a desire i dissuaded him from it but his feelings became vehement and in the present state of his health it would have been as little prudent as humane in me to have given an absolute refusal  will you permit me sir to write of charles lloyd with freedom i do not think he ever will endure whatever might be the consequences to practise as a physician or to undertake any commercial employment what weight your authority might have i know not i doubt not he would struggle to submit to itbut would he succeed in any attempt to which his temper feelings and principles are inimical    what then remains i know of nothing but agriculture if his attachment to it should prove permanent and he really acquired the steady dispositions of a practical farmer i think you could wish nothing better for him than to see him married and settled near you as a farmer i love him and do not think he will be well or happy till he is married and settled  i have written plainly and decisively my dear sir i wish to avoid not only evil but the appearances of evil this is a world of calumnies yea there is an imposthume in the large tongue of this world ever ready to break and it is well to prevent the contents from being sputtered into ones face my wife thanks you for your kind inquiries respecting her she and our infant are wellonly the latter has met with a little accidenta burn which is doing well  to mrs lloyd and all your children present my remembrances and believe me in all esteem and friendliness yours sincerely s t coleridge 1 sunday december 4 1796  footnote 1 to this letter mr lloyd seems to have returned the question how could coleridge live without companions the answer came quickly as we learn from a letter from coleridge to poole letters i p 186 in which he mentions mr lloyds query and quotes his own characteristic reply i shall have six companions my sara my babe my own shaping and disquisitive mind my books my beloved friend thomas poole and lastly nature looking at me with a thousand looks of beauty and speaking to me in a thousand melodies of love if i were capable of being tired with all these i should then detect a vice in my nature and would fly to habitual solitude to eradicate it coleridges letter to mr lloyd containing this passage seems to have been lost note by e v lucas  the ode to the departing year coleridge tells us was written on 24th 25th and 26th december 1796 it was first printed in the cambridge intelligencer of 31st december and then republished along with the lines to a young man who abandoned himself to a causeless melancholy probably charles lloyd in quarto form of 16 pages it was then prefaced by the following letter    letter 47 to thomas poole of stowey dedication to the ode to the departing year  my dear friend  soon after the commencement of this month the editor of the cambridge intelligencer a newspaper conducted with so much ability and such unmixed and fearless zeal for the interests of piety and freedom that i cannot but think my poetry honoured by being permitted to appear in it requested me by letter to furnish him with some lines for the last day of this year i promised him that i would make the attempt but almost immediately after a rheumatic complaint seized on my head and continued to prevent the possibility of poetic composition till within the last three days so in the course of the last three days the following ode was produced in general when an author informs the public that his production was struck off in a great hurry he offers an insult not an excuse but i trust that the present case is an exception and that the peculiar circumstances which obliged me to write with such unusual rapidity give a propriety to my professions of it nec nunc eam apud te jacto sed et ceteris indico ne quis asperiore limae carmen examinet et a confuso scriptum et quod frigidum erat ni statim traderem i avail myself of the words of statius and hope that i shall likewise be able to say of any weightier publication what he has declared of his thebaid that it had been tortured with a laborious polish  for me to discuss the literary merits of this hasty composition were idle and presumptuous if it be found to possess that impetuosity of transition and that precipitation of fancy and feeling which are the essential excellencies of the sublimer ode its deficiency in less important respects will be easily pardoned by those from whom alone praise could give me pleasure and whose minuter criticisms will be disarmed by the reflection that these lines were conceived not in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academic groves but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow1 i am more anxious lest the moral spirit of the ode should be mistaken you i am sure will not fail to recollect that among the ancients the bard and the prophet were one and the same character and you know that although i prophesy curses i pray fervently for blessings farewell brother of my soul      o ever found the same   and trusted and beloved   never without an emotion of honest pride do i subscribe myself  your grateful and affectionate friend s t coleridge  bristol december 26 1796  footnote 1 from the preface to the first edition of johnsons dictionary of the english language    chapter iv  contemporary portraits of coleridge  from mr wordsworths stanzas written in my pocketcopy of thomsons castle of indolence     with him there often walked in friendly guise   or lay upon the moss by brook or tree   a noticeable man with large grey eyes   and a pale face that seemed undoubtedly   as if a blooming face it ought to be   heavy his lowhung lip did oft appear   deprest by weight of musing phantasy   profound his forehead was though not severe   yet some did think that he had little business here    sweet heaven forefend his was a lawful right   noisy he was and gamesome as a boy   his limbs would toss about him with delight   like branches when strong winds the trees annoy   nor lacked his calmer hours device or toy   to banish listlessness and irksome care   he would have taught you how you might employ   yourself and many did to him repair   and certes not in vain he had inventions rare   for josiah wade the gentleman to whom the letters placed at the beginning of the last chapter were written the fine portrait of mr coleridge by allston nearly full length in oils was painted at rome in 18061i believe in the spring of that year mr allston himself spoke of it as in his opinion faithfully representing his friends features and expression such as they commonly appeared his countenance he added in his high poetic mood was quite beyond the painters art it was indeed spirit made visible  mr coleridge was thirtythree years old when this portrait was painted but it would be taken for that of a man of forty the youthful even boyish look which the original retained for some years after boyhood must rather suddenly have given place to a premature appearance first of middleagedness then of old age at least in his general aspect though in some points of personal appearancehis fair smooth skin and large grey eyes at once the clearest and the deepestso a friend lately described them to methat i ever saw he grew not old to the last sergeant talfourd thus speaks of what he was at three or four and forty lamb used to say that he was inferior to what he had been in his youth but i can scarcely believe it at least there is nothing in his early writing which gives any idea of the richness of his mind so lavishly poured out at this time in his happiest moods although he looked much older than he was his hair being silvered all over and his person tending to corpulency there was about him no trace of bodily sickness or mental decay but rather an air of voluptuous repose his benignity of manner placed his auditors entirely at their ease and inclined them to listen delighted to the sweet low tone in which he began to discourse on some high theme at first his tones were conversational he seemed to dally with the shallows of the subject and with fantastic images which bordered it but gradually the thought grew deeper and the voice deepened with the thought the stream gathering strength seemed to bear along with it all things which opposed its progress and blended them with its current and stretching away among regions tinted with etherial colours was lost at airy distance in the horizon of fancy coleridge was sometimes induced to repeat portions of christabel then enshrined in manuscript from eyes profane and gave a bewitching effect to its wizard lines but more peculiar in its beauty than this was his recitation of kubla khan as he repeated the passage     a damsel with a dulcimer   in a vision once i saw     it was an abyssinian maid   and on her dulcimer she played   singing of mount abora   his voice seemed to mount and melt into air as the images grew more visionary and the suggested associations more remote2  mr de quincey thus describes him at thirtyfour in the summer season of 1807 about a year and a half after the date of mr allstons portrait  i had received directions for finding out the house where coleridge was visiting and in riding down a main street of bridgewater i noticed a gateway corresponding to the description given me under this was standing and gazing about him a man whom i shall describe in height he might seem to be above five feet eight he was in reality about an inch and a half taller his person was broad and full and tended even to corpulence his complexion was fair though not what painters technically style fair because it was associated with black hair his eyes were large and soft in their expression and it was from the peculiar appearance of haze or dreaminess which mixed with their light that i recognised my object this was coleridge i examined him steadfastly for a minute or more and it struck me that he saw neither myself nor any object in the street  he was in a deep reverie for i had dismounted made two or three trifling arrangements at an inn door and advanced close to him before he had apparently become conscious of my presence the sound of my voice announcing my own name first awoke him he started and for a moment seemed at a loss to understand my purpose or his own situation for he repeated rapidly a number of words which had no relation to either of us there was no mauvaise honte in his manner but simple perplexity and an apparent difficulty in recovering his position among daylight realities this little scene over he received me with a kindness of manner so marked that it might be called gracious  coleridge led me to a drawing room and rang the bell for refreshments and omitted no point of a courteous reception he told me that there would be a very large dinner party on that day which perhaps might be disagreeable to a perfect stranger but if not he could assure me of a most hospitable welcome from the family i was too anxious to see him under all aspects to think of declining this invitation and these little points of business being settled coleridge like some great river the orellana or the st lawrence that had been checked and fretted by rocks or thwarting islands and suddenly recovers its volume of waters and its mighty music swept at once as if returning to his natural business into a continuous strain of eloquent dissertation certainly the most novel the most finely illustrated and traversing the most spacious fields of thought by transitions the most just and logical that it was possible to conceive  i will now present him as he appeared to william hazlitt in the february of 1798 when he was little more than five and twenty  it was in january 1798 that i rose one morning before daylight to walk ten miles in the mud to hear this celebrated person preach never the longest day i have to live shall i have such another walk as this cold raw comfortless one in the winter of the year 1798 il y a des impressions que ni le temps ni les circonstances peuvent effacer dusseje vivre des siecles entiers le doux temps de majeunesse ne pent renatre pour moi ni seffacer jamais dans ma memoire when i got there the organ was playing the hundredth psalm and when it was done mr coleridge rose and gave out his text he departed again into a mountain himself alone as he gave out this text his voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes and when he came to the two last words which he pronounced loud deep and distinct it seemed to me who was then young as if the sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart and as if that prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe the idea of st john came into my mind of one crying in the wilderness who had his loins girt about and whose food was locusts and wild honey the preacher then launched into his subject like an eagle dallying with the wind the sermon was upon peace and warupon church and statenot their alliance but their separationon the spirit of the world and the spirit of christianity not as the same but as opposed to one another he talked of those who had inscribed the cross of christ on banners dripping with human gore he made a poetical and pastoral excursionand to shew the fatal effects of war drew a striking contrast between the simple shepherd boy driving his team afield or sitting under the hawthorn piping to his flock as though he should never be old and the same poor country lad crimped kidnapped brought into town made drunk at an alehouse turned into a wretched drummerboy with his hair sticking on end with powder and pomatum a long cue at his back and tricked out in the finery of the profession of blood     such were the notes our once loved poet sung   and for myself i could not have been more delighted if i had heard the music of the spheres poetry and philosophy had met together truth and genius had embraced under the eye and with the sanction of religion this was even beyond my hopes i returned home well satisfied the sun that was still labouring pale and wan through the sky obscured by thick mists seemed an emblem of the good cause and the cold dank drops of dew that hung half melted on the beard of the thistle had something genial and refreshing in them 3    a glowing dawn was his but noons full blaze   of perfect day neer filld his heavn with radiance   scarce were the flowrets on their stems upraised   when sudden shadows cast an evening gloom   oer those bright skiesyet still those skies were lovely   the roses of the morn yet lingered there   when stars began to peepnor yet exhaled   fresh dewdrops glittered near the glowworms lamp   and many a snatch of larklike melody   birds of the shade trilled forthmid plaintive warbling  the principal portraits of coleridge are besides the one by allston

close   even to the gates and inlets of his life   but it is true no less that strenuous firm   and with a natural gladness he maintained   the citadel unconquered and in joy   was strong to follow the delightful muse   with the letter of nov 5 1 the biographical sketch left by mr coleridges late editor comes to an end and at the present time i can carry it no further than to add that in january 1797 my father removed with his wife and child the latter then four months old to a cottage at stowey which was his home for three years that from that home in company with mr and miss wordsworth he went in september 1798 to germany and that he spent fourteen months in that country during which period the letters called satyranes were written  footnote 1 no 43 sara coleridge now continues the narrative for ten lines  cottle in his reminiscences says mr coleridge sent him the following letter from stowey    letter 48  january 1797  dear cottle  i write under great agony of mind charles lloyd being very ill he has been seized with his fits three times in the space of seven days and just as i was in bed last night i was called up again and from twelve oclock at night to five this morning he remained in one continued state of agonized delirium what with bodily toil exerted in repressing his frantic struggles and what with the feelings of agony for his sufferings you may suppose that i have forced myself from bed with aching temples and a feeble frame    we offer petitions not as supposing we influence the immutable but because to petition the supreme being is the way most suited to our nature to stir up the benevolent affections in our hearts christ positively commands it and in st paul you will find unnumbered instances of prayer for individual blessings for kings rulers etc etc we indeed should all join to our petitions but thy will be done omniscient allloving immortal god  believe 1 me to have towards you the inward and spiritual gratitude and affection though i am not always an adept in the outward and visible signs  god bless you  s t c  footnote 1 my respects to your good mother and to your father and believe me etcearly recollections  the next letter refers to the second edition of the poems and must have been written early in january 1797    letter 49  3 january 1797  my dear cottle  if you delay the press it will give me the opportunity i so much wish of sending my visions of the maid of arc to wordsworth who lives 1 not above twenty miles from this place and to charles lamb whose taste and judgment i see reason to think more correct and philosophical than my own which yet i place pretty high     we arrived safe our house is set to rights we are allwife bratling and self remarkably well mrs coleridge likes stowey and loves thomas poole and his mother who love her a communication has been made from our orchard into t pooles garden and from thence to cruikshanks a friend of mine and a young married man whose wife is very amiable and she and sara are already on the most cordial terms from all this you will conclude we are happy bythebye what a delightful poem is southeys musings on a landscape of caspar poussin i love it almost better than his hymn to the penates in his volume of poems the following namely  the six sonnets on the slave tradethe ode to the genius of africato my own miniature picturethe eight inscriptionselinor botanybay ecloguefrederick dittothe ten sonnets pp 107116 on the death of an old spanielthe soldiers wife dactylicsthe widow sapphicsthe chapel bellthe race of bancorudiger  all these poems are worthy the author of joan of arc and  the musings on a landscape etc and the hymn to the penates  deserve to have been published after joan of arc as proofs of progressive genius  god bless you  s t c  footnote 1 mr wordsworth lived at racedown before he removed to allfoxden cottle the dates of letters 49 and 50 are determined by that of a letter from lamb to coleridge of 5th january 1797 ainger i 57 letter 49 implies that coleridge was now acquainted with wordsworth a letter from mrs wordsworth to sara coleridge of 7th nov 1845 knights life of wordsworth i iii gives the date of the first meeting of the poets as about the year 1795 professor knight thinks this should be 1796 in the letter of wordsworth to wrangham referred to in note to letter 13 wordsworth does not say that he knew coleridge personally letter 49 is the only trustworthy contemporary evidence on the subject  after receiving lambs answer of 5th january in which lamb criticises unfavourably the joan of arc lines ainger i 57 coleridge writes     letter 50 to cottle  10 january 1797  my dear cottle  the lines which i added to my lines in the joan of arc have been so little approved by charles lamb to whom i sent them that although i differ from him in opinion i have not heart to finish the poem  mr coleridge in the same letter says cottle thus refers to his ode to the departing year     so much for an ode which some people think superior to the bard of gray and which others think a rant of turgid obscurity and the latter are the more numerous class it is not obscure my religious musings i know are but not this ode  coleridge in 1797 as in 1796 was invariably behind time with his copy for the second edition he thus writes cottle     letter 51 to cottle  jany 1797  my dear cottle     on thursday morning by milton the stowey carrier i shall send you a parcel containing the book of my poems interleaved with the alterations and likewise the prefaces which i shall send to you for your criticisms        letter 52 to cottle  stowey friday morning 1797  my dear cottle     if you do not like the following verses or if you do not think them worthy of an edition in which i profess to give nothing but my choicest fish picked gutted and cleaned please to get some one to write them out and send them with my compliments to the editor of the new monthly magazine but if you think as well of them as i do most probably from parental dotage for my last born let them immediately follow the kiss  god love you  s t c  to an unfortunate young woman  whom i had known in the days of her innocence   maiden that with sullen brow  sittst behind those virgins gay like a scorched and mildewd bough  leafless mid the blooms of may  inly gnawing thy distresses  mock those starts of wanton glee and thy inmost soul confesses  chaste affections majesty  loathing thy polluted lot  hie thee maiden hie thee hence seek thy weeping mothers cot  with a wiser innocence  mute the lavrac 1 and forlorn  while she moults those firstling plumes that had skimmd the tender corn  or the beanfields odrous blooms  soon with renovating wing  shall she dare a loftier flight upwards to the daystar

when the scythesman oer his sheaf  carolld in the yellow vale sad i saw thee heedless leaf  love the dalliance of the gale  lightly didst thou poor fond thing  heave and flutter to his sighs while the flatterer on his wing  wood and whisperd thee to rise  gaily from thy mother stalk  wert thou danced and wafted high soon on this unsheltered walk  flung to fade and rot and die   footnote 1 the skylark   cottle subjected the two poems to severe criticism and coleridge replied     letter 53 to cottle  wednesday morning 10 oclock  january 1797  my dearest cottle     ill besped is indeed a sad blotch but after having tried at least a hundred ways before i sent the poem to you and often since i find it incurable this first poem is but a so so composition i wonder i could have been so blinded by the ardour of recent composition as to see anything in it  your remarks are perfectly just on the allegorical lines except that in this district corn is as often cut with a scythe as with a hook however for scythesman read rustic for poor fond thing read foolish thing and for flung to fade and rot and die read flung to wither and to die                                milton the carrier waits impatiently  s t c 1  footnote 1 letters lxxilxxii follow letter 53   only the second poem was included in the second edition the next letter which contains an unrealized prophecy regarding southey speaks of the joint partnership of the volume of 1797     letter 54 to cottle  stoweyfeby or mch 1797  my dear cottle     public affairs are in strange confusion i am afraid that i shall prove at least as good a prophet as bard oh doomd to fall my country enslaved and vile but may god make me a foreboder of evils never to come  i have heard from sheridan desiring me to write a tragedy i have no genius that way robert southey has i think highly of his joan of arc and cannot help prophesying that he will be known to posterity as shakspeares great grandson i think he will write a tragedy or tragedies  charles lloyd has given me his poems which i give to you on condition that you print them in this volume after charles lambs poems the title page poems by s t coleridge second edition to which are added poems by c lamb and c lloyd c lambs poems will occupy about forty pages c lloyds at least one hundred although only his choice fish  ps i like your lines on savage  god bless you  s t coleridge  during his stay at stowey coleridge remained a subscriber to catcotts library bristol and the following letter to the librarian is worth preserving     letter 55 to cottle  stowey may 1797  my dear cottle  i have sent a curious letter to george catcott he has altogether made me pay five shillings for postage by his letters sent all the way to stowey requiring me to return books to the bristol library      mr catcott  i beg your acceptance of all the enclosed letters you must not think lightly of the present as they cost me who am a very poor man five shillings  with respect to the bruck hist crit although by accident they were registered on the 23d of march yet they were not removed from the library for a fortnight after and when i received your first letter i had had the books just three weeks our learned and ingenious committee may read through two quartos that is one thousand and four hundred pages of close printed latin and greek in three weeks for aught i know to the contrary i pretend to no such intenseness of application or rapidity of genius  i must beg you to inform me by mr cottle what length of time is allowed by the rules and customs of our institution for each book whether their contents as well as their size are consulted in apportioning the time or whether customarily any time at all is apportioned except when the committee in individual cases choose to deem it proper i subscribe to your library mr catcott not to read novels or books of quick reading and easy digestion but to get books which i cannot get elsewherebooks of massy knowledge and as i have few books of my own i read with a commonplace book so that if i be not allowed a longer period of time for the perusal of such books i must contrive to get rid of my subscription which would be a thing perfectly useless except so far as it gives me an opportunity of reading your little expensive notes and letters  yours in christian fellowship  s t coleridge  whether coleridge had given southey the opportunity to try his skill at the drama or not does not appear but the following letter to cottle shows that he had addressed himself to the task of composing a tragedy evidently osorio    letter 56 to cottle  stowey may 1797  my dearest cottle  i love and respect you as a brother and my memory deceives me woefully if i have not evidenced by the animated tone of my conversation when we have been teteatete how much your conversation interested me but when last in bristol the day i meant to devote to you was such a day of sadness i could do nothing on the saturday the sunday and ten days after my arrival at stowey i felt a depression too dreadful to be described     so much i felt my genial spirits droop   my hopes all flat nature within me seemed   in all her functions weary of herself   wordsworths 1 conversation aroused me somewhat but even now i am not the man i have been and i think i never shall a sort of calm hopelessness diffuses itself over my heart indeed every mode of life which has promised me bread and cheese has been one after another torn away from me but god remains i have no immediate pecuniary distress having received ten pounds from lloyd i employ myself now on a book of morals in answer to godwin and on my tragedy   there are some poets who write too much at their ease from the facility with which they please themselves they do not often enough              feel their burdened breast   heaving beneath incumbent deity   so that to posterity their wreaths will look unseemly here perhaps an everlasting amaranth and close by its side some weed of an hour sere yellow and shapeless their very beauties will lose half their effect from the bad company they keep they rely too much on story and event to the neglect of those lofty imaginings that are peculiar to and definite of the poet  the story of milton might be told in two pages it is this which distinguishes an epic poem from a romance in metre observe the march of milton his severe application his laborious polish his deep metaphysical researches his prayer to god before he began his great work all that could lift and swell his intellect became his daily food  i should not think of devoting less than twenty years to an epic poem ten years to collect materials and warm my mind with universal science i would be a tolerable mathematician i would thoroughly understand mechanics hydrostatics optics and astronomy botany metallurgy fossilism chemistry geology anatomy medicine then the mind of man then the minds of men in all travels voyages and histories so i would spend ten years the next five in the composition of the poem and the five last in the correction of it so would i write haply not unhearing of that divine and nightlywhispering voice which speaks to mighty minds of predestinated garlands starry and unwithering  god love you  s t coleridge  ps david hartley is well and grows sara is well and desires a sisters love to you  footnote 1 mr wordsworth at this time resided at allfoxden house two or three miles from stoweynote by cottle  the following letter of mr c says cottle was in answer to a request for some longpromised copy and for which the printer importuned     letter 57 to cottle  stowey may 1797  my dear dear cottle  have patience and everything shall be done i think now entirely of your brother1 in two days i will think entirely for you by wednesday next you shall have lloyds other poems with all lambs etc etc      s t c  a little before this time says cottle a singular occurrence happened to mr c during a pedestrian excursion into somersetshire as detailed in the following letter to mr wade  footnote 1 my brother when at cambridge had written a latin poem for the prize the subject italia vastata and sent it to mr coleridge with whom he was on friendly terms in ms requesting the favour of his remarks and this he did about six weeks before it was necessary to deliver it in mr c in an immediate letter expressed his approbation of the poem and cheerfully undertook the task but with a little of his procrastination he returned the ms with his remarks just one day after it was too late to deliver the poem innote by cottle     letter 58 to wade  may 1797  my dear friend  i am here after a most tiresome journey in the course of which a woman asked me if i knew one coleridge of bristol i answered i had heard of him do you know quoth she that that vile jacobin villain drew away a young man of our parish one burnett etc and in this strain did the woman continue for near an hour heaping on me every name of abuse that the parish of billingsgate could supply i listened very particularly appeared to approve all she said exclaiming dear me two or three times and in fine so completely won the womans heart by my civilities that i had not courage enough to undeceive her     s t coleridge  ps you are a good prophet oh into what a state have the scoundrels brought this devoted kingdom if the house of commons would but melt down their faces it would greatly assist the copper currencywe should have brass enough  coleridge like all the returntonature poets of the eighteenth century thomson cowper burns and others was given to that humanitarian regard for the lower creatures which brought forth such poems as burnss address to a mouse and coleridges own lines to a young ass the following letter to cottle is an amusing sample of that humanitarianism george burnett one of the pantisocrats occasionally resided with coleridge and during the latters temporary absence from stowey had taken ill on reaching stowey coleridge wrote to cottle     letter 59 to cottle  stowey may 1797  my dear friend  i found george burnett ill enough heaven knows yellow jaundicethe introductory symptoms very violent i return to bristol on thursday and shall not leave till all be done  remind mrs coleridge of the kittens and tell her that georges brandy is just what smuggled spirits might be expected to be execrable the smack of it remains in my mouth and i believe will keep me most horribly temperate for half a century he burnett was bit but i caught the brandiphobia1 obliterations         scratched out well knowing that you never allow such things to pass uncensured a good joke and it slipped out most impromptuishly  the mice play the very devil with us it irks me to set a trap by all the whiskers of all the pussies that have mewed plaintively or amorously since the days of whittington it is not fair tis telling a lie tis as if you said here is a bit of toasted cheese come little mice i invite you when oh foul breach of the rites of hospitality i mean to assassinate my too credulous guests no i cannot set a trap but i should vastly like to make a pittfall smoke the pun but concerning the mice advise thou lest there be famine in the land such a year of scarcity inconsiderate mice well well so the world wags  farewell s t c  ps a mad dog ran through our village and bit several dogs i have desired the farmers to be attentive and tomorrow shall give them in writing the first symptoms of madness in a dog  i wish my pockets were as yellow as georges phiz  footnote 1 it appears that mr burnett had been prevailed upon by smugglers to buy some prime cheap brandy but which mr coleridge affirmed to be a compound of hellebore kitchen grease and assafoetida or something as badcottles note  the next letter must belong to the end of may or beginning of june cottles note shows that the second edition of the poems was now published    letter 60 to cottle  stowey june 1797  my dear cottle  i deeply regret that my anxieties and my slothfulness acting in a combined ratio prevented me from finishing my progress of liberty or visions of the maid of orleans with that poem at the head of the volume with the ode in the middle and the religious musings at the end     in the lines on the man of ross immediately after these lines     he heard the widows heavenbreathed prayer of praise   he markd the shelterd orphans tearful gaze   please to add these two lines     and oer the portiond maidens snowy cheek   bade bridal love suffuse its blushes meek   and for the line     beneath this roof if thy cheerd moments pass   i should be glad to substitute this     if near this roof thy winecheerd moments pass   these emendations cottle adds came too late for admission in the second edition nor have they appeared in the last edition they will remain therefore for insertion in any future edition of mr coleridges poems  the exact date on which coleridge and wordsworth met in the year 1796 has not been ascertained but coleridge speaks in the next letter as if he was now well acquainted with wordsworth coleridge had been at taunton early in june letters 220 on the 8th of june he wrote to cottle    letter 61 to cottle  8th june 1797  my dear cottle  i am sojourning for a few days at racedown dorset the mansion of our friend wordsworth who presents his kindest respects to you     wordsworth admires my tragedy which gives me great hopes wordsworth has written a tragedy himself i speak with heartfelt sincerity and i think unblinded judgment when i tell you that i feel myself a little man by his side and yet i do not think myself a less man than i formerly thought myself his drama is absolutely wonderful you know i do not commonly speak in such abrupt and unmingled phrases and therefore will the more readily believe me there are in the piece those profound touches of the human heart which i find three or four times in the robbers of schiller and often in shakespeare but in wordsworth there are no inequalities     god bless you and eke 1  s t coleridge 2  footnote 1  the reader will have observed a peculiarity in most of mr coleridges conclusions to his letters he generally says god bless you and or eke s t c so as to involve a compound blessingcottle  footnote 2 letter lxxiii is our 61  shakespeare evidently occupied an important place in coleridges mind even at this early date his discovery of rivals to the prince of english dramatists in his friends southey and wordsworth only indicates how largely shakespeare already bulked in his view of the dramatic art  the next letter to cottle is of a milder type and leads up to an interesting meeting famous in the lives of lamb coleridge and wordsworth   letter 62 to cottle  stowey june 29th 1797  my very dear cottle  charles lamb will probably be here in about a fortnight could you not contrive to put yourself in a bridgwater coach and t poole would fetch you in a onehorse chaise to stowey what delight would it not give us   still more interesting is the often quoted letter describing dorothy wordsworth   letter 63 to cottle  stowey 317 july 1797  my dear cottle  wordsworth and his exquisite sister are with me she is a woman indeed in mind i mean and heart for her person is such that if you expected to see a pretty woman you would think her rather ordinary if you expected to see an ordinary woman you would think her pretty but her manners are simple ardent impressive in every motion her most innocent soul outbeams so brightly that who saw would say     guilt was a thing impossible in her   her information various her eye watchful in minutest observation of nature and her taste a perfect electrometer it bends protrudes and draws in at subtlest beauties and most recondite faults  she and w desire their kindest respects to you  give my love to your brother amos i condole with him in the loss of the prize but it is the fortune of war the finest greek poem i ever wrote lost the prize and that which gained it was contemptible an ode may sometimes be too bad for the prize but very often too good  your ever affectionate friend  s t c1  footnote 1 letter lxxiv follows 63  dorothy wordsworths description of coleridge whom she met now for the first time is as follows you had a great loss she wrote to a friend in not seeing coleridge he is a wonderful man his conversation teems with soul mind and spirit then he is so benevolent so good tempered and cheerful and like william interests himself so much about every little trifle at first i thought him very plain that is for about three minutes he is pale thin has a wide mouth thick lips and not very good teeth longish loosegrowing half curling rough black hair but if you hear him speak for five minutes you think no more of them his eye is large and full and not very dark but grey such an eye as would receive from a heavy soul the dullest expression but it speaks every emotion of his animated mind it has more of the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling than i ever witnessed he has fine dark eyebrows and an overhanging forehead  the first thing that was read after he came was williams new poem the ruined cottage with which he was much delighted and after tea he repeated to us two acts and a half of his tragedy osorio the next morning william read his tragedy the borderers knights life of wordsworth i 111112   the line coleridge quotes in his description of dorothy     guilt is a thing impossible in her   occurs in the additional verses coleridge had written to the joan of arc lines sent to lamb  john thelwall one of the sturdy democrats of the time who had made no small commotion with his revolutionary principles had also visited coleridge at stowey in the summer of 1797 coleridge had corresponded with him before knowing him personally letters 202 chiefly about politics religion and books coleridge thus describes thelwall to wade     letter 64 to wade  stowey 1720 july 1797  my very dear friend     john thelwall is a very warmhearted honest man and disagreeing as we do on almost every point of religion of morals of politics and philosophy we like each other uncommonly well he is a great favorite with sara energetic activity of mind and of heart is his master feature he is prompt to conceive and still prompter to execute but i think he is deficient in that patience of mind which can look intensely and frequently at the same subject he believes and disbelieves with impassioned confidence i wish to see him doubting and doubting he is intrepid eloquent and honest perhaps the only acting democrat that is honest for the patriots are ragged cattle a most execrable herd arrogant because they are ignorant and boastful of the strength of reason because they have never tried it enough to know its weakness oh my poor country the clouds cover thee there is not one spot of clear blue in the whole heaven  my love to all whom you love and believe me with brotherly affection with esteem and gratitude and every warm emotion of the heart  your faithful  s t coleridge  the next letter closes the visit of thelwall     letter 65 to cottle  stowey

act he set off a week ago  j dykes campbell in his life of coleridge asserts that the tragedy of osorio was sent to drury lane without much hope that it would be accepted1 this however is inaccurate the play was not sent coleridge went to london with it for he writes to cottle in the beginning of september  footnote 1 life p 78    letter 67 to cottle  london 1015 sept 1797  dear cottle  if mrs

of probability that it will be accepted it gave me no pain and great pleasure in finding that it gave me no pain  i had rather hoped than believed that i was possessed of so much philosophical capability sheridan most certainly has not used me with common justice the proposal came from himself and although this circumstance did not bind him to accept the tragedy it certainly bound him to every and that the earliest attention to it i suppose it is snugly in his green bag if it have not emigrated to the kitchen  i sent to the monthly magazine 1797 three mock sonnets in ridicule of my own poems and charles lloyds and lambs etc etc exposing that affectation of unaffectedness of jumping and misplaced accent in commonplace epithets flat lines forced into poetry by italics signifying how well and mouthishly the author would read them puny pathos etc etc the instances were almost all taken from myself and lloyd and lamb  i signed them nehemiah higginbotham i think they may do good

and hearing that coleridge was in need of funds tom wedgwood offered coleridge £100 sending an order for the amount coleridge was now meditating entering the unitarian ministry and was perplexed whether to remain with poetry or enter the pulpit he writes to cottle on the occasion    letter 70 to cottle  stowey january 1798  my very dear friend  this last fortnight has been very eventful i received one hundred pounds from josiah wedgwood in order to prevent the necessity of my going into the ministry i have received an invitation from shrewsbury to be minister there and after fluctuations of mind which have for nights together robbed me of sleep and i am afraid of health i have at length returned the order to mr wedgwood with a long letter explanatory of my conduct and accepted the shrewsbury invitation    the next letter cottle says refers to the wedgwood pension but may be about the rejection of the £100l  footnote 1 see litchfields tom wedgwood pp 5456   letter

feeling can be repaid by kindly feeling i am not your debtor i would wish to express the same thing which is big at my heart but i know not how to do it without indelicacy as much abstracted from

footnote 1 letter lxxviii follows 72   the next letter is an amusing one coming from coleridge it is an apology for the monody on the death of chatterton which he wished to discard from the second edition of his poems but which cottle insisted on retaining among the poets choice fish picked gutted and cleaned      letter 73 to the editor of the monthly magazine  january 1798  sir  i hope this letter may arrive time enough to answer its purpose i cannot help considering myself as having been placed in a very ridiculous light by the gentlemen who have remarked answered and rejoined concerning my monody on chatterton i have not seen the compositions of my competitors unless indeed the exquisite poem of wartons entitled the suicide refer to this subject but this i know that my own is a very poor one it was a school exercise somewhat altered and it would have been omitted in the last edition of my poems but for the request of my friend mr cottle whose property those poems are if it be not in your intention to exhibit my name on any future month you will accept my best thanks and not publish this letter but if crito and the alphabetmen should continue to communicate on this subject and you should think it proper for reasons best known to yourself to publish their communications then i depend on your kindness for the insertion of my letter by which it is possible those your correspondents may be induced to expend their remarks whether panegyrical or vituperative on nobler game than on a poem which was in truth the first effort of a young man all whose poems a candid critic will only consider as first efforts  yours with due respect  s t coleridge  shrewsbury   coleridge even at this date shows signs of a catholicism in literary taste beyond the average man of his time but it is an intellectual hospitality to all sorts and conditions of minds and men rather than a wide or deep enlightenment  he already manifested a tendency to read the most abstruse and outoftheway books he commissioned thelwall to purchase for him iamblichus proclus sidonius apollinaris plotinus ficino and he read dupuis huge origine de tous les cultes a fantastic work tracing the genesis of all religions to the worship of the stars letters 1812 this love of recondite lore remained with him through life but it was his meeting with william and dorothy wordsworth that helped most at this juncture to develop the possibilities within him wordsworth was one of those who are lofty rather than wide but who by their self concentration act as a healthy corrective to the overdiffusiveness of the shakespearian type of mind      chapter vi  the lyrical ballads germany   cottles acquaintance with coleridge led to his making friends with wordsworth and in his early recollections and reminiscences the bristol bookseller tells a few amusing tales about the poets the following is the best  a visit to mr coleridge at stowey in the year 1797 had been the means of my introduction to mr wordsworth soon after our acquaintance had commenced mr w happened to be in bristol and asked me to spend a day or two with him at allfoxden i consented and drove him down in a gig we called for mr coleridge miss wordsworth and the servant at stowey and they walked while we rode on to mr ws house at allfoxden distant two or three miles where we purposed to dine a london alderman would smile at our prepation or bill of fare it consisted of philosophers viands namely a bottle of brandy a noble loaf and a stout piece of cheese and as there were plenty of lettuces in the garden with all these comforts we calculated on doing very well  our fond hopes however were somewhat damped by finding that our stout piece of cheese had vanished a sturdy rat of a beggar whom we had relieved on the road with his olfactories all alive no doubt smelt our cheese and while we were gazing at the magnificent clouds contrived to abstract our treasure cruel tramp an ill return for our pence we both wished the rind might not choke him the mournful fact was ascertained a little before we drove into the courtyard of the house mr coleridge bore the loss with great fortitude observing that we should never starve with a loaf of bread and a bottle of brandy he now with the dexterity of an adept admired by his friends around unbuckled the horse and putting down the shafts with a jerk as a triumphant conclusion of his work lo the bottle of brandy that had been placed most carefully behind us on the seat from the force of gravity suddenly rolled down and before we could arrest this spirituous avalanche pitching right on the stones was dashed to pieces we all beheld the spectacle silent and petrified we might have collected the broken fragments of glass but the brandy that was gone clean gone  one little untoward thing often follows another and while the rest stood musing chained to the place regaling themselves with the cognac effluvium and all miserably chagrined i led the horse to the stable when a fresh perplexity arose i removed the harness without difficulty but after many strenuous attempts i could not get off the collar in despair i called for assistance when aid soon drew near mr wordsworth first brought his ingenuity into exercise but after several unsuccessful efforts he relinquished the achievement as a thing altogether impracticable mr coleridge now tried his hand but showed no more grooming skill than his predecessors for after twisting the poor horses neck almost to strangulation and to the great danger of his eyes he gave up the useless task pronouncing that the horses head must have grown gout or dropsy since the collar was put on for he said it was a downright impossibility for such a huge os frontis to pass through so narrow a collar just at this instant the servant girl came near and understanding the cause of our consternation la master said she you do not go about the work in the right way you should do like as this when turning the collar completely upside down she slipped it off in a moment to our great humiliation and wonderment each satisfied afresh that there were heights of knowledge in the world to which we had not yet attained  we were now summoned to dinner and a dinner it was such as every blind and starving man in the three kingdoms would have rejoiced to behold at the top of the table stood a superb brown loaf the centre dish presented a pile of the true coss lettuces and at the bottom appeared an empty plate where the stout piece of cheese ought to have stood cruel mendicant and though the brandy was clean gone yet its place was well if not better supplied by an abundance of fine sparkling castalian champagne a happy thought at this time started into one of our minds that some condiment would render the lettuces a little more palatable when an individual in the company recollected a question once propounded by the most patient of men how can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt and asked for a little of that valuable culinary article indeed sir betty replied i quite forgot to buy salt a general laugh followed the announcement in which our host heartily joined this was nothing we had plenty of other good things and while crunching our succulents and munching our crusts we pitied the far worse condition of those perchance as hungry as ourselves who were forced to dine off aether alone for our next meal the mileoff village furnished all that could be desired and these trifling incidents present the sum and the result of half the little passing disasters of life  the lyrical ballads were published about midsummer 1798 in september of the same year mr coleridge and mr wordsworth left england for germany and i quitted the business of a bookseller had i not once been such this book would never have appeared   the reference in the following letter to a ballad of 340 lines has never been explained by any biographer of coleridge the ancient mariner in its first form extended to 658 lines some have surmised that the three graves is meant but this poem was 318 lines as published in 18091817   letter 74 to cottle  feb 18 1798  my dear cottle  i have finished my ballad it is 340 lines i am going on with my visions altogether for i shall print two scenes of my tragedy as fragments i can add 1500 lines now what do you advise shall i add my tragedy and so make a second volume or shall i pursue my first intention of inserting 1500 in the third edition if you should advise a second volume should you wish ie find it convenient to be the purchaser i ask this question because i wish you to know the true state of my present circumstances i have received nothing yet from the wedgwoods and my money is utterly expended  a friend of mine wanted five guineas for a little while which i borrowed of poole as for myself i do not like therefore to apply to him mr estlin has some little money i believe in his hands but i received from him before i went to shrewsbury fifteen pounds and i believe that this was an anticipation of the five guinea presents which my friends would have made in march but this affair of the messrs wedgwoods turning out the money in mr estlins hand must go towards repaying him that sum which he suffered me to anticipate meantime i owe biggs £5 which is heavy on my thoughts and mrs f has not been paid her last quarter which is still heavier as to myself i can continue to go on here but this £10 i must pay somehow that is £5 to biggs and £5 to mrs f  god bless you  s t coleridge  ps this week i purpose offering myself to the bridgwater socinian congregation as assistant minister without any salary directly or indirectly but of this say not a word to any one unless you see mr estlin   coleridge sent his poem of the raven to the morning post at this time with the following curious letter to the editor the poem appeared in the paper of 10th march     letter 75 to the editor of the morning post with the raven a poem  10 march 1798  sir  i am not absolutely certain that the following poem was written by edmund spenser and found by an angler buried in a fishingbox     under the foot of mole that mountain hoar   mid the green alders by the mullas shore   but a learned antiquarian of my acquaintance has given it as his opinion that it resembles spensers minor poems as nearly as vortigern and rowena the tragedies of william shakespeare this poem must be read in recitative in the same manner as the aegloga secunda of the shepherds calendar  cuddy   the latin motto cottle says prefixed to the second edition of mr cs poems puzzled everybody to know from what author it was derived one and another inquired of me to no purpose and expressed a wish that mr c had been clearer in his citation as no one could understand it on my naming this to mr coleridge he laughed heartily and said it was all a hoax not meeting said he with a suitable motto i invented one and with references purposely obscure as will be explained in the next letter     letter 76 to cottle  march 8th 1798  my dear cottle  i have been confined to my bed for some days through a fever occasioned by the stump of a tooth which baffled chirurgical efforts to eject and which by affecting my eye affected my stomach and through that my whole frame i am better but still weak in consequence of such long sleeplessness and wearying pains weak very weak i thank you my dear friend for your late kindness and in a few weeks will either repay you in money or by verses as you like with regard to lloyds verses it is curious that i should be applied to to be persuaded to resign and in hopes that i might consent to give up unknown by whom a number of poems which were published at the earnest request of the author who assured me that the circumstance was of no trivial import to his happiness  times change and people change but let us keep our souls in quietness i have no objection to any disposal of lloyds poems except that of their being republished with mine the motto which i had prefixedduplex etc from groscollias has placed me in a ridiculous situation but it was a foolish and presumptuous start of affectionateness and i am not unwilling to incur the punishment due to my folly by past experiences we build up our moral being the giant wordsworthgod love him when i speak in the terms of admiration due to his intellect i fear lest these terms should keep out of sight the amiableness of his manners he has written near twelve hundred lines of a blank verse 1 superior i hesitate not to aver to anything in our language which any way resembles it god bless you  s t coleridge 2  footnote 1 the ruined cottage or tale of margaret afterwards incorporated in the excursion  footnote 2 letter lxxix is our 76 which see for full text     letter 77 to wade  march 21st 1798  my very dear friend  i have even now returned from a little excursion that i have taken for the confirmation of my health which had suffered a rude assault from the anguish of the stump of a tooth which had baffled the attempts of our surgeon here and which confined me to my bed i suffered much from the disease and more from the doctor rather than again put my mouth into his hands i would put my hands into a lions mouth i am happy to hear of and should be most happy to see the plumpness and progression of your dear boy butyes my dear wade it must be a but much as i hate the word but wellbut i cannot attend the chemical lectures i have many reasons but the greatest or at least the most ostensible reason is that i cannot leave mrs c at that time our house is an uncomfortable one our surgeon may be for aught i know a lineal descendant of esculapius himself but if so in the repeated transfusion of life from father to son through so many generations the wit and knowledge being subtle spirits have evaporated  ever your grateful and affectionate friend  s t coleridge    letter 78 to cottle  mch or apl 1798  my dear cottle  i regret that aught should have disturbed our tranquillity respecting lloyd i am willing to believe myself in part mistaken and so let all things be as before i have no wish respecting these poems either for or against republication with mine as to the third edition if there be occasion for it immediately it must be published with some alterations but no additions or omissions the pixies chatterton and some dozen others shall be printed at the end of the volume under the title of juvenile poems and in this case i will send you the volume immediately but if there be no occasion for the volume to go to press for ten weeks at the expiration of that time i would make it a volume worthy of me and omit utterly near onehalf of the present volumea sacrifice to pitch black oblivion  whichever be the case i will repay you the money you have paid for me in money and in a few weeks or if you should prefer the latter proposal ie the not sending me to the press for ten weeks i should insist on considering the additions however large as my payment to you for the omissions which indeed would be but strict justice  i am requested by wordsworth to put to you the following questions what could you conveniently and prudently and what would you give forfirst our two tragedies with small prefaces containing an analysis of our principal characters exclusive of the prefaces the tragedies are together five thousand lines which in printing from the dialogue form and directions respecting actors and scenery are at least equal to six thousand to be delivered to you within a week of the date of your answer to this letter and the money which you offer to be paid to us at the end of four months from the same date none to be paid before all to be paid then  secondwordsworths salisbury plain and tale of a woman which two poems with a few others which he will add and the notes will make a volume this to be delivered to you within three weeks of the date of your answer and the money to be paid as before at the end of four months from the present date  do not my dearest cottle harass yourself about the imagined great merit of the compositions or be reluctant to offer what you can prudently offer from an idea that the poems are worth more but calculate what you can do with reference simply to yourself and answer as speedily as you can and believe me your sincere grateful and affectionate friend and brother  s t coleridge   cottle offered thirty guineas each to wordsworth and coleridge for their tragedies but this offer says cottle after some hesitation was declined from the hope of introducing one or both on the stage cottle received the following letter soon after     letter 79 to cottle  14 apl 1798  my dear cottle  i never involved you in bickering and never suspected you in any one action of your life of practising guile against any human being except yourself  your letter supplied only one in a link of circumstances that informed me of some things and perhaps deceived me in others i shall write today to lloyd i do not think i shall come to bristol for these lectures of which you speak1 i ardently wish for the knowledge but mrs coleridge is within a month of her confinement and i cannot i ought not to leave her especially as her surgeon is not a john hunter nor my house likely to perish from a plethora of comforts besides there are other things that might disturb that evenness of benevolent feeling which i wish to cultivate  i am much better and at present at allfoxden and my new and tender health is all over me like a voluptuous feeling god bless you  s t coleridge  footnote 1 chemical lectures by dr beddoes delivered at the red lodge cottle  the origin of the volume of lyrical ballads is best told in cottles own words  wordsworth says cottle on his introduction by coleridge at stowey read me many of his lyrical pieces when i immediately perceived in them extraordinary merit and advised him to publish them expressing a belief that they would be well received i further said he should be at no risk that i would give him the same sum which i had given to mr coleridge and to mr southey and that it would be a gratifying circumstance to me to have been the publisher of the first volumes of three such poets as southey coleridge and wordsworth such a distinction might never again occur to a provincial bookseller  to the idea of publishing he expressed a strong objection and after several interviews i left him with an earnest wish that he would reconsider his determination  soon after mr wordsworth sent me the following letter  allfoxden 12th april 1798  my dear cottle  you will be pleased to hear that i have gone on very rapidly adding to my stock of poetry do come and let me read it to you under the old trees in the park we have a little more than two months to stay in this place within these four days the season has advanced with greater rapidity than i ever remember and the country becomes almost every hour more lovely god bless you  your affectionate friend  w wordsworth  a little time after i received an invitation from mr coleridge to pay himself and mr wordsworth another visit at about the same time i received the following corroborative invitation from mr wordsworth  dear cottle  we look for you with great impatience we will never forgive you if you do not come i say nothing of the salisbury plain till i see you i am determined to finish it and equally so that you shall publish  i have lately been busy about another plan which i do not wish to mention till i see you let this be very very soon and stay a week if possible as much longer as you can god bless you dear cottle  yours sincerely  w wordsworth  allfoxden 9th may 1798  the following letter also on this subject was received from mr coleridge     letter 80 to cottle  april 1798  my dear cottle  neither wordsworth nor myself could have been otherwise than uncomfortable if any but yourself had received from us the first offer of our tragedies and of the volume of wordsworths poems at the same time we did not expect that you could with prudence and propriety advance such a sum as we should want at the time we specified in short we both regard the publication of our tragedies as an evil it is not impossible but that in happier times they may be brought on the stage and to throw away this chance for a mere trifle would be to make the present moment act fraudulently and usuriously towards the future time  my tragedy employed and strained all my thoughts and faculties for six or seven months wordsworth consumed far more time and far more thought and far more genius we consider the publication of them an evil on any terms but our thoughts were bent on a plan for the accomplishment of which a certain sum of money was necessary the whole at that particular time and in order to this we resolved although reluctantly to part with our tragedies that is if we could obtain thirty guineas for each and at less than thirty guineas wordsworth will not part with the copyright of his volume of poems we shall offer the tragedies to no one for we have determined to procure the money some other way if you choose the volume of poems at the price mentioned to be paid at the time specified ie thirty guineas to be paid sometime in the last fortnight of july you may have them but remember my dear fellow i write to you now merely as a bookseller and intreat you in your answer to consider yourself only as to us although money is necessary to our plan that of visiting germany yet the plan is not necessary to our happiness and if it were w could sell his poems for that sum to someone else or we could procure the money without selling the poems so i entreat you again and again in your answer which must be immediate consider yourself only  wordsworth has been caballed against so long and so loudly that he has found it impossible to prevail on the tenant of the allfoxden estate to let him the house after their first agreement is expired so he must quit it at midsummer whether we shall be able to procure him a house and furniture near stowey we know not and yet we must for the hills and the woods and the streams and the sea and the shores would break forth into reproaches against us if we did not strain every nerve to keep their poet among them without joking and in serious sadness poole and i cannot endure to think of losing him  at all events come down cottle as soon as you can but before midsummer and we will procure a horse easy as thy own soul and we will go on a roam to linton and linmouth which if thou comest in may will be in all their pride of woods and waterfalls not to speak of its august cliffs and the green ocean and the vast valley of stones all which live disdainful of the seasons or accept new honours only from the winters snow at all events come down and cease not to believe me much and affectionately your friend  s t coleridge 1  footnote 1 letters lxxxlxxxv follow letter 80    in consequence of these conjoint invitations i spent a week with mr c and mr w at allfoxden house and during this time beside the reading of ms poems they took me to linmouth and linton and the valley of stones  at this interview it was determined that the volume should be published under the title of lyrical ballads on the terms stipulated in a former letter that this volume should not contain the poem of salisbury plain but only an extract from it that it should not contain the poem of peter bell but consist rather of sundry shorter poems and for the most part of pieces more recently written i had recommended two volumes but one was fixed on and that to be published anonymously it was to be begun immediately and with the ancient mariner which poem i brought with me to bristol a day or two after i received the following     letter 81 to cottle  may 1798  my dear cottle  you know what i think of a letter how impossible it is to argue in it you must therefore take simple statements and in a week or two i shall see you and endeavour to reason with you  wordsworth and i have duly weighed your proposal and this is an answer he would not object to the publishing of peter bell or the salisbury plain singly but to the publishing of his poems in two volumes he is decisively repugnant and oppugnant  he deems that they would want variety etc etc if this apply in his case it applies with tenfold more force to mine we deem that the volumes offered to you are to a certain degree one work in kind though not in degree as an ode is one work and that our different poems are as stanzas good relatively rather than absolutely mark you i say in kind though not in degree as to the tragedy when i consider it in reference to shakespeares and to one other tragedy it seems a poor thing and i care little what becomes of it when i consider it in comparison with modern dramatists it rises and i think it too bad to be published too good to be squandered i think of breaking it up the planks are sound and i will build a new ship of the old materials  the dedication to the wedgwoods which you recommend would be indelicate and unmeaning if after four or five years i shall have finished some work of importance which could not have been written but in an unanxious seclusion to them i will dedicate it for the public will have owed the work to them who gave me the power of that unanxious seclusion  as to anonymous publications depend on it you are deceived wordsworths name is nothing to a large number of persons mine stinks the essay on man the botanic garden the pleasures of memory and many other most popular works were published anonymously however i waive all reasoning and simply state it as an unaltered opinion that you should proceed as before with the ancient mariner  the picture shall be sent1 for your love gifts and bookloans accept our hearty love the joan of arc is a divine book it opens lovelily i hope that you will take off some half dozen of our poems on great paper even as the joan of arc  cottle my dear cottle i meant to have written you an essay on the metaphysics of typography but i have not time take a few hints without the abstruse reasons for them with which i mean to favour you 18 lines in a page the line closely printed certainly more closely printed than those of the joan2 oh by all means closer w

  coleridge has given his account of the origin of the lyrical ballads in the fourteenth chapter of the biographia literaria and wordsworths account is found in the fenwick note to we are seven  an estrangement with charles lamb and charles lloyd at this time took place which has been the subject of many surmises as to its origin among the biographers of coleridge the coldness with lamb passed off by the beginning of 1800 when charles wrote to coleridge in his customary humorous vein but lloyd was not so soon taken back to favour southey joined the cabal against coleridge and encouraged the estrangement but he too was on friendly terms with coleridge in the autumn of 1799  on the l4th may coleridges second child was born named berkeley after the idealist philosopher who had now displaced hartley who had been in the ascendant when the first child was born  with the adoption of berkeley as his pet philosopher we can understand coleridges determination to visit germany he had heard rumours of the kantean philosophy and wished to acquire thoroughly a knowledge of the language of the germans principally to be able to read kant in the original this project coleridge speaks of as early as 6th may 1796 letter 33 but it was only now when he enjoyed the support of the wedgwoods that he could afford to put it into execution the volume of lyrical ballads was published in the early part of the autumn of 1798 and along with william and dorothy wordsworth coleridge set sail from yarmouth john chester a resident of stowey also accompanied them  coleridge arrived at cuxhaven on 19th september from which place he wrote mrs coleridge an account of the voyage and his first impressions of germany this account is more fully given in the letters of satyrane in the biographia literaria he took up his quarters at ratzeburg staying with the pastor of that town while wordsworth and his sister went to goslar from ratzeburg coleridge repaired to gttingen on 12th february 1799 to attend lectures at the university he worked hard while in göttingen to acquire a knowledge of the literature of germany and made himself proficient in the dialects as well as of classical german he met two of the parrys brothers of the arctic explorer at gttingen and later clement carlyon an englishman from pembroke college joined the group carlyon afterwards in later life in his early years and late reflections depicted coleridge as the life and soul of the party incessantly talking discussing and philosophizing and diving into his pocket german dictionary for the right word carlyon devotes 270 pages of the first volume of his book to coleridge  berkeley coleridge died in february and the news depressed coleridge and threw his studies for some time into disorder but the wordsworths visited him at gttingen and they had some talk about the future place of their abode in england the wordsworths were desirous of staying in the north of england but coleridge at this time had resolved to remain at stowey to be near poole in whom he felt his anchor as he expressed it j dykescampbells life chap v  coleridge during his stay in germany wrote a good many letters to his wife to poole and the wedgwoods we can quote only two fragments from those to his wife and the long one over the brocken     letter 82 to mrs coleridge  14 jany 1799  the whole lake of ratzeburg is one mass of thick transparent icea spotless mirror of nine miles in extent the lowness of the hills which rise from the shores of the lake preclude the awful sublimity of alpine scenery yet compensate for the want of it by beauties of which this very lowness is a necessary condition yestermorning i saw the lesser lake completely hidden by mist but the moment the sun peeped over the hill the mist broke in the middle and in a few seconds stood divided leaving a broad road all across the lake and between these two walls of mist the sunlight burnt upon the ice forming a road of golden fire intolerably bright and the mistwalls themselves partook of the blaze in a multitude of shining colours this is our second frost about a month ago before the thaw came on there was a storm of wind during the whole night such were the thunders and howlings of the breaking ice that they have left a conviction on my mind that there are sounds more sublime than any sight can be more absolutely suspending the power of comparison and more utterly absorbing the minds selfconsciousness in its total attention to the object working upon it part of the ice which the vehemence of the wind had shattered was driven shoreward and froze anew on the evening of the next day at sunset the shattered ice thus frozen appeared of a deep blue and in shape like an agitated sea beyond this the water that ran up between the great islands of ice which had preserved their masses entire and smooth shone of a yellow green but all these scattered iceislands themselves were of an intensely bright blood colourthey seemed blood and light in union on some of the largest of these islands the fishermen stood pulling out their immense nets through the holes made in the ice for this purpose and the men their netpoles and their huge nets were a part of the glory say rather it appeared as if the rich crimson light had shaped itself into these forms figures and attitudes to make a glorious vision in mockery of earthly things  the lower lake is now all alive with skaters and with ladies driven onward by them in their ice cars mercury surely was the first maker of skates and the wings at his feet are symbols of the invention in skating there are three pleasing circumstances the infinitely subtle particles of ice which the skate cuts up and which creep and run before the skate like a low mist and in sunrise or sunset become coloured second the shadow of the skater in the water seen through the transparent ice and third the melancholy undulating sound from the skate not without variety and when very many are skating together the sounds and the noises give an impulse to the icy trees and the woods all round the lake tinkle1  footnote 1 letter xciii repeats 82 xcivxcvi follow    letter 83 to mrs coleridge  ratzeburg 23 april 1799  there is a christmas custom here which pleased and interested methe children make little presents to their parents and to each other and the parents to the children for three or four months before christmas the girls are all busy and the boys save up their pocketmoney to make or purchase these presents what the present is to be is cautiously kept secret and the girls have a world of contrivances to conceal itsuch as working when they are out on visits and the others are not with them getting up in the morning before daylight etc then on the evening before christmas day one of the parlours is lighted up by the children into which the parents must not go a great yew bough is fastened on the table at a little distance from the wall a multitude of little tapers are fastened in the bough but not so as to burn it till they are nearly burnt out and coloured paper etc hangs and flutters from the twigsunder this bough the children lay out in great order the presents they mean for their parents still concealing in their pockets what they intend for each other then the parents are introducedand each presents his little giftand then bring out the rest one by one from their pockets and present them with kisses and embraceswhere i witnessed this scene there were eight or nine children and the eldest daughter and the mother wept aloud for joy and tenderness and the tears ran down the face of the father and he clasped all his children so tight to his breastit seemed as if he did it to stifle the sob that was rising within himi was very much affectedthe shadow of the bough and its appendages on the wall and arching over on the ceiling made a pretty pictureand then the raptures of the very little ones when at last the twigs and their needles began to take fire and snapo it was a delight for themon the next day in the great parlour the parents lay out on the table the presents for the children a scene of more sober joy succeeds as on this day after an old custom the mother says privately to each of her daughters and the father to his sons that which he has observed most praiseworthy and that which was most faulty in their conductformerly and still in all the smaller towns and villages throughout north germany these presents were sent by all the parents to some one fellow who in high buskins a white robe a mask and an enormous flax wig personates knecht rupert ie the servant rupert on christmas night he goes round to every house and says that jesus christ his master sent him thitherthe parents and elder children receive him with great pomp of reverence while the little ones are most terribly frightenedhe then enquires for the children and according to the character which he hears from the parent he gives them the intended present as if they came out of heaven from jesus christor if they should have been bad children he gives the parents a rod and in the name of his master recommends them to use it frequentlyabout seven or eight years old the children are let into the secret and it is curious how faithfully they keep it1   over the brocken must occupy a chapter of itself  footnote 1 letter xcvii repeats 83 xcviii follows     chapter vii   the religion of the pinewoods  coleridge called the letters from germany which he published in the friend of 1809 the letters of satyrane he was fond of masquerading under the name of this allegorical personage of the faery queen and in his tombless epitaph he described himself as idolocrastes satyrane under this disguise he looked upon himself as the spokesman of the idea of the omnipresence of the deity in order to appreciate the following beautiful letter one of the finest coleridge ever wrote the reader should peruse coleridges aeolian harp lines written on leaving a place of retirement the limetree bower and wordsworths tintern abbey wordsworths sonnet it is a beauteous evening and coleridges own hymn before sunrise in the vale of chamouni also belong to the same feeling for the god of nature but they were composed after the letter over the brocken  clement carlyon who is the chief authority for the life of coleridge during his stay at gttingen gives a lively account of the ascent of the brocken which took place on whit sunday 12th may 1799 the party visited the magic circle of stones where the fairies assembled and halted for the first time at the village of satzfeld a romantic village a bright moonlight at night and the nightingale heard coleridge was in high spirits and kept talking all the way discoursing on his favourite topics sublimity was defined as a suspension of the powers of comparison no animal but man can be struck with wonder shakespeare owed his success largely to the cheering breath of popular applause the enthusiastic gale of admiration the english divines were applauded by coleridge jeremy taylor prominently and a play by hans sachs was preferred to a play of kotzebue from which he launched into a discourse on miracle plays coleridges conversation was peppered with puns some of which carlyon quotes  carlyon also notices that their course up the mountain was impeded by stunted firs and he describes the dancing party of peasants with whom coleridge was so much taken the party returned to gottingen on 18th may coleridge had written the day before to his wife     letter 84 to mrs coleridge  clausthal 17 may 1799  through roads no way rememberable we came to gieloldshausen over a bridge on which was a mitred statue with a great crucifix in its arms the village long and ugly but the church like most catholic churches interesting and this being whitsun eve all were crowding to it with their massbooks and rosaries the little babies commonly with coral crosses hanging on the breast here we took a guide left the village ascended a hill and now the woods rose up before us in a verdure which surprised us like a sorcery the spring had burst forth with the suddenness of a russian summer as we left gottingen there were buds and here and there a tree half green but here were woods in full foliage distinguished from summer only by the exquisite freshness of their tender green we entered the wood through a beautiful mossy path the moon above us blending with the evening light and every now and then a nightingale would invite the others to sing and some or other commonly answered and said as we suppose it is yet somewhat too early for the song was not continued we came to a square piece of greenery completely walled on all four sides by the beeches again entered the wood and having travelled about a mile emerged from it into a grand plainmountains in the distance but ever by our road the skirts of the green woods a very rapid river ran by our side and now the nightingales were all singing and the tender verdure grew paler in the moonlight only the smooth parts of the river were still deeply purpled with the reflections from the fiery light in the west so surrounded and so impressed we arrived at prele a dear little cluster of houses in the middle of a semicircle of woody hills the area of the semicircle scarcely broader than the breadth of the village                                we afterwards ascended another hill from the top of which a large plain opened before us with villages a little village neuhoff lay at the foot of it we reached it and then turned up through a valley on the left hand the hills on both sides the valley were prettily wooded and a rapid lively river ran through it so we went for about two miles and almost at the end of the valley or rather of its first turning we found the village of lauterberg just at the entrance of the village two streams come out from two deep and woody coombs close by each other meet and run into a third deep woody coomb opposite before you a wild hill which seems the end and barrier of the valley on the right hand low hills now green with corn and now wooded and on the left a most majestic hill indeedthe effect of whose simple outline painting could not give and how poor a thing are words we pass through this neat little townthe majestic hill on the left hand soaring over the houses and at every interspace you see the whole of itits beeches its firs its rocks its scattered cottages and the one neat little pastors house at the foot embosomed in fruittrees all in blossom the noisy coombbrook dashing close by it we leave the valley or rather the first turning on the left following a stream and so the vale winds on the river still at the foot of the woody hills with every now and then other smaller valleys on right and left crossing our vale and ever before you the woody hills running like groves one into another we turned and turned and entering the fourth curve of the vale we found all at once that we had been ascending the verdure vanished all the beech trees were leafless and so were the silver birches whose boughs always winter and summer hang so elegantly but low down in the valley and in little companies on each bank of the river a multitude of green conical fir trees with herds of cattle wandering about almost every one with a cylindrical bell around its neck of no inconsiderable size and as they movedscattered over the narrow vale and up among the trees on the hillthe noise was like that of a great city in the stillness of a sabbath morning when the bells all at once are ringing for church the whole was a melancholy and romantic scene that was quite new to me again we turned passed three smelting houses which we visited a scene of terrible beauty is a furnace of boiling metal darting every moment blue green and scarlet lightning like serpents tonguesand now we ascended a steep hill on the top of which was st andrias berg a town built wholly of wood  we descended again to ascend far higher and now we came to a most beautiful road which winded on the breast of the hill from whence we looked down into a deep valley or huge basin full of pines and firs the opposite hills full of pines and frs and the hill above us on whose breast we were winding likewise full of pines and firs the valley or basin on our right hand into which we looked down is called the wald rauschenbach that is the valley of the roaring brook and roar it did indeed most solemnly  the road on which we walked was weedy with infant firtrees an inch or two high and now on our left hand came before us a most tremendous precipice of yellow and black rock called the rehberg that is the mountain of the roe now again is nothing but firs and pines above below around us how awful is the deep unison of their undividable murmur what a one thing it isit is a sound that impresses the dim notion of the omnipresent in various parts of the deep vale below us we beheld little dancing waterfalls gleaming through the branches and now on our left hand from the very summit of the hill above us a powerful stream flung itself down leaping and foaming and now concealed and now not concealed and now half concealed by the firtrees till towards the road it became a visible sheet of water within whose immediate neighbourhood no pine could have permanent abiding place the snow lay every where on the sides of the roads and glimmered in company with the waterfall foam snow patches and waterbreaks glimmering through the branches in the hill above the deep basin below and the hill opposite over the high opposite hills so dark in their pine forests a far higher round barren stony mountain looked in upon the prospect from a distant country through this scenery we passed on till our road was crossed by a second waterfall or rather aggregation of little dancing waterfalls one by the side of the other for a considerable breadth and all came at once out of the dark wood above and rolled over the mossy rock fragments little firs growing in islets scattered among them the same scenery continued till we came to the oder seich a lake half made by man and half by nature it is two miles in length and but a few hundred yards in breadth and winds between banks or rather through walls of pine trees it has the appearance of a most calm and majestic river it crosses the road goes into a wood and there at once plunges itself down into a most magnificent cascade and runs into the vale to which it gives the name of the vale of the roaring brook we descended into the vale and stood at the bottom of the cascade and climbed up again by its side the rocks over which it plunged were unusually wild in their shape giving fantastic resemblances of men and animals and the firboughs by the side were kept almost in a swing which unruly motion contrasted well with the stern quietness of the huge forestsea every where else                                in nature all things are individual but a word is but an arbitrary character for a whole class of things so that the same description may in almost all cases be applied to twenty different appearances and in addition to the difficulty of the thing itself i neither am nor ever was a good hand at description i see what i write but alas i cannot write what i see from the oder seich we entered a second wood and now the snow met us in large masses and we walked for two miles kneedeep in it with an inexpressible fatigue till we came to the mount called little brocken here even the firs deserted us or only now and then a patch of them windshorn no higher than ones knee matted and cowering to the ground like our thorn bushes on the highest seahills the soil was plashy and boggy we descended and came to the foot of the great brocken without a riverthe highest mountain in all the north of germany and the seat of innumerable superstitions on the first of may all the witches dance here at midnight and those who go may see their own ghosts walking up and down with a little billet on the back giving the names of those who had wished them there for i wish you on the top of the brocken is a common curse throughout the whole empire well we ascendedthe soil boggyand at last reached the height which is 573 toises 1 above the level of the sea we visited the blocksberg a sort of bowlinggreen enclosed by huge stones something like those at stonehenge and this is the witches ballroom thence proceeded to the house on the hill where we dined and now we descended in the evening about seven we arrived at elbingerode at the inn they brought us an album or stammbuch requesting that we would write our names and something or other as a remembrance that we had been there i wrote the following lines which contain a true account of my journey from the brocken to elbingerode     i stood on brockens sovran height and saw   woods crowding upon woods hills over hills   a surging scene and only limited   by the blue distance wearily my way   downward i dragged through fir groves evermore   where bright green moss moved in sepulchral forms   speckled with sunshine and but seldom heard   the sweet birds song become a hollow sound   and the gale murmuring indivisibly   reserved its solemn murmur more distinct   from many a note of many a waterbreak   and the brooks chatter on whose islet stones   the dingy kidling with its tinkling bell   leapt frolicksome or old romantic goat   sat his white beard slow waving i moved on   with low and languid thought for i had found   that grandest scenes have but imperfect charms   where the eye vainly wanders nor beholds   one spot with which the heart associates   holy remembrances of child or friend   or gentle maid our first and early love   or father or the venerable name   of our adored country o thou queen   thou delegated deity of earth   o dear dear england how my longing eyes   turned westward shaping in the steady clouds   thy sands and high white cliffs sweet native isle   this heart was proud yea mine eyes swam with tears   to think of thee and all the goodly view   from sovran brocken woods and woody hills   floated away like a departing dream   feeble and dim stranger these impulses   blame thou not lightly nor will i profane   with hasty judgment or injurious doubt   that mans sublimer spirit who can feel   that god is every where the god who framed   mankind to be one mighty brotherhood   himself our father and the world our home   we left elbingerode may 14th and travelled for half a mile through a wild country of bleak stony hills by our side with several caverns or rather mouths of caverns visible in their breasts and now we came to rubillandoh it was a lovely scene our road was at the foot of low hills and here were a few neat cottages behind us were high hills with a few scattered firs and flocks of goats visible on the topmost crags on our right hand a fine shallow river about thirty yards broad and beyond the river a crescent hill clothed with firs that rise one above another like spectators in an amphitheatre we advanced a little fartherthe crags behind us ceased to be visible and now the whole was one and complete all that could be seen was the cottages at the foot of the low green hill cottages embosomed in fruit trees in blossom the stream and the little crescent of firs i lingered here and unwillingly lost sight of it for a little while the firs were so beautiful and the masses of rocks walls and obelisks started up among them in the very places where if they had not been a painter with a poets feeling would have imagined them crossed the river its name bodi entered the sweet wood and came to the mouth of the cavern with the man who shews it it was a huge place eight hundred feet in length and more in depth of many different apartments and the only thing that distinguished it from other caverns was that the guide who was really a character had the talent of finding out and seeing uncommon likenesses in the different forms of the stalactite here was a nunthis was solomons templethat was a roman catholic chapelhere was a lions claw nothing but flesh and blood wanting to make it completely a claw this was an organ and had all the notes of an organ etc etc etc but alas with all possible straining of my eyes ears and imagination i could see nothing but common stalactite and heard nothing but the dull ding of common cavern stones one thing was really strikinga huge cone of stalactite hung from the roof of the largest apartment and on being struck gave perfectly the sound of a deathbell i was behind and heard it repeatedly at some distance and the effect was very much in the fairy kindgnomes and things unseen that toll mock deathbells for mock funerals after this a little clear well and a black stream pleased me the most and multiplied by fifty and coloured ad libitum might be well enough to read of in a novel or poem we returned and now before the inn on the green plat around the maypole the villagers were celebrating whittuesday this maypole is hung as usual with garlands on the top and in these garlands spoons and other little valuables are placed the high smooth round pole is then well greased and now he who can climb up to the top may have what he can geta very laughable scene as you may suppose of awkwardness and agility and failures on the very brink of success now began a dance the women danced very well and in general i have observed throughout germany that the women in the lower ranks degenerate far less from the ideal of a woman than the men from that of man the dances were reels and waltzes but chiefly the latter this dance is in the higher circles sufficiently voluptuous but here the emotions of it were far more faithful interpreters of the passion which doubtless the dance was intended to shadow yet ever after the giddy round and round is over they walked to music the woman laying her arm with confident affection on the mans shoulders or around his neck the first couple at the waltzing was a very fine tall girl of two or three and twenty in the full bloom and growth of limb and feature and a fellow with huge whiskers a long tail and woollen nightcap he was a soldier and from the more than usual glances of the girl i presumed was her lover he was beyond compare the gallant and the dancer of the party next came two boors one of whom in the whole contour of his face and person and above all in the laughably wouldbe frolicksome kick out of his heel irresistibly reminded me of shakespeares slender and the other of his dogberry oh two such faces and two such postures o that i were an hogarth what an enviable gift it is to have a genius in painting their partners were pretty lasses not so tall as the former and danced uncommonly light and airy the fourth couple was a sweet girl of about seventeen delicately slender and very prettily dressed with a fullblown rose in the white ribbon that went round her head and confined her reddishbrown hair and her partner waltzed with a pipe in his mouth smoking all the while and during the whole of this voluptuous dance his countenance was a fair personification of true german phlegm after these but i suppose not actually belonging to the party a little ragged girl and ragged boy with his stockings about his heels waltzed and dancedwaltzing and dancing in the rear most entertainingly but what most pleased me was a little girl of about three or four years old certainly not more than four who had been put to watch a little babe of not more than a year old for one of our party had asked and who was just beginning to run away the girl teaching him to walk and who was so animated by the music that she began to waltz with him and the two babes whirled round and round hugging and kissing each other as if the music had made them mad there were two fiddles and a bass viol the fiddlersabove all the bass violermost hogarthian phizzes god love them i felt far more affection for them than towards any other set of human beings i have met with since i have been in germany i suppose because they looked so happy  footnote 1 marked with an asterisk in the proofing not the original text but not explained further     chapter viii   return to england wallenstein and the morning post  on the 21st may coleridge wrote the following letter in which he informs josiah wedgwood what he had done in germany and what he expected to do with the knowledge which he had acquired there  letter 85 to josiah wedgwood  may 21st 1799 gottingen  my dear sir  i have lying by my side six huge letters with your name on each of them and all excepting one have been written for these three months about this time mr hamilton by whom i send this and the little parcel for my wife was as it were setting off for england and i seized the opportunity of sending them by him as without any mockmodesty i really thought that the expense of the postage to me and to you would be more than their worth day after day and week after week was hamilton going and still delayed and now that it is absolutely settled that he goes tomorrow it is likewise absolutely settled that i shall go this day three weeks and i have therefore sent only this and the picture by him but the letters i will now take myself for i should not like them to be lost as they comprise the only subject on which i have had an opportunity of making myself thoroughly informed and if i carry them myself i can carry them without danger of their being seized at yarmouth as all my letters were yours to  excepted which were luckily not sealed before i left england i had read the book of which you speak 1 i must confess that it appeared to me exceedingly illogical godwins and condorcets extravagancies were not worth confuting and yet i thought that the essay on population had not confuted them professor wallace derham and a number of german statistic and physicotheological writers had taken the same ground namely that population increases in a geometrical but the accessional nutriment only in arithmetical ratioand that vice and misery the natural consequences of this order of things were intended by providence as the counterpoise i have here no means of procuring so obscure a book as rudgards but to the best of my recollection at the time that the fifth monarchy enthusiasts created so great a sensation in england under the protectorate and the beginning of charles the seconds reign rudgard or rutgard i am not positive even of the name wrote an essay to the same purpose in which he asserted that if war pestilence vice and poverty were wholly removed the world could not exist two hundred years etc seiffmilts 2 in his great work concerning the divine order and regularity in the destiny of the human race has a chapter entitled a confutation of this idea i read it with great eagerness and found therein that this idea militated against the glory and goodness of god and must therefore be falsebut further confutation found i nonethis book of seiffmilts has a prodigious character throughout germany and never methinks did a work less deserve it it is in three huge octavos and wholly on the general laws that regulate the population of the human speciesbut is throughout most unphilosophical and the tables which he has collected with great industry prove nothing my objections to the essay on population you will find in my sixth letter at largebut do not my dear sir suppose that because unconvinced by this essay i am therefore convinced of the contrary no god knows i am sufficiently sceptical and in truth more than sceptical concerning the possibility of universal plenty and wisdom but my doubts rest on other grounds i had some conversation with you before i left england on this subject and from that time i had purposed to myself to examine as thoroughly as it was possible for me the important question is the march of the human race progressive or in cycles but more of this when we meet  what have i done in germany i have learned the language both high and low german i can read both and speak the former so fluently that it must be a fortune for a german to be in my company that is i have words enough and phrases enough and i arrange them tolerably but my pronunciation is hideous 2ndly i can read the oldest german the frankish and the swabian 3rdly i have attended the lectures on physiology anatomy and natural history with regularity and have endeavoured to understand these subjects 4thly i have read and made collections for a history of the belles lettres in germany before the time of lessing and 5thly very large collections for a life of lessing to which i was led by the miserably bad and unsatisfactory biographies that have been hitherto given and by my personal acquaintance with two of lessings friends soon after i came into germany i made up my mind fully not to publish anything concerning my travels as people call them yet i soon perceived that with all possible economy my expenses would be greater than i could justify unless i did something that would to a moral certainty repay them i chose the life of lessing for the reasons above assigned and because it would give me an opportunity of conveying under a better name than my own ever will be opinions which i deem of the highest importance accordingly my main business at gottingen has been to read all the numerous controversies in which lessing was engaged and the works of all those german poets before the time of lessing which i could not afford to buy for these last four months with the exception of last week in which i visited the hartz i have worked harder than i trust in god almighty i shall ever have occasion to work again this endless transcription is such a bodyandsoulwearying purgatory i shall have bought thirty pounds worth of books chiefly metaphysics and with a view to the one work to which i hope to dedicate in silence the prime of my life but i believe and indeed doubt not that before christmas i shall have repaid myself 3  i never to the best of my recollection felt the fear of death but once that was yesterday when i delivered the picture to hamilton i felt and shivered as i felt it that i should not like to die by land or water before i see my wife and the little one that i hope yet remains to me but it was an idle sort of feeling and i should not like to have it again poole half mentioned in a hasty way a circumstance that depressed my spirits for many daysthat you and thomas were on the point of settling near stowey but had abandoned it god almighty what a dream of happiness it held out to me writes poole i felt disappointment without having had hope  in about a month i hope to see you till then may heaven bless and preserve us believe me my dear sir with every feeling of love esteem and gratitude  your affectionate friend

letters xcixciii follow letter 85   it is interesting to compare this letter with that to poole of 6th may 1796 it will be seen that coleridge thus carried out his project of three years before he had been able to convince the wedgwoods of the desirability of introducing a knowledge of the german philosophy into england to refute the philosophy of hume and expose the shallowness of the metaphysics of locke and the paley school of theology tom wedgwood was himself a philosopher and saw in coleridge the champion of a new basis of faith and hence the friendship between them and the support of the wedgwoods to coleridge in carrying out his selfeducation  coleridge returned to england about a month after the wordsworths in july 1799 and he reached stowey before the 29th when he wrote to southey and the two worked in concert for the publication of an annual started as the annual anthology of which two volumes appeared one in 1799 and one in 1800 coleridge contributing some of his poems to the latter the devils thoughts a conjoint squib which caused some sensation was sent to the morning post on 6th september  coleridge spent a part of the autumn of 1799 at ottery st mary visiting his mother and brothers coleridge then went to southey at exeter and they visited the ash dells round about dartmoor together letters 305 coleridge also saw josiah wedgwood at his seat of upcott on his way home and on 15th october we find him back at stowey letters 307 still later he went north to see wordsworth who was staying at sockburn on the tees with the hutchinsons cottle accompanied them as far as greta bridge where john wordsworth joined their company coleridge and william and john wordsworth then went on tour to the lake district visiting grasmere when wordsworth made arrangements to take a house at townend now known as dove cottage and came back to sockburn knights life of wordsworth chap xii it was at sockburn that coleridge first met sarah hutchinson and here it is conjectured he wrote his beautiful poem love which appeared in its first form in the morning post on 21st december 1799 prefaced with the following letter      letter 86 to the editor of the morning post with the poem love first published as introduction to the tale of the dark ladie  21 december 1799  sir  the following poem is the introduction to a somewhat longer one for which i shall solicit insertion on your next open day the use of the old ballad word ladie for lady is the only piece of obsoleteness in it and as it is professedly a tale of ancient times i trust that the affectionate lovers of venerable antiquity as cambden says will grant me their pardon and perhaps may be induced to admit a force and propriety in it a heavier objection may be adduced against the author that in these times of fear and expectation when novelties explode around us in all directions he should presume to offer to the public a silly tale of oldfashioned love and five years ago i own i should have allowed and felt the force of this objection but alas explosion has succeeded explosion so rapidly that novelty itself ceases to appear new and it is possible that now even a simple story wholly unspiced with politics or personality may find some attention amid the hubbub of revolutions as to those who have remained a long time by the falls of niagara the lowest whispering becomes distinctly audible  s t coleridge1  footnote 1 letter civ follows 86  this was followed on 10th january 1800 by the political verses talleyrand to lord grenville heralded by a letter as good as if not better than the verses     letter 87 to the editor of the morning post with talleyrand to lord grenville a metrical epistle  10 january 1800  mr editor  an unmetrical letter from talleyrand to lord grenville has already appeared and from an authority too high to be questioned otherwise i could adduce some arguments for the exclusive authenticity of the following metrical epistle the very epithet which the wise ancients used aurea carmina might have been supposed likely to have determined the choice of the french minister in favour of verse and the rather when we recollect that this phrase of golden verses is applied emphatically to the works of that philosopher who imposed silence on all with whom he had to deal besides is it not somewhat improbable that talleyrand should have preferred prose to rhyme when the latter alone has got the chink is it not likewise curious that in our official answer no notice whatever is taken of the chief consul bonaparte as if there had been no such person existing notwithstanding that his existence is pretty generally admitted nay that some have been so rash as to believe that he has created as great a sensation in the world as lord grenville or even the duke of portland but the minister of foreign affairs talleyrand is acknowledged which in our opinion could not have happened had he written only that insignificant prose letter which seems to precede bonapartes as in old romances a dwarf always ran before to proclaim the advent or arrival of knight or giant that talleyrands character and practices more resemble those of some regular governments than bonapartes i admit but this of itself does not appear a satisfactory explanation however let the letter speak for itself the second line is supererogative in syllables whether from the oscitancy

letter 88 to thomas wedgwood  21 buckingham street strand january 1800  my dear sir  i am sitting by a fire in a rug great coat your room is doubtless to a greater degree air tight than mine or your notions of tartarus would veer round to the greenlanders creed it is most barbarously cold and you i fear can shield yourself from it only by perpetual imprisonment if any place in the southern climates were in a state of real quiet and likely to continue so should you feel no inclination to migrate poor southey from over great industry as i suspect the industry too of solitary composition has reduced himself to a terrible state of weakness and is determined to leave this country as soon as he has finished the poem on which he is now employed tis a melancholy thing that so young a man and one whose life has ever been so simple and selfdenying     o for a peace and the south of france i could almost wish for a bourbon king if it were only that sieyes and buonaparte might finish their career in the old orthodox way of hanging thank god i have my health perfectly and i am working hard yet the present state of human affairs presses on me for days together so as to deprive me of all my cheerfulness it is probable that a mans private and personal connexions and interests ought to be uppermost in his daily and hourly thoughts and that the dedication of much hope and fear to subjects which are perhaps disproportionate to our faculties and powers is a disease but i have had this disease so long and my early education was so undomestic that i know not how to get rid of it or even to wish to get rid of it life were so flat a thing without enthusiasm that if for a moment it leaves me i have a sort of stomach sensation attached to all my thoughts like those which succeed to the pleasurable operations of a dose of opium  now i make up my mind to a sort of heroism in believing the progressiveness of all nature during the present melancholy state of humanity and on this subject i am now writing and no work on which i ever employed myself makes me so happy while i am writing  i shall remain in london till april the expenses of my last year made it necessary for me to exert my industry and many other good ends are answered at the same time where i next settle i shall continue and that must be in a state of retirement and rustication it is therefore good for me to have a run of society and that various and consisting of marked characters likewise by being obliged to write without much elaboration i shall greatly improve myself in naturalness and facility of style and the particular subjects on which i write for money are nearly connected with my future schemes my mornings i give to compilations which i am sure cannot be wholly useless and for which by the beginning of april i shall have earned nearly £150 my evenings to the theatres as i am to conduct a sort of dramaturgy or series of essays on the drama both its general principles and likewise in reference to the present state of the english theatres this i shall publish in the morning post my attendance on the theatres costs me nothing and stuart the editor covers my expenses in london two mornings and one whole day i dedicate to these essays on the possible progressiveness of man and on the principles of population in april i retire to my greater worksthe life of lessing my german chests are arrived but i have them not yet but expect them from stowey daily when they come i shall send a letter  i have seen a good deal of godwin who has just published a novel i like him for thinking so well of davy he talks of him every where as the most extraordinary of human beings he had ever met with i cannot say that for i know one whom i feel to be the superior but i never met with so extraordinary a young man i have likewise dined with horne tooke he is a clearheaded old man as every man must needs be who attends to the real import of words but there is a sort of charlatanry in his manner that did not please me he makes such a mystery out of plain and palpable things and never tells you any thing without first exciting and detaining your curiosity but it were a bad heart that could not pardon worse faults than these in the author of the diversions of purley  believe me my dear sir with much affection  yours  s t coleridge 1  thomas wedgwood esq  footnote 1 letter cv follows our no 88   letter 89 to josiah wedgwood  21 buckingham street feb 1800  my dear sir  your brothers health mr thomas wedgwood outweighs all other considerations beyond a doubt he has made himself acquainted with the degree of heat which he is to experience there the west indies the only objections that i see are so obvious that it is idle in me to mention them the total want of men with whose pursuits your brother can have a fellow feeling the length and difficulty of the return in case of a disappointment and the necessity of seavoyages to almost every change of scenery i will not think of the yellow fever that i hope is quite out of all probability believe me my dear friend i have some difficulty in suppressing all that is within me of affection and grief god knows my heart wherever your brother is i shall follow him in spirit follow him with my thoughts and most affectionate wishes  i read your letter and did as you desired me  1 is very cool to me whether i have still any of the leaven of the citizen and visionary about metoo much for his present zeal or whether he is incapable of attending     as to his views he is now gone to cambridge to canvass for a fellowship in trinity hall mackintosh has kindly written to dr lawrence who is very intimate with the master and he has other interest he is also trying hard and in expectation of a commissionership of bankruptcy and means to pursue the law with all ardour and steadiness as to the state of his mind it is that which it was and will be god love him he has a most incurable forehead  2 called on him and looking on his table saw by accident a letter directed to himself  said he why  3 what letter is this for me and from  4 yes i have had it some time why did you not give it me oh it wants some explanation first you must not read it now for i cant give you the explanation now and 5 who you know is a right easynatured man has not been able to get his own letter from him to this hour of his success at cambridge caldwell is doubtful or more than doubtful     so much of 6 all that i know and all i suspect that is to be known a kind gentlemanly affectionate hearted man possessed of an absolute talent for industry would to god he had never heard of philosophy  i have been three times to the house of commons each time earlier than the former and each time hideously crowded the two first days the debate was put off yesterday i went at a quarter before eight and remained till three this morning and then sat writing and correcting other mens writing till eighta good twenty four hours of unpleasant activity i have not felt myself sleepy yet pitt and fox completely answered my preformed ideas of them the elegance and high finish of pitts periods even in the most sudden replies is curious but that is all he argues but so so and does not reason at all nothing is rememberable of what he says fox possesses all the full and overflowing eloquence of a man of clear head clear heart and impetuous feelings he is to my mind a great orator all the rest that spoke were mere creatures i could make a better speech myself than any that i heard except pitt and fox i reported that part of pitts which i have enclosed in brackets not that i report exofficio but my curiosity having led me there i did stuart a service by taking a few notes  i work from morning to night but in a few weeks i shall have completed my purpose and then adieu to london for ever we newspaper scribes are true galleyslaves when the high winds of events blow loud and frequent then the sails are hoisted or the ship drives on of itself when all is calm and sunshine then to our oars yet it is not unflattering to a mans vanity to reflect that what he writes at twelve at night will before twelve hours are over have perhaps five or six thousand readers to trace a happy phrase good image or new argument running through the town and sliding into all the papers few wine merchants can boast of creating more sensation then to hear a favourite and oftenurged argument repeated almost in your own particular phrases in the house of commons and quietly in the silent selfcomplacence of your own heart chuckle over the plagiarism as if you were monopolist of all good reasons but seriously considering that i have newspapered it merely as means of subsistence while i was doing other things i have been very lucky the new constitution the proposal for peace the irish union etc etc they are important in themselves and excellent vehicles for general truths i am not ashamed of what i have written  i desired poole to send you all the papers antecedent to your own i think you will like the different analyses of the french constitution i have attended mackintoshs lectures regularly he was so kind as to send

i could make almost sure of £2000 a year for stuart has offered me half shares in the two papers the morning post and courier if i would devote myself with him to them but i told him that i would not give up the country and the lazy reading of old folios for two thousand times two thousand poundin short that beyond £250 a year i considered money as a real evil  i think there are but two good ways of writingone for immediate and wide impression though transitorythe other for permanence newspapers are the firstthe best one can do is the second that middle class of translating books is neither the one nor the other when i have settled myself clear i shall write nothing for money but for the newspaper you of course will not hint a word of stuarts offer to me he has behaved with abundant honour and generosity    chapter ix  keswick  coleridge had determined not to live in london his engagement with stuart he regarded as only a temporary shift to clear off some debt which he had incurred in his visit to germany after a short stay with lamb ainger i 113 and a tour to the north to see wordsworth j dykes campbells life 113 he returned to stowey writing to godwin on 21st may  letter 91 to godwin  wednesday may 21 1800  dear godwin  i received your letter this morning and had i not still i am almost confident that i should have written to you before the end of the week hitherto the translation of the wallenstein has prevented me not that it engrossed my time but that it wasted and depressed my spirits and left a sense of wearisomeness and disgust which unfitted me for anything but sleeping or immediate society i say this because i ought to have written to you first yet as i am not behind you in affectionate esteem so i would not be thought to lag in those outward and visible signs that both show and verify the inward spiritual grace believe me you recur to my thoughts frequently and never without pleasure never without my making out of the past a little daydream for the future i left wordsworth on the 4th of this month if i cannot procure a suitable house at stowey i return to cumberland and settle at keswick in a house of such prospect that if according to you and hume impressions constitute our being i shall have a tendency to become a god so sublime and beautiful will be the series of my visual existence but whether i continue here or migrate thither i shall be in a beautiful country and have houseroom and heartroom for you and you must come and write your next work at my house my dear godwin i remember you with so much pleasure and our conversations so distinctly that i doubt not we have been mutually benefited but as to your poetic and physiopathic feelings i more than suspect that dear little fanny and mary have had more to do in that business than i hartley sends his love to mary 1 what and not to fanny yes and to fanny but ill have mary he often talks about them  my poor lamb how cruelly afflictions crowd upon him i am glad that you think of him as i think he has an affectionate heart a mind sui generis his taste acts so as to appear like the unmechanic simplicity of an instinct in brief he is worth an hundred men of mere talents conversation with the latter tribe is like the use of leaden bellsone wearies by exercise lamb every now and then irradiates and the beam though single and fine as a hair yet is rich with colours and i both see and feel it in bristol i was much with davy almost all day he always talks of you with great affection and defends you with a friendly zeal if i settle at keswick he will be with me in the fall of the year and so must you and let me tell you godwin that four such men as you i davy and wordsworth do not meet together in one house every day in the yeari mean four men so distinct with so many sympathies i received yesterday a letter from southey he arrived at lisbon after a prosperous voyage on the last day of april his letter to me is dated mayday he girds up his loins for a great history of portugal which will be translated into portuguese in the first year of the lusitanian republic  have you seen mrs robinson 2 latelyhow is she remember me in the kindest and most respectful phrases to her i wish i knew the particulars of her complaint for davy has discovered a perfectly new acid by which he has restored the use of limbs to persons who had lost it for many years one woman nine years in cases of supposed rheumatism at all events davy says it can do no harm in mrs robinsons case and if she will try it he will make up a little parcel and write her a letter of instructions etc tell her and it is the truth that davy is exceedingly delighted with the two poems in the anthology  nb did you get my attempt at a tragedy from mrs robinson  to mrs smith i am about to write a letter with a book be so kind as to inform me of her direction  mrs inchbald i do not like at all every time i recollect her i like her less that segment of a look at the corner of her eyeo god in heaven it is so cold and cunning through worlds of wildernesses i would run away from that look that heartpicking look tis marvellous to me that you can like that woman  i shall remain here about ten days for certain if you have leisure and inclination in that time write if not i will write to you where i am going or at all events whither i am gone  god bless you and

dear davy  i received a very kind letter from godwin in which he says that he never thinks of you but with a brothers feeling of love and expectation indeed i am sure he does not  i think of translating blumenbachs manual of natural history it is very well written and would i think be useful both to students as an admirable direction to their studies and to others it would supply a general knowledge of the subject i will state the contents of the book 1 of the naturalia in general and their divisions into three kingdoms 2 of organised bodies in general 3 of animals in general 4 of the mammalia 5 birds 6 amphibious 7 fishes 8 insects 9 worms 10 plants 11 of minerals in general 12 of stones and earthy fossils 13 of mineral salts 14 combustible minerals 15 of metals 16 petrifactions at the end there is an alphabetical index so that it is at once a natural history and a dictionary of natural history to each animal etc all the european names are given with of course the scientific characteristics i have the last edition ie that of april 1799 now i wish to know from you whether there is in english already any work of one volume this would make 800 pages that renders this useless in short should i be right in advising longman to undertake it answer me as soon as you conveniently can blumenbach has been no very great discoverer though he has done some respectable things in that way but he is a man of enormous knowledge and has an arranging head ask beddoes if you do not know when you have leisure you would do me a great service if you would briefly state your metaphysical system of impressions ideas pleasures and pains the laws that govern them and the reasons which induce you to consider them as essentially distinct from each other my motive for this request is the followingas soon as i settle i shall read spinoza and leibnitz and i particularly wish to know wherein they agree with and wherein differ from you if you will do this i promise you to send you the result and with it my own creed  god bless you  s t coleridge  blumenbachs book contains references to all the best writers on each subject my friend t poole begs me to ask what in your opinion are the parts or properties in the oak which tan skins and is cold water a complete menstruum for these parts or properties i understand from poole that nothing is so little understood as the chemical theory of tan though nothing is of more importance in the circle of manufactures in other words does oak bark give out to cold water all those of its parts which tan  coleridge and his family at last settled down at greta hall in july 1800 and he thus writes to josiah wedgwood of the event     letter 93 to josiah wedgwood  july 24 1800  my dear sir  i find your letter on my arrival at grasmere namely dated on the 29th of june since which time to the present with the exception of the last few days i have been more unwell than i have ever been since i left school for many days i was forced to keep my bed and when released from that incarceration i suffered most grievously from a brace of swollen eyelids and a head into which on the least agitation the blood was felt as rushing in and flowing back again like the raking of the tide on a coast of loose stones however thank god i am now coming about again  that tom receives such pleasure from natural scenery strikes me as it does you the total incapability which i have found in myself to associate any but the most languid feelings with the godlike objects which have surrounded me and the nauseous efforts to impress my admiration into the service of nature has given me a sympathy with his former state of health which i never before could have had i wish from the bottom of my soul that he may be enjoying similar pleasures with those which i am now enjoying with all that newness of sensation that voluptuous correspondence of the blood and flesh about me with breeze and sunheat which makes convalescence more than repay one for disease  i parted from poole with pain and dejection for him and for myself in him i should have given stowey a decided preference for a residence it was likewise so conveniently situated that i was in the way of almost all whom i love and esteem but there was no suitable house and no prospect of a suitable house     these things would have weighed as nothing could i have remained at stowey but now they come upon me to diminish my regret add to this pooles determination to spend a year or two on the continent in case of a peace and his mothers death god in heaven bless her i am sure she will not live long this is the first day of my arrival at keswick my house is roomy situated on an eminence a furlong from the town before it an enormous garden more than twothirds of which is rented as a garden for sale articles but the walks are ours completely behind the house are shrubberies and a declivity planted with flourishing trees of ten or fifteen years growth at the bottom of which is a most delightful shaded walk by the river greta a quarter of a mile in length the room in which i sit commands from one window the bassenthwaite lake woods and mountains from the opposite the derwentwater and fantastic mountains of borrowdale straight before is a wilderness of mountains catching and streaming lights and shadows at all times behind the house and entering into all our views is skiddaw  my acquaintances here are pleasant and at some distance is sir guilfred lawsons seat with a very large and expensive library to which i have every reason to hope that i shall have free access but when i have been settled here a few days longer i will write you a minute account of my situation wordsworth lives twelve miles distant in about a years time he will probably settle at keswick likewise it is no small advantage here that for twothirds of the year we are in complete retirement the other third is alive and swarms with tourists of all shapes and sizes and characters it is the very place i would recommend to a novelist or farce writer besides at that time of the year there is always hope that a friend may be among the number and miscellaneous crowd whom this place attracts so much for keswick  have you seen my translation of wallenstein it is a dull heavy play but i entertain hopes that you will think the language for the greater part natural and good common sense english to which excellence if i can lay fair claim in any work of poetry or prose i shall be a very singular writer at least i am now working at my introduction of the life of lessing which i trust will be in the press before christmas that is the introduction which will be published first god bless you  s t coleridge  josiah wedgwood esq   to davy coleridge wrote on the succeeding day     letter 94 to davy  keswick friday evening july 25 1800  my dear davy  work hard and if success do not dance up like the bubbles in the salt with the spirit lamp under it may the devil and his dam take success my dear fellow from the window before me there is a great camp of mountains giants seem to have pitched their tents there each mountain is a giants tent and how the light streams from them davy i ache for you to be with us  w wordsworth is such a lazy fellow that i bemire myself by making promises for him the moment i received your letter i wrote to him he will i hope write immediately to biggs and cottle at all events those poems must not as yet be delivered up to them because that beautiful poem the brothers which i read to you in paul street i neglected to deliver to you and that must begin the volume i trust however that i have invoked the sleeping bard with a spell so potent that he will awake and deliver up that sword of argantyr which is to rive the enchanter gaudyverse from his crown to his foot  what did you think of that case i translated for you from the german that i was a wellmeaning sutor who had ultracrepidated1 with more zeal than wisdom i give myself credit for that word ultra crepidated it started up in my brain like a creation i write to tobin by this post godwin is gone irelandward on a visit to curran says the morning post to grattan writes c lamb  we drank tea the night before i left grasmere on the island in that lovely lake our kettle swung over the fire hanging from the branch of a firtree and i lay and saw the woods and mountains and lake all trembling and as it were idealized through the suble smoke which rose up from the clear red embers of the firapples which we had collected afterwards we made a glorious bonfire on the margin by some elder bushes whose twigs heaved and sobbed in the uprushing column of smoke and the image of the bonfire and of us that danced round it ruddy laughing faces in the twilight the image of this in a lake smooth as that sea to whose waves the son of god had said peace may god and all his sons love you as i do  s t coleridge  sara desires her kind remembrances hartley is a spirit that dances on an aspen leaf the air that yonder sallowfaced and yawning tourist is breathing is to my babe a perpetual nitrous oxide never was more joyous creature born pain with

 footnote 1 ne sutor ultra crepidam  footnote 2 letter cx follows no 94  coleridge was now as enamoured of the lake district as he had been of stowey on 22nd september he wrote to godwin     letter 95 to godwin  monday sept 22 1800  dear godwin  i received your letter and with it the enclosed note1 which shall be punctually redelivered to you on the first of october  your tragedy 2 to be exhibited at christmas i have indeed merely read through your letter so it is not strange that my heart continues beating out of time indeed indeed godwin such a stream of hope and fear rushed in on me as i read the sentence as you would not permit yourself to feel if there be anything yet undreamt of in our philosophy if it be or if it be possible that thought can impel thought out of the usual limit of a mans own skull and heart if the cluster of ideas which constitute an identity do ever connect and unite into a greater whole if feelings could ever propagate themselves without the servile ministrations of undulating air or reflected light i seem to feel within myself a strength and a power of desire that might dart a modifying commanding impulse on a whole theatre what does all this mean alas that sober sense should know no other way to construe all this than by the tame phrase i wish you success that which lamb informed you is founded on truth mr sheridan sent through the medium of stuart a request to wordsworth to present a tragedy to his stage and to me a declaration that the failure of my piece was owing to my obstinacy in refusing any alteration i laughed and wordsworth smiled but my tragedy will remain at keswick and wordsworths is not likely to emigrate from grasmere wordsworths drama is in its present state not fit for the stage and he is not well enough to submit to the drudgery of making it so mine is fit for nothing except to excite in the minds of good men the hope that the young man is likely to do better in the first moments i thought of rewriting it and sent to lamb for the copy with this intent i read an act and altered my opinion and with it my wish  your feelings respecting baptism are i suppose much like mine at times i dwell on man with such reverence resolve all his follies into such grand primary laws of intellect and in such wise so contemplate them as evervarying incarnations of the eternal lifethat the llamas dungpellet or the cowtail which the dying brahmin clutches convulsively become sanctified and sublime by the feelings which cluster round them in that mood i exclaim my boys shall be christened but then another fit of moody philosophy attacks me i look at my dotedon hartleyhe moves he lives he finds impulses from within and from without he is the darling of the sun and of the breeze nature seems to bless him as a thing of her own he looks at the clouds the mountains the living beings of the earth and vaults and jubilates solemn looks and solemn words have been hitherto connected in his mind with great and magnificent objects only with lightning with thunder with the waterfall blazing in the sunset then i say shall i suffer him to see grave countenances and hear grave accents while his face is sprinkled shall i be grave myself and tell a lie to him or shall i laugh and teach him to insult the feelings of his fellow men besides are we not all in this present hour fainting beneath the duty of hope from such thoughts i stand up and vow a book of severe analysis in which i shall tell all i believe to be truth in the nakedest language in which it can be told  my wife is now quite comfortable surely you might come and spend the very next four weeks not without advantage to both of us the very glory of the place is coming on the local genius is just arraying himself in his higher attributes but above all i press it because my mind has been busied with speculations that are closely connected with those pursuits that have hitherto constituted your utility and importance and ardently as i wish you success on the stage i yet cannot frame myself to the thought that you should cease to appear as a bold moral thinker i wish you to write a book on the power of words and the processes by which human feelings form affinities with themin short i wish you to philosophize horne tookes system and to solve the great questionswhether there be reason to hold that an action bearing the semblance of predesigning consciousness may yet be simply organic and whether a series of such actions are possibleand close on the heels of this question would follow the old is logic the essence of thinkingin other words is thinking possible without arbitrary signs or how far is the word arbitrary a misnomer are not words etc parts and germinations of the plant and what is the law of their growth in something of this order i would endeavour to destroy the old antithesis of words and things elevating as it were words into things and living things too all the nonsense of vibrations etc you would of course dismiss  if what i have here written appear nonsense to you or common sense in a harlequinade of outre expressions suspend your judgment till we see each other  yours sincerely  s t coleridge  i was in the country when wallenstein was published longman sent me down halfadozenthe carriage back the book was not worth  footnote 1 a loan often pounds  footnote 2 antonio  coleridge had asked godwin to stand godfather to his child which compliment godwin declined hence the passage in the above letter on baptism  davy now occupied a large part of coleridges attention on 9th october he wrote      letter 96 to davy  thursday night october 9 1800  my dear davy  i was right glad glad with a stagger of the heart to see your writing again many a moment have i had all my france and england curiosity suspended and lost looking in the advertisement front column of the morning post gazetteer for mr davys galvanic habitudes of charcoal  upon my soul i believe there is not a letter in those words round which a world of imagery does not circumvolve your room the garden the cold bath the moonlight rocks barristed moore and simplelooking frere and dreams of wonderful things attached to your nameand skiddaw and glaramara and eagle crag and you and wordsworth and me on the top of them i pray you do write to me immediately and tell me what you mean by the possibility of your assuming a new occupation 1 have you been successful to the extent of your expectations in your late chemical inquiries  in your poem2 impressive is used for impressible or passive is it not if so it is not english life diffusive likewise is not english the last stanza introduces confusion into my mind and despondencyand has besides been so often said by the materialists etc that it is not worth repeating if the poem had ended more originally in short but for the last stanza i will venture to affirm that there were never so many lines which so uninterruptedly combined natural and beautiful words with strict philosophic truths ie scientifically philosophic of the second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh stanzas i am doubtful which is the most beautiful do not imagine that i cling to a fond love of future identity but the thought which you have expressed in the last stanzas might be more grandly and therefore more consolingly exemplified i had forgot to say that sameness and identity are words too etymologically the same to be placed so close to each other  as to myself i am doing little worthy the relation i write for stuart in the morning post and i am compelled by the god pecunia which was one name of the supreme jupiter to give a volume of letters from germany which will be a decent lounge book and not an atom more the christabel was running up to 1300 lines and was so much admired by wordsworth that he thought it indelicate to print two volumes with his name in which so much of another mans was included and which was of more consequence the poem was in direct opposition to the very purpose for which the lyrical ballads were published viz an experiment to see how far those passions which alone give any value to extraordinary incidents were capable of interesting in and for themselves in the incidents of common life we mean to publish the christabel therefore with a long blankverse poem of wordsworths entitled the pedlar3 i assure you i think very differently of christabel i would rather have written ruth and natures lady4 than a million such poems but why do i calumniate my own spirit by saying i would rather god knows it is as delightful to me that they are written i know that at present and i hope that it will be so my mind has disciplined itself into a willing exertion of its powers without any reference to their comparative value  i cannot speak favourably of ws health but indeed he has not done common justice to dr beddoess kind prescriptions i saw his countenance darken and all his hopes vanish when he saw the prescriptionshis scepticism concerning medicines nay it is not enough scepticism yet now that peas and beans are over i have hopes that he will in good earnest make a fair and full trial i rejoice with sincere joy at beddoess recovery  wordsworth is fearful you have been much teazed by the printers on his account but you can sympathise with him the works which i gird myself up to attack as soon as money concerns will permit me are the life of lessing and the essay on poetry the latter is still more at my heart than the former its title would be an essay on the elements of poetryit would in reality be a disguised system of morals and politics  when you write and do write soon tell me how i can get your essay on the nitrous oxide if you desired johnson to have one sent to lackingtons to be placed in mr crosthwaites monthly parcel for keswick i should receive it are your galvanic discoveries important what do they lead to all this is ultra crepidation but would to heaven i had as much knowledge as i have sympathy my wife and children are well the baby was dying some weeks ago so the good people would have it baptized his name is derwent coleridge so called from the river for fronting our house the greta runs into the derwent had it been a girl the name should have been greta by the by greta or rather grieta is exactly the cocytus of the greeks the word literally rendered in modern english

cxi is our 96     letter 97 to godwin  monday oct 13 1800  dear godwin  i have been myself too frequently a grievous delinquent in the article of letterwriting to feel any inclination to reproach my friends when peradventure they have been long silent but this out of the question i did not expect a speedier answer for i had anticipated the circumstances which you assign as the causes of your delay  an attempt to finish a poem of mine for insertion in the second volume of the lyrical ballads has thrown me so fearfully back in my bread and beef occupations that i shall scarcely be able to justify myself in putting you to the expense of the few lines which i may be able to scrawl in the present paperbut some parts in your letter interested me deeply and i wished to tell you so first then you know kemble and i do not but my conjectural judgments concerning his character lead me to persuade an absolute passive obedience to his opinion and this too because i would leave to every man his own trade your trade has been in the present instance first to furnish a wise pleasure to your fellowbeings in general and secondly to give mr kemble and his associates the power of delighting that part of your fellowbeings assembled in a theatre as to what relates to the first point i should be sorry indeed if greater men than mr kemble could induce you to alter a but to a yet contrary to your own convictions above all things an author ought to be sincere to the public and when william godwin stands in the titlepage it implies that w g approves that which follows besides the mind and finer feelings are blunted by such obsequiousness but in the theatre it is godwin and co ex professo i should regard it in almost the same light as if i had written a song for haydn to compose and mara to sing i know indeed what is poetry but i do not know so well as he and she what will suit his notes or her voice that actors and managers are often wrong is true but still their trade is their trade and the presumption is in favour of their being right for the press i should wish you to be solicitously nice because you are to exhibit before a larger and more respectable multitude than a theatre presents to you and in a new part that of a poet employing his philosophical knowledge practically if it be possible come therefore and let us discuss every page and every line  now for something which i would fain believe is still more important namely the propriety of your future philosophical speculations your second objection derived from the present ebb of opinion will be best answered by the fact that mackintosh and his followers have the flow this is greatly in your favour for mankind are at present gross reasoners they reason in a perpetual antithesis mackintosh is an oracle and godwin therefore a fool now it is morally impossible that mackintosh and the sophists of his school can retain this opinion you may well exclaim with job o that my adversary would write a book when he publishes it will be all over with him and then the minds of men will incline strongly to those who would point out in intellectual perceptions a source of moral progressiveness every man in his heart is in favour of your general principles a party of doughbaked democrats of fortune were weary of being dissevered from their fellow rich men they want to say something in defence of turning round mackintosh puts that something into their mouths and for awhile they will admire and bepraise him in a little while these men will have fallen back into the ranks from which they had stepped out and life is too melancholy a thing for men in general for the doctrine of unprogressiveness to remain popular men cannot long retain their faith in the heaven above the blue sky but a heaven they will have and he who reasons best on the side of the universal wish will be the most popular philosopher as to your first objection that you are a logician let me say that your habits are analytic but that you have not read enough of travels voyages and biographyespecially mens lives of themselvesand you have too soon submitted your notions to other mens censures in conversation a man should nurse his opinions in privacy and selffondness for a long time and seek for sympathy and love not for detection or censure dismiss my dear fellow your theory of collision of ideas and take up that of mutual propulsion i wish to write more and state to you a lucrative job which would i think be eminently serviceable to your own mind and which you would have every opportunity of doing here i now express a serious wish that you would come and look out for a house did stuart remit you £10 on my account  s t coleridge  i would gladly write any verses but to a prologue or epilogue i am absolutely incompetent  coleridge was a tremendous walker and hill climber the following letter narrates a curious adventure in a storm among the mountains     letter 98 to davy  october 18 1800  my dear davy  our mountains northward end in the mountain carrockone huge steep enormous bulk of stones desolately variegated with the heath plant at its foot runs the river calder and a narrow vale between it and the mountain bowscale so narrow that in its greatest width it is not more than a furlong but that narrow vale is so green so beautiful there are moods in which a man might weep to look at it on this mountain carrock at the summit of which are the remains of a vast druid circle of stones i was wandering when a thick cloud came on and wrapped me in such darkness that i could not see ten yards before me and with the cloud a storm of wind and hail the like of which i had never before seen and felt at the very summit is a cone of stones built by the shepherds and called the carrock man such cones are on the tops of almost all our mountains and they are all called men at the bottom of the carrock man i seated myself for shelter but the wind became so fearful and tyrannous that i was apprehensive some of the stones might topple down upon me so i groped my way farther down and came to three rocks placed on this wise 13\2 each one supported by the other like a childs house of cards and in the hollow and screen which they made i sate for a long while sheltered as if i had been in my own study in which i am now writing there i sate with a total feeling worshipping the power and eternal link of energy the darkness vanished as by enchantment far off far far off to the south the mountains of glaramara and great gable and their family appeared distinct in deepest sablest blue i rose and behind me was a rainbow bright as the brightest i descended by the side of a torrent and passed or rather crawled for i was forced to descend on all fours by many a naked waterfall till fatigued and hungry and with a finger almost broken and which remains swelled to the size of two fingers i reached the narrow vale and the single house nestled in ash and sycamores i entered to claim the universal hospitality of this country but instead of the life and comfort usual in these lonely houses i saw dirt and every appearance of miserya pale woman sitting by a peat fire i asked her for bread and milk and she sent a small child to fetch it but did not rise herself i ate very heartily of the black sour bread and drank a bowl of milk and asked her to permit me to pay her nay says she we are not so scant as thatyou are right welcome but do you know any help for the rheumatics for i have been so long ailing that i am almost fain to die so i advised her to eat a great deal of mustard having seen in an advertisement something about essence of mustard curing the most obstinate cases of rheumatism but do write me and tell me some cure for the rheumatism it is in her shoulders and the small of her back chiefly i wish much to go off with some bottles of stuff to the poor creature i should walk the ten miles as ten yards with love and honour  my dear davy yours  s t

  letter 99 to josiah wedgwood  keswick nov 1 1800  my dear sir  i would fain believe that the experiment which your brother has made in the west indies is not wholly a discouraging one if a warm climate did nothing but only prevented him from getting worse it surely evidenced some power and perhaps a climate equally favourable in a country of more various interest italy or the south of france may tempt your brother to make a longer trial if disciplining myself into silent cheerfulness i could be of any comfort to him by being his companion and attendant for two or three months on the supposition that he should wish to travel and was at a loss for a companion more fit i would go with him with a willing affection you will easily see my dear friend that i say this only to increase the range of your brothers choicefor even in choosing there is some pleasure  there happen frequently little odd coincidences in time that recall momentary faith in the notion of sympathies acting in absence i heard of your brothers return for the first time on monday last the day on which your letter is dated from stoddart had it rained on my naked skin i could not have felt more strangely the 300 or 400 miles that are between us seemed converted into a moral distance and i knew that the whole of this silence i was myself accountable for for i ended my last letter by promising to follow it with a second and longer one before you could answer the first but immediately on my arrival in this country i undertook to finish a poem which i had begun entitled christabel for a second volume of the lyrical ballads i tried to perform my promise but the deep unutterable disgust which i had suffered in the translation of the accursed wallenstein seemed to have stricken me with barrenness for i tried and tried and nothing would come of it i desisted with a deeper dejection than i am willing to remember the wind from the skiddaw and borrowdale was often as loud as wind need be and many a walk in the clouds in the mountains did i take but all would not do till one day i dined out at the house of a neighbouring clergyman and some how or other drank so much wine that i found some effort and dexterity requisite to balance myself on the hither edge of sobriety the next day my versemaking faculties returned to me and i proceeded successfully till my poem grew so long and in wordsworths opinion so impressive that he rejected it from his volume as disproportionate both in size and merit and as discordant in its character in the mean time i had gotten myself entangled in the old sorites of the old sophistprocrastination i had suffered my necessary businesses to accumulate so terribly that i neglected to write to any one till the pain i suffered from not writing made me waste as many hours in dreaming about it as would have sufficed for the letter writing of half a life but there is something beside time requisite for the writing of a letterat least with me my situation here is indeed a delightful situation but i feel what i have lostfeel it deeplyit recurs more often and more painfully than i had anticipated indeed so much so that i scarcely ever feel myself impelled that is to say pleasurably impelled to write to poole i used to feel myself more at home in his great windy parlour than in my own cottage we were well suited to each othermy animal spirits corrected his inclination to melancholy and there was something both in his understanding and in his affections so healthy and manly that my mind freshened in his company and my ideas and habits of thinking acquired day after day more of substance and reality indeed indeed my dear sir with tears in my eyes and with all my heart and soul i wish it were as easy for us all to meet as it was when you lived at upcott yet when i revise the step i have taken i know not how i could have acted otherwise than i did act everything i promised myself in this country has answered far beyond my expectation the room in which i write commands six distinct landscapesthe two lakes the vale the river and mountains and mists and clouds and sunshine make endless combinations as if heaven and earth were for ever talking to each other often when in a deep study i have walked to the window and remained there looking without seeing all at once the lake of keswick and the fantastic mountains of borrowdale at the head of it have entered into my mind with a suddenness as if i had been snatched out of cheapside and placed for the first time in the spot where i stoodand that is a delightful feelingthese fits and trances of novelty received from a long known object the river greta flows behind our house roaring like an untamed son of the hills then winds round and glides away in the front so that we live in a peninsula but besides this etherial eyefeeding we have very substantial conveniences we are close to the town where we have respectable and neighbourly acquaintance and a most sensible and truly excellent medical man our garden is part of a large nursery garden which is the same to us and as private as if the whole had been our own and thus too we have delightful walks without passing our garden gates my landlord who lives in the sister house for the two houses are built so as to look like one great one is a modest and kind man of a singular character by the severest economy he raised himself from a carrier into the possession of a comfortable independence he was always very fond of reading and has collected nearly 500 volumes of our most esteemed modern writers such as gibbon hume johnson etc etc his habits of economy and simplicity remain with him and yet so very disinterested a man i scarcely ever knew lately when i wished to settle with him about the rent of our house he appeared much affected told me that my living near him and the having so much of hartleys company were great comforts to him and his housekeeper that he had no children to provide for and did not mean to marry and in short that he did not want any rent at all from me this of course i laughed him out of but he absolutely refused to receive any rent for the first halfyear under the pretext that the house was not completely furnished hartley quite lives at the house and it is as you may suppose no small joy to my wife to have a good affectionate motherly woman divided from her only by a wall eighteen miles from our house lives sir guilfred lawson who has a princely library chiefly of natural historya kind and generous but weak and ostentatious sort of man who has been abundantly civil to me among other raree shows he keeps a wild beast or two with some eagles etc the master of the beasts at the exeter change sent him down a large bearwith it a long letter of directions concerning the food etc of the animal and many solicitations respecting other agreeable quadrupeds which he was desirous to send to the baronet at a moderate price and concluding in this manner and remain your honours most devoted humble servant jp permit me sir guilfred to send you a buffalo and a rhinoceros as neat a postscript as i ever heardthe tradesmanlike coolness with which these pretty little animals occurred to him just at the finishing of his letter you will in three weeks see the letters on the rise and condition of the german boors i found it convenient to make up a volume out of my journey etc in north germanyand the letters your name of course erased are in the printers hands i was so weary of transcribing and composing that when i found those more carefully written than the rest i even sent them off as they were                                my littlest one is a very stout boy indeed he is christened by the name of derwenta sort of sneaking affection

had except by encroaching on the names of my little nephews if you are at gunville at christmas i hold out hopes to myself that i shall be able to pass a week with you there i mentioned to you at upcott a kind of comedy that i had committed to writing in part this is in the wind  wordsworths second vol of the lyrical ballads will i hope and almost believe afford you as unmingled pleasure as is

received your kind letter with the £20 my eyes are in such a state of inflammation that i might as well write blindfold they are so bloodred i have had leeches twice and have now a blister behind my right ear how i caught the cold in the first instance i can scarcely guess but i improved it to its present glorious state by taking long walks all the mornings spite of the wind and writing late at night while my eyes were weak  i have made some rather curious observations on the rising up of spectra in the eye in its inflamed state and their influence on ideas etc but i cannot see to make myself intelligible to you present my kindest remembrance to mrs w and your brother pray did you ever pay any particular attention to the first time of your little ones smiling and laughing both i and mrs c have carefully watched our little one and noticed down all the circumstances under which he smiled and under which he laughed for the first six times nor have we remitted our attention but i have not been able to derive the least confirmation of hartleys or darwins theory you say most truly my dear sir that a pursuit is necessary pursuit for even praiseworthy employment merely for good or general good is not sufficient for happiness nor fit for man  i have not at present made out how i stand in pecuniary ways but i believe that i have anticipated on the next year to the amount of thirty or forty pounds probably more god bless you my dear sir and your sincerely  affectionate friend  s t coleridge  josiah wedgwood esq  the publication of the wallenstein had brought on coleridge the odium of being an advocate of the german theatre at this time identified with the melodramatic sentimentalism of kotzbue and his school english opinion did not then discriminate between a schiller and a kotzebue the following curious disclaimer appeared in the monthly review on 18th november 1800     letter 101 to the editor of the monthly review  greta hall keswick  nov 18 1800  in the review of my translation of schillers wallenstein rev for october i am numbered among the partisans of the german theatre as i am confident there is no passage in my preface or notes from which such an opinion can be legitimately formed and as the truth would not have been exceeded if the direct contrary had been affirmed i claim it of your justice that in your answers to correspondents you would remove this misrepresentation the mere circumstance of translating a manuscript play is not even evidence that i admired that one play much less that i am a general admirer of the plays in that language  i remain etc  s t coleridge  during the latter half of 1800 dorothy wordsworths journal contains many entries showing that coleridge and the wordsworths were in frequent communication with each other coleridge thought nothing of traversing the dozen miles between keswick and dove cottage by the highway or over the hill passes wordsworth and dorothy too went often to keswick and occasionally stayed with the coleridges grasmere journals i 4360  amid these literary and poetic meetings between the poets and their families other correspondents were not forgotten by coleridge the following two letters to davy indicate that the poets were taking some interest in science     letter 102 to davy  greta hall tuesday night december 2 1800  my dear davy  by an accident i did not receive your letter till this evening i would that you had added to the account of your indisposition the probable causes of it it has left me anxious whether or no you have not exposed yourself to unwholesome influences in your chemical pursuits there are few beings both of hope and performance but few who combine the are and the will be for gods sake therefore my dear fellow do not rip open the bird that lays the golden eggs i have not received your book i read yesterday a sort of medical review about it i suppose longman will send it to me when he sends down the lyrical ballads to wordsworth i am solicitous to read the latter part did there appear to you any remote analogy between the case i translated from the german magazine and the effects produced by your gas did carlisle1 ever communicate to you or has he in any way published his facts concerning pain which he mentioned when we were with him it is a subject which exceedingly interests me i want to read something by somebody expressly on pain if only to give an arrangement to my own thoughts though if it were well treated i have little doubt it would revolutionize them for the last month i have been trembling on through sands and swamps of evil and bodily grievance my eyes have been inflamed to a degree that rendered reading and writing scarcely possible and strange as it seems the act of metre composition as i lay in bed perceptibly affected them and my voluntary ideas were every minute passing more or less transformed into vivid spectra i had leeches repeatedly applied to my temples and a blister behind my earand my eyes are now my own but in the place where the blister was six small but excruciating boils have appeared and harass me almost beyond endurance in the meantime my darling hartley has been taken with a stomach illness which has ended in the yellow jaundice and this greatly alarms me so much for the doleful amid all these changes and humiliations and fears the sense of the eternal abides in me and preserves unsubdued my cheerful faith that all i endure is full of blessings  at times indeed i would fain be somewhat of a more tangible utility than i am but so i suppose it is with all of usone while cheerful stirring feeling in resistance nothing but a joy and a stimulus another while drowsy selfdistrusting prone to rest loathing our own selfpromises withering our own hopesour hopes the vitality and cohesion of our being  i purpose to have christabel published by itselfthis i publish with confidencebut my travels in germany come from me now with mortal pangs nothing but the most pressing necessity could have induced meand even now i hesitate and tremble be so good as to have all that is printed of christabel sent to me per post  wordsworth has nearly finished the concluding poem it is of a mild unimposing character but full of beauties to those shortnecked men who have their hearts sufficiently near their headsthe relative distance of which according to citizen tourder the french translator of spallanzani determines the sagacity or stupidity of all bipeds and quadrupeds  there is a deep blue cloud over the heavens the lake and the vale and the mountains are all in darkness only the summits of all the mountains in long ridges covered with snow are bright to a dazzling excess a glorious scene hartley was in my arms the other evening looking at the sky he saw the moon glide into a large cloud shortly after at another part of the cloud several stars sailed in says he pretty creatures they are going in to see after their mother moon  remember me kindly to king

for another letter o what a fine unveiling of modern politics it would be if there were published a minute detail of all the sums received by government from the post establishment and of all the outlets in which the sums so received flowed out again and on the other hand all the domestic affections that had been stifled all the intellectual progress that would have been but is not on account of the heavy tax etc etc the letters of a nation ought to be paid for as an article of national expense well but i did not take up this paper to flourish away in splenetic politics a gentleman resident here his name calvert an idle goodhearted and ingenious man has a great desire to commence fellowstudent with me and wordsworth in chemistry he is an intimate friend of wordsworths and he has proposed to w to take a house which he calvert has nearly built called windy brow in a delicious situation scarce half a mile from greta hall the residence of s t coleridge esq and so for him calvert to live with them ie wordsworth and his sister in this case he means to build a little laboratory etc wordsworth has not quite decided but is strongly inclined to adopt the scheme because he and his sister have before lived with calvert on the same footing and are much attached to him because my health is so precarious and so much injured by wet and his health too is like little potatoes no great things and therefore grasmere thirteen miles from keswick is too great a distance for us to enjoy each others society without inconvenience as much as it would be profitable for us both and likewise because he feels it more necessary for him to have some intellectual pursuit less closely connected with deep passion than poetry and is of course desirous too not to be so wholly ignorant of knowledge so exceedingly important however whether wordsworth come or no calvert and i have determined to begin and go on calvert is a man of sense and some originality and is besides what is well called a handy man he is a good practical mechanic etc and is desirous to lay out any sum of money that is necessary you know how long how ardently i have wished to initiate myself in chemical science both for its own sake and in no small degree likewise my beloved friend that i may be able to sympathize with all that you do and think sympathize blindly with it all i do even now god knows from the very middle of my hearts heart but i would fain sympathize with you in the light of knowledge this opportunity is exceedingly precious to me as on my own account i could not afford the least additional expense having been already by long and successive illnesses thrown behindhand so much that for the next four or five months i fear let me work as hard as i can i shall not be able to do what my heart within me burns to do that is to concenter my free mind to the affinities of the feelings with words and ideas under the title of concerning poetry and the nature of the pleasures derived from it i have faith that i do understand the subject and i am sure that if i write what i ought to do on it the work would supersede all the books of metaphysics and all the books of morals too to whom shall a young man utter his pride if not to a young man whom he loves  i beg you therefore my dear davy to write to me a long letter when you are at leisure informing mefirstly what books it will be well for me and calvert to purchase secondly directions for a convenient little laboratory thirdly to what amount apparatus would run in expense and whether or no you would be so good as to superintend its making at bristol fourthly give me your advice how to begin and fifthly and lastly and mostly do send a drop of hope to my parched tongue that you will if you can come and visit me in the spring indeed indeed you ought to see this country this beautiful country and then the joy you would send into me  the shape of this paper will convince you with what eagerness i began this letter i really did not see that it was not a sheet  i have been thinking vigorously during my illness so that i cannot say that my long long wakeful nights have been all lost to me the subject of my meditations has been the relations of thoughts to thingsin the language of hume of ideas to impressions i may be truly described in the words of descartes i have been res cogitans id est dubitans affirmans negans pauca intelligens multa ignorans volens nolens imaginans etiam et sentiens i please myself with believing that you will receive no small pleasure from the result of these broodings although i expect in you in some points a determined opponent but i say of my mind in this respect manet imperterritus ille hostem magnanimum opperiens et mole sua stat every poor fellow has his proud hour sometimes and this i suppose is mine  i am better in every respect than i was but am still very feeble the weather has been woefully against me for the last fortnight having rained here almost incessantly i take quantities of bark but the effect is to express myself with the dignity of science x  0000000 and i shall not gather strength or that little suffusion of bloom which belongs to my

wade  march 6 1801  my very dear friend  i have even now received your letter my habits of thinking and feeling have not hitherto inclined me to personify commerce in any such shape so as to tempt me to turn pagan and offer vows to the goddess of our isle but when i read that sentence in your letter the time will come i trust when i shall be able to pitch my tent in your neighbourhood i was most potently commanded 1 to a breach of the second commandment and on my knees to entreat the said goddess to touch your bank notes and guineas with her magical multiplying wand i could offer such a prayer for you with a better conscience than for most men because i know that you have never lost that healthy common sense which regards money only as the means of independence and that you would sooner than most men cry out enough enough to see ones children secured against want is doubtless a delightful thing but to wish to see them begin the world as rich men is unwise to ourselves for it

proper antidote of wealth             is not march rather a perilous month for the voyage from yarmouth to hamburg danger there is very little in the packets but i know what inconvenience rough weather brings with it not from my own feelings for i am never seasick but always in exceeding high spirits on board ship but from what i see in others but you are an old sailor at hamburg i have not a shadow of acquaintance my letters of introduction produced for me with one exception viz klopstock the brother of the poet no real service but merely distant and ostentatious civility and klopstock will by this time have forgotten my name which indeed he never properly knew for i could speak only english and latin and he only french and german at ratzeburg 35 english miles ne from hamburg on the road to lubec i resided four months and i should hope was not unbeloved by more than one family but this is out of your route at gottingen i stayed near five months but here i knew only students who will have left the place by this time and the high learned professors only one of whom could speak english and they are so wholly engaged in their academical occupations that they would be of no service to you other acquaintance in germany i have none and connexion i never had any for though i was much entreated by some of the literati to correspond with them yet my natural laziness with the little value i attach to literary men as literary men and with my aversion from those letters which are to be made up of studied sense and unfelt compliments combined to prevent me from availing myself of the offer herein and in similar instances with english authors of repute i have ill consulted the growth of my reputation and fame but i have cheerful and confident hopes of myself if i can hereafter do good to my fellowcreatures as a poet and as a metaphysician they will know it and any other fame than this i consider as a serious evil that would only take me from out the number and sympathy of ordinary men to make a coxcomb of me  as to the inns or hotels at hamburg i should recommend you to some german inn wordsworth and i were at the der wilde man and dirty as it was i could not find any inn in germany very much cleaner except at lubec but if you go to an english inn for heavens sake avoid the shakspeare at altona and the king of england at hamburg they are houses of plunder rather than entertainment the duke of york hotel kept by seaman has a better reputation and thither i would advise you to repair and i advise you to pay your bill every morning at breakfast time it is the only way to escape imposition what the hamburg merchants may be i know not but the tradesmen are knaves scoundrels with yellowwhite phizzes that bring disgrace on the complexion of a bad tallow candle now as to carriage i know scarcely what to advise only make up your mind to the very worst vehicles with the very worst horses drawn by the very worst postillions over the very worst roads and halting two hours at each time they change horses at the very worst inns and you have a fair unexaggerated picture of travelling in north germany the cheapest way is the best go by the common post wagons or stage coaches what are called extraordinaries or postchaises are little wicker carts uncovered with moveable benches or forms in them execrable in every respect and if you buy a vehicle at hamburg you can get none decent under thirty or forty guineas and very probably it will break to pieces on the infernal roads the canal boats are delightful but the porters everywhere in the united provinces are an impudent abominable and dishonest race you must carry as little luggage as you well can with you in the canal boats and when you land get recommended to an inn beforehand and bargain with the porters first of all and never lose sight of them or you may never see your portmanteau or baggage again  my sarah desires her love to you and yours god bless your dear little

journal i 55it was then that stoddart obtained a copy of christabel and read it shortly afterwards 3 to sir walter scott then busy with his border minstrelsy the beauty of christabel touched sir walters romantic imagination and echoes of the poem are discernible in the lay of the last minstrel and the bridal of tryermain  but coleridge in spite of many attempts could not complete the piece and had to give up the endeavour in a letter to godwin of 25th march 1801 coleridge thus laments what was practically the end of his career as a poet  footnote 1 tempted er ii 18  footnote 2 letters cxvicxvii follow 104  footnote 3 in 1802     letter 105 to godwin  wednesday march 25 1801  dear godwin  i fear your tragedy 1 will find me in a very unfit state of mind to sit in judgment on it i have been during the last three months undergoing a process of intellectual exsiccation during my long illness i had compelled into hours of delight many a sleepless painful hour of darkness by chasing down metaphysical game and since then i have continued the hunt till i found myself unaware at the root of pure mathematics and up that tall smooth tree whose few poor branches are all at the very summit am i climbing by pure adhesive strength of arms and thighs still slipping down still renewing my ascent you would not know me all sounds of similitude keep at such a distance from each other in my mind that i have forgotten how to make a rhyme i look at the mountains that visible god almighty that looks in at all my windowsi look at the mountains only for the curves of their outlines the stars as i behold them form themselves into triangles and my hands are scarred with scratches from a cat whose back i was rubbing in the dark in order to see whether the sparks from it were refrangible by a prism the poet is dead in me my imagination or rather the somewhat that had been imaginative lies like a cold snuff on the circular rim of a brass candlestick without even a stink of tallow to remind you that it was once clothed and mitred with flame that is past by i was once a volume of gold leaf rising and riding on every breath of fancy but i have beaten myself back into weight and density and now i sink in quicksilver and remain squat and square on the earth amid the hurricane that makes oaks and straws join in one dance fifty yards high in the element  however i will do what i can taste and feeling have i none but what i have give i unto thee but i repeat that i am unfit to decide on any but works of severe logic  i write now to beg that if you have not sent your tragedy you may remember to send antonio with it which i have not yet seen and likewise my campbells pleasures of hope which wordsworth wishes to see  have you seen the second volume of the lyrical ballads and the preface prefixed to the first i should judge of a mans heart and intellect precisely according to the degree and intensity of the admiration with which he read these poems perhaps instead of heart i should have said taste but when i think of the brothers of ruth and of michael i recur to the expression and am enforced to say heart if i die and the booksellers will give you anything for ray life be sure to say wordsworth descended on him like the greek gnothi seauton from heaven by showing to him what true poetry was he made him know that he himself was no poet  in your next letter you will perhaps give me some hints respecting your prose plans  god bless you and  s t coleridge  greta hall keswick  pswhat is a fair pricewhat might an author of reputation fairly ask from a bookseller for one edition of a thousand copies of a fiveshilling book  i congratulate you on the settlement of davy in london i hope that his enchanting manners will not draw too many idlers about him to harass and vex his mornings   footnote 1 this tragedy was entitled abbas     part ii   the permanent  i will write for the permanent or not at all letter to sir g beaumont coleorton memorials ii 162 woe is me that at 46 i am under the necessity of appearing as a lecturer and obliged to regard every hour given to the permanent whether as poet or philosopher an hour stolen from others as well as from my own maintenance letter to mudford brandls life of coleridge p 359                                the conventional view of coleridge that opium killed the poet in him does not commend itself to the scientific consciousness opium has the tendency to stimulate rather than to deaden the poetic imagination as the history of de quincey can testify and one of coleridges most imaginative pieces kubla khan is said to have been occasioned by an overdose of the drug  the poet in coleridge was extinguished by a very different thing than opium coleridges poetic faculty was suspended by the loss of hope and also by the growth of his intellect by the development of his reasoning and philosophic powers and by the multiplication of the interests which appealed to him and the many problems which presented themselves for his solution he was constitutionally the most comprehensive mind of a new age and just because he was its greatest thinker he was perplexed and attracted by the majority of the problems which arose around him and which he himself helped to raise poetry the poetry of the romantic movement in which he far excelled all his contemporaries was no longer capable of grappling with the philosophic theological political and social questions now on the horizon or which coleridge felt would soon by the development of international affinities be on the horizon of the english mind hence coleridges thirst for the new lore of the german philosophy which seemed to him to supply a want in the intellectualism of his native country  in spite of this coleridge knew that in being deserted by the poetic spirit he was leaving a high artistic realm for one of lesser glory and hence his letter to godwin of 25th march 1801 and later on his dirge over himself in dejection  coleridge in choosing to follow wordsworth to the lake district in preference to remaining at nether stowey with poole had experienced some contrition for poole after all was a more profound appreciator of his manysidedness and the cervantean vein of his character than wordsworth who appreciated coleridge only from that side of him which resembled himself  tom poole regretted like others that coleridge had no permanent calling or could not fix upon an undertaking worthy of his powers poole looked upon coleridges devotion to journalism while he was engaged upon the morning post as a turning aside of his powers from higher ends t poole and his friends ii 2 and wished him to give himself up to something more permanently useful to society t poole and his friends ii 3 the correspondence of coleridge and poole from 1800 onwards often turns upon the subject t poole and his friends ii 66 68 122 177 187 205 226 247 and coleridge admitted a distracting manifoldness in his objects and attainments t poole and his friends ii 122 you said coleridge are nobly employedmost worthy of you you are made to endear yourself to mankind as an immediate benefactor i must throw my bread on the waters t poole and his friends ii 122  while engaged in these argumentations with his best friend coleridge was striving to think out in his deep philosophic and musing mind many problems of the time and there arose in his imagination the idea of the permanent he was henceforth no longer the poet of romanticism whose significance he had exhausted but the philosopher of the permanent which presented itself as a splendid possibility in all departments of human knowledge and activity in his prose works and letters we find a continual reference to what coleridge now calls the permanentthe permanent principles of morals philosophy and religion and of the permanent principles of criticism as applied to poetry and the fine arts everything is now adjusted by coleridge to this idea art morals religion and politics are tried by its standard to find if they are founded in the permanent principles of human nature  it is in the light of this idea the ideal of coleridges later life that we must judge coleridge and weigh him to continue to see in opium the sole or even the principal cause of his failure is to misjudge him altogether to compare him with others of different powers who accomplished more in one direction in the matter of literary output with sir walter scott or byron for instance is misleading it is the man of profound genius who in his own time is feeling on all sides into the future who is least likely to give forth finished productions as they are called in which the subjects of which they treat are often exhausted and please the ear of the present coleridge is such a man of genius nearly all his works are fragmentary unfinished suggestive rather than complete just because they verge upon that transcendentalism which he was the first to make audible to english ears in his day ill health and opium in conjunction with ill health contributed no doubt to enfeeble his utterance but to assert that opium was the cause or the main cause of coleridges inability to do what he wanted himself to do or what his friends and contemporaries expected him to do is a gross perversion of the facts of the case coleridges inability arose from his multiplicity of motive his visionary faculty of seeing in the light of a new principle a host of problems rise up on all sides all claiming recognition and solution that is the disease of my mindit is comprehensive in its conceptions and wastes itself in the contemplations of the many things which it might do letter to poole 4th january 1799 letters p 270 a greater than coleridge had felt this tendency before him and created as its embodiment hamlet and coleridge has been called the hamlet of literature    chapter x   ill health southey comes to keswick  on 13th april 1801 coleridge wrote to southey the following letter and southey replied in cordial terms from which it will be gathered a reconciliation had been made since the lloyd and lamb quarrel 1  footnote 1 see letters vol i 304      letter 106 to robert southey esq  greta hall keswick april 13 1801  my dear southey  i received your kind letter on the evening before last and i trust that this will arrive at bristol just in time to rejoice with them that rejoice alas you will have found the dear old place sadly minused by the removal of davy it is one of the evils of long silence that when one recommences the correspondence one has so much to say that one can say nothing i have enough with what i have seen and with what i have done and with what i have suffered and with what i have heard exclusive of all that i hope and all that i intendi have enough to pass away a great deal of time with were you on a desert isle and i your friday but at present i purpose to speak only of myself relatively to keswick and to you  our house stands on a low hill the whole front of which is one field and an enormous garden ninetenths of which is a nursery garden behind the house is an orchard and a small wood on a steep slope at the foot of which flows the river greta which winds round and catches the evening lights in the front of the house in front we have a giants campan encamped army of tentlike mountains which by an inverted arch gives a view of another vale on our right the lovely vale and the wedgeshaped lake of bassenthwaite and on our left derwentwater and lodore full in view and the fantastic mountains of borrodale behind us the massy skiddaw smooth green high with two chasms and a tentlike ridge in the larger a fairer scene you have not seen in all your wanderings without going from our own grounds we have all that can please a human being as to books my landlord who dwells next door1 has a very respectable library which he has put with mine histories encyclopaedias and all the modern gentry but then i can have when i choose free access to the princely library of sir guilfred lawson which contains the noblest collection of travels and natural history of perhaps any private library in england besides this there is the cathedral library of carlisle from whence i can have any books sent to me that i wish in short i may truly say that i command all the libraries in the county   our neighbour is a truly good and affectionate man a father to my children and a friend to me he was offered fifty guineas for the house in which we are to live but he preferred me for a tenant at twentyfive and yet the whole of his income does not exceed i believe £200 a year a more truly disinterested man i never met with severely frugal yet almost carelessly generous and yet he got all his money as a common carrier2 by hard labour and by pennies  he is one instance among many in this country of the salutary effect of the love of knowledgehe was from a boy a lover of learning the house is full twice as large as we want it hath more rooms in it than allfoxden you might have a bedroom parlour study etc etc and there would always be rooms to spare for your or my visitors in short for situation and convenienceand when i mention the name of wordsworth for society of men of intellecti know no place in which you and edith would find yourselves so well suited  s t c    footnote 1 greta hall was at this time divided into two houses which were afterwards thrown together  footnote 2 this person whose name was jackson was the master in wordsworths poem of the waggoner the circumstances of which are accurately correct   the remainder of this letter as well as another of later date was filled with a most gloomy account of his own health to which southey refers in the commencement of his reply    southey to coleridge  bristol july 11 1801  yesterday i arrived and found your letters they did depress me but i have since reasoned or dreamt myself into more cheerful anticipations i have persuaded myself that your complaint is gouty that good living is necessary and a good climate i also move to the south at least so it appears and if my present prospects ripen we may yet live under one roof   you may have seen a translation of persius by drummond an mp this man is going ambassador first to palermo and then to constantinople if a married man can go as his secretary it is probable that i shall accompany him i daily expect to know it is a scheme of wynns to settle me in the south and i am returned to look about me my salary will be smalla very trifle but after a few years i look on to something better and have fixed my mind on a consulship now if we go you must join us as soon as we are housed and it will be marvellous if we regret england i shall have so little to do that my time may be considered as wholly my own our joint amusements will easily supply us with all expenses so no more of the azores for we will see the great turk and visit greece and walk up the pyramids and ride camels in arabia i have dreamt of nothing else these five weeks as yet every thing is so uncertain for i have received no letter since we landed that nothing can be said of our intermediate movements if we are not embarked too soon we will set off as early as possible for cumberland unless you should think as we do that mahomet had better come to the mountain that change of all externals may benefit you and that bad as bristol weather is it is yet infinitely preferable to northern cold and damp meet we must and will  you know your old poems are a third time in the press why not set forth a second volume    your christabel your three graces1 which i remember as the very consummation of poetry i must spur you to something to the assertion of your supremacy if you have not enough to muster i will aid you in any waymanufacture skeletons that you may clothe with flesh blood and beauty write my best or what shall be bad enough to be popularwe will even make plays alamode robespierre    drop all taskwork it is ever unprofitable the same time and one twentieth part of the labour would produce treble emolument for thalaba i received £115 it was just twelve months intermitting work and the aftereditions are my own   i feel here as a stranger somewhat of leonards feeling god bless wordsworth for that poem2 what tie have i to england my london friends there indeed i have friends but if you and yours were with me eating dates in a garden at constantinople you might assert that we were in the best of all possible places and i should answer amen and if our wives rebelled we would send for the chief of the black eunuchs and sell them to the seraglio then should moses 3 learn arabic and we would know whether there was anything in the language or not we would drink cyprus wine and mocha coffee and smoke more tranquilly than ever we did in the ship in small street  time and absence make strange work with our affections but mine are ever returning to rest upon you i have other and dear friends but none with whom the whole of my being is intimatewith whom every thought and feeling can amalgamate oh i have yet such dreams is it quite clear that you and i were not meant for some better star and dropped by mistake into this world of pounds shillings and pence    god bless you  robert southey  footnote 1 the three graves  footnote 2 the brothers is the title of this poem  footnote 3 hartley coleridge    southey to coleridge  july 25  in about ten days we shall be ready to set forward for keswick where if it were not for the rains and the fogs and the frosts i should probably be content to winter but the climate deters me it is uncertain when i may be sent abroad or where except that the south of europe is my choice the appointment hardly doubtful and the probable destination palermo or naples we will talk of the future and dream of it on the lake side    i may calculate upon the next six months at my own disposal so we will climb skiddaw this year and scale etna the next and sicilian air will keep us alive till davy has found out the immortalising elixir or till we are very well satisfied to do without it and be immortalised after the manner of our fathers my pocketbook contains more plans than will ever be filled up but whatever becomes of those plans this at least is feasible    poor h he has literally killed himself by the law which i believe kills more than any disease that takes its place in the bills of mortality blackstone is a needful book and my coke is a borrowed one but i have one law book whereof to make an autodafe and burnt he shall be but whether to perform that ceremony with fitting libations at home or fling him down the crater of etna directly to the devil is worth considering at leisure  i must work at keswick the more willingly because with the hope hereafter the necessity will cease my portuguese materials must lie dead and this embarrasses me it is impossible to publish any thing about that country now because i must one day return thereto their libraries and archives otherwise i have excellent stuff for a little volume and could soon set forth a first vol of my history either civil or literary in these labours i have incurred a heavy and serious expense i shall write to hamilton and review again if he chooses to employ me    it was cottle who told me that your poems were reprinting in a third edition this cannot allude to the lyrical ballads because of the number and the participle present    i am bitterly angry to see one new poem 1 smuggled into the world in the lyrical ballads where the 750 purchasers of the first can never get at it at falmouth i bought thomas dermodys poems for old acquaintance sake alas the boy wrote better than the man    pyes alfred to distinguish him from alfred the pious 2 i have not yet inspected nor the wilful murder of bonaparte by anna matilda nor the high treason committed by sir james bland burgess baronet against our lionhearted richard davy is fallen stark mad with a play called the conspiracy of gowrie which is by rough an imitation of gebir with some poetry but miserably and hopelessly deficient in all else every character reasoning and metaphorising and metaphysicking the reader most nauseously by the by there is a great analogy between hock laver pork pie and the lyrical balladsall have a flavour not beloved by those who require a taste and utterly unpleasant to dramdrinkers whose diseased palates can only feel pepper and brandy i know not whether wordsworth will forgive the stimulant tale of thalabatis a turtle soup highly seasoned but with a flavour of its own predominant his are sparagrass it ought to be spelt so and artichokes good with plain butter

german with you and we must read tasso together  god bless you  yours  r s   footnote 1 coleridges poem of love  footnote 2 this alludes to mr cottles alfred   the next two letters to davy indicate

yields me greater pleasure by writing to me yet i have neither pain nor disquietude from your silence i have a deep faith in the guardianship of nature over youof the great being whom you are manifesting heaven bless you my dear davy  i have been rendered uneasy by an account of the lisbon packets nonarrival lest southey should have been on board it have you heard from him lately  it would seem affectation to write to you and say nothing of my health but in truth i am weary of giving useless pain yesterday i should have been incapable of writing you this scrawl and tomorrow i may be as bad sinking sinking sinking i feel that i am sinking my medical attendant says that it is irregular gout with nephritic symptoms gout in a young man of twentynine swollen knees and knotty fingers a loathing stomach and a dizzy head trust me friend i am at times an object of moral disgust to my own mind but that this long illness has impoverished me i should immediately go to st miguels one of the azoresthe baths and the delicious climate might restore meand if it were possible i would afterwards send over for my wife and children and settle there for a few years it is exceedingly cheap on this supposition wordsworth and his sister have with generous friendship offered to settle there with meand happily our dear southey would come too but of this i pray you my dear fellow do not say a syllable to any human being for the scheme from the present state of my circumstances is rather the thing of a wish than of a hope  if you write to me pray in a couple of sentences tell me whether herschells thermometric spectrum in the philos trans will lead to any revolution in the chemical philosophy as far as words go i have become a formidable chemisthaving got by heart a prodigious quantity of terms etc to which i attach some ideas very scanty in number i assure you and right meagre in their individual persons that which must discourage me in it is that i find all power of vital attributes to depend on modes of arrangement and that chemistry throws not even a distant rushlight glimmer upon this subject the reasoning likewise is always unsatisfactory to me i am perpetually saying probably there are many agents hitherto undiscovered this cannot be reasoning we must have a deep conviction that all the terms have been exhausted this is saying no more than that with dr beddoess leave chemistry can never possess the same kind of certainty with the mathematicsin truth it is saying nothing i grow however exceedingly interested in the subject  god love you my dear

cornwall i must believe that you have made some important discoveries in galvanism and connected the facts with other more interesting ones or i should be puzzled to conceive how that subject could furnish matter for more than one lecture if i recollect aright you have identified it with electricity and that indeed is a wide field i shall dismiss my british critic and take in nicholsons journal and then i shall know something about you i am sometimes apprehensive that my passion for science is scarcely true and genuineit is but davyism that is i fear that i am more delighted at your having discovered facts than at the facts having been discovered  my health is better i am indeed eager to believe that i am really beginning to recover though i have had so many short recoveries followed by severe relapses that i am at times almost afraid to hope but cheerful thoughts come with genial sensations and hope is itself no mean medicine  i am anxious respecting robert southey why is he not in england remember me kindly to tobin as soon as i have anything to communicate i will write to him but alas sickness turns large districts of time into dreary uniformity of sandy desolation alas for

his complaints about health     letter 109 to godwin  greta hall keswick  dear godwin  i have had during the last three weeks such numerous interruptions of my uninterrupted rural retirement such a succession of visitors both indigenous and exotic that verily i wanted both the time and composure necessary to answer your letter of the first of juneat present i am writing to you from my bed for in consequence of a very sudden change in the weather from intense heat to a raw and scathing chillness my bodily health has suffered a relapse as severe as it was unexpected  i have not yet received either antonio or your pamphlet in answer to dr parr and the scotch gentleman 1 who is to be professor of morals to the young nabobs at calcutta with an establishment of £3000 a year stuart was so kind as to send me fenwicks review of it in a paper called the albion and mr longman has informed me that by your orders the pamphlet itself has been left for me at his house the extracts which i saw pleased me much with the exception of the introduction which is incorrectly and clumsily worded but indeed i have often observed that whatever you write the first page is always the worst in the book i wish that instead of six days you had employed six months and instead of a halfcrown pamphlet had given us a good halfguinea octavo but you may yet do this it strikes me that both in this work and in the second edition of the political justice your retractations have been more injudicious than the assertions or dogmas retracted but this is no fit subject for a mere letter if i had time which i have not i would write two or three sheets for your sole inspection entitled history of the errors and blunders of the literary life of william godwin to the world it would appear a paradox to say that you are at all too persuadable but you yourself know it to be the truth  i shall send back your manuscript on friday with my criticisms you say in your last how i wish you were here when i see how little i have written of what i could have talked i feel with you that a letter is but a mockery to a full and ardent mind in truth i feel this so forcibly that if i could be certain that i should remain in this country i should press you to come down and finish the whole in my house but if i can by any means raise the moneys i shall go in the first vessel that leaves liverpool for the azores st michaels to wit and these sail at the end of july unless i can escape one english winter and spring i have not any rational prospect of recovery you cannot help regarding uninterrupted rural retirement as a principal cause of my ill health my ill health commenced at liverpool in the shape of bloodshot eyes and swollen eyelids while i was in the daily habit of visiting the liverpool literatithese on my settling at keswick were followed by large boils in my neck and shoulders these by a violent rheumatic fever this by a distressing and tedious hydrocele and since then by irregular gout which promises at this moment to ripen into a legitimate fit what uninterrupted rural retirement can have had to do in the production of these outward and visible evils i cannot guess what share it has had in consoling me under them i know with a tranquil mind and feel with a grateful heart o that you had now before your eyes the delicious picture of lake and river and bridge and cottage and spacious field with its pathway and woody hill with its spring verdure and mountain with the snow yet lingering in fantastic patches upon it even the same which i had from my sick bed even without raising my head from the pillow o god all but dear and lovely things seemed to be known to my imagination only as words even the forms which struck terror into me in my feverdreams were still forms of beauty before my last seizure i bent down to pick something from the ground and when i raised my head i said to miss wordsworth i am sure rotha that i am going to be ill for as i bent my head there came a distinct vivid spectrum upon my eyes it was one little picturea rock with birches and ferns on it a cottage backed by it and a small stream were i a painter i would give an outward existence to this but it will always live in my memory  bythebye our rural retirement has been honoured by the company of mr sharp and the poet rogers the latter though not a man of very vigorous intellect won a good deal both on myself and wordsworth for what he said evidently came from his own feelings and was the result of his own observation  my love to your dear little one i begin to feel my knee

daily papers again     letter 110 to davy  greta hall keswick cumberland october 31 1801  my dear davy  i do not know by what fatality it has happened but so it is that i have thought more often of you and i may say yearned after your society more for the last three months than i ever before did and yet i have not written to you but you know that i honour you and that i love whom i honour love and esteem with me have no dividual being and wherever this is not the case i suspect there must be some lurking moral superstition which nature gets the better of and that the real meaning of the phrase i love him though i cannot esteem him isi esteem him but not according to my system of esteem but you my dear fellow all men love and esteemwhich is the only suspicious part of your characterat least according to the 5th chapter of st matthewgod bless you  and now for the business of this letter if i can i leave this place so as to be in london on wednesday the 11th of next month in london i shall stay a fortnight but as i am in feeble health and have a perfect phobia of inns and coffeehouses i should rejoice if you or southey should be able to offer me a bedroom for the fortnight aforesaid from london i move southward now for the italicized words if i can the cryptical and implicit import of which isi have a damned thorn in my leg which the surgeon has not been yet able to extractand but that i have metaphysicized most successfully on pain in consequence of the accident by the great scatterer of thoughts i should have been half mad but as it is i have borne it like a woman which i believe to be two or three degrees at least beyond a stoic a suppuration is going on and i endure in hope  i have redirected some of southeys letters to you taking it for granted that you will see him immediately on his arrival in town he left us yesterday afternoon let me hear from you if it be only to say what i know already that you will be glad to see me o dear friend thou one

coleridge at this date is well known and we must quote it coleridge has left london for keswick during his stay in town i saw him seldomer than usual when i did see him it was generally in the midst of large companies where he is the image of power and activity his eloquence is unimpaired perhaps it is softer and stronger his will is less than ever commensurate with his ability brilliant images of greatness float upon his mind like images of the morning clouds on the waters their forms are changed by the motions of the waves they are agitated by every breeze and modified by every sunbeam he talked in the course of an hour of beginning three works he recited the poem of christabel unfinished and as i had before heard it what talent does he not waste in forming visions sublime but unconnected with the real world i have looked to his efforts as to the efforts of a creating being but as yet he has not laid the foundation for the new world of intellectual forms fragmentary remains p 74  southey had now returned from portugal and was also in london southeys letters i 183 it was not till september 1803 that southey came to keswick southeys letters i 22931 during the interval coleridge had written various things for the morning post the most outstanding contributions being the two powerful letters to fox of 4th and 9th november 1802 written on the occasion of that statesman going to paris and paying court to napoleon the next eight letters to thomas wedgwood give the best impression of coleridge between october 1802 and february 1803      letter 111 to thomas wedgwood  keswick oct 20 1802  my dear sir  this is my birthday my thirtieth it will not appear wonderful to you when i tell you that before the arrival of your letter i had been thinking with a great weight of different feelings concerning you and your dear brother for i have good reason to believe that i should not now have been alive if in addition to other miseries i had had immediate poverty pressing upon me i will never again remain silent so long it has not been altogether indolence or my habit of procrastination which have 1 kept me from writing but an eager wishi may truly say a thirst of spirit to have something honourable to tell you of myself  at present i must be content to tell you something cheerful my health is very much better i am stronger in every respect and am not injured by study or the act of sitting at my writing desk but my eyes suffer if at any time i have been intemperate in the use of candlelight this account supposes another namely that my mind is calm and more at ease my dear sir when i was last with you at stowey my heart was often full and i could scarcely keep from communicating to you the tale of my distresses but could i add to your depression when you were low or how interrupt or cast a shade on your good spirits that were so rare and so precious to you    i found no comfort but in the driest speculationsin the ode to dejection which you were pleased with these lines in the original followed the line my shaping spirit of imagination     for not to think of what i needs must feel   but to be still and patient all i can   and haply by abstruse research to steal   from my own nature all the natural man   this was my sole resource my only plan   and that which suits a part infests the whole   and now is almost grown the temper 2 of my soul    i give you these lines for the spirit and not for the poetry    but better days are arrived and are still to come i have had visitations of hopethat i may yet be something of which those who love me may be proud  i cannot write that without recalling dear poole i have heard twice and written twice and i fear by a strange fatality one of the letters will have missed him leslie 3 was here some time ago i was very much pleased with him and now i will tell you what i am doing i dedicate three days in the week to the morning post and shall hereafter write for the far greater part such things as will be of as permanent interest as any thing i can hope to write and you will shortly see a little essay of mine justifying the writing in a newspaper  my comparison of the french with the roman empire was very favourably received the poetry which i have sent is merely the emptying out of my desk the epigrams are wretched indeed but they answered stuarts purpose better than better things i ought not to have given any signature to them whatsoever i never dreamt of acknowledging either them or the ode to the rain as to feeble expressions and unpolished linesthere is the rub indeed my dear sir i do value your opinion very highly i think your judgment on the sentiment the imagery the flow of a poem decisive at least if it differed from my own and if after frequent consideration mine remained different it would leave me at least perplexed for you are a perfect electrometer in these thingsbut in point of poetic diction i am not so well satisfied that you do not require a certain aloofness from the language of real life which i think deadly to poetry  very soon however i shall present you from the press with my opinions full on the subject of style both in prose and verse and i am confident of one thing that i shall convince you that i have thought much and patiently on the subject and that i understand the whole strength of my antagonists cause for i am now busy on the subject and shall in a very few weeks go to press with a volume on the prose writings of hall milton and taylor and shall immediately follow it up with an essay on the writings of dr johnson and gibbon and in these two volumes i flatter myself i shall present a fair history of english prose if my life and health remain and i do but write half as much and as regularly as i have done during the last six weeks this will be finished by january next and i shall then put together my memorandumbook on the subject of poetry in both i have endeavoured sedulously to state the facts and the differences clearly and accurately and my reasons for the preference of one style to another are secondary to this  of this be assured that i will never give any thing to the world in propria persona in my own name which i have not tormented with the file i sometimes suspect that my foul copy would often appear to general readers more polished than my fair copy many of the feeble and colloquial expressions have been industriously substituted for others which struck me as artificial and not standing the test as being neither the language of passion nor distinct conceptions dear sir indulge me with looking still further on in my literary life  i have since my twentieth year meditated an heroic poem on the siege of jerusalem by titus this is the pride and the stronghold of my hope but i never think of it except in my best moods the work to which i dedicate the ensuing years of my life is one which highly pleased leslie in prospective and my paper will not let me prattle to you about it i have written what you more wished me to write all about myself  our climate in the north is inclement and our houses not as compact as they might be but it is a stirring climate and the worse the weather the more unceasingly entertaining are my study windows and the month that is to come is the glory of the year with us a very warm bedroom i can promise you and one at the same time which commands the finest lake and mountain view if leslie could not go abroad with you and i could in any way mould my manners and habits to suit you i should of all things like to be your companion good nature an affectionate disposition and so thorough a sympathy with the nature of your complaint that i should feel no pain not the most momentary at being told by you what your feelings require at the time in which they required it this i should bring with me but i need not say that you may say to meyou dont suit me without inflicting the least mortification of course this letter is for your brother as for you but i shall write to him soon god bless you  s t coleridge  thomas wedgwood esq  footnote 1 sic  footnote 2 cottle prints temple an error  footnote 3 the eminent edinburg professor

keswick november 3 1802  dear wedgwood  it is now two hours since i received your letter and after the necessary consultation mrs coleridge herself is fully of opinion that to lose time is merely to lose spirits accordingly i have resolved not to look the children in the face the parting from whom is the downright bitter in the thing but to go to london by tomorrows mail of course i shall be in london god permitting on saturday morning i shall rest that day and the next and proceed to bristol by the monday nights mail at bristol i will go to cotehouse1 at all events barring serious illness serious fractures and the et cetera of serious unforeseens i shall be at bristol tuesday noon november 9  you are aware that my whole knowledge of french does not extend beyond the power of limping slowly not without a dictionary crutch through an easy french book and that as to pronunciation all my organs of speech from the bottom of the larynx to the edge of my lips are utterly and naturally antigallican if only i shall have been any comfort any alleviation to you i shall feel myself at easeand whether you go abroad or no while i remain with you it will greatly contribute to my comfort if i know you will have no hesitation nor pain in telling me what you wish me to do or not to do  i regard it among the blessings of my life that i have never lived among men whom i regarded as my artificial superiors that all the respect i have at any time paid has been wholly to supposed goodness or talent the consequence has been that i have no alarms of pride no cheval de frise of independence i have always lived among equals it never occurs to me even for a moment that i am otherwise if i have quarrelled with men it has been as brothers or as schoolfellows quarrel how little any man can give me or take from me save in matters of kindness and esteem is not so much a thought or conviction with me or even a distinct feeling as it is my very nature much as i dislike all formal declarations of this kind i have deemed it well to say this i have as strong feelings of gratitude as any man shame upon me if in the sickness and the sorrow which i have had and which have been kept unaggravated and supportable by your kindness and your brothers mr josiah wedgwood shame upon me if i did not feel a kindness not unmixed with reverence towards you both but yet i never should have had my present impulses to be with you and this confidence that i may become an occasional comfort to you if independently of all gratitude i did not thoroughly esteem you and if i did not appear to myself to understand the nature of your sufferings and within the last year in some slight degree to have felt myself something of the same  forgive me my dear sir if i have said too much it is better to write it than to say it and i am anxious in the event of our travelling together that you should yourself be at ease with me even as you would with a younger brother to whom from his childhood you had been in the habit of saying do this col or dont do that all good be with you  s t coleridge  thomas wedgwood esq2  footnote 1 westbury near bristol the then residence of mr john wedgwood  footnote 2 letters cxxxiicxxxiv follow 112    letter 113 to thomas wedgwood  keswick january 9 1803  my dear wedgwood  i send you two letters one from your dear sister the second from sharp by which you will see at what short notice i must be off if i go to the canaries if your last plan continue in full force i have not even the phantom of a wish thitherward struggling but if aught have happened to you in the things without or in the world within to induce you to change the place or the plan relatively to me i think i could raise the money but i would a thousandfold rather go with you whithersoever you go i shall be anxious to hear how you have gone on since i left you you should decide in favour of a better climate somewhere or other the best scheme i can think of is to go to some part of italy or sicily which we both liked i would look out for two houses wordsworth and his family would take the one and i the other and then you might have a home either with me or if you thought of mr and mrs luff under this modification one of your own and in either case you would have neighbours and so return to england when the home sickness pressed heavy upon you and back to italy when it was abated and the climate of england began to poison your comforts so you would have abroad in a genial climate certain comforts of society among simple and enlightened men and women and i should be an alleviation of the pang which you will necessarily feel as often as you quit your own family  i know no better plan for travelling in search of objects is at best a dreary business and whatever excitement it might have had you must have exhausted it god bless you my dear friend i write with dim eyes for indeed indeed my heart is very full of affectionate sorrowful thoughts toward you  i write with difficulty with all the fingers but one of my right hand very much swollen before i was half up the kirkstone mountain the storm had wetted me through and through and before i reached the top it was so wild and outrageous that it would have been unmanly to have suffered the poor woman guide to continue pushing on up against such a torrent of wind and rain so i dismounted and sent her home with the storm in her back i am no novice in mountain mischiefs but such a storm as this was i never witnessed combining the intensity of the cold with the violence of the wind and rain the rain drops were pelted or slung against my face by the gusts just like splinters of flint and i felt as if every drop cut my flesh my hands were all shrivelled up like a washerwomans and so benumbed that i was obliged to carry my stick under my arm o it was a wild business such hurry skurry of clouds such volleys of sound in spite of the wet and the cold i should have had some pleasure in it but for two vexations first an almost intolerable pain came into my right eye a smarting and burning pain and secondly in consequence of riding with such cold water under my seat extremely uneasy and burthensome feelings attacked my groin so that what with the pain from the one and the alarm from the other i had no enjoyment at all  just at the brow of the hill i met a man dismounted who could not sit on horseback he seemed quite scared by the uproar and said to me with much feeling o sir it is a perilous buffeting but it is worse for you than for me for i have it at my back however i got safely over and immediately all was calm and breathless as if it was some mighty fountain put on the summit of kirkstone that shot forth its volcano of air and precipitated huge streams of invisible lava down the road to patterdale  i went on to grasmere 1 i was not at all unwell when i arrived there though wet of course to the skin my right eye had nothing the matter with it either to the sight of others or to my own feelings but i had a bad night with distressful dreams chiefly about my eye and waking often in the dark i thought it was the effect of mere recollection but it appeared in the morning that my right eye was bloodshot and the lid swollen that morning however i walked home and before i reached keswick my eye was quite well but i felt unwell all over yesterday i continued unusually unwell all over me till eight oclock in the evening i took no laudanum or opium but at eight oclock unable to bear the stomach uneasiness and achings of my limbs i took two large teaspoons full of ether in a wine glass of camphorated gumwater and a third teaspoon full at ten oclock and i received complete relief my body calmed my sleep placid but when i awoke in the morning my right hand with three of the fingers was swollen and inflamed the swelling in the hand is gone down and of two of the fingers somewhat abated but the middle finger is still twice its natural size so that i write with difficulty this has been a very rough attack but though i am much weakened by it and look sickly and haggard yet i am not out of heart such a bout such a periless buffetting was enough to have hurt the health of a strong man few constitutions can bear to be long wet through in intense cold i fear it will tire you to death to read this prolix scrawled story  affectionately dear friend yours ever  s t coleridge2   footnote 1 the then residence of mr wordsworth cottle  footnote 2 letter cxxxv is our no 110      letter 114 to thomas wedgwood  friday night jan 14 1803  dear friend  i was glad at heart to receive your letter and still more gladdened by the reading of it the exceeding kindness which it breathed was literally medicinal to me and i firmly believe cured me of a nervous rheumatic affection the acid and the oil very completely at patterdale but by the time it came to keswick the oil was all atop  you ask me why in the name of goodness i did not return when i saw the state of the weather the true reason is simple though it may be somewhat strange the thought never once entered my head the cause of this i suppose to be that i do not remember it at least i never once in my whole life turned back in fear of the weather prudence is a plant of which i no doubt possess some valuable specimens but they are always in my hothouse never out of the glasses and least of all things would endure the climate of the mountains in simple earnestness i never find myself alone within the embracement of rocks and hills a traveller up an alpine road but my spirit careers drives and eddies like a leaf in autumn a wild activity of thoughts imaginations feelings and impulses of motion rises up from within me a sort of bottom wind that blows to no point of the compass comes from i know not whence but agitates the whole of me my whole being is filled with waves that roll and stumble one this way and one that way like things that have no common master i think that my soul must have preexisted in the body of a chamois chaser the simple image of the old object has been obliterated but the feelings and impulsive habits and incipient actions are in me and the old scenery awakens them  the further i ascend from animated nature from men and cattle and the common birds of the woods and fields the greater becomes in me the intensity of the feeling of life life seems to me then an universal spirit that neither has nor can have an opposite god is everywhere i have exclaimed and works everywhere and where is there room for death in these moments it has been my creed that death exists only because ideas exist that life is limitless sensation that death is a child of the organic senses chiefly of the sight that feelings die by flowing into the mould of the intellect becoming ideas and that ideas passing forth into action reinstate themselves again in the world of life and i do believe that truth lies in these loose generalizations i do not think it possible that any bodily pains could eat out the love of joy that is so substantially part of me towards hills and rocks and steep waters and i have had some trial  on monday night i had an attack in my stomach and right side which in pain and the length of its continuance appeared to me by far the severest i ever had about one oclock the pain passed out of my stomach like lightning from a cloud into the extremities of my right foot my toe swelled and throbbed and i was in a state of delicious ease which the pain in my toe did not seem at all to interfere with on tuesday i was uncommonly well all the morning and ate an excellent dinner but playing too long and too rompingly with hartley and derwent i was very unwell that evening on wednesday i was well and after dinner wrapped myself up warm and walked with sarah hutchinson to lodore i never beheld anything more impressive than the wild outline of the black masses of mountain over lodore and so on to the gorge of borrowdale even through the bare twigs of a grove of birch trees through which the road passes and on emerging from the grove a red planet so very red that i never saw a star so red being clear and bright at the same time it seemed to have sky behind it it started as it were from the heavens like an eyeball of fire i wished aloud at that moment that you had been with me  the walk appears to have done me good but i had a wretched night shocking pains in my head occiput and teeth and found in the morning that i had two bloodshot eyes but almost immediately after the receipt and perusal of your letter the pains left me and i am bettered to this hour and am now indeed as well as usual saving that my left eye is very much bloodshot it is a sort of duty with me to be particular respecting facts that relate to my health i have retained a good sound appetite through the whole of it without any craving after exhilarants or narcotics and i have got well as in a moment rapid recovery is constitutional with me but the former circumstances i can with certainty refer to the system of diet abstinence from vegetables wine spirits and beer which i have adopted by your advice  i have no dread or anxiety respecting any fatigue which either of us is likely to undergo even in continental travelling many a healthy man would have been laid up with such a bout of thorough wet and intense cold at the same time as i had at kirkstone would to god that also for your sake i were a stronger man but i have strong wishes to be with you i love your society and receiving much comfort from you and believing likewise that i receive much improvement i find a delight very great my dear friend indeed it is when i have reason to imagine that i am in return an alleviation to your destinies and a comfort to you i have no fears and am ready to leave home at a two days warning for myself i should say two hours but bustle and hurry might disorder mrs coleridge she and the three children are quite well1  i grieve that there is a lowering in politics the moniteur contains almost daily some bitter abuse of our minister and parliament and in london there is great anxiety and omening i have dreaded war from the time that the disastrous fortunes of the expedition to saint domingo under le clerc was known in france write me one or two lines as few as you like  i remain my dear wedgwood with most

feb 10 1803  dear wedgwood  last night poole and i fully expected a few lines from you when the newspaper came in without your letter we felt as if a dull neighbour had been ushered in after a knock at the door which had made us rise up and start forward to welcome some long absent friend indeed in pooles case this simile is less overswollen than in mine for in contempt of my convictions and assurance to the contrary poole passing off the brummagem coin of his wishes for sterling reasons had persuaded himself fully that he should see you in propria persona the truth is we had no right to expect a letter from you and i should have attributed your not writing to your having nothing to write to your bodily dislike of writing or though with reluctance to low spirits but that i have been haunted with the fear that your sister is worse and that you are at cotehouse in the mournful office of comforter to your brother god keep us from idle dreams life has enough of real pains  i wrote to captain wordsworth to get me some bang the captain in an affectionate letter answers me the bang if possible shall be sent if any country ship arrives i shall certainly get it we have not got anything of the kind in our china ships if you would rather wait till it can be brought by captain wordsworth himself from china give me a line that i may write and tell him we shall hope for a letter from you tonight i need not say dear wedgwood how anxious i am to hear the particulars of your health and spirits  pooles account of his conversations etc in france are very interesting and instructive if your inclination lead you hither you would be very comfortable here but i am ready at an hours warning ready in heart and mind as well as in body and moveables  i am dear wedgwood most truly yours  s t

it was in the north indeed it is much better i have no fears but if you fear that my health being what you know it to be the inconveniences of my being with you will be greater than the advantages i feel no reluctance in telling you so 1 it is so entirely an affair of spirits and feeling that the conclusion must be made by you not in your reason but purely in your spirit and feeling sorry indeed should i be to know that you had gone abroad with one to whom you were comparatively indifferent sorry if there should be no one with you who could with fellowfeeling and general likemindedness yield you sympathy in your sunshiny moments dear wedgwood my heart swells within me as it were i have no other wish to accompany you than what arises immediately from my personal attachment and a deep sense in my own heart that let us be as dejected as we will a week together cannot pass in which a mind like yours would not feel the want of affection or be wholly torpid to its pleasurable influences i cannot bear to think of your going abroad with a mere travelling companion with one at all influenced by salary or personal conveniences you will not suspect me of flattering you but indeed dear wedgwood you are too good and too valuable a man to deserve to receive attendance from a hireling even for a month together in your present state  if i do not go with you i shall stay in england only such time as may be necessary for me to raise the travelling money and go immediately to the south of france i shall probably cross the pyrenees to bilboa see the country of biscay and cross the north of spain to perpignan and so on to the north of italy and pass my next winter at nice i have every reason to believe that i can live even as a traveller as cheap as i can in england god bless you i will repeat no professions even in the superscription of a letter you know me and that it is my serious simple wish that in everything respecting me you would think altogether of yourself and nothing of me and be assured that no resolve of yours however suddenly adopted or however nakedly communicated will give me any pain any at least arising from my own bearings  yours ever  s t coleridge

who has received a very kind invitation from your brother john in a letter of last monday and which was repeated in last nights letter goes with me i hope in the full persuasion that you will be there at cotehouse before he be under the necessity of returning home poole is a very very good man i like even his incorrigibility in little faults and deficiencies it looks like a wise determination of nature to let well alone  are you not laying out a scheme which will throw your travelling in italy into an unpleasant and unwholesome part of the year from all i can gather you ought to leave this country at the first of april at the latest but no doubt you know these things better than i if i do not go with you it is very probable we shall meet somewhere or other at all events you will know where i am and i can come to you if you wish it and if i go with you there will be this advantage that you may drop me where you like if you should meet any frenchman italian or swiss whom you liked and who would be pleasant and profitable to you but this we can discuss at gunville  as to 1 i never doubted that he means to fulfil his engagements with you but he is one of those weak moralled men

and i concluded was the mistake or carelessness of the servant who had put the letter into the post office instead of the coach office i should have been indignant if dear poole had not set me laughing on opening it it contained my letter from gunville and a small parcel of bang from purkis i will transcribe the parts of his letter which relate to it   brentford feb 7 1803  my dear coleridge  i thank you for your letter and am happy to be the means of obliging you immediately on the receipt of yours i wrote to sir joseph banks who i verily believe is one of the most excellent and useful men of this country requesting a small quantity of bang and saying it was for the use of mr t wedgwood i yesterday received the parcel which i now send accompanied with a very kind letter and as part of it will be interesting to you and your friend i will transcribe it the bang you ask for is the powder of the leaves of a kind of hemp that grows in the hot climates it is prepared and i believe used in all parts of the east from morocco to china in europe it is found to act very differently on different constitutions some it elevates in the extreme others it renders torpid and scarcely observant of any evil that may befal them in barbary it is always taken if it can be procured by criminals condemned to suffer amputation and it is said to enable those miserables to bear the rough operations of an unfeeling executioner more than we europeans can the keen knife of our most skilful chirurgeons this it may be necessary to have said to my friend mr t wedgwood whom i respect much as his virtues deserve and i know them well i send a small quantity only as i possess but little if however it is found to agree i will instantly forward the whole of my stock and write without delay to barbary from whence it came for more  sir joseph adds in a postscript it seems almost beyond a doubt that the nepenthe was a preparation of the bang known to the ancients   now i had better take the small parcel with me to gunville if i send it by the post besides the heavy expense i cannot rely on the stowey carriers who are a brace of as careless and dishonest rogues as ever had claims on that article of the hemp and timber trade called the gallows indeed i verily believe that if all stowey ward excepted does not go to hell it will be by the supererogation of pooles sense of honestycharitable  we will have a fair trial of bang do bring down some of the hyoscyamine pills and i will give a fair trial of opium henbane and nepenthe bythebye i always considered homers account of the nepenthe as a banging lie  god bless you my dear friend and  st coleridge 1  footnote 1 letter cxxxvi follows 118   the last four letters were written from stowey whither coleridge had gone on a visit to poole  during the same period some events had taken place which changed the aspect of things he had become acquainted with william sotheby the poet translator of homer and wieland to whom he communicated in long letters his views on wordsworths theory of poetic diction indicating a widening divergence from his brother poet he had also made for the satisfaction of sotheby a translation in blank verse of gessners erste schiffer which has been lost letters 369401 he had likewise paraphrased one of gessners idylls published as the picture of the lovers resolution in the morning post of 6th september 1802 dejection an ode the hymn before sunrise and the beautiful dramatic fragment the night scene are the last products of coleridges chilled poetic imagination a third edition 1803 of the early poems was issued under the superintendence of lamb ainger i 199206 he had made a second tour in wales in company with tom wedgwood in november and december 1802 letters 410417 returning to find that sara had been born on 23rd december 1802 in august 1803 coleridge went on tour to scotland with the wordsworths letters 451 and dorothy wordsworths journal it is impossible for us to give all the correspondence of this busy mental period but on 4th june 1803 coleridge writes to godwin      letter 119 to godwin  saturday night june 4 1803  greta hall keswick  my dear godwin  i trust that my dear friend c lamb will have informed you how seriously ill i have been i arrived at keswick on good friday caught the influenza have struggled on in a series of convalescence and relapse the disease still assuming new shapes and symptoms and though i am certainly better than at any former period of the disease and more steadily convalescent yet it is not mere low spirits that makes me doubt whether i shall ever wholly surmount the effects of it i owe then explanation to you for i quitted town with strong feelings of affectionate esteem towards you and a firm resolution to write to you within a short time after my arrival at my home during my illness i was exceedingly affected by the thought that month had glided away after month and year after year and still had found and left me only preparing for the experiments which are to ascertain whether the hopes of those who have hoped proudly of me have been auspicious omens or mere delusions and the anxiety to realize something and finish something has no doubt in some measure retarded my recovery i am now however ready to go to the press with a work which i consider as introductory to a system though to the public it will appear altogether a thing by itself i write now to ask your advice respecting the time and manner of its publication and the choice of a publisher i entitle it  organum vera organum or an instrument of practical reasoning in the business of real life 1 to which will be prefixed 1 a familiar introduction to the common system of logic namely that of aristotle and the schools 2 a concise and simple yet full statement of the aristotelian logic with reference annexed to the authors and the name and page of the work to which each part may be traced so that it may be at once seen what is aristotles what porphyrys what the addition of the greek commentators and what of the schoolmen 3 an outline of the history of logic in general   1st chapter the origin of philosophy in general and of logic speciatim   2d chap of the eleatic and megaric logic   3d chap of the platonic logic   4th chap of aristotle containing a fair account of the greek   orhganonof which dr reid in kaimes sketches of man has given   a most false and not only erroneous but calumnious statementin as   far as the account had not been anticipated in the second part of my   work namely the concise and simple yet full etc etc   5th chap a philosophical examination of the truth and of the value of   the aristotelian system of logic including all the afteradditions to   it   6th chap on the characteristic merits and demerits of aristotle and   plato as philosophers in general and an attempt to explain the fact   of the vast influence of the former during so many ages and of the   influence of platos works on the restoration of the belles lettres   and on the reformation   7th chap raymund lully   8th chap peter ramus   9th chap lord bacon or the verulamian logic both chap examination   of the same and comparison of it with the logic of plato in which i   attempt to make it probable that though considered by bacon himself   as the antithesis and the antidote of plato it is bona fide the   same and that plato has been misunderstood2   10th chap descartes   11th chap condillac and a philosophical examination of his logic   ie the logic which he basely purloined from hartley then follows my own organum vera organum which consists of a greek eustaema of all possible modes of true probable and false reasoning arranged philosophically ie on a strict analysis of those operations and passions of the mind in which they originate or by which they act with one or more striking instances annexed to each from authors of high estimation and to each instance of false reasoning the manner in which the sophistry is to be detected and the words in which it may be exposed  the whole will conclude with considerations of the value of the work or its practical utility in scientific investigations especially the first part which contains the strictly demonstrative reasonings and the analysis of all the acts and passions of the mind which may be employed to the discovery of truth in the arts of healing especially in those parts that contain a catalogue etc of probable reasoning lastly to the senate the pulpit and our law courts to whom the wholebut especially the latter threefourths of the work on the probable and the falsewill be useful and finally instructive how to form a commonplace book by the aid of this instrument so as to read with practical advantage and supposing average talents to ensure a facility and rapidity in proving and in computing i have thus amply detailed the contents of my work which has not been the labour of one year or of two but the result of many years meditations and of very various reading the size of the work will printed at thirty lines a page form one volume octavo 500 pages to the volume and i shall be ready with the first half of the work for the printer at a fortnights notice now my dear friend give me your thoughts on the subject would you have me to offer it to the booksellers or by the assistance of my friends print and publish on my own account if the former would you advise me to sell the copyright at once or only one or more editions can you give me a general notion what terms i have a right to insist on in either case and lastly to whom would you advise me to apply phillips is a pushing man and a book is sure to have fair play if it be his property and it could not be other than pleasant to me to have the same publisher with yourself but now if there be anything of impatience that whether truth and justice ought to follow that but you will inform me it is not my habit to go to work so seriously about matters of pecuniary business but my ill health makes my life more than ordinarily uncertain and i have a wife and three little ones if your judgment leads you to advise me to offer it to phillips would you take the trouble of talking with him on the subject and give him your real opinion whatever it may be of the work and of the powers of the author  when this book is fairly off my hands i shall if i live and have sufficient health set seriously to work in arranging what i have already written and in pushing forward my studies and my investigations relative to the omne scibile of human naturewhat we are and how we become what we are so as to solve the two grand problemshow being acted upon we shall act how acting we shall be acted upon but between me and this work there may be death  i hope your wife and little ones are well i have had a sick family at one time every individualmaster mistress children and servantswere all laid up in bed and we were waited on by persons hired from the town for the week but now all are well i only excepted if you find my paper smell or my style savour of scholastic quiddity you must attribute it to the infectious quality of the folio on which i am writingnamely scotus erigena de divisione naturae the forerunner by some centuries of the schoolmen i cherish all kinds of honourable feelings towards you and i am dear godwin  yours most sincerely  s t coleridge  footnote 1 extant in ms see athenaeum 26th october 1895  footnote 2 see the friend bohn library pp 319345     you know the high character and present scarcity of tuckers light of nature i have found in this writer says paley in his preface to his moral and political philosophy more original thinking and observation upon the several subjects he has taken in hand than in any other not to say in all others put together his talent also for illustration is unrivalled but his thoughts are diffused through a long various and irregular work and a friend of mine every way calculated by his taste and private studies for such a work1 is willing to abridge and systematize that work from eight to two volumesin the words of paley to dispose into method to collect into heads and articles and to exhibit in more compact and tangible masses what in that otherwise excellent performance is spread over too much surface i would prefix to it an essay containing the whole substance of the first volume of hartley entirely defecated from all the corpuscular hypothesis with more illustrations i give my name to the essay likewise i will revise every sheet of the abridgment i should think the character of the work and the above quotations from so high an authority with the present public i mean as paley would ensure its success if you will read or transcribe and send this to mr phillips or to any other publisher longman and rees excepted you would greatly oblige me that is to say my dear godwin you would essentially serve a young man of profound genius and original mind who wishes to get his sabine subsistence by some employment from the booksellers while he is employing the remainder of his time in nursing up his genius for the destiny which he believes appurtenant to it qui cito facit bis facit impose any task on me in return 2  footnote 1 hazlitt the abridgment was made and published in 1807  footnote 2 letter cxxxvii follows 119    godwin published his life of chaucer in 1803 the next letter refers to this work     letter 120 to godwin  friday july 10 1803  greta hall  my dear godwin  your letter has this moment reached me and found me writing for stuart to whom i am under a positive engagement to produce three essays by the beginning of next week to promise therefore to do what i could not do would be worse than idle and to attempt to do what i could not do well from distraction of mind would be trifling with my time and your patience if i could convey to you any tolerably distinct notion of the state of my spirits of late and the train or the sort of my ideas consequent on that state you would feel instantly that my nonperformance of the promise is matter of regret with me indeed but not of compunction it was my full intention to have prepared immediately a second volume of poems for the press but though the poems are all either written or composed excepting only the conclusion of one poem equal to four days common work and a few corrections and though i had the most pressing motives for sending them off yet after many attempts i was obliged to give up the very hopethe attempts acted so perniciously on my disorder  wordsworth too wished and in a very particular manner expressed the wish that i should write to him at large on a poetic subject which he has at present sub malleo ardentem et ignitum i made the attempt but i could not command my recollections it seemed a dream that i had ever thought on poetry or had ever written it so remote were my trains of ideas from composition or criticism on composition these two instances will in some manner explain my nonperformance but indeed i have been very ill and that i have done anything in any way is a subject of wonder to myself and of no causeless selfcomplacency yet i am anxious to do something which may convince you of my sincerity by zeal and if you think that it will be of any service to you i will send down for the work i will instantly give it a perusal con amore and partly by my reverential love of chaucer and partly from my affectionate esteem for his biographer the summer too bringing increase of health with it i doubt not that my old mind will recur to me and i will forthwith write a series of letters containing a critique on chaucer and on the life of chaucer by w godwin and publish them with my name either at once in a small volume or in the morning post in the first instance and republish them afterwards  the great thing to be done is to present chaucer stripped of all his adventitious matter his translations etc to analyse his own real productions to deduce his province and his rank then to compare him with his contemporaries or with immediate prede and suc cessors first as an englishman and secondly as a european then with spenser and with shakespeare between whom he seems to stand midway with however a manner of his own which belongs to neither with a manner and an excellence lastly to compare dante and chaucer and inclusively spenser and shakespere with the ancients to abstract the characteristic differences and to develop the causes of such differences for instance in all the writings of the ancients i recollect nothing that strictly examined can be called humour yet chaucer abounds with it and dante too though in a very different way thus too the passion for personifications and me judice strong sharp practical good sense which i feel to constitute a strikingly characteristic difference in favour of the feudal poets as to information i could give you a critical sketch of poems written by contemporaries of chaucer in germany an epic to compare with his palamon and tales with his tales descriptive and fanciful poems with those of the same kind in our own poet in short a life of chaucer ought in the work itself and in the appendices of the work to make the poet explain his age and to make the age both explain the poet and evince the superiority of the poet over his age i think that the publication of such a work would do your work some little service in more ways than one it would occasion necessarily a double review of it in all the reviews and there is a large class of fashionable men who have been pleased of late to take me into high favour and among whom even my name might have some influence and my praises of you weight but let me hear from you on the subject  now for my own business as soon as you possibly can do something respecting the abridgment of tucker1 do so you will on my honour be doing good in the best sense of the word of course i cannot wish you to do anything till after the 24th unless it should be put in your way to read that part of the letter to phillips  as to my own work let me correct one or two conceptions of yours respecting it i could no doubt induce my friends to publish the work for me but i am possessed of facts that deter me i know that the booksellers not only do not encourage but that they use unjustifiable artifices to injure works published on the authors own account it never answered as far as i can find in any instance and even the sale of a first edition is not without objections on this scoreto this however i should certainly adhere and it is my resolution but i must do something immediately now if i knew that any bookseller would purchase the first edition of this work as numerous as he pleased i should put the work out of hand at once totus in illo but it was never my intention to send one single sheet to the press till the whole was bona fide ready for the printerthat is both written and fairly written the work is half written out and the materials of the other half are all in paper or rather on papers i should not expect one farthing till the work was delivered entire and i would deliver it at once if it were wished but if i cannot engage with a bookseller for this i must do something else first which i should be sorry for your division of the sorts of works acceptable to booksellers is just and what has been always my own notion or rather knowledge but though i detailed the whole of the contents of my work so fully to you i did not mean to lay any stress with the bookseller on the first half but simply state it as preceded by a familiar introduction and critical history of logic on the work itself i meant to lay all the stress as a work really in request and nonexistent either well or illdone and to put the work in the same class with guthrie and books of practical instructionfor the universities classes of scholars lawyers etc etc its profitable sale will greatly depend on the pushing of the booksellers and on its being considered as a practical book organum vere organum a book by which the reader is to acquire not only knowledge but likewise power i fear that it may extend to seven hundred pages and would it be better to publish the introduction of history separately either after or before god bless you and all belonging to you and your chaucer all happiness to you and your wife  ever yours s t c  ps if you read to phillips any part of my letter respecting my own work or rather detailed it to him you would lay all the stress on the practical  footnote 1 godwin exerted himself actively in the matter as appears by the correspondence of charles lamb  the ambitious scheme of the letters to godwin did not exhaust coleridges projects at this season to southey he wrote      letter 121 to southey 1  keswick july 1803  my dear southey   i write now to propose a scheme or rather a rude outline of a scheme of your grand work what harm can a proposal do if it be no pain to you to reject it it will be none to me to have it rejected i would have the work entitled bibliotheca britannica or an history of british literature bibliographical biographical and critical the two last volumes i would have to be a chronological catalogue of all noticeable or extant books the others be the number six or eight to consist entirely of separate treatises each giving a critical bibliobiographical history of some one subject i will with great pleasure join you in learning welsh and erse and you i turner and owen might dedicate ourselves for the first half year to a complete history of all welsh saxon and erse books that are not translations that are the native growth of britain if the spanish neutrality continues i will go in october or november to biscay and throw light on the basque  let the next volume contain the history of english poetry and poets in which i would include all prose truly poetical the first half of the second volume should be dedicated to great single names chaucer and spenser shakespeare milton and taylor dryden and pope the poetry of witty logicswift fielding richardson sterne i write par hasard but i mean to say all great names as have either formed epochs in our taste or such at least as are representative and the great object to be in each instance to determine first the true merits and demerits of the books secondly what of these belong to the agewhat to the author quasi peculium the second half of the second volume should be a history of poetry and romances everywhere interspersed with biography but more flowing more consecutive more bibliographical chronological and complete the third volume i would have dedicated to english prose considered as to style as to eloquence as to general impressiveness a history of styles and manners their causes their birthplaces and parentage their analysis  these three volumes would be so generally interesting so exceedingly entertaining that you might bid fair for a sale of the work at large then let the fourth volume take up the history of metaphysics theology medicine alchemy common canon and roman law from alfred to henry vii in other words a history of the dark ages in great britain the fifth volumecarry on metaphysics and ethics to the present day in the first half the second half comprise the theology of all the reformers in the fourth volume there would be a grand article on the philosophy of the theology of the roman catholic religion in this fifth volume under different nameshooker baxter biddle and foxthe spirit of the theology of all the other parts of christianity the sixth and seventh volumes must comprise all the articles you can get on all the separate arts and sciences that have been treated of in books since the reformation and by this time the book if it answered at all would have gained so high a reputation that you need not fear having whom you liked to write the different articlesmedicine surgery chemistry etc etc navigation travellers voyagers etc etc if i go into scotland shall i engage walter scott to write the history of scottish poets tell me however what you think of the plan it would have one prodigious advantage whatever accident stopped the work would only prevent the future good not mar the past each volume would be a great and valuable work per se then each volume would awaken a new interest a new set of readers who would buy the past volumes of course then it would allow you ample time and opportunities for the slavery of the catalogue volumes which should be at the same time an index to the work which would be in very truth a pandect of knowledge alive and swarming with human life feeling incident by the bye what a strange abuse has been made of the word encyclopaedia it signifies properly grammar logic rhetoric and ethics and metaphysics which last explaining the ultimate principles of grammarlog rhet and ethformed a circle of knowledge    to call a huge unconnected miscellany of the omne scibile in an arrangement determined by the accident of initial letters an

father paid a short visit to london the chief purpose of which was to negotiate with messrs longman and rees respecting the management of a bibliotheca britannica upon a very extensive scale to be arranged chronologically and made a readable book by biography criticism and connecting chapters to be published like the cyclopaedia in parts     southey to s t coleridge esq  bristol aug 3 1803  dear coleridge  i meant to have written sooner but those little units of interruption and preventions which sum up to as ugly an aggregate as the items in a lawyers bill have come in the way   your plan is too good too gigantic quite beyond my powers if you had my tolerable state of health and that love of steady and productive employment which is now grown into a necessary habit with me if you were to execute and would execute it it would be beyond all doubt the most valuable work of any age or any country but i cannot fill up such an outline no man can better feel where he fails than i do and to rely upon you for whole quartos dear coleridge the smile that comes with that thought is a very melancholy one and if edith saw me now she would think my eyes were weak again when in truth the humour that covers them springs from another cause  for my own comfort and credit and peace of mind i must have a plan which i know myself strong enough to execute i can take author by author as they come in their series and give his life and an account of his works quite as well as ever it has yet been done i can write connecting paragraphs and chapters shortly and pertinently in my way and in this way the labour of all my associates can be more easily arranged  and after all this is really nearer the actual design of what i purport by a bibliotheca than yours would bea book of reference a work in which it may be seen what has been written upon every subject in the british language this has elsewhere been done in the dictionary form whatever we get better than that formponemus lucro 1

dear wedgwood  i reached home on yesterday noon william hazlitt is a thinking observant original man of great power as a painter of characterportraits and far more in the manner of the old painters than any living artist but the objects must be before him he has no imaginative memory so much for his intellectuals his manners are to ninetynine in one hundred singularly repulsive browhanging shoecontemplatingstrange sharp seemed to like him but sharp saw him only for half an hour and that walking he is i verily believe kindlynatured is very fond of attentive to and patient with children but he is jealous gloomy and of an irritable pride with all this there is much good in him he is disinterested an enthusiastic lover of the great men who have been before us he says things that are his own in a way of his own and though from habitual shyness and the outside of bear skin at least of misanthropy he is strangely confused and dark in his conversation and delivers himself of almost all his conceptions with a forceps yet he says more than any man i ever knew you yourself only excepted of that which is his own in a way of his own and often times when he has warmed his mind and the juice is come out and spread over his spirits he will gallop for half an hour together with real eloquence he sends wellfeathered thoughts straight forward to the mark with a twang of the bowstring if you could recommend him as a portrait painter i should be glad to be your companion he is in my opinion utterly unfit his own health is fitful  i have written as i ought to do to you most freely you know me both head and heart and i will make what deductions your reasons may dictate to me i can think of no other person for your travelling companionwhat wonder for the last years i have been shy of all new acquaintance     to live beloved is all i need   and when i love i love indeed   i never had any ambition and now i trust i have almost as little vanity  for five months past my mind has been strangely shut up i have taken the paper with the intention to write to you many times but it has been one blank feelingone blank idealess feeling i had nothing to saycould say nothing how dearly i love you my very dreams make known to me i will not trouble you with the gloomy tale of my health when i am awake by patience employment effort of mind and walking i can keep the fiend at arms length but the night is my hellsleep my tormenting angel three nights out of four i fall asleep struggling to lie awake and my frequent nightscreams have almost made me a nuisance in my own house dreams with me are no shadows but the very calamities of my life     in the hope of drawing the gout if gout it should be into my feet i walked previously to my getting into the coach at perth 263 miles in eight days with no unpleasant fatigue and if i could do you any service by coming to town and there were no coaches i would undertake to be with you on foot in seven days i must have strength somewhere my head is indefatigably strong my limbs too are strong but acid or not acid gout or not gout something there is in my stomach     to diversify this dusky letter i will write an epitaph which i composed in my sleep for myself while dreaming that i was dying to the best of my recollection i have not altered a word     here sleeps at length poor col and without screaming   who died as he had always lived a dreaming   shot dead while sleeping by the gout within   alone and all unknown at enbro in an inn   it was tuesday night last at the black bull edinburgh yours dear wedgwood gratefully and

must be 1803 is to miss cruikshank of nether stowey the penelope referred to is penelope poole the cousin of tom poole    letter 123 to miss cruikshank  no date supposed to be 18031  my dear miss cruikshank  with the kindest intentions i fear you have done me some little disservice in borrowing the first edition of my poems from miss b i never held any principles indeed of which considering my age i have reason to be ashamed the whole of my public life may be comprised in eight or nine months of my 22nd year and the whole of my political sins during that time consisted in forming a plan of taking a large farm in common in america with other young men of my age a wild notion indeed but very harmless  as to my principles they were at all times decidedly antijacobin and antirevolutionary and my american scheme is a proof of this indeed at that time i seriously held the doctrine of passive obedience though a violent enemy of the first war afterwards and for the last ten years of my life i have been fighting incessantly in the good cause against french ambition and french principles and i had mr addingtons suffrage as to the good produced by my essays written in the morning post in the interval of the peace of amiens and the second war together with my two letters to mr fox 2  of my former errors i should be no more ashamed than of my change of body natural to increase of age but in that first edition there was inserted without my consent a sonnet to lord stanhope in direct contradiction equally to my then as to my present principles a sonnet written by me in ridicule and mockery of the bloated style of french jacobinical declamation and inserted by biggs the fool of a printer in order forsooth that he might send the book and a letter to earl stanhope who to prove that he was not mad in all things treated both book and letter with silent contempt i have therefore sent mr pooles second edition and if it be in your power i could wish you to read the dedication to my brother at the beginning to lady e perceval to obtain whose esteem so far at least as not to be confounded with the herd of vulgar mob flatterers i am not ashamed to confess myself solicitous  i would i could be with you and your visitors penelope you know is very high in my esteem with true warmth of heart she joins more strength of understanding and to steady principle more variety of accomplishments than it has often been my lot to meet with among the fairer sex when i praise one woman to another i always mean a compliment to both my tenderest regards to your dear mother whom i really long to spend a few hours with and believe me with sincere good wishes  yours etc  s t coleridge 3  footnote 1 dated 1807 in early recollections  footnote 2 it appears from sir james macintoshs life published by his son that a diminution of respect towards sir james was entertained by mr fox arising from the above two letters of mr coleridge which appeared in the morning post some enemy of sir james had informed mr fox that these two letters were written by macintosh and which exceedingly wounded his mind before the error could be corrected mr fox died this occurrence was deplored by sir james in a way that showed his deep feeling of regret but which as might be supposed did not prevent him from bearing the amplest testimony to the social worth and surpassing talents of that great statesman mr coleridges bristol friends will remember that once mr fox was idolized by him as the paragon of political excellence and mr pitt depressed in the same proportion note by cottle  footnote

124 to thomas wedgwood  16 abingdon street westminster jan 1804  my dear friend  some divines hold that with god to think and to create are one and the same act if to think and even to compose had been the same as to write with me i should have written as much too much as i have written too little the whole truth of the matter is that i have been very very ill your letter remained four days unread i was so ill what effect it had upon me i cannot express by words it lay under my pillow day after day i should have written forty times but as it often and often happens with me my heart was too full and i had so much to say that i said nothing i never received a delight that lasted longer upon mebrooded on my mind and made it pregnant than from the six last sentences of your last letterwhich i cannot apologize for not having answered for i should be casting calumnies against myself for for the last six or seven weeks i have both thought and felt more concerning you and relating to you than of all other men put together  somehow or other whatever plan i determined to adopt my fancy goodnatured pander of our wishes always linked you on to it or i made it your plan and linked myself on i left my home december 20 1803 intending to stay a day and a half at grasmere and then to walk to kendal whither i had sent all my clothes and viatica from thence to go to london and to see whether or no i could arrange my pecuniary matters so as leaving mrs coleridge all that was necessary to her comforts to go myself to madeira having a persuasion strong as the life within me that one winter spent in a really warm genial climate would completely restore me wordsworth had as i may truly say forced on me a hundred pounds in the event of my going to madeira and stuart had kindly offered to befriend me during the days and affrightful nights of my disease when my limbs were swollen and my stomach refused to retain the foodtaken in in sorrow then i looked with pleasure on the scheme but as soon as dry frosty weather came or the rains and damps passed off and i was filled with elastic health from crown to sole then the thought of the weight of pecuniary obligation from so many people reconciled me but i have broken off my story  i stayed at grasmere mr wordsworths a month three fourths of the time bedriddenand deeply do i feel the enthusiastic kindness of wordsworths wife and sister who sat up by me one or the other in order to awaken me at the first symptoms of distressful feeling and even when they went to rest continued often and often to weep and watch for me even in their dreams i left them january the 14th and have spent a very pleasant week at dr cromptons at liverpool and arrived in london at pooles lodgings last night at eight oclock  though my right hand is so much swollen that i can scarcely keep my pen steady between my thumb and finger yet my stomach is easy and my breathing comfortable and i am eager to hope all good things of my health that gained i have a cheering and i trust prideless confidence that i shall make an active and perseverant use of the faculties and requirements that have been entrusted to my keeping and a fair trial of their height depth and width indeed i look back on the last four months with honest pride seeing how much i have done with what steady attachment of mind to the same subject and under what vexations and sorrows from without and amid what incessant sufferings so much of myself when i know more i will tell you more  i find you are still at cotehouse poole tells me you talk of jamaica as a summer excursion if it were not for the voyage i would that you would go to madeira for from the hour i get on board the vessel to the time that i once more feel england beneath my feet i am as certain as past and present experience can make me that i shall be in health in high health and then i am sure not only that i should be a comfort to you but that i should be so without diminution of my activity or professional usefulness briefly dear wedgwood i truly and at heart love you and of course it must add to my deeper and moral happiness to be with you if i can be either assistance or alleviation if i find myself so well that i defer my madeira plan i shall then go forthwith to devonshire to see my aged mother once more before she dies and stay two or three months with my brothers but wherever i am i never suffer a day except when i am travelling to pass without doing something  poole made me promise that i would leave one side for him god bless him he looks so worshipful in his office among his clerks that it would give you a few minutes good spirits to look in upon him pray you as soon as you can command your pen give me half a score lines and now that i am loose say

idle for me to say to you that my heart and very soul ache with the dull pain of one struck down and stunned i write to you for my letter cannot give you unmixed pain and i would fain say a few words to dissuade you what good can possibly come of your plan will not the very chairs and furniture of your room be shortly more far more intolerable to you than new and changing objects more insufferable reflectors of pain and weariness of spirit oh most certainly they will you must hope my dearest wedgwood you must act as if you hoped despair itself has but that advice to give you have you ever thought of trying large doses of opium a hot climate keeping your body open by grapes and the fruits of the climate is it possible that by drinking freely you might at last produce the gout and that a violent pain and inflammation in the extremities might produce new trains of motion and feeling in your stomach and the organs connected with the stomach known and unknown worse than what you have decreed for yourself cannot well happen say but a word and i will come to you will be with you will go with you to malta to madeira to jamaica or if the climate of which and its strange effects i have heard wonders true or not to egypt  at all events and at the worst even if you do attempt to realize the scheme of going to and remaining at gunville for gods sake my dear dear friend do keep up a correspondence with one or more or if it were possible for you with several i know by a little what your sufferings are and that to shut the eyes and stop up the ears is to give ones self up to storm and darkness and the lurid forms and horrors of a dream i scarce know why it is a feeling i have and which i can hardly understand i could not endure to live if i had not a firm faith that the life within you will pass forth out of the furnace for that you have borne what you have borne and so acted beneath such pressureconstitutes you an awful moral being i am not ashamed to pray aloud for you

direct apology as my promise was wholly conditional this i did not only from general foresight but from the possibility of hearing from you that you had not been able to untie your former engagement to you therefore i owe the apology and on you i expressly and earnestly desired tobin to call and to explain for me that i had been in an utterly incompatible state of bodily feeling the whole evening at mr rennys that i was much hurt by the walk home through the wet instantly on my return here had an attack in my bowels that this had not wholly left me and therefore that i could not come unless the weather altered by which i did not mean merely its holding up though even this it did not do at four oclock at barnards inn the sleety rain was still falling though slightly but the drying up of the rawness and dampness which would infallibly have diseased me before i had reached the institutionnot to mention the effect of sitting a long evening in damp clothes and shoes on an invalid scarcely recovered from a diarrhoea i have thought it fit to explain at large both as a mark of respect to you and because i have very unjustly acquired a character for breaking engagements entirely from the nonsympathy of the well with the sick the robust with the weakly it must be difficult for most men to conceive the extreme reluctance with which i go at all into company and the unceasing depression which i am struggling up against during the whole time i am in it which too often makes me drink more during dinner than i ought to do and as often forces me into efforts of almost obtrusive conversation acting the opposite of my real state of mind in order to arrive at a medium as we roll paper the opposite way in order to smoothe it  be so good as to tell me what hour you

12 oclock  my dear  sir thomas browne is among my first favorites rich in various knowledge exuberant in conceptions and conceits contemplative imaginative often truly great and magnificent in his style and diction though doubtless too often big stiff and hyperlatinistic thus i might without admixture of falsehood describe sir t browne and my description would have only this fault that it would be equally or almost equally applicable to half a dozen other writers from the beginning of the reign of elizabeth to the end of charles ii he is indeed all this and what he has more than all this peculiar to himself i seem to convey to my own mind in some measure by sayingthat he is a quiet and sublime enthusiast with a strong tinge of the fantastthe humourist constantly mingling with and flashing across the philosopher as the darting colours in shot silk play upon the main dye in short he has brains in his head which is all the more interesting for a little twist in the brains he sometimes reminds the reader of montaigne but from no other than the general circumstances of an egotism common to both which in montaigne is too often a mere amusing gossip a chitchat story of whims and peculiarities that lead to nothingbut which in sir thomas browne is always the result of a feeling heart conjoined with a mind of active curiositythe natural and becoming egotism of a man who loving other men as himself gains the habit and the privilege of talking about himself as familiarly as about other men fond of the curious and a hunter of oddities and strangenesses while he conceived himself with quaint and humourous gravity a useful inquirer into physical truth and fundamental sciencehe loved to contemplate and discuss his own thoughts and feelings because he found by comparison with other mens that they too were curiosities and so with a perfectly graceful and interesting ease he put them too into his museum and cabinet of varieties in very truth he was not mistakenso completely does he see every thing in a light of his own reading nature neither by sun moon nor candle light but by the light of the faery glory around his own head so that you might say that nature had granted to him in perpetuity a patent and monopoly for all his thoughts read his hydriotaphia above alland in addition to the peculiarity the exclusive sirthomasbrowneness of all the fancies and modes of illustration wonder at and admire his entireness in every subject which is before himhe is totus in illo he follows it he never wanders from itand he has no occasion to wanderfor whatever happens to be his subject he metamorphoses all nature into it in that hydriotaphia or treatise on some urns dug up in norfolkhow earthy how redolent of graves and sepulchres is every line you have now dark mould now a thighbone now a scull then a bit of mouldered coffin a fragment of an old tombstone with moss in its hic jaceta ghost or a winding sheetor the echo of a funeral psalm wafted on a november wind and the gayest thing you shall meet with shall be a silver nail or gilt anno domini from a perished coffin top the very same remark applies in the same force to the interesting though the far less interesting treatise on the quincuncial plantations of the ancients there is the same attention to oddities to the remotenesses and minutiae of vegetable termsthe same entireness of subject you have quincunxes in heaven above quincunxes in earth below and quincunxes in the water beneath the earth quincunxes in deity quincunxes in the mind of man quincunxes in bones in the optic nerves in roots of trees in leaves in petals in every thing in short first turn to the last leaf of this volume and read out aloud to yourself the last seven paragraphs of chap v beginning with the words more considerables etc but it is time for me to be in bed in the words of sir thomas which will serve you my dear as a fair specimen of his mannerbut the quincunx of heaventhe hyades or five stars about the horizon at midnight at that timeruns low and tis time we close the five ports of knowledge we are unwilling to spin out our waking thoughts into the phantasmes of sleep which often continueth precogitationsmaking tables of cobwebbes and wildernesses of handsome groves to keep our eyes open longer were but to act our antipodes the huntsmen are up in america and they are already past their first sleep in persia think you my dear friend that there ever was such a reason given before for going to bed at midnightto wit that if we did not we should be acting the part of our antipodes and then the huntsmen are up in americawhat life what fancydoes the whimsical knight give us thus a dish of strong green tea and call it an opiate i trust that you are quietly asleep     and that all the stars hang bright above your dwelling   silent as tho they watched the sleeping earth 1    s t coleridge  footnote 1 from dejection an ode the lady of the later version of which was sarah hutchinson see knights life of wordsworth ii 86  coleridge now wrote to tom wedgwood of his determination to go to malta stoddart his old friend had invited him thither      letter 128 to thomas wedgwood  24 march 1804  my dear friend  though fearful of breaking in upon you after what you have written to me i could not have left england without having written both to you and your brother at the very moment i received a note from sharp informing me that i must instantly secure a place in the portsmouth mail for tuesday and if i could not that i must do so in the light coach for tuesdays early coach  i am agitated by many things and only write now because you desired an answer by return of post i have been dangerously ill but the illness is going about and not connected with my immediate ill health however it may be with my general constitution it was the choleramorbus but for a series of the merest accidents i should have been seized in the streets in a bitter east wind with cold rain at all events have walked through it struggling it was sundaynight  i have suffered it at tobins tobin sleeping out at woolwich no fire no wine or spirits or medicine of any kind and no person being within call but luckily perhaps the occasion would better suit the word providentially tuffin calling took me home with him    i tremble at every loud sound i myself utter but this is rather a history of the past than of the present i have only enough for memento and already on wednesday i consider myself in clear sunshine without the shadow of the wings of the destroying angel  what else relates to myself i will write on monday would to heaven you were going with me to malta if it were but for the voyage with all other things i could make the passage with an unwavering mind but without cheerings of hope let me mention one thing lord cadogan was brought to absolute despair and hatred of life by a stomach complaint being now an old man the symptoms as stated to me were strikingly like yours excepting the nervous difference of the two characters the flittering fever etc he was advised to reduce lean beef to a pure jelly by papins digester with as little water as could secure it from burning and of this to take half a wine glass 10 or 14 times a day this and nothing else he did so sir george beaumont saw within a few weeks a letter from himself to lord st asaph in which he relates the circumstance of his perseverence in it and rapid amelioration and final recovery i am now he says in real good health as good and in as cheerful spirits as i ever was when a young man  may god bless you even here  s t coleridge   before coleridge left for malta humphry davy wrote the following beautiful letter to coleridge and coleridge replied in a letter equally beautiful in its selfportraiture   royal institution twelve oclock monday  my dear coleridge  my mind is disturbed and my body harassed by many labours yet i cannot suffer you to depart without endeavouring to express to you some of the unbroken and higher feelings of my spirit which have you at once for their cause and object  years have passed since we first met and your presence and recollections in regard to you have afforded me continued sources of enjoyment some of the better feelings of my nature have been elevated by your converse and thoughts which you have nursed have been to me an eternal source of consolation  in whatever part of the world you are you will often live with me not as a fleeting idea but as a recollection possessed of creative energyas an imagination winged with fire inspiring and rejoicing  you must not live much longer without giving to all men the proof of power which those who know you feel in admiration perhaps at a distance from the applauding and censuring murmurs of the world you will be best able to execute those great works which are justly expected from you you are to be the historian of the philosophy of feeling do not in any way dissipate your noble nature do not give up your birthright  may you soon recover perfect healththe health of strength and happiness may you soon return to us confirmed in all the powers essential to the exertion of genius you were born for your country and your native land must be the scene of your activity i shall expect the time when your spirit bursting through the clouds of ill health will appear to all men not as an uncertain and brilliant flame but as a fair and permanent light fixed though constantly in motionas a sun which gives its fire not only to its attendant planets but which sends beams from all its parts into all worlds  may blessings attend you my dear friend do not forget me we live for different ends and with different habits and pursuits but our feelings with regard to each other have i believe never altered they must continue they can have no natural death and i trust they can never be destroyed by fortune chance or accident  h davy     letter 129 to davy  sunday march 25 1804  my dear davy  i returned from mr northcotes having been diseased by the change of weather too grievously to permit me to continue sitting for in those moods of body brisk motion alone can prevent me from falling into distempered sleep i came in meditating a letter to you or rather the writing of the letter which i had meditated yesterday even while you were yet sitting with us but it would be the merest confusion of my mind to force it into activity at present yours of this morning must have sunken down first and must have found its abiding restingplace o dear friend blessed are the moments and if not moments of humility yet as distant from whatever is opposite to humility as humility itself when i am able to hope of myself as you have dared hope of and for me alas they are neither many nor of quick recurrence there is a something an essential something wanting in me i feel it i know itthough what it is i can but guess i have read somewhere that in the tropical climates there are annuals as lofty and of as an ample girth as forest treesso by a very dim likeness i seem to myself to distinguish power from strengthand to have only the former but of this i will speak again for if it be no reality if it be no more than a disease of my mind it is yet deeply rooted and of long standing and requires help from one who loves me in the light of knowledge i have written these lines with a compelled understanding my feelings otherwhere at workand i fear unwell as i am to indulge my 1 deep emotion however ennobled or endeared dear davy i have always loved always honoured always had faith in you in every part of my being that lies below the surface and whatever changes may have now and then rippled even upon the surface have been only jealousies concerning you in behalf of all men and fears from exceeding great hope i cannot be prevented from uttering and manifesting the strongest convictions and best feelings of my nature by the incident that they of whom i think so highly esteem me in return and entertain reciprocal hopes no i would to god i thought it myself even as you think of me but  so far had i written my dear davy yesterday afternoon with all my faculties beclouded writing mostly about myselfbut heaven knows thinking wholly about you i am too sad too much dejected to write what i could wish of course i shall see you this evening here at a quarter after nine when i mentioned it to sir george too late said he no if it were twelve oclock it would be better than his not coming they are really kind and good sir george and lady beaumont sir george is a remarkably sensible man which i mention because it is somewhat remarkable in a painter of genius who is at the same time a man of rank and an exceedingly amusing companion  i am still but very indifferentbut that is so old a story that it affects me but little to see you look so very unwell on saturday was a new thing to me and i want a word something short of affright and a little beyond anxiety to express the feeling that haunted me in consequence  i trust that i shall have time and the greater spirit to write to you from portsmouth a part at least of what is in and upon me in my more genial moments  but always i am and shall be my dear davy with hope and esteem and affection the aggregate of many davys  your sincere friend  s t coleridge
