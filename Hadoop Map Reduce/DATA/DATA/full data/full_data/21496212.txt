21496212	the prince and the page  by charlotte m yonge     preface    in these days of exactness even a childs historical romance must point to what the french term its pieces justficatives  we own that ours do not lie very deep  the picture of simon de montfort drawn by his wifes own household books as quoted by mrs everett green in her lives of the princesses and that of edward i in cartes history and more recently in the greatest of the plantagenets furnished the two chief influences of the story  the household accounts show that earl simon and eleanor of england had five sons henry fell with his father at evesham  simon and guy deeply injured his cause by their violence and after holding out kenilworth against the prince retired to the continent where they sacrilegiously murdered henry son of the king of the romansa crime so much abhorred in italy that dante represents himself as meeting them in torments in the inferno not however before guy had become the founder of the family of the counts of monforte in the maremma richard the fourth son appears in the household books as possessing dogs and having garments bought for him but his history has not been traced after his mother left england  the youngest son amaury obtained the hereditary french possessions of the family and continued the line of montfort as a french subject  eleanor the only daughter called the demoiselle de montfort married as is well known the last native prince of wales and died after a few years  the adventure of edward with the outlaw of alton wood is one of the stock anecdotes of history and many years ago the romance of the encounter led the author to begin a tale upon it in which the outlaw became the protector of one of the proscribed family of montfort the commencement was placed in one of the manuscript magazines which are so often the amusement of a circle of friends  it was not particularly correct in its details and the hero bore the peculiarly improbable name of wilfred by which he has since appeared in the monthly packet  the story slept for many years in ms until further reading and thought had brought stronger interest in the period and for better or for worse it was taken in hand again joinville together with the authorities quoted by sismondi assisted in picturing the arrival of the english after the death of st louis and the murder of henry of almayne is related in all crusading histories but for simons further career and for his implication in the attempt on edwards life at acre the author is alone responsible taking refuge in the entire uncertainty that prevails as to the real originator of the crime and perhaps an apology is likewise due to dante for having reversed his doom  for the latter part of the story the old ballad of the blind beggar of bethnal green gives the framework  that ballad is believed to be elizabethan in date and the manners therein certainly are scarcely accordant with the real thirteenth century and still less with our notions of the days of chivalry  some liberties therefore have been taken with it the chief of them being that bessee is not permitted to go forth to seek her fortune in the inn at romford and the readers are entreated to believe that the alteration was made by the traditions which repeated henry de montforts song  it was the late hugh millar who alleged that the huge stone under which edward sleeps in westminster abbey agrees in structure with no rocks nearer than those whence the mighty stones of the temple at jerusalem were hewn and there is no doubt that earth and stones were frequently brought by crusaders from the holy land with a view to the hallowing of their own tombs  the author is well aware that this tale has all the incorrectnesses and inconsistencies that are sure to attend a historical tale but the dream that has been pleasant to dream may be pleasant to listen to and there can be no doubt that in spite of all inevitable faults this style of composition does tend to fix young peoples interest and attention on the scenes it treats of and to vivify the characters it describes and if this sketch at all tends to prepare young peoples minds to look with sympathy and appreciation on any of the great characters of our early annals it will have done at least one work  december 12th 1865    chapter ithe stately hunter    now who are thou of the darksome brow   who wanderest here so free oh im one that will walk the green green woods   nor ever ask leave of thees m  a fine eveningsix centuries agoshed a bright parting light over alton wood illuminating the gray lichens that clung to the rugged trunks of the old oak trees and shining on the smoother bark of the graceful beech with that sidelong light that towards evening gives an especial charm to woodland scenery  the long shadows lay across an open green glade narrowing towards one end where a path nearly lost amid dwarf furze crested heather and soft bentgrass led towards a hut rudely constructed of sods of turf and branches of trees whose gray crackling foliage contrasted with the fresh verdure around  there was no endeavour at a window nor chimney but the door of wattled boughs was carefully secured by a long twisted withe  a halbert a broken arrow a deerskin pegged out on the ground to dry a bundle of faggots a bare and blackened patch of grass strewn with wood ashes were tokens of recent habitation though the reiterations of the nightingale the deep tones of the blackbird and the hum of insects were the only sounds that broke the stillness  suddenly the silence was interrupted by a clear loud ringing whistle repeated at brief intervals and now and then exchanged for the callleonillo  leon  a footstep approached rapidly overtaken and passed by the rushing gallop of a large animal and there broke on the scene a large tawny hound prancing bounding and turning round joyfully pawing the air and wagging his tail in welcome to the figure who followed him  this was a youth thirteen years old wearing such a dress as was usual with forestersnamely a garment of homespun undyed wool reaching to the knee and there met by buskins of deerskin with the dappled hair outside but the belt which crossed one shoulder was clasped with gold and sustained a dagger whose hilt and sheath were of exquisite workmanship  the cap on his head was of gray rabbit skin but a herons plume waved in it the dark curling locks beneath were carefully arranged and the port of his head and shoulders the mould of his limbs the cast of his features and the fairness of his complexion made his appearance ill accord with the homeliness of his garb  in one hand he carried a bow over his shoulder in the other he held by the ears a couple of dead rabbits with which he playfully tantalized the dog holding them to his nose and then lifting them high aloft while the hound perfectly entering into the sport leapt high after them with open mouth and pretended to seize them then bounded and careered round his young master with gay short barks till both were out of breath and the boy flinging the rabbits on the turf threw himself down on it with one arm upon the neck of the panting dog whose great gasps like a sobbing of laughter heaved his whole frame   ay good leonillo take your rest said the boy  we have done yeomans service today and shown ourselves fit to earn our own livelihood  we are outlaws now my lion of the pyrenees and you at least lead a merrier life than in the castle halls when we hunted for sport and not for sustenance  welladay my leonas the creature closed his mouth and looked wistfully up at him with almost human sympathy and intelligencewould that we knew where are all that were once wont to go with us to the chase  but for them i would be well content to be a bold forester all my days  better so than to be ever vexed and crossed in every design for the countrys wealdistrusted abovebetrayed beneath  alack alack my noble father why wert thou wrecked in every hopein every aim  these murmurings were broken off as leonillo suddenly crested his head and changed his expression of repose for one of intense listening  already exclaimed the boy springing to his feet as leonillo bounded forward to meet a stout hardy forester who was advancing from the opposite end of the glade  this was a man of the largest and most sinewy mould his face tanned by sun and wind to a uniform hard ruddy brown and his shaggy black hair untrimmed as well as his dark bristly beard  his jerkin was of rough leather crossed by a belt sustaining sword and dagger a bow and arrows were at his back a huge quarterstaff in his hand and his whole aspect was that of a ferocious outlaw whose hand was against every man  but the youth started towards him gleefully as if the very sight of him had dispelled all melancholy musings and shouted merrily welcomewelcome adam  why so early home  have the alton boors turned surly or are the kings prickers abroad and the neighbourhood unwholesome for bold clerks of st nicholas  worse was the gruff mutter in reply  down leon  i am in no mood for thy freaks  what is it adam  have the keepers carried their complaints to the king of the venison we have consumed with small thanks to him  prince edward is at alton  what think you of that sir  come to seek through copse and brake for the arrant deerstealer and outlaw and all his gang  why theres preferment for you said the boy laughing  high game for the heir of the throne  and his gang  hold up your head leonillo  you and i come in for a share of the honour  hold up your head said the outlaw bitterly  you may chance to hold it as high as your fathers is for all your gibes and jests my young lord if the longshanks gets a hold of you which our lady forefend  nay i think better of my cousin longshanks  i loved him well when i was his page at hereford  he was tenderer to me than ever my brothers were and i scarce think he would hang draw and quarter me now  you may try if you are not the better guided  how did you hear these tidings inquired the boy changing his mood to a graver one  from the monk to whom you confessed a fortnight back  did you let him know your lineage  how could i do otherwise  he looked like a man who would keep a secret and yet  shameshame to doubt the good father  nay i do not say that i do but i would have the secret in as few mens power as may be  nevertheless i thank the good brother  he called out to me as he saw me about to enter the town that if i had any tenderness for my own life i had best not show myself there and he went on to tell me how the prince was come to his huntinglodge with hawk and hound indeed but for the following of men rather than bird or beast  and what would you have me do  be instantly on the way to the coast ere the search begins and there either for love of sir simon the righteous or for that gilt knife of yours we may get ferried over to the isle of wight whence but what ails the dog  whist leonillo  hold your throat  i can hear naught but your clamour  the hound was in fact barking with a tremendous lionlike note and when on reiterated commands from his master and the outlaw he changed it for a low continuous growling like distant thunder a step and a rustling of the boughs became audible  they are upon us already cried the boy snatching up and stringing his bow  leave me to deal with him returned the outlaw  off to alton the good father will receive you to sanctuary  fleenever cried the boy  you teaching my fathers son to flee  tushtis but one said the outlaw  he is easily dealt with and he shall have no time to call his fellows  so saying the forester strode forward into the wood where a tall figure was seen through the trees and with uplifted quarterstaff dealt a blow of sudden and deadly force as soon as the stranger came within its sweep totally without warning  the power of the stroke might have felled an ox and would have at once overthrown the new comer but that he was a man of unusual stature and this being unperceived in the outlaws haste the blow lighted on his left shoulder instead of on his head  ha caitiff he exclaimed and shortening the huntingpole in his hand he returned the stroke with interest but the outlaw had already prepared himself to receive the blow on his staff  for some seconds there was a rapid exchange and all that the boy could detect in the fierce flourish of weapons was that his champion was at least equally matched  the height of the stranger was superior and his movements if less quick and violent had an equableness that showed him a thorough master of his weapon  but ere the lad had time to cross the heather to the scene of action the fight was over the outlaw lay stunned and motionless on the ground and the gigantic stranger was leaning on his huntingpole regarding him with a grave unmoved countenance the fair skin of which was scarcely flushed by the exertion  spare him spare him cried the boy leaping forwards  i am the prey you seek  well met my young lord was the stern reply  you have found yourself a worthy way of life and an honourable companion  honourable indeed if faithfulness be honour replied the boy myself i yield sir but spare him if yet he liveso adam my only friend he sobbed as kneeling over him he raised his head undid his collar and parted the black locks to seek for the mark of the blow whence blood was fast oozing  he liveshe will do well enough said the hunter  now tell me boywhat brought you here  the loving fidelity of this man was the prompt reply a poitevin a falconer at kenilworth who found me sore wounded on the field at evesham and ever since has tended me as never vassal tended lord and nownow hath he indeed died for me and the boy endeavouring to raise the inanimate form dropped heavy tears on the senseless face  true rigidly spoke the hunter though there was somewhat of a quivering of the muscles of the cheek discernible amid the curls of his chestnut beard  robbery is not the wonted service demanded of retainers  poor adam said the youth with a flash of spirit at least he never stripped the peaceful homestead and humble farmer like the royal purveyors  hayoung rebel exclaimed the hunter  know you what you say  i reck not replied the boy  you have slain my father and my brothers and now you have slain my last and only friend  do as you will with meonly for my mothers sake let it not be a shameful death and let my sister eleanor have my poor leonillo  and let me too leave this gold with the priest of alton that my truehearted loving adam may have fit burial and masses  i tell thee boy he is in no more need of a burial than thou or i i touched him warily  herehis face more to the air  and the stranger bent down and with his powerful strength lifted the heavy form of adam so that the boy could better support him  then taking some wine from the huntingflask slung to his own shoulder he applied some drops to the bruise  the smart produced signs of life and the hunter put his flask into the boys hand saying give him a draught and then he put his finger to his own lips and stood somewhat apart  adam opened his eyes and made some inarticulate murmurs then the liquor being held to his lips he drank and with fresh vigour raised himself  the boywhere is he  what has chanced  is it you sir  where is the rogue  fled the villain  we shall have the prince upon us next  i must after him and cut his story short  your hand sir  nay adamyour hurt  a broken head  tush tis naught  here your hand  canst not lend a hand to help a man up in your own service he added testily as stiff and dizzy he sat up and tried to rise  you might have sent an arrow to stop his traitorous tongue but there is no help in you he added provoked at seeing a certain embarrassment about the youth desert me at this pinch  it is not like his fathers son and he was sinking back when at sight of the hunter he stumbled eagerly to his feet but only to stagger against a tree  you are my prisoner said the calm deep voice  well and good said adam surlily  but let the lad go free  he is a yeomans son who came but to bear me company  and learn thy trade  goodly lessons in falling unawares on the kings huntsmen and sending arrows after them  fair breeding in sooth repeated the stranger standing with his arms crossed upon his mighty breadth of chest and looking at adam with a still grave commanding blue eye that seemed to pierce him and hold him down as it were and a countenance whose youthfulness and perfect regularity of feature did but enhance its exceeding severity of expression you know the meed of robbery and murder  a halter and a bough said adam readily  well and good but i tell thee that concerns not the boysince he added bitterly he is too meek and tender so much as to lift a hand in his own cause he has never crossed the laws  i understand you friend said the hunter  he is a valued charge maybe the son of one of the traitor barons  take my adviceyield him to the kings justice and secure your own pardon  out miscreant shouted adam and was about to spring at him again but the powerful arm collared him and he recognized at once that he was like a child in that grasp  he ground his teeth with rage and muttered that a fellow with such thews should give such dastardly counsel and he yonder not lift a finger to aid  wilt follow me composedly demanded the stranger with hands free or must i bind them  follow replied adam ruefully looking at the boy with eyes full of reproachay follow to any gallows thou wiltand the nearest tree were the best  come on  i have no warrant returned the grave hunter  tush what warrant is needed for hanging a wellknown outlawmade so by the princes tender mercies  the prince will thank thee man for ridding the realm of the robber who fell on the treasurer bearing the bags from leicester  and meanwhile with uncouth cunning adam was striving to telegraph by winks and gestures to the boy who had so grievously disappointed him that the moment of his own summary execution would be an excellent one for his companions escape  but the eye so steady yet so quick under its somewhat drooping eyelid detected the simple stratagem  i trow the prince might thank me more for bringing in this charge of thine  small thanks i trow for laying hands on a poor orphanthe son of a poitevin manatarmsthat i kept with me for love of his father though he is fitter for a convent than the green wood added adam with the same sound of keen reproach and disappointment in his voice  that shall we learn at guildford replied the stranger  there are means of teaching a man to speak  none that will serve with me stoutly responded adam  that shall we see was the brief answer  and he signed to his prisoners to move on before him taking care so to interpose his stately person between them that there should be no communication by word far less by look    chapter iithe lady of the forest    behold how mercy softeneth still   the haughtiest heart that beats pride with disdain may he answered again   but pardon at once defeatss m  the socalled forest was in many parts mere open heath thickly adorned by the beautiful purple ling blending into a rich carpet with the dwarf furze and backed by thickets of trees in the hollows of the ground  across this wild country the tall forester conducted his captives in silencemoving along with a pace that evidently cost him so little exertion and was so steady and even that his companions might have supposed it slow had they only watched it and not been obliged to keep up with it  light of foot as the youth was he was at times reduced to an almost breathless run and adam plodded along with strides that worked his arms and shoulders in sympathy  after about three miles when the boy was beginning to feel as if he must soon be in danger of lagging they came into a dip of the ground where stood a long low irregular building partly wood and partly stone roofed with shingle in some parts in others with heather the last addition a deep porch still retained the fresh tints of the bark on the timber sides and the purple of the ling that roofed it  sheds and outhouses surrounded it dogs in couples horses grooms and foresters were congregated in the background but around this new porch were gathered a troop of peasant women children and aged men  the fine bald brow and profile of the old peasant the eager face of the curlyhaired child the worn countenance of the hard tasked mother were all uplifted towards the doorway in which stood slightly above them a lady with two long plaited flaxen tresses descending on her shoulders under a black silken veil that disclosed a youthful countenance full of pure calm loveliness of a simple but dignified and devotional expression that might have befitted an angel of charity  a priest and a lady were dispensing loaves and warm garments to the throng around but each gift was accompanied by a gentle word from the lady framed with difficulty to their homely english tongue but listened to even by uncomprehending ears like a strain of church music  adam had expected the forester to turn aside to the group of servants but in blank amazement saw him lead the way through the poor at the gate and advancing to the porch with a courteous bending of his head he said in the soft provencalfar more familiar than english to adams earshast room for another suppliant mi dona  the sweet fair face lighted up with a sudden sunbeam of joy and a musical voice replied  welcome my dearest lord  much did i need thee to hear the plaints of some of these thy lieges which my ears can scarce understand  but why art thou alone or rather why thus strangely accompanied  these are the captives won by my single arm whom according to all laws of chivalry thine own true knight thus lays at thy feet fair lady mine to be disposed of at thine own gracious will and pleasure  and a smile of such sweetness lightened his features that a murmur of blessings on his comely face ran through the assembly and adam indulged in a gruff startled murmur of tis the prince or the devil himself while his young master comprehending the gesture of the prince and overborne by the lovely winning graces of the princess stepped forward doffing his cap and bending his knee and signing to adam to follow his example  thou hast been daring peril again said the princess holding her husbands arm and looking up into his face with lovingly reproachful yet exulting eyes  yet i will not be troubled  naught is danger to thee  and yet alone and unarmed to encounter such a sturdy savage as i see yonder  but there is blood on his brow  let his hurt be looked to ere we speak of his fate  he is at thy disposal mi dona returned edward  thou art the judge of both and shall decide their lot when thou hast heard their tale  it can scarce be a very dark one replied eleanor or thou wouldst never have led them to such a judge  then turning to the prisoners she began to say in her foreign english follow the good father friends when she broke off at fuller sight of the boys countenance and exclaimed in provencal i know the like of that face and mien  truly dost thou know it her husband replied but peace till thou hast cleared thy present court and we can be privatefollow the priest he added and await the princesss pleasure  they obeyed and the priest led them through a sidedoor through which they could still hear eleanors sweet castillian voice laying before her husband her difficulties in comprehending her various petitioners  the priest being english was hardly more easily understood than his flock and her lady spoke little but langue doui the northern french which was as little serviceable in dealing with her spanish and provencal as with the rude westsaxon english  edwards deep manly tones were to be heard however now interrogating the peasants in their own tongue now briefly interpreting to his wife in provencal and a listener could easily gather that his hand was as bounteous his heart as merciful as hers save where attacks on the royal game had been requited by the trouble complained of and that in such cases she pleaded in vain  the captives whom her husband had surrendered to her mercy had been led into a great long low hall with rudelytimbered sides and rough beams to the roof with a stone floor and great open fire over which a mancook was chattering french to his bewildered english scullion  an oak table and settles on either side of it ran the whole length of the hall and here the priest bade the two prisoners seat themselves  they obeyedthe boy slouching his cap over his face averting it and keeping as far as possible from the group of servants near the fire  the priest called for bread meat and beer to be set before them and after a moments examination of adams bruise applied the simple remedy that was all it required and left them to their meal  adam took this opportunity to growl in an undertone does he there know you  the reply was a nod of assent and you knew him  another nod and then the boy looking heedfully round added in a quick undertone not till you were down  then he helped me to restore you  you forgive me adam now and he held out his hand and wrung the rugged one of the forester  what should i forgive  poor lad you could not have striven in the longshanks grasp  i was a fool not to guess how it was when i saw you not knowing which way to look  hush broke in the youth with uplifted hand as a page of about his own age came daintily into the hall gathering his green robe about him as if he disdained the neighbourhood and holding his head high under his jaunty tall feathered cap  outlaws he said speaking english but with a strong foreign accent and as if it were a great condescension the gracious princess summons you to her presence  follow me  the colour rushed to the boys temples and a retort was on his lips but he struggled to withhold it and likewise speaking english said i would we could have some water and make ourselves meeter for her presence  scarce worth the pains returned the page  as if thou couldst ever be meet for her presence  she had rather be rid of thee promptly than wait to be regaled with thy mayday braverieshonest lad  again the answer was only restrained with exceeding difficulty and there was a scornful smile on the young prisoners cheek that caused the page to exclaim angrily what means that insolence malapert boy  but there was no time for further strife for the door was pushed open and the princes voice called hamlyn de valence why tarry the prisoners  only sir returned hamlyn that this young robber is offended that he hath not time to deck himself out in his last stolen gold chain to gratify the princess  peace hamlyn returned the prince  thou speakest thou knowest not whatcome hither boy he added laying his hand on his young captives shoulder and putting him through the door with a familiarity that astonished hamlynall the more when he found that while both prisoners were admitted he himself was excluded  princess eleanor was alone in another chamber of the sylvan lodge hung with tapestry representing hunting scenes the floor laid with deerskins and deers antlers projecting from the wall to support the feminine properties that marked it as her special abode  she was standing when they entered and was turning eagerly with outstretched hand and face of recognition when prince edward checked her by saying nay the cause is not yet tried and placing her in a large carved oaken chair where she sat with a lilylike grace and dignity half wondering but following his lead he proceeded sit thou there fair dame and exercise thy right as judge of the two captives whom i place at thy feet  and you my lord she asked  i stand as their accuser said edward  advance prisonersnow most fair judge what dost thou decree for the doom of adam de gourdon rebel first and since that the terror of our royal fathers lieges the robber of his treasurers the rifler of our cousin pembrokes jewellery the slayer of our deer  alas my lord why put such questions to me said eleanor imploringly unless as i would fain hope thou dost but jest  do i speak jest gourdon said edward regarding adam with a lion like glance  tis all true growled adam  and proceeded the prince if thy gentle lips refuse to utter the doom merited by such deeds what wilt thou say to hear that not content with these traitorous deeds of his own he fosters the treason of others  here stands a young rebel who would have perished at evesham but for the care and protection of this gourdon who healed his wounds guarded him robbed for him for him spurned the offer of amnesty and finally set on thine own husband in alton woodall to shelter yonder young traitor from the hands of justice speak the sentence he merits most just of judges  the sentence he merits said eleanor with swimming eyes  oh would that i were indeed monarch to dispense life or death  what he merits he shall have from my whole heartmine own poor esteem for his fidelity and our joint entreaties to the king for his pardon brave manthou shalt come with me to seek thy pardon from king henry  thanks lady said adam with rude courtesy but it were better to seek my young lords  my own dear young cousin exclaimed eleanor laying aside her assumed judicial power and again holding out her hands to him we deemed you slain  yes come hither said edward my jailer at herefordthe rebel who drew his maiden sword against his king and unclethe outlaw who would try whether leicester fits as well as huntingdon with a bandit life  what hast thou to say for thyself richard de montfort  that my fate be it what it may must not stand in the way of adams pardon said richard standing still without response to the princesss invitation  my lord you have spoken much of his noble devotion to me for my fathers sake but you know not the half of what he has done and dared for me  oh plead for him lady  plead for him said eleanor  that will i do with all my heart and well do i know that the good old king will weep with gratitude to him for having preserved the life of his young nephew  yes richard oft have we grieved for thee my husbands kind young companion in his captivity and mourned that no tidings could be gained of thee  it was not richard who replied to this winning address  he stood flushed irresolute with eyes resolutely cast down as if to avoid seeing the princesss sweet face  adam however spoke  then lady i am indeed beholden to you provided that the boy is safe  he is safe said prince edward  his age is protection sufficientmy young cousin thou art no outlaw  thine uncle will welcome thee gladly and a career is open to thee where thou mayst redeem the honour of thy name  the colour came with deeper crimson to the boys cheek as he answered in a choked voice my fathers name needs no redemption  simultaneously a pleading interjection from the princess and a warning growl from de gourdon admonished richard that he was on perilous ground but the prince responded in a tone of deep feeling well said richard  the term does not befit that worthy name  i should have said that i would fain help thee to maintain its honour my page once wilt thou be so again and one day my knightmy trusty baron  how can i said richard still in the same undertone subdued but determined  it was you who slew him and my brothers  nay nay exclaimed the princess  the poor boy thinks all his kindred are slain  and they are not cried richard raising his face with sudden animation  they are safe  thy brother henry died withwith the earl said eleanor but all the rest are safe and in france  and my mother and sister asked richard  they are likewise abroad said the prince  and richard thou art free to join them if thou wilt  but listen first to me  we tarry yet two days at this forest lodge  remain with us for that space thy name and rank unknown if thou wiltand if thou shalt still look on me as guilty of thy fathers death and not as a loving kinsman who honoured him deeply i will send thee safely to the coast with letters to my uncle the king of france  richard raised his head with a searching glance to see whether this were invitation or command  thou art my captive said eleanor softly coming towards him with a young matrons caressing manner to a boy whom she would win and encourage  not captive but guest said edward but richard perceived in the tones that no choice was left him as far as these two days were concerned    chapter iiialton lodge    ever were his sons hawtayn and bold for their vilanye bothe to knight and sweyn did they vilanye old ballad of simon de montforte  for the first time for many a month richard de montfort lay down to sleep in a pallet bed instead of a couch of heather but his heart was ill at ease  he was the fourth son of the great earl of leicester simon de montfort and for the earlier years of his life he had been under the careful training of the excellent chaplain adam de marisco a pupil and disciple of the great robert grostete bishop of lincoln  his elder brothers had early left this wholesome control pushed forward by the sad circumstances that finally drove their father to take up arms against the king and strangers to the noble temper that actuated him in his championship of the english people they became mere lawless rebelsfiercely profiting by his elevation not for the good of the people but for their own gratification  richard had been still a mere boy under constant control and being intelligent spirited and docile had been an especial favourite with his father  to him the great earl had been the model of all that was admirable wise and noble deeply religious just and charitable and perfect in all the arts of chivalry and accomplishments of peacea tender and indulgent father and a firm and wise head of a householdhe had been ardently loved and looked up to by the young son who had perhaps more in common with him by nature than any other of the family  wrongs and injuries had been heaped upon montfort by the weak and fickle king who would far better have understood him if like the selfish kinsmen who encircled the throne he had struggled for his own advantage and not for the maintenance of the great charter richard was too young to remember the early days when his elder brothers had been companions almost on equal terms to their first cousins the kings sons his whole impression of his parents relations with the court was of injustice and perfidy from the king and his counsellors vehemently blamed by his mother and brothers but sometimes palliated by his father who almost always even at the worst pleaded the kings helplessness and prince edwards honourable intentions  understanding little of the rights of the case richard only saw his father as the maintainer of the laws and defender of the oppressed against covenant breakers and when the appeal to arms was at length made he saw the white cross assumed by his father and brothers in full belief that the war in defence of magna carta was indeed as sacred as a crusade and he had earnestly entreated to be allowed to bear arms but he had been deemed as yet too young and thus had had no share in the victory of lewes save the full triumph in it that was felt by all at kenilworth afterwards when sent to be prince edwards page at hereford he was prepared to regard his royal cousin as a ferocious enemy and was much taken by surprise to find him a graceful courtly knight peculiarly gentle in manner loving music romances and all chivalrous accomplishments and far from the pride and haughtiness that had been the theme of all the vassals who assembled at kenilworth he was gracious to all and distinguished his young page by treating him as a kinsman and favourite companion showing him indeed far more consideration than ever he had received from his unruly turbulent brothers  when edward had effected his escape and had joined the mortimers and clares richard had gone home where his expressions of affection for the prince were listened to by his father indeed with a well pleased though melancholy smile and an augury that one day his brave godson would shake off the old kings evil counsellors and show himself in his true and noble colouring  his brothers however laughed and chid any word about the princes kindness  edwards flattery and seduction they declared had won the young de clare from their cause  and in vain did their father assure them that they had lost the alliance of the house of gloucester solely by their own overbearing injusticea tyranny worse than had been exercised under the name of the king  with henry of winchester in their hands however theirs seemed the loyal cause and richard had by the influence of his elders been made ashamed of his regard for the prince and looked upon it as a treacherous rebellion when edward mustered his forces and fell upon leicester and his followers  his father had mournfully yielded to the boys entreaty to remain with him instead of being sent away with his mother and the younger ones for security  an honourable death said the earl might be better for him than an outlawed and proscribed life  and thus richard had heard his fathers exclamation on marking the wellordered advance of the royalists  they have learnt this style from me  now god have mercy on our souls for our bodies are the princes  and when henry his eldest son spoke words of confidence entreating him not to despair he had answered i do not my son but your presumption and the pride of thy brothers have brought me to this pass  i firmly believe i shall die for the cause of god and justice  richard had shared his fathers last communion received his last blessing and had stood beside him in the desperate ring which in true english fashion died on the field of battle but never was driven from it  since that time the boys life had been a wandering amid outlaws and peasantsall in one mind of bitter hatred to the court for its cruel vexations and oppressions and of intense love and regret for their champion sir simon the righteous of whose beneficence tales were everywhere told rising at every step into greater wonder until at length they were enhanced into miracles wrought by his severed head and hands  each day had made the boy prouder of his fathers memory more deeply incensed against the court party that had brought about his fall and keen and bitter were his feelings at finding himself in the hands of the prince himself he chafed all the more at feeling the ascendency which edwards lofty demeanour and personal kindness had formerly exerted over him reviving again by force of habit he hated himself for not having at once challenged his fathers murderer so as if he could not do more to have died by his hand and he despised himself the more for knowing that all he could have said would have been goodnaturedly put down by the prince all he could have done would have been but like a gnats efforts against that mighty strength  then how despicable it was to be sensible in spite of himself that this atmosphere of courtly refinement was far more natural to himthe son of a provencal noble and of a princess motherthan the rude forest life he had lately led  the greenwood liberty had its charms and he had truly loved adam de gourdon but the soft tones and refined accents were like a note of home to him and though he had never seen the princess beforeshe having been sent to the court of st louis during the troublesyet the whole of the interview gave him an inexplicable sense of being again among kindred and friends  he told himself that it was base resolved that he would show himself determined to cast in his lot with his exiled brethren and made up his mind to maintain a dignified silence during these two days and at the end of them to leave with the prince a challenge to be fought out when he should have attained manly strength and skill in arms  in pursuance of this resolution he appeared at the morning mass and meal still grave and silent and especially avoiding young hamlyn de valence who as the son of one of the half brothers of henry iii stood in the same relationship to prince edward and to richard whose mother was the sister of king henry  probably hamlyn had had a hint from the prince for though he regarded young montfort with no friendly eyes he yielded him an equality of precedence which hardly consorted with richards rude forest garments  the chase was the order of the day  the prince rode forth with a boar spear to hunt one of these monsters of the wood of which vague reports had reached him unconfirmed till adam de gourdon had undertaken to show him the creatures lair  he had proposed to richard to join the hunt but the boy firm to his resolution of accepting no favour from him that could be helped had refused as curtly as he could and then not without a feeling of disappointment had stood holding leonillo in as the gallant train of hunters rode down the woodland glade and he figured to himself the brave sport in which they would soon be engaged  the most part of the day was spent by him in lying under a tree with his dog by his side thinking over the scenes of his earlier life which had passed by his childish mind like those of a drama in which he had no part nor comprehension but which now with clearer perceptions he strove to recall and explain to himself  ever his fathers stately figure was the centre of his recollections whether receiving tidings of infractions of engagements taking prompt measures for action or striving to repress the violence of his sons and partizans or it might be gazing on his younger boys with sad anxiety  richard well remembered his saying when he heard that his sons simon and guy had been plundering the merchant ships in the channel  alas alas when i was more loyal to the law than to the crown i little deemed that i was rearing a brood who would scorn all law and loyalty  and well too did richard recollect that when the proposal had been made that he should become the attendant of the prince at hereford his father had told him that here he would see the mirror of all that was knightly and virtuous and had added on the loud outcry of the more prejudiced brothers  it is only the truth  were it not that the kings folly and his perjured counsellors had come between my nephew edward and his better self we should have in him a sovereign who might fitly be reckoned as a tenth worthy  it is his very duty to a misruled father that has ranged him against us  yet thought richard on the man who thus thought and spoke of him the prince could make savage warfare nay offer his senseless corpse foul despite  how can i tarry these two days in such keeping  i had ratherif he will still keep mebe a captive in his lowest dungeon than eat of his bread as a guest  by our lady i will tell him so to his face  i will none of his favours  alone i will go to the coast alone make my way to simon and guy with no letters to the french king  all kings however saintly they may be called are in league and make common cause as said my poor brother henry when the mise of lewes was to be laid before this frenchman  i will none of them pshaw is this the princess coming  i trust she will not see me  i want none of her fair words  he had prepared himself to be ungracious but his courtly breeding was too much of an instinct with him for him not to rise doff his cap and stand aside as eleanor of castille slowly moved towards the woodland path with her graceful spanish step followed but at some distance by two of her women  she turned as she was passing him and smiled with a sweet radiance that would have won him instantly had he not heard his elder brothers sneer at the cheap coin of royal smiles  he only bowed but leonillo was more accessible and started forward to pay his homage of dignified blandishments to the queenly sweetness that pleased his canine appreciation  richard was forced to step forth call him in and make his excuses but the princess responded by praises of the noble animal and caresses to which leonillo replied with a grand gratitude that showed him as nobly bred as his young master  thou art a gallant creature said eleanor her hand upon the proud head and no doubt as faithful as beautiful  faithful to the death lady replied richard warmly  he is thine own i trow said the princessnot thy grooms  i remember that when thy brave father brought my lord and me back from our bridal at burgos he procured two hounds in the pyrenees of meseems such a breed  true lady they were the parents of my leonillo said richard gratified in spite of himself  how well i remember continued eleanor that first sight of the great earl  my brothers had teased me for going so far north and told me the english were mere rude islandersboorish and unlettered but child as i was scarce eleven years old i could perceive the nobleness of the earl  if all thy new subjects be like him said my brother to me thou wilt reign over a race of kings and how good he was to me when i wept at leaving my home and friends how he framed his tongue to speak my own castillian to me how he comforted me when the queen my motherinlaw required more dignity of me than i yet knew how to assume and how he chid my boy bridegroom for showing scant regard for his girl bride said eleanor smiling at the recollection as the beloved wife of eleven years could well afford to do  i mind me well that he found me weeping because my edward had tied the scarf i gave him on the neck of one of those very dogs and the fatherly counsel he gave me  ah leonillo thy wise wistful face brings back many thoughts to my mind i am glad i may honour thee for fidelity  indeed you may lady said richard  it was he that above all saved my life  prithee let me hear said the princess who had already so moved on while herself speaking as to draw richard into walking with her along the path that had been cleared under the beech trees  we have so much longed to know thy fate  i cannot tell you much lady returned richard  the last thing i recollect on that dreadful day was that my father asked for quarter for usfor my brother henry and me  we heard the reply  no quarter for traitors and henry fell before us a dead man  my father shouted by the arm of st james it is time for me to die i saw him with his sword in both hands cut down a wild welshman who was rushing on me  then i saw no more till in the moonlight i was awakened by this dogs cool tongue licking the blood from my face and heard his low whining over me  good dog good dog murmured eleanor caressing the animal  and thou richard thou wert sorely wounded  sorely said richard my side had been pierced with a lance a welsh twohanded sword had broken through my helmet and wellnigh cleft my skull and the menatarms riding over me i suppose must have broken my leg for i could not move  and oh i felt it hard that i had yet to die  then lady came lights and murmuring voices they were mortimers plundering welsh robbers  i heard their wild gibbering tongue and i knew how it would be with me should they see the white cross on my breast  but lady leonillo stood over me his lion bark chased them aside and when one bolder than the rest came near the mound where we lay good leonillo flew at his savage throat  i heard the struggle as i laythe growls of the dog the howls of the man and then they were cut short  and next i heard de gourdons gruff voice commending the good hound whose note had led him to the spot from the woods where he was hiding after the battle  the faithful beast sprang from him and in a moment more had led him to me  thenah then lady when adam had freed me from my broken helm and lifted me in his arms what a sight had i  oh what a field that harvest moon shone upon how thickly heaped was that little mound  and there was my fathers face upturned in the white moonlight  o lady never in hall or bower could it have been so peaceful or so majestic  i bade adam lay me down by his side and keep guard through the night with leonillo but he said that the plunderers would come in numbers too great for him and that he must care for the living rather than the dead and withstand him as i would he bore me away  o lady lady foul wrong was done when we were gone  think not on that said eleanor it bitterly grieved my lord that so it should have been  thou knowest i hope that he was the chief mourner when those honoured limbs were laid in the holy ground at evesham abbey  they told me who saw him that day that his weeping for his godfather and his cousin henry overcame all joy in his victory  and i can assure thee dear richard that when three months after i came to him at canterbury just after he had been with thy mother at dover even then he was sad and mournful  he said that the wisest and best baron in england had been made a rebel of and then slain and he was full of sorrow for thee only then understanding from thy mother that thou hadst been in the battle at all and that nothing had been heard of thee  he said thou wert the most like to thy father of all his sons and truly i knew thee at once by thine eyes richard  where wast thou all these months  at first said richard i was in an anchorets cell in the wall of a church  so please you madame i must not name names but when adam bearing me faint and wellnigh dying on his back saw the twinkling light in the churchyard he knocked and entreated aid the good anchoret pitied my need at first and when he learnt my name he gave me shelter for my fathers sake the friend of all religious men  i lay on his little bed in the chamber in the wall till i could again walk  meanwhile adam watched in the woods at hand and from time to time came at night to see how i fared and bring me tidings  simon was still holding out kenilworth and we hoped to join him there but when we set forth i was still lame and too feeble to go far in a day and we fell in withwithin short with a band of robbers who detained us half as guests half as captives  they needed adams stout arm and there was a shrewd gray tough old fellow who had been in robin hoods band and was looked up to as a sort of prince among them who was bent on making us one with them  lady you would smile to hear how the old man used to sit by me as i lay on the rushes and talk of outlawry as father adam de marisco used to talk of learningas a good and noble science decaying for want of spirit and valour in these days  it was all laziness he said barons and princes must needs have their wars and use up all the stout men that were fit to bend a bow in a thicket  if the prince went on at this rate he said there would soon be not an honest outlaw to be found in england  but he was a kind old man and very good to me and he taught me how to shoot with the long bow better than ever our master at odiham could  however i could not brook the spoilers life and the band did not trust me so as we found that kenilworth had fallen as soon as my strength had returned to me we stole away from the outlaws and came southwards hoping to find my mother at odiham  hearing that odiham too was gone from us we have lurked in alton wood till means should serve us for reaching the coast  till thou hast found the friend who has longed for thee and sought for thee replied eleanor  what didst thou do young richard to win my husbands heart so entirely in his captivity  i know not lady why he should take thought for me bluntly said richard with a return of the sensation of being coaxed and talked over  methinks i can tell thee one cause returned the princess  was there not a time when thou didst overhear him concerting with thomas de clare the plan of an escape and thou didst warn them that thou wast at hand ay and yet didst send notice to thy father  yes answered richard with surprise i could do no other  even so said eleanor  and thus didst thou win the esteem of thy kinsman  the stripling is loyal and trustworthy he has said to me pity that such a heart should be pierced in an inglorious field would that i could find him and strive to return to him something of what his fathers care hath wrought for me  richard trust me it would be a real joy and lightening of his grief to have thee with him  grief madame repeated richard  i little thought he grieved for my father who but for him would be and a sob checked him as the contrast rose before him of the great earl and beautiful countess presiding over their large family and princely household and the scattered ruined state of all at present  he shall answer that question himself said eleanor  see here he comes to meet us by the beechwood alley  and in fact a form well suited to its setting within the stately aisles of the beech trees was pacing towards them  the chase had ended and hearing that his wife had walked forth into the wood the prince had come by another path to meet her and his rare and beautiful smile shone out as he saw who was her companion  art making friends with my young cousin he said affectionately  i would fain do so replied eleanor but alas my lord he feels that there is a long dark reckoning behind that stands in the way of our friendship  richard looked down and did not speak  the princess had put his thought into words  richard said the prince i feel the same  it is for that very cause that i seek to have thee with me  hear me  thou art grown older and hast seen mans work and mans sorrows since i left thee on the hillside at hereford  thou canst see perchance that a question hath two sidesthough it is not given to all men to do so hearken thenthy father was the greatest man i have knownnay but for the thought of my uncle of france i should say the holiest  he was my teacher in all knightly doings and in all kingly thoughts such as i pray may be with me through life  it was from him i learnt that this royal this noble power is not given to exalt ourselves but as a trust for the welfare of others  it was the spring of action that was with him through life  it was murmured richard calling to mind many a saying of his fathers  and fain would he have impressed it on all around added edward but there were others who deemed that kingly power was but a means of enjoyment and that restraint was an outrage on the crown  they drew one way the earl drew the other and as his noble nature prompted him made common cause with the injured  it skills not to go through the past  those whom he joined had selfish aims and pushed him on and as the crown had been led to invade the rights of the vassals so the vassals invaded my fathers rights  oaths were extorted though both sides knew they could never be observed and between violences now on one side now on the other the right course could scarce be kept  the earl imagined that with my father in his hands removed from all other influences he could give england the happy days they talk of her having enjoyed under my patron st edward but as thou knowest richard the authority he held being unlawful was unregarded and its worst transgressors came out of his own bosom  he could not enforce the terms on which i had yielded myselfhe could not even prevent my father from being a mere captive and for the english folk their miseries were but multiplied by the tyrants who had arisen  it was no doing of his said richard with cheek hotly glowing  none know that better than i said the prince but if he had snatched the bridle from a feeble hand it was only to find that the steed could not be ruled by him  what was left for me but to break my bonds and deliver my father in the hope that being come to mans estate i might set matters on a surer footing  i had hopedi had greatly hoped so to rule affairs that the earl might own that his training had not been lost on his nephew and that the crown might be trusted not to infringe the charter  i had hoped that he might yet be my wisest counsellor  but richard i too had supporters who outran my commands  bitter hatred and malice had been awakened and cruel resolves that none should be spared  when i returned from bearing my father bleeding and dismayed from the battle whither he had been cruelly led it was to find that my orders had been disobeyedthat there had been foul and cruel slaughter and that all my hopes that my uncle of leicester would forgive me and look friendly on me were ended  the princes lip trembled as he spoke and tears glistened in his eyes and the evident struggle to repress his feelings brought home deeply and forcibly the conviction to richard that his sorrow was genuine  he could not speak for some seconds then he added  i marvel not that i am looked on among you as guilty of his blood  simon and guy regard me as one with whom they are at deadly feud and cannot understand that it was their own excesses that armed those merciless hands against him  even my aunt shrank from me and implored my mercy as though i were a ruthless tyrant  but thou richard thou hast inherited enough of thy fathers mind to be able to understand how unwillingly was my share in his fall and how great would be my comfort and joy in being good kinsman to one of his sons  the strong mans generous pleading was most touching  richard bowed his head the princess watched him eagerly  the boy spoke at last in perplexity  my lord you know better than i  would it be knightly would it be honourable  the princess started in some indignation at such a question to her husband but edward understood the boy better and said that which is most christian is most knightly  then pausing  ask thine heart richard which would thy father choose for theeto live in such guidance as i hope will ever be found in my household or to share the wandering i fear me freebooting life of thy brothers  richard could not forget how his father had sternly withheld him from going with simon to besiege pevensey  he knew that these two brethren had long been a pain and grief to his father and began to understand that the nephew with whom the earls last battle had been fought was nevertheless his truest pupil  thou wilt remain said edward decisively and let us strive one day to bring to pass the state of things for which thy father and i fought alike though alas in opposite ranks  if my mother consents said richard his head bent down and uttering the words with the more difficulty because he felt so strongly drawn towards his cousin who never seemed so mighty as in his condescension  then richard de montfort said edward gravely let us render to one another the kiss of peace as kinsmen who have put away all thought of wrong between them  richard looked up and the prince bending his lofty head there was exchanged between them that solemn embrace which in the early middle ages was the deepest token of amity  and with that kiss it was as though the soul of richard de montfort were knit to the soul of edward of england with the heartwhole devotion composed of affection and loyal homage to a great character which ever since the days of the bond between the son of the doomed king of israel and the youthful slayer of the philistine champion has been one of the noblest passions of a young heart    chapter ivthe translation    now in gems their relics lie and their names in blazonry and their forms in storied panes gleam athwart their own loved fanes lyra innocentium  if novelty has its charms so has old age and to us the great abbey church of westminster has become doubly beloved by long generations of affection and doubly beautiful by the softening handiwork of time and of smoke  yet what a glorious sight must it not have been when it was fresh from the hands of the builder the creamy stone clear and sharp at every angle and each moulding and flower true and perfect as the chisel had newly left it  the deep archway of the west front opened in stately magnificence and yet with a light loftiness hitherto unknown in england and somewhat approaching to the style in which the great french cathedrals were then rising  and its accompaniments were on the one hand the palace and hall on the other hand the monastery with its high walled courts and deepbrowed cloisters its noble refectory and vaulted kitchen the herbarium or garden shady with trees and enriched with curious plants of palestine sloping down to the broad and majestic thames pure and blue as he pursued his silver winding way through emerald meadows and softly rising hills clothed with copses and woods  to the east seated upon her hills stood the crowned and battlemented city the massive white tower rising above the fortifications  the autumn brilliance of october 1269 never enlightened a more gorgeous scene than when it shone upon the ceremony still noted in our calendar as the translation of king edward  buried at first in his own lowbrowed heavyarched norman structure which he had built as he believed at the express bidding of st peter the confessor whose tenderhearted and devout nature had by force of contrast with those of his fierce foreign successors come to assume a saintly halo in the eyes not merely of the english but of their angevin lords themselves was now to reign on almost equal terms with the great apostle himself as one of the hallowing patrons of the abbeynay since at least his relics were entire and undoubted as its chief attraction  the new chapel in his especial honour behind the exquisite bayed apsidal chancel was at length complete and on this day he was to take possession of it  an ark of pure gold chased and ornamented with the surpassing grace of that period of perfect taste had received the royally robed corpse which churchmen averred lay calm and beautiful untainted by decay and this was now uplifted by the arms of king henry himself of richard king of the romans his brother and of the two princes edward and edmund  it was a striking sight to see those two pairs of brothers  the two kings nearly of an age and so fondly attached that they could hardly brook a separation till the death of the one broke the wearied heart of the other were both grayhaired prematurelyaged men of features that time instead of hardening had rendered more feeble and uncertain  their faces were much alike but henry might be known from richard by a certain inequality in the outline of his eyebrows and their dress though both alike wore long flowing gowns the side seams only coming down as far as the thigh so as to allow play for the limbs so far differed that henrys was of blue with the english lions embroidered in red and gold on his breast and richard was in the imperial purple or rather scarlet and the eagle of the empire on his breast testified to the futile election which he had purchased with the wealth of his cornish mines  both the elders together with all their best will and their simple faith in the availing merit of the action they were performing would have been physically incapable of proceeding many steps with their burden but for the support it received from the two younger men who sustained the feet of the saint using some dexterity in adapting their strength so that the coffin might be carried evenly  one was the hunter we have already seen in alton wood  his features wore their characteristic stamp of deep awe and enthusiasm and even as he slowly and calmly moved sustaining the chief of the weight with scarcely an effort of his giant strength his head towering high above all those around his eyes might be observed to be seeing though not marking what was before them but to be fixed as though the soul were in contemplation far far away  he did not see in the present scene four princes rendering homage to a royal saint who from personal connection and by a brilliant display of devotion might be propitiated into becoming a valuable patron amid intercessor still less did it present itself to him as a pageant in which he was to bow his splendid powers mental and bodily to aid two feebleminded old men to totter under the goldcased corpse of a still more foolish and mischievous prince dead two hundred years back  no rather thought and eye were alike upon the great invisible world the echo of whose chants might perchance be ringing on his ear that world where holy kings cast their crowns before the throne and where the lamblike spirit of the confessor might be joining in the praise and offering these tokens of honour to him to whom all honour and praise and glory and blessing are due  of shorter stature darker browed of less regular feature and less clear complexion so as to look as if he were the elder of the brothers prince edmund moved by his side using much exertion and bending with the effort so as to increase the slight sloop that had led to his historical nickname of the crouchback though some think this was merely taken from his crusading cross  he bore the arms of sicily to which he had not yet resigned his claim  his eye wandered but not far away like that of his brother  it was in search of his young betrothed the lady aveline of lancaster the fair young heiress to whom he was to owe the great earldom that was a fair portion for a younger brother even of royalty  all the four were barefooted and both princes were in robes much resembling that of their father except that upon the left shoulder of each might be seen in white cloth the two lines of the cross that marked them as pilgrims and crusaders already on the eve of departure for the holy land  the shrine where the golden coffin was to rest is substantially the same in our own day with its triplecusped arches below the stage of six and stage of four above them and the twisted columns in imitation of that which was supposed to have come from the beautiful gate of the temple  but at that time it was a glittering fabric of mosaic work in gold lapislazuli and precious stones aided here and there by fragments of coloured glass the only part of the costly workmanship that has come down to us  around this shrine the preceding members of the procession had taken their places archbishop boniface of savoy was there old age ennobling a countenance that once had been light and frivolous and all his bishops in the splendour of their richest copes solidly embroidered with absolute scenes and portraits in embroidery with tall mitres worked with gold wire and jewels and crosiers of beauteous workmanship in gold ivory and enamel  mitred abbots no less glorious in array stood in another rank the scarletmantled grand prior of the hospital and the whitecloaked templar made a link between the ecclesiastic and the warrior  priests and monks selected for their voices sake clustered in every available space and in full radiance on a stage on the further side were seated the ladies of the court mostly with their hair uncovered and surrounded by a garland of precious stones  queen eleanor of provence still bent on youthfulness looked somewhat haggard in this garb but it well became beatrix von falkmorite the young german girl whom richard king of the romans had wedded in his old age for the sake of her fair face  smiling plump and rosy she sat opening her wide blue eyes wearing her emerald and ruby wreath as though it had been a coronal of daisies and gazing with childish whisperings as she watched the movements of her king and clung for direction and help in her own part of the pageant to the princess eleanor who sat beside her little the elder in years less beautiful in colouring but how far surpassing her in queenly pensive grace and dignity leaning on eleanors lap was a brighteyed brighthaired boy of four years old watching with puzzled looks the brilliant ceremony which he only half understood and his glances wandering between his father and the blue and white robed little acolytes who stood nearest to the shrine holding by chains the silver censers which from time to time sent forth a fragrant vapour curling round the heads of the nearest figures and floating away in the lofty vaultings of the roof  the actual ceremony could only be beheld by a favoured few the official clergy the many connections of royalty and the chief nobility filled the church to overflowing but the rest of the world repaid itself by making a magnificent holiday  goodnatured king henry had been permitted by his son who had now though behind the scenes assumed the reins of government to spend freely and make a feast to his hearts content  roasting and boiling were going on on a fast and furious scale not only in the palace and abbey but in booths erected in the fields and tables were spreading and rushes strewing for the accommodation of all ranks  near the entrance of the abbey the trains of the personages within awaited their coming forth in some sort of order the more reverent listening to the sounds from within and bending or crossing themselves as the familiar words of higher notes of praise rose loud enough to reach their ears but for the most part the tones and gestures were as various as the appearance of the attendants  here were black benedictines there white augustinians clustered round the sleek mules of their abbots there scornful dark templars in their black and white sowed the seeds of hatred against their order and scarlet hospitaliers looked bright and friendly even while repelling the jostling of the crowd  a hoary old squire who had been with the king through all his troubles kept together his immediate attendants a party of boorishlooking germans waited for richard of cornwall and the slender richlycaparisoned palfreys of the ladies were in charge of highborn pages who sometimes with means fair or foul pushed back the throng sometimes themselves became enamoured of its humours  for not only had the neighbouring city of london poured forth her merchants and artizans to gaze wonder and censure the extravagancenot only had beggars of every degree been attracted by the largesse that henry delighted to dispense and peasants had poured in from all the villages around but no sort of entertainment was lacking  here were minstrels and storytellers gathering groups around them here was the mountebank clearing a stage in which to perform feats of jugglery tossing from one hand to another a never ending circle of balls balancing a lance upon his nose with a popinjay on its point here were a bevy of girls with strange garments fastened to their ankles who would dance on their hands instead of their feet while their uplifted toes jangled little bells  peasant and beggar citizen and performer sightseer and professional all alike strove to get into the space before the great entrance where the procession must come forth to gratify the eyes of the gazers and mayhap shower down such bounty as the elder mendicants averred had been given when prince edward the saints defend him had been weighed at five years old and to avert ill luck the counterbalance of pure gold had been thrown among the poor to purchase their prayers  his weight in gold at his present stature could hardly be expected by the wildest imaginations but hungry eyes had been estimating the weight of his little heir and discontented lips had declared that the child was of too slender make to be ever worth so much to them as his father  yet a whisper of the possibility had quickly been magnified to a certainty of such a largesse and the multitude were thus stimulated to furious exertions to win the most favourable spot for gathering up such a golden rain as even little prince henrys counterpoise would afford and ever as time waxed later the throng grew denser and more unruly and the struggle fiercer and more violent  the screams and expostulations of the weak elbowed and trampled down mingled with more festive sounds and the attendants who waited on the river in the large and beautifullyornamented barges which were the usual conveyances of distinguished personages began to agree with one another that if they saw less than if they were on the bank they escaped a considerable amount of discomfort as well as danger  for murmured one of the pages i suppose it would be a dire offence to the prince to lay about among the churls as they deserve  ay truly among londoners above all was the answer of his companion whom the last four years had rendered considerably taller than when we saw him last  not that there is much love lost between them  he hath never forgotten the day when they pelted the queen with rotten eggs and sang their ribald songs nor they the day he rode them down at lewes like corn before the reaper  and lost the day muttered the other page then added the less love the more cause for caution  oh yes we know you are politic master richard was the sneering reply but you need not fear my quarrelling with your citizen friends  i would not be the man to face prince edward if i had made too free with any of the caitiffs  hark master hamlyn the tumult is louder than ever interposed an elderly man of lower rank who was in charge of the stout rowers in the royal colours of red and gold  young gentlemen the mass must be ended it were better to draw to the stairs than to talk of you know not what he muttered  hamlyn de valence who held the rudder steered towards the wide stone steps that descended to the river nearest to the apse in which st peters abbey church terminated before henry vii had added his chapel  at that moment a louder burst of sound half imprecation half shriek was heard there was a heavy splash a little way above and a small blue bundle was seen on the river apparently totally unheeded by the frantic crowd on the bank  no sooner was it seen by richard however than he threw back his mantle and sprang out of the barge  there was a loud cry from the third page a little fellow of nine or ten years old but richard gallantly swam out battled with the current and succeeded in laying hold of a young child with whom he made for the barge partly aided by the stream but he was breathless and heartily glad to reach the boat and support himself against the gunwale  a pretty boat companion you said hamlyn maliciously  how are we to take you in over the velvet cushions  the little page gave an expostulating cry  hold the child an instant john gasped richard raising it towards his younger friend i will but recover breath and then land and seek out her friends  how is this said a voice above them and looking up they found that while all had been absorbed in the rescue the prince with his little son in his arms and his wife hanging on his arm had come to the stone stairs and was looking down  richard overboard  a child fell over the bank my lord eagerly shouted the little john with cap in hand and he swam out to pick it up  into the barge instantly richard commanded the prince  tis as much as his life is worth to remain in this cold stream  and truly richard was beginning to feel as much  he was assisted in by two of the oarsmen and the barge then putting towards the steps the princess was handed into her place and began instantly to ask after the poor child  it had not been long enough in the water to lose its consciousness though it had hitherto been too much frightened to cry but it no sooner opened a wide pair of dark eyes to find itself in strange hands than it set up a lamentable wail calling in broken accents for dada  let me take it ashore at once gracious lady said richard revived by a draught of wine from the stores provided for the long day i will find its friends  nay said the princess it were frenzy to take it thus in its wet garments and frenzy to remain in thine richard  as she spoke the prince and the other persons of the suite had embarked and the barge was pushing away from the steps  give the child to me she added holding out her arms and disregarding a remonstrance from one of her ladies disregarding too the sobs and struggles of the child whom she strove to soothe while hastily removing the little things soaked blue frock and hood and wrapping it up in a warm woollen cloak  it is a pretty little maiden she said and not ill cared for  some mothers heart must be bursting for her hush thee hush thee little one we will take thee home and clothe thee and then thou shalt go to thy mother she added in better english than she had spoken four years earlier in alton wood  but the child still cried for her dada and the princess asked again what is thy fathers name little maid  pere she answered with a peculiar accent that made the prince say that is a provencal tongue  they are provencal eyes likewise added eleanor  see how like their hue is to richards own and in provencal she repeated the question what the fathers name and the childs own might be  but pere again and bessee pretty bessee was all the answer she obtained the last in unmistakable english  i thought said eleanor that it was only my own children that scarce knew whether they spoke english languedoc or languedoui  it was the same with us lady said richard  father adam was wont to say we were a little babel  the child looked towards him on hearing his voice and held out her hands to go to him reiterating an entreaty to be taken to her father  she is probably the child of some minstrel or troubadour said the prince  we will send in search of him as soon as we have reached the savoy  the savoy palace had been built for queen eleanors obnoxious uncle prince thomas of savoy and had recently been purchased by the queen herself as a wedding gift for her son edmund but in the meantime edward and his family were occupying it during their stay near westminster and their barge was brought up to the wide stairs of its noble court  richard was obliged to give up the child to the princess and her ladies though she shrieked after him so pertinaciously that eleanor called to him to return so soon as he should have changed his garments  in a few minutes he again appeared and found the little girl dressed in a little garment of one of the royal children but totally insensible to the honour turning away from all the dainties offered to her and sobbing for her father much to the indignation of the two little princes henry and john who stood hand in hand staring at her  she flew to him directly with a broken entreaty that she might be taken to her father  again they tried questioning her but richard whether speaking english or provencal always succeeded in obtaining readier and more comprehensible replies than did the princess  whether she recognized him as her preserver or whether his language had a familiar tone she seemed exclusively attracted by him and he it was who learnt that she lived at homefar offon the green near the red monks and that her father could not seehe would be lost without bessee to lead him  and the little creature hardly three years old if so much was evidently in the greatest trouble at her father having lost her guidance and protection  richard touched and flattered by the little maidens exclusive preference and owning in her provencal eyes and speech something strangely like his own young sister eleanor entreated permission to be himself the person to take her in search of her friends  the princess added her persuasions declaring it would be cruel to send the poor little thing with another stranger and that his provencal tongue was needed in order to discovering her father among the troubadours  edward yielded to her persuasion adding however that richard must take two menatarms with him and gravely bidding him be on his guard  nor would he permit him to be accompanied by little john de mohun who half page half hostage had lately been added to the princesss train and being often bullied and teased by hamlyn and his fellows had vehemently attached himself to richard and now entreated in vain to go with him on the adventure  in fact prince edward was a stern disciplinarian equally severe against either familiarity or insolence towards the external world and especially towards any one connected with london  if richard ever gave him any offence it was by a certain freedom of manner towards inferiors such as the earl of leicester had diligently inculcated on his family but which more than once had excited a shade of vexation on the princes part  even after richard had reached the door he was called back and commanded on no pretext to loiter or enter on any dispute and if his search should detain him late to sleep at the tower rather than be questioned and stopped at any of the gates which were guarded at night by the citizens    chapter vthe old knight of the hospital    the warriors of the sacred grave    who looked to christ for laws lord houghton  richard summoned a small boat and with two stout menatarms of whom adam de gourdon was one prepared again to cross the river leonillo ran down the stone stairs with a wistful look of entreaty and it occurred to both richard and adam that could the child only lead them to the place where her father had sat the dogs scent might prove their most efficient guide  little bessee seemed quite comforted when on her way back to her father and sat on richards knee eating the comfits with which the princess had provided her and making him cut a figure that seemed somewhat to amaze the other boatloads whom they encountered on the river  when they landed the throng was more dispersed but revelry and sports of all kinds were going on fast and furiously each door of the abbey was besieged by hungry crowds receiving their dole and richards inquiries for a blind man who had lost his child were little heeded or met with no satisfactory answer  bessee herself was bewildered and incapable of finding her fathers late station and richard was becoming perplexed and doubtful whether he ought to take her back as well as somewhat put out of countenance by the laughter of thomas de clare and other young nobles who rallied him on his strange charge  at last the little girls face lightened as at sight of something familiar  good red monks she said  they give bessee soupmake father well  with a ray of hope richard advanced to a party of brethren of st john who were mounting at the abbey gate to return to their house at spitalfields and doffing his bonnet intimated a desire to address the tall old warworn knight with a benevolent face who was adjusting his scarlet cloak before mounting a gray arab steed looking as old and worthy as himself  ha a young crusader i perceive was the greeting of the old knight as his eye fell on the white cross on richards mantle welcome brother  dost thou need counsel on thy goodly eastern way  thanks reverend sir returned richard but my present purpose was to seek for the father of this little one who fell into the river in the press  she pointed to you saying she had received your bounty  it is blind hals child sir robert exclaimed a servingbrother in black coming eagerly forward the villeins on the green told me the poor knave was distraught at having lost his child in the throng  what brought he her there for exclaimed sir robert  poor fool his wits must have forsaken him  the child had a craving to see the show replied the brother so hob the cobbler told me and all went well till my lord of pembrokes retainers forced all right and left to make way in the crowd  hal was thrown down and the child thrust away till they feared she had fallen over the bank  hob and his wife were fain to get the poor man away for his moans and fierce words were awful  and he was not a little hurt in the scuffle so i een gave them leave to lay him in the cart that brought up your reverences vestments and the gear we lent the abbey for the show  right brother hilary said sir robert and now the poor knave will have his best healinghe must have been a good soldier once he added to richard but he is a mere fragment of a man wasted in your earl of leicesters wars  where dwells he asked richard keenly interested in all his fathers old followers i would fain restore him his child  in a hut on bednall green answered the servingbrother but twice or thrice a week he comes to the spital to have his hurts looked to  ay we tell him his little witch must soon be shut out  she turns the heads of all our brethren said sir robert smiling  wild work she makes with our novices  wilder with our knights commanders maybe sir retorted laughing a fair openfaced youth in his novitiate  i shall some day warn hal how our brethren the templars are said to play at ball with tender babes on their lances  no scandal about our brethren of the temple rayland said sir robert looking grave for a momentyoung sir it would be a favour if you would ride with us we would gladly show you the way to bednall green  i should rejoice to go sir returned richard but i am of prince edwards householdrichard fowen and my horse is on the other side of the river  that is soon remedied said sir robert who seemed to have taken a great fancy to richard either for the sake of his crossed shoulder or of his kindness to the little plaything of the spital  our young brother engelbert von fuchstein has leave to tarry this night with his brother in the train of the king of the romans and his horse is at your service if you will do our poor spital the favour to tarry there this night and ride it back in the morn to meet him at westminster  richard knew that this invitation might be safely accepted without danger of giving umbrage to the prince who was on the best terms with the knights of the hospital  he therefore dismissed gourdon and the other manatarms with a message explaining the matter and warmly thanking the old grand prior laid one hand on the saddle of the great ponderous beast that was led up to him and vaulted on its back without touching the stirrup  well done my young master said sir robert it is easy to see you are of the princes household  i cannot yet do as the prince can said richardtake this leap in full armour  no and let me give you a bit of counsel fair sir  such pastimes are very well for the tiltyard but they should be laid aside in the blessed land and strength reserved for the one cause and purpose he crossed himself and in the meantime bessee intimated her imperious purpose of not riding before brother hilary but being perched before richard on the enormous creamcoloured animal whence he was looking down from a considerable elevation upon sir robert on his slender arab  these are the german monsters that our brethren bring over said sir robert  mark me young brother cumber not yourself with these beasts of europe which are good for nothing but food for foul birds in the east  purvey yourself of an arab as soon as you land  there is a rogue at acre one ali by name who will not cheat you more than is reasonable so you mention my name to him sir robert darcy at your service  thanks reverend father returned richard but i am but a landless page and the prince mounts me  said you this poor man had been wounded in the late wars  ay hacked and hewed worse than by the infidels themselves  woeful it is that here at home mens blood should be wasted on your own petty feuds  this same barons war now hath cost as much downright courage as would have brought us back to jerusalem and all thrown away without a cause with no honour no hope  not without a cause richard could not help saying  nay said the old knight no cause is worth the taking of a life save the cause of the holy sepulchre  what be these matters of taxes and laws to ask a man to shed his blood for  alack the temper of the crossbearer is dying out  i pray i may not see this crusade end like half those i have beheldand the cross on the shoulder become no better than a mockery  that may scarcely be with such leaders as the prince and the king of france said richard  well well the prince is untried and for king louis he is as holy a man as ever lived since king godfrey of blessed memory but he has bad luck ever bad luck  the saints forefend but i trow he will listen to some crazy counsel from rome belike or some barefooted hermitvery holy no doubt but who does not know a greek from a saracen or a horses head from his tailand will go to some pestilential hole like that foul egyptian swamp where we stayed till our skin was the colour of an old boot in hopes of converting the sultan of babylon or the old man of the mountain or what not and there he will stay till the flower of his forces have wasted away  were you in egypt with king louis eagerly exclaimed richard  ay marry was i and a goodly land it is but i saw many a good manatarms perish miserably in a marsh who might have been the saving of the holy city  why i myself have never been the same man since  never could do a months service out of the infirmary at acre though after all theres no work i like so well as the hospital business and for the last five years i have had to stay here training young brethren  oh young man  i envy you your first stroke for the holy sepulchre  would that the grandmaster would hear my entreaty  i am too old to be worth sparing and i would fain have one more chance of dying under the banner of the orderbut i am setting you a bad example son raynal a hospitalier has no will and look you young sir page if you stay out at sunset in that clime tis all up with you  and you should veil your helmet well or the sun smites on your head as deadly as a flake of greek fire  so rambled on good old sir robert darcy grand prior of england a perfect dragon among the saracens but everywhere else the mildest and most benevolent of men his discourse strangely mingling together the deepest enthusiasm with a businesslike commonsense appreciation of ways and means and with minute directions precautions and anecdotes gathered from his practical experience both as captain in the field priest in the church and surgeon in the hospital and all seen from the most sunshiny point of view  meanwhile they were riding along the strand a beautiful open road with grassy borders shelving down to the thames  they passed through the city of london  the hospital lay beyond the walls but the marshes of moorfields that protected them were not passable without a long circuit and the fortified gates stood open at temple bar where the hospitaliers looking towards the round church and stately buildings of the preceptory saluted the whitecloaked figures moving about it with courtesy grim and distant in all but sir robert darcy who could not even hate a templar a creature to the ordinary hospitalier far more detestable than a saracen  on then up ground beginning to rise below which the little muddy stream called the flete stagnated along its way meandering to the thames  thatched hovels and wooden booths left so narrow a passage that the horsemen were forced to move in single file and did not gain a clearer space even when the stone houses of merchants began to stand thick on ludgate hill their carved wooden balconies so projecting that it would seem to have been an object with the citizens to be able to shake hands across the street  the city was comparatively empty and quiet as all the world were keeping holiday at westminster but even as it was the passengers seemed to swarm in the streets and knots of persons who had been unable to witness the spectacle sat with gazing children upon the stairs outside the houses to admire the fragments of the pageant that came their way  acclamations of delight greeted the appearance of the scarletmantled hospitaliers such as richard had often heard in his boyhood when riding in his fathers train but far less frequently since he had been a part of the princes retinue  and equally diverse was the merry nod and smile of sir robert to each gaping shouting group of little ones from the stately distant courtesy with which edward returned the popular salutations  he could be gracioushe could not be friendly except to a few  they passed the capitular buildings of st pauls with the beautiful cathedral towering over them and in its rear numerous booths for the purchase of rosariesrecent inventions then of st dominic the great friend of richards stern grandfather the persecutor of the albigenses  sir robert drew up and declared he must buy one for the little maid as a remembrance of the day and then found she was fast asleep but he nevertheless purchased a blackbeaded chaplet giving for it one of the sorelyclipped coins of king henry  prithee let me have one likewise holy sir quoth richard in memory of the talk that hath taught me so much of the import of my crusading vow  thou shalt bring me for it one of the olive of bethlehem said sir robert i have given away all i brought from the east  they are so great a boon to our poor sick folk that i wish i had brought twice as many but to me they have always a saracen look  your moslem always fingers one much of the same fashion as he parleys  ludgate freshly built and adorned with new figures to represent the fabulous king lud was not yet closed for the night and the party came forth beyond the walls with the desolate moorfields to their left and before them a number of rising villages clustered round their churches  the hospital a grand fortified monastery was already to be seen over the fields but sir robert sending home the rest of his troop turned aside with richard and brother hilary towards the common with a border of cottages around it which went by the name of bednall green  brother hilary knew the hut inhabited by blind hal and led the way to it  low and mudbuilt thatched and with a wattled door it had a wretched appearance but the old woman who came to the door was not ill clad  blessings on you holy father she cried do i see the child my lamb my ladybird  would that she may come in time to cheer her poor father  how is it with him then gammer demanded sir robert springing to the ground with the alacrity of a doctor anxious about his patient  ill very ill sir  whether the horses feet hurt his old wound or whether it be the loss of the child he hath done nought but moan and rave and lie as one dead ever since they brought him home  he is lying in one of the dead swoons now  it were not well that the child saw him  but bessee awakening with a cry of joy saw her borne and struggled to go to her father whose name she called on with all her might disregarding the caresses of the old woman and the endeavour made by richard to restrain without alarming her while sir robert went into the hut to endeavour to restore the sufferer  suddenly a cry broke from within and richard turning at the voice beheld the blind man sitting up on his pallet with arms outstretched my childmy father hast thou brought her to visit me in limbo he cried  he raves said richard using his strength to withhold the child who broke out into a shriek  nay nay she doth not abide here he exclaimed  her spirit is pure  my sins are not visited on her beyond the grave  thou art on the earthly side of the grave still my son said sir robert at the same time as bessee sprang from richard and nestled on his breast clinging to his neck  my babemy bessee he exclaimed gathering her close to him living living indeed  yet how may it be  surely this is the other world  that voice sounds not among the living  it is the voice of the youth who saved thy child said the grand prior  speak again  let him speak again implored the beggar  can i do aught for you good man asked richard  again there was a strange start and thrill of amazement  only for heavens sake tell me who thou art  a page of prince edwards good man  i am called richard fowen  and who for heavens sake are you added richard as leonillo who had been smelling about and investigating threw himself on the blind man in a transport of caresses  off leonoff cried richard  it is but a dogfear not little onetell me tell me he added trembling as he knelt before the miserable object holding back the eager leonillo with one arm round his neck who art thou thou ghost of former times  knowst me not richard returned a suppressed voice in provencal  henry  henry exclaimed richard and fell upon the foot of the low bed weeping bitterly  is it come to this  ay even to this said the blind man that two sons of one father meet unknownone with a changed name the other with none at all neither with the honoured one they were born to  alack alack was all richard could say at the first moment as he lifted himself up to look again at the firstborn of his parents the head of the brave troop of brethren the gay handsome imperious young lord de montfort whose proud head and gallant bearing he had looked at with a younger brothers imitative deference  what did he see but a wreck of a man sitting crouched on the wretched bed the left arm a mere stump a bandage where the bright sarcastic eyes used to flash forth their dark fire deep scars on all the small portion of the face that was visible through the overgrown masses of hair and beard so plentifully sprinkled with white that it would have seemed incredible that this man was but eight months older than the prince whose rival he had always been in personal beauty and activity  the beautiful child clasped close to his breast her face buried on his shoulder under his shaggy locks was a strange contrast to his appearance but only added to the look of piteous helplessness and desolation as she hung upon him in her alarm at the agitation around her  richard had long been accustomed to think of his brother as dead but such a spectacle as this was far more terrible to him and his cheek blanched at the shock as he gasped again thou here and thus thou whom i thought slain  deem me so still said his brother even as i deem the royal minion dead to me  nay henry thou knowst not  who is present interrupted the blind man raising his head and tossing back his hair with a gesture that for the first time gave richard a sense that his eldest brother was indeed before him methought i heard another voice  i am here fair son replied the old knight father robert of the hospital  i will either leave thee or keep thy secret as though it were thy shrift but thou art sore spent and mayst scarce talk more  weariness and pain are past father with my little one again in my bosom said henry and there are matters that must be spoken between me and this young brother of mine ere he quits this hut and his voice resumed its old authoritative tone towards richard  said you that he had saved my child  he drew me from the river father said bessee looking up  there was nothing to stand on and it was so cold  and he took me in his arms and pulled me out and put me in a boat and the lady pulled off my blue coat and put this one on me  feel it father oh so pretty so warm  it was the princess said richard but henry not noticing continued  thou hast earned my pardon richard and held out his remaining hand somewhere towards the height where his brothers used to be  sir robert smiled saying thou dost miscalculate thy brothers stature son  and at the same moment richard who was now little short of his cousin edward in height was kneeling by henry accepting and returning his embrace with agitation and gratitude such as showed how their relative positions in the family still maintained their force but richard still asserted his independence so as to say when you have heard all brother you will see that there is no need of pardoning me  henry however as perhaps sir robert had foreseen instead of answering put his hand to his side and sank back in a paroxysm of pain ending in another swoon  the child stood by quiet and frightened but too much used to similar occurrences to be as much terrified as was richard who thought his brother dying but calling in the servingbrother the old hospitalier did all that was needed and the blind man presently recovered and explained in a feeble voice that he had been jostled thrown down and trodden on at the moment when he lost his hold of his little daughter and this was evidently renewing his sufferings from the effect of an injury received in battle  and what took thee there son said sir robert somewhat sharply  the harvest father answered henry rousing himself to speak with a certain sarcasm in his tone  it is the beggars harvest wherever king henry goes  we brethren of the wallet cannot afford to miss such windfalls  a beggar exclaimed richard in horror  and what art thou retorted henry with a sudden fierceness  listen young men said sir robert this i know my patient there will soon be nothing if ye continue in this strain  a litter shall bring him to the infirmary  nay said henry hastily not so good father  here i abide hap what may  and i abide with him said richard  not so i say returned the hospitalier unless thou wouldst slay him outright  return to the spital with me and at morn if he have recovered himself unravel these riddles as thou and he will  it is well father said henry  go with him richard but mark me  be silent as the grave and see me again  and reluctant as he was richard was forced to comply    chapter vithe beggar earl    along with the nobles that fell at that tyde his eldest son henrye who fought by his syde was felde by a blow he receivde in the fight a blow that for ever deprivde him of sight old beggar  the chapel at the spital was open to all who chose to attend  the deep choir was filled with the members of the order half a dozen knights in the stalls and the novices and servingbrothers so ranged as to give full effect to the body of voice  richard knelt on the stone floor outside the choir intending after early mass to seek his brother but to his surprise he found the blind man with his child at his feet in what was evidently his accustomed place just within the door  his hair and beard were now arranged his appearance was no longer squalid but when he rose to depart guided in part by the child but also groping with a stick he looked even more helpless than on his bed and richard sprang forward to proffer an arm for his support  flemish cloth and frieze gown said the object of his solicitude in a strange gibing voice court page and street beggarhow now my master  lord earl and elder brother returned richard thine is my service through life  mine  ho ho  that much for thy service with a disdainful gesture of his fingers  a strapping lad like thee would be the ruin of my trade  i might as well give up bag and staff at once  nay surely wilt thou not exclaimed richard in broken words from his extreme surprise  the king and prince only long to pardon and restore and  and thou wouldst well like to lord it at kenilworth earl in all but the name  thou mayst do so yet without being cumbered with me or mine  thou dost me wrong henry said richard much distressed  i love the prince for none so truly honoured our blessed father as he and for his sake he hath been most kind lord to me but thou art the head of my house my brother and with all my heart do i long to render thee such service asas may lighten these piteous sufferings  i believe thee richard thou wert ever an honest simplehearted lad said henry in a different tone but the only service thou canst render me is to let me alone and keep my secret  herei feel that we are at the stone bench where i bask in the sun and lay out my dish for the visitors of the gracious orderhere bessee child put the dish down he added retaining his hold of his brother as if to feel whether richard winced at this persistence in his strange profession  the little girl obeyed and betook herself to the quiet sports of a lonely child amusing herself with leonillo and sometimes returning to her father and obtaining his attention for a few moments sometimes prattling to some passing brother of the order who perhaps made all the more of the pretty creature because this might be called an innocent breach of discipline  and now master page said henry in his tone of authority yet with some sarcasm let us hear how longlegged edward finished the work he had began on thee at herefordmade thee captive in the battle eh  richard briefly narrated his life with gourdon and his capture by the prince adding my mother was willing i should remain with him she bade me do anything rather than join simon and guy and verily brother save that the prince is less free of speech his whole life seems moulded upon our blessed fathers  speak not of them in the same breath cried henry hastily  and whereforeif such be his honour to him whom he slew and mutilated art thou to disown thy name and stand before him like some chance foundling  that was the kings doing said richard  the prince was averse to it but king henry though he wept over me and called me his dear nephew made it his special desire that he might not hear the name of montfort and the prince though overruling him in all that pertains to matters of state is most dutiful in all lesser matters  i hoped at least to be called fitz simon but some mumble of the king turned it into fowen and so it has continued  i believe no one at court is really ignorant of my lineage but among the people montfort is still a trumpetcall and the king fears to hear it  well he may laughed henry  rememberest thou richard the sorry figure our good uncle cut when we armed him so courteously and put him on his horse to meet the rebels at eveshamhow he durst not hang back and loved still less to go onward and kept calling me his loving nephew all the time  ah  henrybut didst thou not hear my father mutter when he saw the crowned helm under the standard that it was ill done and no good could come of seething the kid in the mothers milk  and verily had not the prince been carrying his father from the field i trow the mortimers had not refused us quarter nor had their cruel will of us  oh ho thou art come to have opinions of thine own laughed henry with the scoff of a senior unable to brook that his younger brother should think for himself  yet this tone was so familiar to richards ears that it absolutely encouraged him to a nearer step to intimacy he said but how scapedst thou henry  i could have sworn that i saw thee fall skull and helmet cleft a dead man  instead of answering henry put his hand under the chin of his child who was leaning against him and holding up her face to his brother said thou canst see this childs face  tell me what like she is  like little eleanor like amaury  the homelook of her eyes won my heart at once  even the princess remarked their resemblance to mine think of eleanor and thy minds eye will see her  no other likeness said the blind man wistfully but nothou wast at hereford when she was at odiham  who  he grasped richards hand and under his breath uttered the name isabel  isabel mortimer exclaimed richard who had been of course aware of his brothers betrothal when the two families of montfort and mortimer had been on friendly terms we heard she had taken the veil  and so thou sawst me slain said henry de montfort dryly  but howhow was it asked richard eagerly  men sometimes tie knots faster than they intend said henry  when roger mortimer took simons doings in wrath and vowed that his sister should never wed a montfort he knew not what he did  he and his proud wife could flout and scorn my isabelthey might not break her faith to me  thou knowst perhaps richard since thou art hand and glove with our foes that like a raven to the slaughter the lady mortimer came as near the battlefield as her care for her dainty person would allow and there was one whom she brought with her and gentle dame what doth she do but carry her sisterinlaw a sweet and womanly gift  what thinkst thou it was richard  i fear i know said richard choked my fathers hand  nay that was a choicer morsel reserved for my lady countess herself  it was mine own with our betrothalring thereon  now quoth that loving sister might isabel resume her ring  no plighted troth could be her excuse any longer for refusing to wed my lord of gloucester  then rose up my love it beckons me she said and bade them leave it with her  they deemed that it was for death that it beckoned  so mayhap did she  i wot countess maud had little grieved  but little dreamed they of her true purposemy perfect jewel of constant lovenamely to restore the lopped hand to the poor corpse that it might likewise have christian burial  her old nurse welsh winny was as true to her as she was to me and forth they sped fearless of the spoilers and made their way at nightfall even to the abbey church where edward less savage than the fair countess had caused us to be laid before the altar awaiting our burial in the vaults  thou wert senseless all this time  ay and so continued  the pang when my hand was severed had roused me for a few moments but only to darkness and my effort to speak had been rewarded with as many welsh knives as could pierce my flesh at once  and thou didst not bleed to death  the swoon checked my blood  and the monks of evesham must have staunched and bandaged so as to make a decent corpse of me  had they had a manatarms among them they would have known that mine were not the wounds of a dead but of a living man  the old nurse knew it when my sweet lady would needs unbind my wrist to place my hand in its right place  an old crone such as welsh winny never stirs without her cordial potion  they poured it into my lipsand if i were never more to awake to the light of day i awoke to the sound that was yet dearer to mewhile alas it still was left to me  he became silent till richards question drew him on  what with their care and support when once on my feet i found strength to stumble out of the chapel and gain shelter in the woods ere day and i believe the monks got credit for their zeal in casting out the excommunicate body  not credit said richard the prince was full of grief more especially as they all disavowed the deed  but brother art thou excommunicate still  far from it most pious crusader  if seas of holy wells could assoil me i should be pure enough  my sweet isabel deemed that some such washing might bring back mine eyesight and from one to another we wandered as my limbs could bear it  and at st winifreds there was a priest who told us strange tales of the miracles wrought in the mortimer household by my fathers severed hand nay that it had so worked on lord mortimers sister that she had left the vanities of the world and gone into a nunnery  he seemed so convinced of my fathers saintliness and so honest a fellow that isabel insisted on unbosoming ourselves to him under seal of confession  no longer was the old nurse to be my mother and she my sister and the good man made no difficulties but absolved me and wedded me to the truest most loving wife that ever blessed a man bereft of all else  and you begged  o henry the noble lady  at first we had the knightly chain and spurs in which the monks had kindly pranked me up  isabel too had worn a few jewels but after all a palmer need never hunger  my father always said no trade was so well paid as begging under king henry and verily we found it so she used at times to gather berries and thread them for chaplets to sell at the holy wells but i trow sheer beggary throve better  but wherefore  even had pardon not been ready simon held out kenilworth for months  henry laughed his dry laugh  simple boy dost think i would trust simon with an elder brother whose hand could no longer keep his head  and my mother  she had always hated the mortimers even when the contract was matter of policy  would i have taken my sweet isabel to abide her royal scorn it might be incredulity of our marriage  though for that matter it is more unimpeachable than her own  nay nay out of ken and out of reach was our only security from our kin on either side unless we desired that my head should follow my hand as a dainty dish for countess maud  how could the lady brook it  she dyed her fair skin with walnut wore russet gown and hood and was a very nightingale for blitheness and sweet song through that first year said henry blither than ever when that little one was born in the sunshiny days of whitsuntide  i tell thee those were happier days than ever i passed as lord de montfort at kenilworth but after that the bruised hurt in my side which had never healed when the cleaner gashes did became more painful and troublesome holy wells did nothing for it and she wasted with watching it as though my pain had been hers  naught would serve her but coming here because she had been told that the knights of st john had better experience of old battlewounds than any men in the realm much ado had we to get herethe young babe in her arms and i well nigh distraught with pain  we crept into this same hut and i had a weary sickness throughout the winterliving i know not how by the bounty of the spital and by the works of her fingers which winny would take out to sell on feastdays in the city  oh that eyes had been left me to note how she pined away but i had scarce felt how thin and bony were her tender fingers ere the blasts of the cruel march wind finished the work  alack alack poor henry said richard never never was lady of romaunt so noble and so true  no more said henry hastily leaning his brow on the top of his staff  come hither bessee he added after a brief pause say thy prayer for thy blessed mother child  and holding out his one hand he inclosed her two clasped ones within it as the little voice ran over an utterly unintelligible form of childishly clipped latin sounding however sweet and birdlike from the very liberties the little memory had taken in twisting its mellifluous words into a rhythm of her own  and there was catchword enough for richard to recognize and follow it with bonnet doffed and crossing himself  and now he said surely the need for secrecy is ended  the land is tranquil the king ruled by the prince the prince owning all the past folly and want of faith that goaded our father into resistance wherefore not seek his willing favour  thou art ever a pilgrim  be with us in the crusade  who knows what the jordan waves may effect for thee  no no grimly laughed henry  dost think any favour would make it tolerable to be wept over and pitied by the kingpitied by the king he repeated in ineffable disgust or to be the show of the court among all that knew me of old when i was a man  hob the cobbler and martin the bagster are better company than pembroke and gloucester and i meet with more humours on cheapside than i should at winchestermore regard too  why they deem me threescore years old at least and i am a very oracle of wisdom among them  earl of leicester forsooth he would be nobody compared with blind hal  and as to freedomwith child and staff the whole country and city are before meno shouts to dull retainers and jackanape pages to set my blind lordship on horseback without his bridle hand and lead him at their will anywhere but at his own  all this i can understand for thyself said richard but for thy childs sake canst thou not be moved  my child quotha  what when her uncle simon is true grandson to king john  richard started  i cannot believe what thou sayest of simon he answered in displeasure  one day thou wilt calmly answered henry but i had rather not have it proved upon the heiress of leicester and montfort  leicester is forfeitsimon an outlawed man  if the humour for pardon is set in cousin edward is no man to do things by halves  if he owned me at all the lands would be mine again and such a bait would be smelt out by simon were he at the ends of the earth  or if not that poor child would be granted to any needy kinsman or grasping baron that edward wanted to portion my child shall be my own and none others  better a beggars brat than an earls heiress  she is a lovely little maiden  i know not how thou canst endure letting her grow up in poverty an alien from her birth and rank  poverty henry laughed  little knowest thou of the jolly beggars business  i would fain wager thee richard that pretty bessees marriageportion shall be a heavier bag of gold than the lady elizabeth de montfort would gather by all the aids due to her father from his vassalsand won moreover without curses  but who would be the bridegroom  her own choice not the kings answered henry briefly  and this is all said richard perceiving that according to the previous days agreement the creamcoloured elephant of a german horse was being led forth for his use and sir robert preparing to accompany him  i must leave thee in this strange condition  ay that must thou  betray me and thou shalt have the curse of the head of thine house  had thy voice not become so strangely like my fathers i had never made myself known to thee  i will see thee again  that will be as thou canst  i trow edward hardly gives freedom enough to his pages for them to pay visits unknown replied henry with a strange sneering triumph in his own wild liberty  if aught ails thee if i can aid thee swear to me that thou wilt send to me  henry laughed with somewhat of a tone of mockery adding well wellkeep thou thy plight to me so long as i want thee not and i will keep mine to thee if ever i should need thee  now away with thee  i hear the horses impatient for thee and what would be the lot of the beggar if he were seen chattering longer with a lordly young page than might suffice for his plaint  i hear voices  put a tester in my dish fair sir for appearance sake  thou hast it not ahai told thee i was the richer as well as the freer man  whats that  that is no ring of coin  tis a fair jewel father green and sparkling cried bessee  nay nay ill have none of it  some token from thy new masters ha boy  from the princess on new years day replied richard  but keep it oh keep it henry it breaks my heart to leave thee thus  keep it  not i  what wouldst say to thy dainty dame  nor should i get half its value from the jews  no no take back thy jewel sir page ill not put thee in need of telling more lies than becomes thine office  richard glowed with irritation but what was the use of anger with a blind beggar  and while henry bestowed far more demonstration of affection on leonillo than on his brother it became needful to mount and ride off resolving to tell the prince and princess what would be no falsehood that the child belonged to a kenilworth manatarms sorely wounded at evesham and at present befriended by the knights of st john  old sir robert darcy knew so much that it was needful to confide fully in him and he gave richard some satisfaction by a promise to watch over his brother as far as was possible with a man of such uncertain vagrant habits and he likewise engaged to let him know even in the holy land of any change in the beggars condition and this considering the widespread connections of the order and that some of its members were sure to be in any crusading army was all that richard could reasonably hope  canst write asked sir robert  yea father  i could once  but if there be need to send thee a scroll ill take care it is writ by a trusty hand  more than this richard could not hope  there had always been a strange selfwilled wildness of character about his eldest brother who though far less violent and overbearing in actual deed than the two next in age simon and guy had contrived to incur even greater odium than they by his mocking careless manner and love of taunts and gibing  simon de montfort the elder had indeed strangely failed in the bringing up of his sons  whether it were that their royal connection had inflated them with pride or that the kings indulgence had counteracted the good effects of the admirable education provided for them at home they had done little justice to their parentage or to their tutor the excellent robert grostete perhaps the earl himself was too affectionate  perhaps his occupation in public affairs hindered him from enforcing family discipline  at any rate neither of the elder three could have been naturally endowed with his largeness of mind and high unselfish views  he was a man before his age not only deeply pious but with a devoted feeling for justice and mercy carried into all the details of life till his loyalty to the law overcame his loyalty to the king  simon and guy on the other hand were commonplace young nobles of the thirteenth century heedless of all but themselves and disdaining all beneath them and when their father had seized the reins of government in order to enforce the laws that the king would not observe they saw in his elevation a means of gratifying themselves and being above all law  the cry throughout england had been that simons sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not  henry de montfort had not indeed like his brothers plundered the ships in the channel extorted money from peaceful yeomen nor insulted the poor old captive king to his face but his deference had been more galling than their defiance his scornful smiles and keen cutting jests had mortally offended many a partizan and when positive work was to be done simon with all his fierceness and cruelty was far more to be depended on than henry who might at any time fly off upon some incalculable freak  to richards boyish recollection if simon had been the most tyrannical towards him in deed henry had been infinitely more annoying and provoking in the lesser arts of teasing  and looking back on the past he could understand how intolerable a life of helplessness would be among the equals whom henry had so often stung with his keen wit and that to a man of his peculiar tone of mind there was infinitely more liberty in thus sinking to the lowest depths where his infirmities were absolute capital to him than in being hedged about with the restraints of his rank  any way it was impossible to interfere even for the childs sake and all richard could do to console himself was to look forward to his return from the crusade an esquire or even a knight with exploits that henry might respecta standing in the court that would give him some right to speakperhaps in time a home and lady wife to whom his brother would intrust his child who would then be growing out of a mere toy  or might not his services win him a fresh grant of the earldom and could he not then prove his sincerity by laying it at the true earls feet  pretty bessee too  richard remembered stories current in the family of their grandmother amicia countess of leicester in her own right being forced when a young girl to wed the stern grim old persecuting simon de montfort and how vain had been her struggles against her doom  he lost himself in graceful romantic visions of the young knight whose love he would watch and foster and whose marriage to his lovely niece should be securely concluded ere her rank should be made known when her guardian uncle would yield all to her  and from that day forth richard looked out with keen eyes among the playfellows of the little princes for bessees future knight    chapter viiamong the ruins of carthage    but man is more than law and i may have some impress of myself upon the world one poor brief life helping to feed the flame of chivalry and keep alive the truth that courage honour mercy make a knight queen isabel by s m  land in sight  cheer up john my man said richard leaning over a bundle of cloaks that lay on the deck of a genoese galley  the cross floated high aloft accompanied by the lions of english royalty the bulwark was hung round with blazoned shields and the graceful white sails were filled by a gay breeze that sent the good ship dancing over the crested waves of the mediterranean in company with many another of her gallant sisters crowded with the chivalry of england  woeful was however the plight of great part of that chivalry merrily merrily bounded the bark but her sport felt very like death to many of her freight and among others to poor little john de mohun  his father baron mohun of dunster had been deeply implicated in the barons wars and had been a personal friend of the earl of leicester from whom he had only separated himself in consequence of the outrageous exactions and acts of insolence perpetrated by the young montforts  he had indeed received a disabling wound while fighting on the princes side at evesham but his submission had been thought so insecure that his son and heir had been required of him ostensibly as page but really as hostage  in spite of his norman surname little john of dunster was at twelve years old a sturdy thoroughgoing english lad with the strongest possible hatred to all foreigners whom with grand indifference to natural history he termed locusts sucking the blood of englishmen not a word or command would he understand except in his mother tongue and no blows nor reproofs had sufficed to tame his sturdy obstinacy  the other pages had teased fagged and bullied him to their hearts content without disturbing his determination to go his own way and his only friend and protector had been richard whom under the name of fowen he took for a genuine englishman and loved with all his heart  if anything would ever cure him of his wilful awkwardness and dogged bashfulness it was likely to be the kindness of richardabove all in the absence of the tormentors for hamlyn de valence alone of the other pages had been selected to attend upon the prince in this expedition and he though scornful and peremptory did not think the boy worthy of his attention and did not actively tease him  at present hamlyn de valence as well as most others of the passengers lay prostrate scarcely alive even to the assurance of richard who had still kept his feet that the outline of the hills was quickly becoming distinct and that they were fast entering the gulf where lay the fleet that had brought the crusaders of france and sicily whom they hoped to join in the conquest and conversion of tunis  on arriving at aigues mortes they had found that the french king had already sailed for sicily and following him thither learnt that his brother charles of anjou had persuaded him to begin his crusade by a descent on tunis to which the sicilian crown was said to have some claim that he had sailed thither at once and charles had followed him so soon as the genoese transports could return for the sicilian troops  i see the masts exclaimed richard the bay is crowded with them there must be a goodly force  yonder are two headlands within them we shall have smoother watersee  what strikes thee so suddenly silent growled one of the muffled figures stretched on deck  the ensigns are but halfmast high my lord returned richard in an awestruck voice the lilies of france are hung drooping downward  these plaguy southern winds at their tricks muttered at first earl gilbert of gloucester for he it was who had spoken though richard had not known him to be so near then sitting up he came to a fuller view  hmit looks ill  thou canst keep thy feet fowen or what do they call thee  down with thee to the cabin and let the prince know  stepping across the prostrate forms and meeting with vituperations as he trode richard made his way to the ladder that led below and notified his presence behind the curtain that veiled the royal cabin he was summoned to enter at once  the prince was endeavouring to write at a swingingtable the princess lay white and resigned on a couch attended on by dame idonea or more properly iduna osbright a lady who had lost her husband in a former crusade and had ever since been a sort of highborn head nurse in the palace  a danish skald who had once been at the english court had said that she seemed to have eaten her namesakes apple of immortality without her apple of beauty for no one could ever remember to have seen her other than a tiny driedup old witch with keen gray eyes a sharp tongue an ever ready foot and hand and a frame utterly unaffected by any of the influences so sinister to far younger and stronger ones  devoted to all the royal family her special passion was for prince edmund who in his mothers repugnance to his deformity had been left almost entirely to her and she had accompanied the princess eleanor all the more willingly from her desire to look after her favourite nursling  there lady said edward to his wife the tossing is all but over here is richard come to tell us that we are nigh on land  even so my lord returned richard we are entering the gulf but my lord of gloucester has sent me to report to you that in all the ships the colours are trailing  sayst thou exclaimed the prince hastily laying aside his writing materials  fear not mi dona i will return anon and tell thee how it is  we are in smoother water already  so much smoother that i will come with thee out of this stifling cabin said eleanor  o would that we had been in time for thee to have counselled thine uncles  we will see what we have to grieve for ere we bemoan ourselves said the prince  my good uncle of france would put his whole fleet in mourning for one barefooted friar  depend on it my lord tis mourning for something in earnest interposed dame iduna i said it was not for nothing that a single pyot came and rocked up his illomened tail while we were taking horse for this expedition and my lady there was kissing the little ones at home nor that a hare ran over our road at bagshot  well dame interposed the prince goodhumouredly seeing his wife somewhat affected by the list of omens i know you have a horseshoe in your luggage so you will come safe off whoever does not  and what matters what my luck is returned the dame an old beldame such as me so long as you and your brother come off safe and find the blessed princes at home well and sound  would that we were out of this sandy hole or that any one would resolve me why we cannot go straight to jerusalem when we are about it  the dame had delayed them while she spoke in order to adjust the princesss muffler over her somewhat dishevelled locks but eleanor seeing that her husband was impatient put a speedy end to her operations and took his arm  meantime the vessel had come within the gulf of goletta and others of the passengers had revived and were standing on deck to watch their entrance into the very harbour that two thousand years before had sheltered the stormtossed fleet of aeneas but if the trojan had there found a wooded haven the groves and sylvan shades must long since have been destroyed for to the newcomers the bay appeared inclosed by spits of sand though there was a rising ground in front that cut off the view  in the centre of the bay was a low sandy islet covered with remains of masonry and with a fort in the midst on this was mounted the french banner but likewise drooping and all around it lay the ships with furled sails and trailing ensigns giving them an inexpressibly mysterious look of woe like living creatures with folded wings and vailed crests lying on the face of the waters in a silent sleep of sorrow  there was an awe of suspense that kept each one on the deck silent unable to utter the conjecture that weighed upon his breast  a boat was already putting off and its quick movements seemed to mar the solemn stillness as impelled by the regular strokes of a dozen dark handsome genoese mariners with gailytinted caps it shot towards the vessel  a genoese captain in graver garb sat at the helm and as they came alongside a whisper almost a shudder seemed to thrill upwards from the boat to the crew and through them to the passengers il re il re santo il re di francia  it seemed to have pervaded the whole ship even before the genoese had had time to take the rope flung to him and to climb up the ships side where as his fellowcaptain greeted him he asked hastily for the principe inglese  for edward had not come forward but was standing with his back against the mainmast with colourless cheek and eyes set and fixed eleanor looked up to him in silence aware that he was mastering vehement agitation and would endure no token of sympathy or sorrow that would unnerve him when dignity required firmness  to him louis ix the husband of his mothers sister had been the guiding friend and noble pattern denied to him in his father and eleanor intrusted to his uncles care during the troubles of england a maiden wife in her first years of womanhood had been formed and moulded by that holy and upright influence  to both the loss was as that of a father and the murmur among the sailors was to them as a voice saying knowest thou that god will take away thy master from thy head today  for the moment however the princesss sole thought was how her husband would bear it and she watched anxiously till the struggle was over in the space of a few seconds and he met the genoese with his usual reserved courtesy and returning his salutation signed to him to communicate his tidings  they were however brief for the captain had held by his ship and all he knew was that deadly sickness fever and plague had raged in the camp  the papal legate was dead and the good king of france his son was dead too and many another beside  which son  not the eldesthe lay sick but there were hopes of him but the little onehe had been carried on board his ship but it had not saved him  poor little tristan sighed eleanor true crossbearer born in one hapless crusade to die in another  the king of sicily demanded edward between his teeth  he had arrived the very day of his brothers death said the genoese and when he had seen how matters stood he had concluded a truce with the king of tunis and intended to sail as soon as the new king of france could bear to be moved  in the meantime the vessel had been anchored and preparations were made for landing but the princes impatience to hear details would not brook even the delay of waiting till his horse could be set ashore  he committed to the earl of gloucester the charge of encamping his men on the island left a message with him for his brother edmund who was in another ship and perceiving that richard had suffered the least of all his suite summoned him to attend him in the boat which was at once lowered  this would have been a welcome call had not richard found that poor little john de mohun had not revived like the other passengers but still lay inert and sometimes moaning  all richard could do was to beg the groom specially attached to the pages service to have a care of the little fellow and get him sheltered in a tent as soon as possible but the prince never suffered any hesitation in obeying him and it was needful to hurry at once into the boat  without a word the prince with long swift strides in the light of the sinking sun walked up the low hill the same where erst the pious aeneas climbed with his faithful achates following  from the brow the trojan prince had beheld the rising city in the valleythe english prince came on its desolation  yet nature had made the vale lovelygreen with wellwatered verdure fields of beauteous green maize graceful date palms and majestic cork trees and among them were white flatroofed moorish houses but many a black stain on the fair landscape told of the fresh havoc of an invading army  utterly blotted out was carthage  half demolished half choked with sand the city of dido the city of hannibal the city of cyprian all had vanished alike and nothing remained erect but a moorish fortress built up with fragments of the huge stones of the old phoenicians intermixed with the friezes and sculptures of graecising rome and the whole fabric in the graceful saracenic taste while completing the strange mixture of periods another of those mournful french banners drooped from the battlements and around it spread the white tents of the armies of france and the two sicilies like it with trailing banners an orphaned plaguestricken host in a ruined city  while the prince paused for a moments glance a party of knights came spurring up the hill who had been ordered off to meet him on the first intelligence that his fleet was in sight but had been taken by surprise by his alertness  they met with bowed heads and dejected mien and there was one who hid his face and wept aloud as he exclaimed ah  messire our holy king loved you well  alas beau sire guillaume de porceles was all that edward could say as with tears in his eyes he held out his hand to the good provencal knight adding let me hear  the knight leading his horse and walking by edwards side told how the king had been induced to make his descent on tunis from some wild hope of the kings conversion which had been magnified by charles of anjou from his dislike to let so gallant an army pass by without endeavouring to obtain some personal advantage to his own realm of sicily  though a vassal of beatrix of provence the sire de porceles was no devoted admirer of her husband charles of anjou and spoke with no concealment of the unhappy perversion of the crusade charles of anjou was allpowerful with the court of rome and in crusading matters louis deemed it right absolutely to surrender to the ecclesiastical power all that judgment which had made him so prudent and wise a king at home while his crusades were lamentable failures  thus in him it had been a piece of obedient selfdenial not to press forward to the holy sepulchre but to land in this malarious bay to fulfil aims that had he but used his common sense he would have seen to be merely those of private ambition  there it had been one scene of wasting sickness  a few deeds of arms had been done to refresh the spirits of the french such as the taking of the fort of carthage and now and then a skirmish of some foraging party but in general the moors launched their spears and fled without staying for combat  many who had hid themselves in the vaults and cellars of carthage had been dragged out and put to death and their bodies had aided in breeding pestilence  name after name fell from the lips of the knight like the roll of warriors fallen in a great battle when   they melted from the field like snow their king their lords their mightiest low   and the last foreign embassy that ever reached louis ix had been that of the greek emperor michael palaeologos come to set before him the savage barbarities perpetrated upon christians by this brother    who had spoilt the purpose of his life   it was as charles entered the port that louis lying on a bed of ashes with his hands crossed upon his breast and the words o jerusalem jerusalem entered not the jerusalem of his earthly schemes but the jerusalem of his true aspirations  shall we conduct you to my lord the king of sicily asked de porceles  no said edward with bitter sternness to my uncle of france  down down my lord and all of you instantly shouted porceles suddenly throwing himself face downwards on the ground  edward was too good a soldier not to follow the injunction instantaneously and richard did the same as well as all the knights who had come up with porceles  even the horses buried their noses in the hot sandy soil a strange rushing roaring sound passed over them there was a sense of intense suffocation then of heat pricking and irritation  the provencals were rising and the prince and his page doing the same shook off a plentiful load of sand and beheld careering furiously away between them and the western sun what looked like a purple column reaching from earth to heaven and bespangled with living golddust whirling round in giddy spirals and all the time fleeting so fast that it was diminishing every moment and was gone in a wink of the eye  is it enchantment gasped richard to the squire nearest him as he strove to clear his eyes from the sand and gaze after the wonder  worse than enchantment quoth the squire it is a sand whirlwind  they were soon crossing the ditch that had been dug around the camp among the ruins and passed through lanes of tents erected among the thick foliage that mantled the broken walls here and there tracks of mosaic pavement of temples to dido or anna peeping forth beneath either the luxuriant vegetation or the heavy sanddrifts or columns of the new carthage lying veiled by acanthus or remnants of churches destroyed by gensericall alike disregarded by the sickly drooping figures that moved feebly about among them regarding them as little save stumblingblocks  a moorish house in the midst of a once welllaidout garden now trampled and destroyed was the place to which the provencal knight led the english prince  entering the doorway of a court where a fountain sparkled in the midst of a marble pavement they saw the richlylatticed stone doorway of the house guarded by two figures in armour like iron statues and passing between them they came into the principal chamber marblefloored and with a divan of cushions round it but full in the midst of the room lay a coffin covered with the lilied banner and the standard of the cross the crowned helmet good sword knightly spurs and crossmarked shield lying upon it solemn forms in armour guarded it and priests knelt and chanted prayers and psalms around it  within were only the bones of louis which were to be taken to st denis  the flesh which had been removed by being boiled in wine and spices was already on its way to palermo in a vessel whose melancholy ensigns would have announced the loss to the english had they not passed it in the night  long did edward kneel beside the remains of his uncle with his face hidden and thoughts beyond our power to trace  richards heart was full of that strange question wherefore  wherefore should the best and purest schemes planned by the highest souls fall over like a crested wave and become lost  so it had been he would have said with the round table under arthur so with englands rights beneath his own noble father so with the crusade under such leaders as edward of england and louis of france  did he mark the answer in those psalms that the priests were singing around    qui seminant in lacrymis in exultatione metent euntes ibant et flebant mittentes semina sua venientes autem venient cum exultatione portantes manipulos suos 1   surely we may believe that simon of leicester and louis of france were alike beyond grief at their marred visions their errors of deed or of judgment were washed away and their true purpose was accepted both waiting the harvest when their works should follow them and it should have been made manifest that the effect of what they had been and had suffered had told far more on future generations than what they had wrought out in their own lifetime  it was at that moment that the sensation that an eye was upon him caused richard to raise his eyes from the floor  one of the armed figures who had hitherto stood as still as suits of armour in a castle hall had partially lowered the visor of the helmet and eyes nose and a part of the cheeks were visible  richard looked up and they were those of his father was it a delusion of his fancy  he closed his eyes and looked again  again it was the deep brown montfort eye the clearlycut nose the embrowned skin  he glanced at the bearings on the shield  behold it was his ownthe red field and white lion rampant with a forked tail which he had not seen for so long  almost at the same moment another person entered the chambera man with a sallow complexion narrow french features sharp gray eyes and a certain royal bearing that even a cunning shrewdness of expression could not destroy  his face was composed to a look of melancholy and he crossed himself and knelt down near edward to await the conclusion of his devotions  edward who knelt absorbed in grief with his cloak partly over his face apparently did not perceive him and after two or three unheeded endeavours at attracting notice he at length rose and said in a low voice my fair nephew  for a moment the prince lifted up his face and richard had rather have died than have encountered that glance of mournful reproof then hiding his face in his hands again he continued his devotions  when these were ended he rose from his knees and when out of the deathchamber bowed his bead and with grave courtesy exchanged greetings with charles of anjou asking at the same time to see his young cousin philippe the new king of france  an inquiry from an attendant elicited that philippe had just dropped asleep under the influence of a potion from his leech  then fair nephew said charles of sicily be content with your old uncle and come to my apartments where i will set before you the necessities that have led me to conclude the truce that is baffling your eager desire of deeds of arms  pardon me royal uncle returned edward i must see my camp set up  it is already late and i must take order that my troops mingle not where contagion might seize them  another time he added i may brook the argument better  charles of anjou did not press him further  there was that in his face and voice which betokened that his fierce indignation and overpowering grief were scarcely restrained and that a word of excuse in his present mood would but have roused the lion  horses had been provided for him and his attendant  he flung himself on his steed at once and richard was obliged to follow without a moments opportunity of making inquiry about the wonderful apparition he had seen in the chamber of death  for some distance edward galloped rapidly over the sandy soil then drawing up his horse when he had come to the brow from which he could see on the one side the valley of carthage on the other the bay he made an exclamation which richard took for a summons and he came up asking if he were called  no boy no  i only spoke my thoughts aloud  failure and success  weve seen them both todayin the two kings  what thinkst thou of them  better be wrecked than work the wreck my lord said richard  ay but why surrender the wit to the worker of the wreck said edward  then knitting his brow two holy men have i known who did not blind their wit for their conscience saketwo alonedid it fare better with them  one was the good bishop of lincolnthe other thou knowst richard  well one goes after anotherfirst good bishop grostete then the lord of leicester and now mine uncle of france and if earth is to have no better than such as it pleases the saints to leave in it it will not be worth staying in much longer  my lord said richard coming near methought i saw my fathers face under a visorone of the knightly guards beside the holy king  well might thy fancy call him up in such a presence said edward they twain had hearts in the same place above though they saw the world below on different sides and knew each other little and loved each other less in life  thats all at an end now  well back to our camp to make the best of the world they have left behind them and then in a tone that richard was not meant to hear while mi dona leonor remains to me there is something saintly and softening still in this world  heaven help meay and all my foeswere she gone from it too    chapter viiirichards wraith    no distance breaks the tie of blood brothers are brothers evermore nor wrong nor wrath of deadliest mood that magic may oerpowerchristian year  it was nearly dark when the prince and the page landed on the island and found the tents already set up in their due order and rank according to the discipline that no one durst transgress where edward was the commander  richard attended him to his pavilion and being there dismissed until suppertime crossed the square space which was always left around the royal banner to the tent at the southern corner which was regularly appropriated to the pages use  on lifting its curtain he was however dismayed to see a kirtle there and imagining that he must have fallen upon the ladies quarters he was retreating with an apology when the sharp voice of dame idonea called out oh yes master page tis you that are at home here  i was merely tarrying till twas the will of one of you to come in and look to the poor child  and little john of dunster called from a couch of mantles richard oh is it he at last  it is i said richard advancing into the light of a brass lamp hung by chains from the top of the tent  this is kind indeed lady but is he indeed so ill at ease  how should he be otherwise with none of you idlepated pages casting a thought to him  i was grieved to leave himbut the prince summoned me began richard  beshrew thee  tell me not of princes as though there were no one whom thou couldst bid to have a care of the little lad  i did bid piers richard made another attempt  piers quotha  why didst not bid the jackanapes that sits on the luggage  a proper warder for a sick babe  i am no babe here burst out john i am twelve years old come martinmas and i need no tendance but richards  ha ha  so those are all the thanks we ladies get when we are not young and fair laughed dame idonea rather amused  i want no women young or old petulantly repeated john i want richardlift me up richard take away this cloak  for his life no returned the dame he has the heats and the chills on him and to let him take cold would be mere slaughter  alas said richard i hoped nothing ailed him but the sea and that landing would make all well  as if the sea ever made a child shiver and burn by turns  nay tis the trick of the sun in these parts  strange that the sun himself should be a mere ally of the infidel  i tell thee if the child is ever to see dunster again thou must watch him well keep him from the sun by day and the chill by night or hell be like the poor creatures in the french camp out there whom i suppose you found in fine case  alack yes lady  ive seen it many a time and all their disorders will be creeping into our camp next  tell me is it even as they told us one king dead and the other dying  richard began to wonder whether he should ever get her out of his tent for she insisted on his telling her every possible particular who had died who had lived who was sick who well and as from the close connection between the english french and sicilian courts whose queens were all sisters she knew who every one was and accounted for the history of each person she inquired after back to the last generationhappy if it were not to the thirdher conversation was not quickly over  she ended at last by desiring richard to give her patient some of a febrifuge which she had brought with her every two hours and when it was all spent or in case of any change in the boys state to summon her from the ladies tent adding however but whats the use of leaving a pert springald like thee in charge  thou wilt sleep like a very dormouse ill warrant  id best call mother jugge  oh no no cried john to whom the attendance of mother jugge would have been a worse indignity than the being nursed by dame idonea let me have no one but richard  richard knows all i wantrichard leave me not again  ay ay a little lad ever hangs to a bigger were he to torture the life out of him  small thanks for us women after our good looks be past  but ill look in on the child in early morn thanks or no thanks for i know his mother well and if i can help it the hyenas shall not make game of his bones as i hear them doing by the french yonder  john strove to say that indeed he thanked her and had been infinitely comforted and refreshed by her care and that all he meant was to express his distaste to mother jugge the lavender ie laundress and his desire for richard fowens company but he was little attended to and apparently more than half offended the brisk old lady trotted away  that island was a dreary place without a tree or any shelter from the glare of sun and sea whose combined influences threatened blindness sunstroke or at the very least blistered the faces of those who stepped beyond their tents by day  the princes orders however strictly confined his army within its bounds except that at twilight parties were sent ashore for water and provisions under strict orders however to hold no parley with any one from the french or sicilian camps lest they should bring home the infection of the pestilence and always under the command of some trustworthy knight able and willing to enforce the command  the prince himself refused all participation in the counsels of charles of anjou and confined himself like his men entirely to the fleet and island  charles contrived to spread a report that his displeasure was solely due to his disappointment at being balked of fighting with the tunisians and that instead of indignant grief at the perversion of the wrecked crusade he was only showing the sullenness of an aggrieved swordsman  even young philippe le hardi a dull heavy ignorant youth was led to suppose this was the cause of his offence and though daily inquiries were sent through the genoese crews for his health he made no demonstration of willingness to see his cousin of england  thus richard had no opportunity of ascertaining whether there were any basis for the strange impression he had received in st louiss deathchamber  it would have been an act of disobedience not soon overlooked by the prince had one of his immediate suite transgressed his commands and indeed so strict was the discipline that it would scarcely have been possible to make the attempt  besides richards time was entirely engrossed between his duties in attending on the prince and his care of little john of dunster who had a sharp attack of fever and was no doubt only carried through it by the experienced skill of dame idonea osbright and by richards tender nursing  somehow the dames heart was not won even by the elder pages dutiful care and obedience to all her directions  partly she viewed him as a rival in the affections of the patientwho poor little fellow would in his companions absence be the child he was and let her treat him like his mother or old nurse chattering to her freely about home and his homesick longings whereas the instant any male companion appeared he made it a point of honour to be the manly warrior and crusader just succeeding so far as to be sullen instead of plaintive though when left to richard he could again relax his dignity and become natural and affectionate  but besides this species of jealousy richard suspected that lady osbright knew or at least guessed his own parentage and disliked him for it accordingly  she had never forgotten the distress and degradation of his mothers stolen marriage nor forgiven his father for it she had often stung the proud heart of his brother henry when he shared the nursery of his cousins the princes and her sturdy english dislike of foreigners and her strong narrow personal loyalty had alike resulted in the most vehement hatred of the earl of leicester whose head she would assuredly have welcomed with barbarous exultation worthy of her danish ancestors  little chance then was there that she would regard with favour his son under a feigned name fostered in the princes own court and camp  she was a constraint and almost a vexation to richard and he heartily wished that the boys recovery would free his tent from her the boy did recover favourably in spite of all the discomforts of the island and was decidedly convalescent when after nearly ten days isolation on the island edward drew out his whole force upon the shore to do honour to the embarkation of the relics of louis ix it was one of the most solemn and melancholy pageants that could be conceived  a wide lane of mailed soldiers was drawn up sicilians and provencals on the one side and on the other english and the knights of the two orders  all stood or sat on horseback in shining steel guarding the way along which were carried the coffins  in memory perhaps of louiss own words i your leader am going first his remains headed the procession closely followed by those of his young son and behind it marched his two brothers charles and alfonse and his soninlaw the king of navarre the two latter already bearing the seeds of the fatal malady and the three english princes edward edmund and henry of almayne each followed by his immediate suite  the long line of coffins of french counts and nobles whose lives had in like manner been sacrificed brought up the rear and alas how many nameless dead must have been left in the ruins  each coffin when brought to the shore was placed in a boat and with muffled oars transplanted to the vessel ready to receive it while the troops remained drawn up on the shore  the procession that ensued was almost more mournful  it was still of biers but these were not of the dead but of the living and again the foremost was the king of france while next to him came his sister the queen of navarre  edward went down to his litter as it was brought on the beach and offered him his arm as he feebly stepped forth to enter the boat  philippe looked up to his tall cousin and wrung his hands as he murmured alas what is to be the end of all this  edward made kind and cheerful reply that things would look better when they met at trapani and then almost lifted the young king into his boat poor youth he had not yet seen the end  he was yet to lose his wife his brotherinlaw and his uncle and aunt ere he should see his home again  richard and hamlyn de valence as part of the princes train had moved in the procession and they were for the rest of the day in close attendance on their lord conveying his numerous orders for the embarkation of the troops on the morrow on their return to sicily it was not till nightfall that richard returned to his tent where john of dunster was sitting on the sand at the door eagerly watching for him  well jack my lad how hast thou sped asked he advancing  couldst see our doleful array  is it thou indeed this time said the boy catching at his cloak  why who should it be  thy wraith  thy doubleganger has been here richard  what dreaming again  no no  i am well i am strong  but this is the land of enchantment  thou knowst it is  did we not see a fleet of fairy boats sailing on the sea and a leaf eat up a fly here on this very tent pole  and did not the fay morgaine show us towns and castles and churches in the sea  thou didst not call me lightheaded then richard thou sawest it too  but this wraith of mine  where didst see it  in this tent  i was lying on the sand trying if i could make it hold enough to build a castle of it when the curtain was put back and there thou stoodest richard  well did i speak or vanish  oh thou spakesti mean the thing spake and it said is this the tent of the young lord of montfort  how nowwhat have i said  whom did he ask for demanded richard breathlessly  montfortyoung lord de montfort replied john i know it was for he said it twice over  and what didst thou answer  what should i answer  i said we had no montforts here for they were all dishonoured traitors slain and outlawed  richard could not restrain a sudden indignant exclamation that startled the boy  every one says so  my father says so he returned somewhat defiantly  not of the earl said richard recollecting himself  he said every one of the young montforts was a foul traitor and mansworn tyrant as bad as king john had been ere the charter repeated john hotly and their father was as bad since he would give no redress  thou knowst how they served us in somerset and devon  i have heard i have heard said richard cutting short the story and controlling his own burning pain glad that the darkness concealed his face  no more of that but tell me what said this stranger  thou thinkest it was really a stranger and not thy wraith said john anxiously  i hope it was for dame idonea said if it were a wraith it betokened that thou wouldst notlive longand oh richard  i could not spare thee  and the little fellow came nestling up to his friends breast in an access of tenderness such as perhaps he would have disdained save in the darkness  did dame idonea see him asked richard  no but she came in soon after he had vanished  vanished  what like fay morgaines castles  tell me in sooth john it imports me to know  what did this stranger when thou spakest thus of the house of montfort  he answered said john he did not answer courteouslyhe said that i was a malapert little ass and demanded again where this young montforts tent was  so then i said that if a montfort dared to show his traitors face in this camp the prince would hang him as high as judas for i wanted to be rid of him richard it was so dreadful to see thy face and hear thy voice talking french and asking for dead traitors  french said richard  methought thou knewst no french  ii have heard it long now mores the pity faltered john and and id have spoken anything to be rid of that shape  and wert thou rid  what befell then  it cursed the prince and king and all of them said john with a shudder it looked black and deadly and i crossed myself and said the blessed name and no doubt it writhed itself and went off in brimstone and smoke for i shut my eyes and when i looked up again it was gone  gone  didst look after him  oh no  earthly things are all food for a brave mans sword said master john drawing himself up very valiantly but wraiths and things from beneaththey do scare the very heart out of a man  and i lay i dont know how till dame idonea came in and she said either the foul fiend had put on thy shape because he boded thee ill or it was one of the traitor brood looking for his like  tell me john said richard anxiously surely he was not in all points like me  had he our english white cross  i cannot say as to the cross said john meseemed it was all you yourselfand that was allonly i thought your voice was strange and hollowandnow i think of ityeshe was beardedbrown bearded and with a sudden thought stand up prithee in the opening of the tent and then taking his post where he had been sitting at the time of the apparition he was not so tall as thou art  thy head comes above the fold of the curtain and his i know did not touch it for i saw the light over it  then thou dost not think it was thy wraith he added anxiously  i think my wraith would have measured me more exactly both in stature and in age said richard lightly  but how did leonillo comport himself  he brooks not a stranger in general and dogs cannot endure the presence of a spirit  ah but he fawned upon this one and thrust his nose into his hand said john and i think he must have run after him for it was so long ere he came back to me that i had feared greatly he was gone and oh richard then i must have gone too  i could never have met you without leonillo  by this time richard had little doubt that the visitor must have been one of his brothers simon or guy who were not unlikely to be among the provencals in the army of charles of anjou  he had not been thought to resemble them as a boy but he had observed how much more alike brothers appear to strangers than they do to their own family and he knew by occasional observations from the prince as well as from his brother henrys recognition of his voice that the old montfort characteristics must be strong in himself  he would not however avow his belief to john of dunster  secrecy on his own birth had been enjoined on him by his uncle the king and disobedience to the old mans most trifling commands was always sharply resented by the prince nor was the boys view of the house of montfort very favourable to such a declaration  richard really loved the brave little fellow and trusted that some day when the discovery must be made it would be coupled with some exploit that would show it was no name to be ashamed of  so he only told the boy that he had no doubt the stranger was a foreign knight who had once known the old leicester family but bade him mention the circumstance to no one  he feared however that the caution came too late since dame idonea was not only an inveterate gossip but was likely to hold in direful suspicion any one who had been inquired for by such a name  the personal disappointment of having missed his brother was great richard was very lonely  the princes and hamlyn de valence were the only persons who knew his secret and both by prince edmund and de valence he was treated with indifference or dislike  edward himself though the object of his fervent affection and his protector in all essentials was of a reserved nature and kept all his attendants at a great distance  on very rare occasions when his feelings had been strongly stirredas in the instance of his visit to his uncles deathchamberhe might sometimes unbend and momentary flashes from the glow of his warm deep heart went further in securing the love and devotion of those around him than would the daily affability of a lower nature but in ordinary life towards all concerned with him except his nearest relations he was a strict cold grave disciplinarian ever just though on the side of severity and stern towards the slightest neglect or breach of observance nor did he make any exception in favour of richard  if the youth seldom received one of his brief annihilating reproofs it was because they were scarcely ever merited but he had experienced that any want of exactitude in his duties was quite as severely visited as if he had not been the princes close kinsman romantically rescued by him and placed near his person by his special desire  and eleanor with all her gentle courtesy and kindness was strictly withheld by her husband from pampering or cockering his pages nor did she ever transgress his will  the atmosphere was perhaps bracing but it was bleak  and there were times when richard regretted his acceptance of the princes offer and yearned after family ties equality and freedom  simon and guy had never been kind to him but at least they were his brothers and with them disguise and constraint would be overhe should too be in communication with his mother and sister  he was strongly inclined to cast in his lot with them and end this life of secrecy and distrust from all around him save one and his loyal love ill requited even by that one  it grieved him keenly that one of his brothers should have been repulsed from his tent an absolutely famished longing for fraternal intercourse gained possession of him and as he lay on his pallet that night in the dark he even shed tears at the thought of the greeting and embrace that he had missed  still he had hopes for the future  there must be meetings and possibilities of inquiries passing between the three armies and he would let no opportunity go by  the next day however there was no chance  the english troops were embarked in their vessels and after a short and prosperous passage were again landed at trapani the western angle of sicily  the french had sailed first but were not in harbour when the english came in and the sicilians who had brought up the rear arrived the next day but still there was no tidings of the french  towards the evening however the royal vessel bearing philippe iii came into harbour and all the rest were in sight when at sunset a frightful storm arose and the ships were in fearful case  many foundered many were wrecked on the rocky islets around the port and the french army was almost as much reduced in numbers as it had been by the plague of carthage  charles of anjou remained himself in the town of trapani but knowing the evils of crowding a small space with troops he at once sent his men inland and richard was again disappointed of the hope of seeing or hearing of his brothers for the prince still forbade all intercourse with the shattered remnant of the french army justly dreading that they might still carry about them the seeds of the infection of the camp  the three heads of the crusade however met in the castle of trapani to hold council on their future proceedings  the place was the statechamber of the castle  each prince had brought with him a single attendant and the three stood in waiting near the door in full view of their lords though out of earshot  it was an opportunity that richard could not bear to miss of asking for his brothers unheard by any of those english ears who would be suspicious about his solicitude for the house of montfort  a livelylooking neapolitan lad was the attendant of king charles and in spite of all the perils of attempting conversation while thus waiting richard hadwhile the princes were greeting one another and taking their seatsventured the question whether any of the sons of the english earl of leicester were in the sicilian army  of earl of leicester the italian knew nothing but count of montfort was a more familiar sound  si si vero  sicily had rung with it and count rosso aldobrandini of the maremma toscana had given his only daughter and heiress to the banished english knight guido di monforte who had served in the kings army as a provencal  richards heart beat high  guy a wellendowed count with a castle lands and home  he would have asked where guy now was and how far off was the maremma but the conference between the princes was actually commencing and silence became necessary on the part of their attendants  they could only hear the murmur of voices but could discern plainly the keen looks and animated gestures of charles of anjou the sickly sullen indifference of philippe and the majestic gravity of edward whose noble head towered above the other two as if he were their natural judge  charles was in fact trying to persuade the others to sail with him for greece and there turn their forces on the unfortunate michael palaeologos who had lately recovered constantinople the empire that charles hoped to win for himself the favoured champion of rome  philippe merely replied that he had had enough of crusading he was sick and weary he must go home and bury his father and get himself crowned  charles might be then seen trying a little hypocrisy and telling philippe that his saintly father would only have wished to speed him on the way of the cross  then that trumpet voice of edward whose tones richard never missed answered what is the way of the cross fair uncle  it was well known that louis ix had refused to crusade against christians even greek christians and philippe soon sheltered himself under the plea that had not at first occurred to his dull mind  in effect he laid particulars before his uncle that quickly made it plain that the french army was in too miserable a condition to do anything but return home and charles then addressed his persuasions to edwardstriving to convince him in the first place of the sanctity of a war against greek heretics and when edward proved past being persuaded that arms meant for the recovery of the holy sepulchre ought not to be employed against christians who reverenced it he tried to demonstrate the uselessness of hoping to conquer the holy land even by such a crusade as had been at first planned far less with the few attached to edwards individual banner  long did the king argue on  his low voice was scarcely audible even without the words but edwards brief ringing almost scornful replies never failed to reach richards ear and the last of them was it skills not my fair uncle  for the holy land i am vowed to fight and thither would i go had i none with me but fowen my groom  and withal his eye lit on richard with a look of certainty of response of security that here was one to partake his genuine ardour and of refreshment in the midst of his disgust with the selfish uncle and sluggish cousin  that look that half smile made the youths heart bound once more  yes with him he would go to the ends of the earth  what was the freedom of guys castle to the following of such a lord and leader in such a cause  richard could have thrown himself at his feet and poured forth pledges of fidelity  but in ten minutes he was following home the unapproachable silent cold warrior  and the lack of any outlet for his aspirations turned them back upon themselves with a strange sense of bitterness and almost of resentment  leonillo alone as the creature lay at his feet and looked up into his face with eyes of deep wistful meaning seemed to him to have any feeling for him and leonillo became the recipient of many an outpouring of something between discontent and melancholy leonillo the sole remnant of his home  he burnt for that holy land where he was to win the name and fame lacking to him but there was to be long delay  fain would the prince have proceeded at once to palestine but the genoese from whom in the abeyance of the english navy he had been obliged to hire his transports absolutely refused to sail for the east until after the three winter months and he was therefore obliged to remain in sicily  king charles invited him to spend christmas at the court at syracuse or naples in hopes perhaps of persuading him to the greek expedition but edward was far too much displeased with the angevin to accept his hospitality recollecting perhaps that such a sojourn had been little beneficial to his great uncle coeur de lions army  he decided upon staying where he was in the remotest corner of sicily and keeping his three hundred crusaders as much to themselves and to strict military discipline as possible maintaining them at his own cost and avoiding as far as he could all transactions with the cruel and violent provencal adventurers with whom charles had filled the island  thus richard found his hopes of obtaining further intelligence about his brothers entirely passing away  he did indeed venture on one day saying to the prince my lord i hear that my brother guy hath become a neapolitan count  a tuscan robber would be nearer the mark coldly replied edward  and added richard methought while the host is in winter quarters i would venture on craving your license my lord to visit him  thou hast thy choice richard answered the prince with grave displeasure loyalty and honour with me or lawlessness and violence with thy brother  both cannot be thine  and returning to his study of the lais of marie de france he made it evident that he would hear no more and left richard to a sharp struggle in which hot irritation and wounded feeling would have carried him away at once from the stern superior who required the sacrifice of all his family and gave not a word of sympathy in return  it was the crusading vow alone that detained the youth  he could not throw away his pledge to the wars of the cross and it was plain that if he went now to seek out guy he should never be allowed to return to the crusading army  but that vow once fulfilled proud edward should see that not merely sufferance but friendliness was needed to bind the son of his fathers sister to his service  the brother at bednall green was right this bondage was worse than beggary  nor under the influence of these feelings had richards service the alacrity and affection for which it had once been remarkable  the prince rebuked his shortcomings unsparingly and thus added to the sense of injury that had caused them hamlyn de valence sneered and dame idonea took good care to point out both the youths neglects and his sullenness and to whisper significantly that she did not wonder considering the stock he came of  a soothing word or gentle excuse from the kindhearted princess were the only gleams of comfort that rendered the present state of things endurable  just after christmas arrived a vessel with reinforcements from home among them came a small body of hospitaliers with the novice raynal at their head now a fullblown knight in dazzling scarlet and white as sir reginald ferrers  richard at once recognized him when he came to present himself to the prince and was very desirous of learning whether he knew aught of that other brother so mysteriously hidden in obscurity  sir raynal on his side seemed to share the desire he exchanged a friendly glance with the page and when the formality of the reception was over sought him out saying i have a greeting for you master fowen  from sir robert darcy asked richard  how fares it with the kind old knight  excellent well  nay nothing fares amiss with father robert said the young knight smiling  everything is the very best that could have befallen himto hear him speak  he is the very sunshine of the spital and had he been ordered on this crusade i think all the hamlets round would have risen to withhold him  ah said richard hoping he was acting indifference said he aught of the little maiden with the blind father  pretty bessee and blind hal of bednall green  verily that was the purport of my message  the poor knave hath been sorely sick and more cracked than ever this autumn insomuch that father robert spent whole nights with him and though he be better now and as much in his senses as eer he will be such another access is like to make an end of him  now father robert saith that you sir page know who the poor man is by birth and that he prays you to send him word what had best be done with the child in case either of his death or of his getting so frenzied as to be unable to take care of her  send him word repeated richard in perplexity  we shall certainly have some one returning soon to the spital replied sir raynal  indeed methinks some of the princes will be like to return for the old king of the romans is failing fast and king henry implored that the prince of almayne would come to hearten him  then must i write to sir robert said richard mine is scarce a message for word of mouth  so he said it was like to be returned the knight and he took thought to send you a slip of parchment knowing he said that such things are not wont to be found in a crusaders budget  moreover if ink be wanting he bade me tell you that theres a fish in these seas with many arms and very like the foul fiend that carries a bag of ink as good as any scrivener s  i have seen the monster said richard who had often been down to the beach to see the unlading of the fishermens boats and to share little john of dunsters unfailing marvel that the mediterranean should produce such outlandish creatures so alien to his bristol channel experiences  and the very next time the boats came in richard made his way to the shore on the beautiful rocky broken coast and presently encountered a sepia which fully justified sir roberts comparison lying at the bottom of a boat  the fisherman intended it for his own dinner when all his choicer fish should have gone to supply the fridays meal of the english chivalry and he was a good deal amazed when the young gentleman making his provencal as like sicilian as he could began to traffic with him for it and at last made him understand that it was only its inkbag that he wanted  the said ink secured in a shell was brought home by richard together with a couple of the largest seabirds quills that he could findand which he shaped with his dagger as best he might in remembrance of father adam de mariscos writing lessons  he meditated what should be the language of his letter which was not likely to be secure from the eyes of the few who could read it and finally decided that english was the tongue known to the fewest readers who if they knew letters at all were sure to be acquainted with french and latin  on a strip of parchment then about nine inches long and three wide he proceeded to indite in upright cramped letters with many contractions nearly in such terms as these    reverend and knightly father  the good ghostly father and knight sir raynald ferrers hath borne to me your tidings of my brothers sickness and of all your goodness to himwhereof i pray that our blessed lady and good st john may reward you for i can only pray for you  touching his poor little daughter in case of his death or frenzy which the saints of their mercy forefend i would entreat you of your goodness to place her in some nunnery but without making known her name and quality until my return so heaven bring me home safe  but an if i should be slain in this eastern land then were it most for the little ones good to present her to the gracious lady princess by whom she would be most lovingly and naturally cared for and would be more safe than with such as might shun to own her rights of blood and heirship  commend me to my brother if so be that he cares to hear of me and tell him that guy hath wedded the lady of a castle in the land of italy  and so praying you ghostly father for your blessing i greet you well and rest your grateful bedesman and servant  richard of leicester  given at the princes camp at drepanum in the realm of sicilia on the octave of the epiphany in the year of grace mcclxx and so our lord have you heartily in his keeping   letterwriting was a mighty task and richards extemporary implements were not of the best  he laboured hard over his composition kneeling against a chest in the tent  when at length he raised his head he encountered a face full of the most utter amazement  little john of dunster had come into the tent and stood gazing at him with open eyes and gaping mouth as if he were perpetrating an incantation  richard could not help laughing  why jack dost think i am framing a spell for thee  writing gasped john relieving his distended mouth by at length closing it  wherefore not  did not i see the chaplain teaching thee to write at guildford  aybut that was when i was a babe  writing  why my father never writes  but the prince does  thou hast seen him write  come now added richard  if thou wilt i will help thee to write a letter to send thy greetings home to dunster  thy father and mother will be right glad to hear thou hast scaped that african fever  theytheyd think me no better than a french monk said john and none of them could read it either  ill never write  my grandsire only set his cross to the great charter  and john retreatedin fear perhaps that richard would sully his manhood with a writing lesson  the letter was rolled up in a scroll bound with a silken thread and committed to the charge of sir raynald ferrers who was going shortly to be commandery of his order at castel san giovanni whence he had no doubt of being able to send the letter safely to sir robert darcy at the grand priory  it would perhaps have been more expeditious to have intrusted the letter to one of the suite of prince henry of almayne who had been recalled by the tidings of the state of his fathers health but richard dreaded betraying his brothers secret too much to venture on confiding the missive to any of this partynone of whom were indeed likely to wish to oblige him  hamlyn de valence was going with henry as his esquire and his absence seemed to richard like the beginning of better days    chapter ixash wednesday    mostrocci un ombra da l un canto sola dicendo colui feese in grembo a dio lo cuor chen su tamigi ancor si cola dante  inferno  shrovetide had come and the prince had before leaving trapani been taking some share in the entertainments of the carnival  personally his grave reserve made gaieties distasteful to him and the disastrous commencement of the crusade weighed on his spirits  but when state and show were necessary he provided for them with royal bounty and magnificence and caused them to be regulated with the admirable taste of that age of exceeding beauty in which he lived  thus in this festal season banquets were provided and military shows took place for the benefit of the sicilian nobility and of the citizens of trapani on such a scale that the english rose high in general esteem and many were the secret wishes that edmund of lancaster rather than charles of anjou had been able to make good the grant from the pope  splendid were the displays and no slight toil did they involve on the part of the immediate train of the prince few in number as they were and destitute of the appliances of the resident court  richard hurrying hither and thither and waiting upon every one had little of the diversion of the affair but he would willingly have taken treble the care and toil in the relief it was to be free from the prying mistrustful eyes of hamlyn de valence  looking after little john of dunster was however no small part of his trouble the urchin was so certain to get into some mischief if left to himself now treading on a ladys train now upsetting a flagon of wine now nearly impaling himself upon the point of a whole spitful of ortolans that were being handed round to the company now becoming uncivilly deaf upon his french ear  altogether it was a relief to richards mind when he stumbled upon the little fellow fast asleep even though it was in the middle of the princesss violet velvet and ermine mantle which she had laid down in order to tread a stately measure with sire guillaume de porceles  after all richards exertions that evening it was no wonder that the morning found him fast asleep at the unexampled hour of eight  his wakening was a strange one  his little fellowpage was standing beside him with a strange frightened yet important air  what is the matter john  it is late  is the prince gone to mass has he missed me cried richard starting up in dismay for unpunctuality was a great offence with edward  he is gone to mass said john but before he comes back he came near and lowered his voice hob longbow sent me to say you had better flee  flee  boy why should i flee  are your senses fleeing  o richard cried john his face clearing up then it is not true you are not one of the traitor montforts  if i were a hundred montforts what has that to do with it  then all is well exclaimed the boy  i said you were no such thing  ill tell hob he lied in his throat  if he said i was a traitor verily he did but as to being a montfortbut how now john what means all this  then it is so  o richard richard you cannot be one of them  you cannot have written that letter to warn them to murder prince henry  to murder prince henry richard stood transfixed  not the princes little son  oh no prince henry of almayne  at viterbo  hamlyn de valence saw it  he is come back  it was in the cathedral  o richardat the elevation of the host  guy and simon de montfort fell on him stabbed him to the heart and rushed out  then they came back again and dragged him by the hair of his head into the mire and shouted that so their father had been dragged through the streets of evesham and then they went off to the maremma  and continued the boy breathlessly hob longbow is on guard and he bade me tell you that for love of your father he will let you pass and then you can hide if only you can go ere the prince comes forth  hide  wherefore should i hide  this is most horrible but it is no deed of mine said richard  who dares to think it is  then you are none of them  you had no part in it  i shall tell hob he is a villain  stay said richard laying a detaining hand on the boy  why does hob think me in danger  is anything stirring against me  they allall of poor prince henrys meine that are come back with hamlynsay that you are a montfort too andoh do not look so fiercethat you sent a letter to warn your brethren where to meet and fall on the prince  and the murderers being fled they are keen to have your life and richard you know i saw you write the letter  that you saw me write a letter is as certain as that my name is montfort said richard but i am not therefore leagued with traitors or murderers  in the church saidst thou  oh well that the prince forbade me to visit guy  then you will not flee  no forsooth  i will stay and prove my innocence  but you are a montfort  and i saw you write the letter  did you speak of my having written the letter asked richard pausing  the boy hung his head and muttered something about dame idonea  by this time even if richard had thought of flight it would have been impossible  two archers made their presence apparent at the entrance of the tent and in brief gruff tones informed richard that the prince required his presence  the space between his tent and the royal pavilion was short but in those few steps richard had time to glance over the dangers of his position and take up his resolution though with a certain stunned sense that nothing could be before the member of a proscribed family but failure suspicion and ruin  the two brothers edward and edmund with the earl of gloucester and their other chief councillors were assembled and there were looks of deep concern on the faces of all making edwards more than ever like a rigid marble statue while edmund had evidently been weeping bitterly though his features were full of fierce indignation hamlyn de valence and a few other members of the murdered princes suite stood near in deep mourning suits  richard de montfort said prince edward looking at him with a sorrowful reproachful sternness that went to his heart we have sent for you to answer for yourself on a grave charge  you have heard of that which has befallen  i have heard my lord of a foul crime which my soul abhors  i trust none present here think me capable of sharing in it  whoever dares to accuse me shall be answered by my sword and he glanced fiercely at hamlyn  hold said edward severely no one is so senseless as to accuse you of taking actual part in a crime that took place beyond the sea but there is only too much reason to believe that you have been tampered with by your brothers  then as his brother edmund made some suggestion to him he added is john de mohun of dunster here  yea my lord said the little boy coming forward with a flush on his face and a bold though wistful look but verily richard is no traitor be he who he may  that is not what we wished to ask of you said the prince too sad and earnest to be amused even for a moment  tell us whom you said even now you had seen in the tent you shared with him in africa  i said i had seen his wraith said john  no smile lighted upon the princes features they were as serious as those of the boy as he commented his likenesshis exact likeness you mean  ay said the boy but richard proved to me after that it had been less tall and was bearded likewise  so i hoped it did not bode him ill  worse i fear than if it had in sooth been his double said gloucester to prince edmund  the prince added the question whether this visitor had spoken and john related the inquiry for richard by the name of montfort and his own reply which elicited a murmur of amused applause among the bystanders  the prince however continued in the same grave manner to draw from the little witness his account of richards injunction to secresy and then asked about the letterwriting of which john gave his plain account  the prince then said speak now hamlyn  this then i have to add my lord that i as all the world remarked that richard de montfort consorted much with sir reginald de ferrieres who as we all remember is the son of a family deeply concerned in the mad parliament  by sir reginald on his arrival at castel san giovanni a messenger is despatched bearing letters to the hospital at florence and it is immediately after his arrival there that the two montforts speed from the maremma to the unhappy and bloody mass at viterbo  you hear richard said the prince  i bade you choose between me and your brothers  had you believed me that you could not serve both it had been better for you  i credit not that you incited them to the assassination but your tidings led them to perpetrate it  i cannot retain the spy of the montforts in my camp  my lord said richard at last finding space for speech i deny all collusion with my brothers  i have neither seen spoken with nor sent to them by letter nor word  then to whom was this letter demanded the prince  to sir robert darcy the grand prior of england answered richard  a murmur of incredulous amazement was heard  the purport continued edward  that my lord it consorts not with my duty to tell  look here richard interposed gilbert of gloucester this is an unlikely tale  you can have no cause for secresy save in connection with these brothers and if you will point to some way of clearing yourself of being art and part in this foul act of murder you may be sent scot free from the camp but if you wilfully maintain this denial what can we do but treat you as a traitor  no obstinacy what can a lad like you have to say to good old sir robert darcy that all the world might not know  my lord of gloucester said richard i am bound in honour not to reveal the matters between me and sir robert i can only declare on the faith of a christian gentleman that i have neither had nor attempted to have any dealings with either of my brothers guy or simon and if any man says i have i will prove his falsehood on his body  and richard flung down his glove before the prince  at the same moment hamlyn de valence sprang forward  then richard de montfort i take up the gage  i give thee the lie in thy throat and will prove on thy body that thou art a mansworn traitor in league with thy false brethren  i commit me to the judgment of god said richard looking upwards  my lord said hamlyn have we your permission to fight out the matter  you have said edward since to that holy judgment richard hath appealed  but the prince looked far from contented with the appeal  he allowed the preliminaries of place and time to be fixed without his interposition and when the council broke up he fixed his clear deep eyes upon richard in a manner which seemed to the boy to upbraid him with the want of confidence for which however he would not condescend to ask  richard felt that let the issue of the combat be what it would he had lost that full trust on the part of the prince which had hitherto been his one drop of comfort and if he were dismissed from the camp he should be more than ever desolate for his soul could scarce yet bring itself to grasp the horror of the crime of his brothers  the combat could not take place for two dayswaiting on one in order that hamlyn might have time to rest and recover his full strength after his voyage and the next because it was ash wednesday  in the meantime richard was left solitary under no restraint but universally avoided  the judicial combat did not make him uneasy the two youths had often measured their strength together and though hamlyn was the elder richard was the taller and had inherited something of the plantagenet frame so remarkable in those two   lords of the biting axe and beamy spear   wide conquering edward and lion richard and each believed in the righteousness of his own cause sufficiently to have implicit confidence that the right would be shown on his side  in fact richard soon understood that though prince edward with a sense of the value of definite evidence far in advance of the time and befitting the english justinian had only allowed the charge to be brought against him which could in a manner be substantiated yet that the general belief went much further  proved to be a montfort and to have written a letter he was therefore convicted by universal consent of a league with his brothers for the revenge of their house to have instigated the assassination at viterbo and to be only biding his time for the like act at trapani  even the prince was deeply offended by his silence and imputed it to no good motive trust and affection were gone and richard felt no tie to retain him where he was save his duty as a crusader  let him fail in the combat and the best he could look for would be to be ignominiously branded and expelled  let him gain and he much doubted whether though the ordeal of battle was always respected he would regain his former position  with keen suffering and indignation he rebelled against edwards harshness and distrust  hewho had brought him therewho ought to have known him better  moreover there was the crushing sense of the guilt of his brothers guilt most horrible in its sacrilegious audacity and doubly shocking to the feelings of a family where the grim sanctity of the first simon de montfort and the enlightened devotion of the second formed such a contrast to the savage outrage of him who now bore their name  richard as with bare feet and ashes whitening his dark locks he knelt on the cold stones of the dark norman church at trapani wept hot and bitter tears of humiliation over the family crimes that had brought them so low prayed in an agony for repentance for his brothers and for himself some opening for expiating their sin against at least the generous royal family  o could i but die for my prince and know that he forgave and they repented  only when on his way back to the camp was he sensible of the murmurs of censure at his hypocrisy in joining the penitential procession at all  dame idonea in a complete suit of sackcloth was informing her friends that she had made a vow not to wash her face till the whole adder brood of montfort had been crushed and that she trusted to see the beginning of justice done tomorrow  she had offered a candle to st james to that effect hoping to induce him to turn away his patronage from the family  every one knight or squire shrank away from richard if he did but look towards them and he was seriously discomfited by the difficulty of obtaining a godfather for the combat  no one chose even to be asked lest they might be suspected of approving of the murder of prince henry and the unhappy page reentered his tent with the most desolate sense of being abandoned by heaven and man  fastened upon the pole of the tent by an arrowhead a small scroll of parchment met his eyes  he read in englisha steed and a lance are ready for the lioncel who would rather avenge his father than lick the tyrants feet  a guide awaits thee  some weeks since this might have been a tempting summons but now the sickening sense of the sacrilegious murder and of the life of outlawry utterly unrestrained passed over richard  yet if he should not accept the offer what was before him  a shameful death perhaps if he failed in the ordeal disgrace captivity or expulsion if he succeeded bondage and distrust for ever  some new accusation some deeper fall  there was a low growl from leonillo the hangings of the tent were raised and an archer bending his head said a word with you sir  who art thou demanded richard  hob longbow sir  remember you not old passagesin the forest thereand master adam  richard did remember the archer in the days of his outlaw life in a very different capacity  you were grown so tall sir and so hand and glove with the longshanks that nick dustifoot and i knew not an if it were yourselfbut now your name is out and the wind is in another quarterhe grinned then seeing richard impatient of the approach to familiarity you did not know nick dustifoot  he was one of young sir simons menatarms you see and took to the woods like other folk after kenilworth was given up till stout men were awanting for this crusade  and he knew sir guy when he came to the camp yon by tunis and spake with him moreover he went in the train of him of almayne to viterbo and had speech again with sir simon who gave him this scroll  and if you will meet him at the syrens rock tonight my lord richard he will bring you to those who will conduct you to sir guys brave castle where he laughs kings and counts to scorn  we have the guard and will see you safe past the gates of the camp  the way to liberty was open  richard deliberated  the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion under the princes coldness was wellnigh unbearable  danger faced him for the next day  disgrace was everywhere  should he leave it behind where at least he would not hear and feel it  should he when all had turned from him meet a brotherly welcome  then came back on him the thought of what simon and guy had made themselves the thought of his fathers grief at former doings of theirs which had fallen so far short of the atrocity of this  he knew that his father had rather have seen each one of his five sons slain or helpless cripples like the firstborn than have been thus avenged  nay had he this morning prayed for the pardon of a crime to which he would thus become a consenting party  he looked up resolutely  no hob longbow  hap what hap my part can never be with those who have stained the church with blood  let my brothers know that my heart yearned to them before but now all is over between us  i can only bear the doom they have brought upon me  it was not possible to remain and argue  a tent was a dangerous place for secret conferences and hob longbow could only growl as you will sir  now nor you nor any one else can say i have not done my charge  alack alack sighed richard would that my honour once redeemed hamlyn might make an end of me  but for thee my poor leonillo i have no comforter or friend and he flung his arms round the dogs neck    chapter xthe combat    and now with sae sharp of steele they gan to lay on load sir cauline  heavyhearted and palecheeked with his rigidly observed fast richard armed himself in early morning and set forth to the chapel tent where the previous solemnities had to be observed  he had made up his mind to make an earnest appeal to the earl of gloucester for the sake of the old friendship with his father to become his godfather in the combat as one whose character stood too high to be injured by connection with him  even this plan was frustrated for hamlyn de valence entered led by earl gilbert as his sponsor should he turn to his one other friend the prince himself  nay the prince was umpire and judge  never stood warrior so lonely  little john of dunster crept up to his side and but for fear of injuring the child he would almost have asked him to be his sponsor  at that moment however the tramp of horses feet was heard and sir reginald de ferrieres with his squires galloped up to the tent  the young hospitalier held out his hand cordially  in time i hope said he i have ridden ever since lauds at castel san giovanni hoping to be with you so as to stand by you in this matter  it was kindly done of you said richard tears of gratitude swelling in his eyes as he wrung sir raynalds hand  i have not even a godfather for the fight  how could you know of my need  some of our brethren came over from the camp for our ash wednesday procession and spoke of the stress you were inthat your montfort lineage was out and that you were thought to have writ a letterbut stay theres no time for words methinks heres the prince and all his train  sir raynald went through the solemnity of presenting richard de montfort as about to fight in defence of his own innocence  the prince coldly accepted the presentation  richard knew that sir raynald was deemed anything but a satisfactory sponsor but the young knights hearty sympathy a sort of radiance caught from good old sir robert was too comforting not to be reposed on  each champion then confessed  raynald heard richards shrift and nearly wept over itit was the first the young priestly knight had received and he could scarcely clear his voice to speak the words of absolution  even as they left the confessional he grasped richards hand and said cast in thy lot with us  st john will find thee father and home and brethren  and a gleam of joy and hope flashed on the youths heart and shone brighter as he participated in the solemn mass in preparation for the combat  this over each champion made oath of the justice of his quarrel in the hands of his godfather before the prince  hamlyn de valence swearing that to the best of his belief richard de montfort was a traitor in league with his brothers and art and part in the murder of prince henry of almayne and offering to prove it on his body while on the other hand richard swore that he was a true and faithful liegeman to the king free from all intercourse with his brethren and sackless of the death of prince henry  then each mounted on horseback the trumpets sounded the sponsors led them to their places and the princes clear voice exclaimed and so god show the right  one glance of pitying sympathy would have filled richards arm with fresh vigour  the two youths closed with shivered lances and horses reeling from the shock  backing their steeds each received a fresh lance  again they met richard felt the point of hamlyns lance glint against his breastplate glide down enter make its way into his flesh but at the same instant his lance was pushing driving bearing on hamlyn before him the sheer force in his plantagenet shoulders was telling now the very pain seemed as it were to add to the energy with which he pressed onon till the hostile spear dropped from his own side and hamlyn was borne backwards over the croup of the staggering horse till he fell with crashing ringing armour upon the ground little john clapped his hands and shouted for joy but no one responded  richard leapt down in another second and stood over him  yield thee hamlyn de valence  confess that thou hast slandered me with an ungrounded accusation  hamlyn had no choice  let me rise he said sullenly i will confess so thou letst me open my visor  and richard standing aside hamlyn spoke out in a dogged formal tone i hereby own that by the judgment of heaven richard de montfort hath cleared himself of all share in the foul murder of lord henry whose soul heaven assoilzie  also that he hath disproven the charge of leaguing with his brethren  richard was the victor but where were the gratulations  young johns hearty but slender hurrah was lost in the general silence  the prince reared his stately form and said the judgment of heaven is final  richard de montfort is pronounced free of all penalty for treason in the matter of the death of our dear cousin and is free to go where he will  cold as ice was the princes face  that richard meant murder to henry he had never believed but that he had hankered after his brothers and held dangerous communings with them was evidently still credited and unforgiven  the very form of words was a dismissaland the youths heart was wrung  he stood looking earnestly up as the prince moved from his place without a glance towards him  the next moment raynalds kind hand was on his shoulder and his voice saying well fought brother a brave stroke  come with me thou art hurt  would it were to the death murmured richard dreamily as raynald throwing his arm round him led him away but before they had reached the tent there was a plunging rush and scampering behind them and john of dunster came dashing up  i knew it  i knew it he cried i knew he would overset spiteful hamlyn  hurrah  they cant keep me away now richardnow the judgment of heaven has gone for you  richard smiled and put his gauntleted hand caressingly on the boys shoulder  i was afraid added john that you would think me like the rest of them  miscreants all  not one would shout for youyou the victor  they dont heed the judgment of heaven one jot  and thats what they call being warriors of the cross  if the prince were a trueborn englishman he would be ashamed of himself  but never heed richard  why dont you speak to me  are you angered that i told of the letter  indeed i never guessed  hush varlet said sir raynald see you not that he has neither breath nor voice to speak  if you wish to do him a service hie to our tentsdown yonder to the east where you see the eightpointed cross  i know sir said john perfectly civil on hearing accents as english as his own  and bring up brother bartlemy he is a better infirmarer than i bid him from me bring his salves and bandages  richard was barely conscious when he reached the tent as much from rigid fasting and sleeplessness as from the actual loss of blood his friend disarmed him tenderly and revived him with bread and wine silencing a halfmurmured scruple about lenten diet with the dispensation due to sickness  the wound was not likely to be serious or disabling and the cares of the hospitalier and his infirmarer had presently set their patient so much at ease that he dropped into a sound sleep having scarcely said a word beyond a few faintly uttered thanks since he had fought the combat  at first his sleep was profound but by and by the associations of blows and wounds carried him back to the field of evesham  the wild melee was renewed he heard the voice of his father but always in that strange distressing manner peculiar to dreams of the departed always far away and just beyond his reach ever just about to give him the succour he needed but ever withheld  the thunderstorm that broke over the contending armies roared again in his ears and then again recurred the calm still night when he had lain helpless on the battlefield even the caress of leonillo and his low growl were vividly repeated but as the dog moved it was to richard as if the form of his father rose up in its armour from the dark field and said in a deep hollow voice well fought my son i will give thee knighthood  then richard thought he was kneeling before his father and hearing that same voice saying my son be true and loyal  in the name of god and st james  i dub thee knight of death and looking up he beheld under the helmet not simon de montforts face but the princes  he awoke with a start of disappointmentand there stood edward himself leaning against the tentpole looking down at him  he sprang on his feet scarcely knowing whether he slept or woke but edward said in that voice that at times was so ineffably sweet be still richard i fear me thou hast suffered a wrong and i am come to repair it as far as i can  lay thee down again  and the prince seated himself on the oaken chest while richard after a few words sat down on his couch  is this the letter about which there has been such a coil said edward giving him the scroll in its sepia ink  it is replied richard in amazement and dismay  the only letter thou didst write  the only one repeated richard  and added edward it concerns thy brother henry  richard turned even paler than before and could not suppress a gasp of dismay  my lord make me not forsworn  listen to me richard said edward  my sweet lady gave me no rest about thee  she held that i had withdrawn my trust over lightly for what was no blame to thine heart and that having set thee here apart from thy natural friends we owed thee more notice than i have been wont to think wholesome for untried striplings  others and i among them held that raynald ferrers friendship and countenance showed thee stubbornly set on old connections and many thought the letter to the grand prior darcy a mere excuse  but when hamlyn fell and i still held that thou wert merely cleared from wilful share in the deadly crime of which i had never held thee guilty then she spake more earnestly  she of her own will sent for raynald ferrers to our tent and called me to speak with him sure that even though his family had been our foes he was too honourable a knight to have espoused thy cause without good reason  then it was that he told us of thine interest for the blind beggar whose child thou didst save and of the grand priors message  also as full exculpation of thee he gave me the letter which having failed to find a homebound messenger at san giovanni he had brought back to the camp  and now richard what can i say more than that i did thee wrong and pray thee to give me thy hand in pardon  richard hid his face and sobbed completely overwhelmed by the simple dignity of the humility of such a man as edward  he held the princes hand to his lips and exclaimed oh howhow could i have ever felt discontent or faltered not in truthoh nobut in trust and patience  oh my lord that i could die for you  not yet said edward smiling we have much to do together first and now tell me richard this beggar is indeed henry  richard hung his head  what thou mayst not betray him  i am under an oath my lord  nay i know wellnigh all richard  i did indeed see my dear old comrade laid in evesham church so as it broke my heart to see him bleeding from many wounds and even his hand lopped by the savage mortimers  then as i bent down and gave his brow a last kiss it struck me for a moment that the touch was not that of a dead mans skin  but i looked again at the deadly wounds of head and breast and thought it would be but cruelty to strive to bring back the glimmer of life only toto see the ruin of his house and all that he could not be saved from  o richard to no man in either host could the day of evesham have been so sore as to me who had to sit in the gate to gladden mens hearts like holy king david when he would fain have been weeping for his son  but in early morning came abbot william of whitchurch to my chamber and with much secrecy told me that the corpse of henry de montfort had been stolen from the church by night praying me to excuse that the monks wearied out with the day of alarms and the care of our wounded had not kept better watch  then knew i that some one had been less faithless than i and i hoped that poor henry was at least dying in peace i had never deemed that he could survive  but when i saw thy billet and heard ferrers tale i had no further doubt remembering likewise how strangely familiar was the face of that little one at westminster  yes my lord it was even as a strange wild wilful blind beggar that i found poor henry and heavy was the curse he laid me under should i make him known to you  he calls himself thus a freer and happier man than he could be even were he pardoned and reinstated and he can indulge his vein of mockery  i dare be sworn that consoles him for all said edward nearly laughing  so long as he could utter his gibe henry little recked which way the world passed round him and i trow he has found some mate of low degree that he would be loth to produce in open day  not so my lord  it is so wild a tale of true love that i can sometimes scarce believe a minstrel did not sing it to me  and richard told the history of isabel mortimers fidelity  the prince was deeply touched and then remembered the marked manner in which the baron of mortimer had replied to his inquiry in what convent he had bestowed henry de montforts betrothed  she is dead my lord dead to us  then he added suddenly so that blackeyed babe is the heiress of leicester and all the honours of montfort  it is one of the causes for henrys resolve to be secret said richard  i thought it harsh and distrustful then but he dreaded simons knowledge of her  we will find a way of securing her from simon said the prince but fear not richard henrys secret shall be safe with me  i have kept his secrets before now he added with a smile  only when we are at home againso it please the saints to spare usthou shalt strive to show him cause to trust my lady with his child if he doth not seek to breed her up to scrip and wallet  i see such is thy counsel in this scroll and it is well  how could i say other said richard and now more than ever  i long to thank the gracious princess this very evening  thy wound said the prince  my wound is naught i scarce feel it  then said the prince unless the leech gainsay it it would be as well to be at our pavilion this evening that men may see thou art not in any disgrace  rest then till suppertime  and as he spoke he rose to depart but richard made a gesture of entreaty  so please your grace grant me a few farther words  i sware and truly that i had heard nothing from my brothers when i was accused of writing that letter to them  but see here what yestermorn was pinned to that tentpole  he gave edward the scroll at which the prince looked half smiling so  a dagger in store for me too is there  well my cousins have a goodly thirst for vengeance  hast thou any suspicion how this billet came here  ay my lord and for that cause i would warn you against two of the archers one of whom was in simons troop and went with the late prince to viterbo  i gave them no promise of silence  you spoke with them  with one who was charged to let me through the outposts to a spot where means were provided for bringing me to guy  and thou said edward smiling didst choose to bide the buffet  sir said richard i did indeed long after my brethren when guy had been so near me in africa but now i would far rather die than cast in my lot with them  thou art wise said edward not merely right but wise  i have sent gloucester to my uncle of sicily with such messages that he will scarce dare to leave them scatheless  then at suppertime we meet againin thine own name richard and as my kinsman and esquire thou shalt bear thine own name and arms  i will cause a mourning suit to be sent to theethou art equally of kin with myself to poor henryand shalt mourn him with edmund and me at the requiem to morrow  so will it best be manifest to the camp that we exempt thee from all blame  again he was departing when richard addedthe archers my lordwere it not good to dismiss them  tush said edward tell me not their names  so soon as the wind veers they will be beyond guys reach and if i were to stand on my guard against every man who loved thy father better than mine what good would my life do me  the poor knaves will be true enough when they see a saracen before them  and away went edward to be glanced at as he passed through the camp as a severe hard cruel tyrant  had he only been gay openhearted and careless he might have hung both the guilty archers and a dozen innocent ones into the bargain and yet have never won the character for harshness and unmercifulness that he had acquired even while condoning many a dire offence simply from his stern gravity and his punctilious exactitude in matters of discipline  but the evils of a lax and easygoing court had been so fatal and had produced such suffering that it was no marvel that he had adopted a rule of iron and in the pain and distress of seeing his closest friends the noblest subjects in the realm pushed into a rebellion where he had himself to maintain his fathers cause and then to watch without being able to hinder the meanspirited revenge of his own partizans his manner had acquired that silent reserve and coldness which made him feared and hated by the many while intensely beloved by the few even towards those few it was absolutely difficult to him to unbend as he had done in this hour of effusion towards richard and the youth was proportionably moved and agitated with fervent gratitude and affection  he had scarcely had so happy an evening since he had been a boy at odiham  he was indeed feeble and dizzy at times but with a far from painful languor and the princess enjoying the permission to follow the dictates of her own heart was kind to him with a motherly or sisterly kindness could not bear to receive from him his wonted attendance but made him lie upon the cushions at her feet and when out of hearing of every one talked of the faithful isabel and of pretty bessee on whom she already looked as the companion of her little eleanor whom she had left at home  it might be questioned whether richard did not undergo more in watching little john de mohuns endeavours at waiting than he would have suffered from doing it himself  and not a few dissatisfied glances were levelled at the favoured stripling besides the literally as well as figuratively sour glances of dame idonea  edward being of course unable to betray his real grounds for acquitting richard had only deigned to inform prince edmund that he knew all and was perfectly satisfied  now prince edmund as well as all the old court faction deemed edwards regard for the barons party an unreasonable weakness that they durst not indeed combat openly but which angered them as a species of disaffection to his own cause  the outer world thought him a tyrant but there was an inner world to whom he appeared weakly goodnatured and generous and this inner world thought richard had successfully hoodwinked him  therefore edmund of lancaster desired to adopt hamlyn de valence as his own squire to save him from association with richard and both prince and squire and all the rest of the train made it perfectly evident to the young montfort that he was barely tolerated out of respect for the prince  but richard in his joy could have borne worse than this for the prince had not relaxed in his kindness and made his young cousins wound an excuse for showing him more tenderness and consideration than he would otherwise have thought befitting  moreover an esquire as richard had now become might be in much closer relations of intimacy with his master than was possible to a page and the day that had begun so sadly was like the dawn of a brighter period  sir raynald ferrers had been invited to the princes pavilion but the rules of his order did not permit his joining a secular entertainment in lent and he did not admit either the camp life or the gravity of the princes mourning household as a dispensation however when richard leaning fondly on little johns ready shoulder crossed to his own tent he found his good friend waiting there to attend to his wound which sir raynald professed to regard as an excellent subject to practise upon and likewise to hear whether all had been cleared up and had gone right with him  though he said i could not doubt of it when that fair and lovely princess had taken your matters in hand  tell me richard have you secular men many such dames as that abroad in the world  not many such as she said richard smiling  well i have not spoken to a female thing save perhaps pretty bessee since i went into the spital ten years ago and verily the sound of the ladys voice was to me as if st margaret had begun talking to me  and so wise and clear of wit too  i thought women were featherpated wilful beings from whom there was no choice but to shut oneself up  i trow that now all is well with thee thou wilt scarce turn a thought again towards our brotherhood where to glance at such a being becomes a sin  and raynald crossed himself with an effort to recall his wonted asceticism  ladies love is not like to be mine said richard laughing as one not yet awake to the force of the motive  no  gladly would i be one of your noble brotherhood where alone have i met with kindness but sir raynald my first duty under heaven must be to redeem my fathers name by my service to the prince  my brothers think they uphold it by deadly revenge  i want to show what a true montfort can be with such a master as my father never had  and raynald i cannot but fear that further schemes of vengeance may be afloat  the prince is too fearless to take heed to himself and who is so bound to watch for him as i    chapter xithe view from carmel    on her who knew that love can conquer death    who kneeling with one arm about her king drew forth the poison with her balmy breath       sweet as new buds in springtennyson  a year had elapsed since the crusaders had landed in palestine nazareth had been taken and the christian host were encamped upon the plain before acre according to their princes constant habit of preferring to keep his troops in the open field rather than to expose them to the temptations of the citywhich was alas in a state most unworthy of the last stronghold of latin christianity in the holy land  it was on a scorching june day whitsun tuesday in the exquisite beauty of an early summer in the mountains of the levantwhen the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smellthat richard de montfort was descending the wooded sides of mount carmel  anxious tidings had of late come from england respecting the health of the little prince john and princess eleanor was desirous of offering gifts and obtaining prayers on his behalf on the part of the good fathers of the convent associated with the memory of the great prophet who had raised the dead child to life  she herself however was at the time unfit for a mountain ride and prince edward who was a lay brother of the carmelite order and had fully intended himself to go and offer his devotions for his child was so unwell on that day from the feverish heat of the summer that he could not expose himself to the sun and richard was therefore despatched on the part of the royal pair  he had ascended in the cool of the morning setting forth before sunrise and attending the regular mass  the good fathers would fain have detained him till the heat of the day should be past but his anxiety not to overpass in the slightest degree the time fixed by the prince made him resolved on setting out so soon as his errand was sped  unspeakably beautiful was his ridethrough rocky dells filled with copsewood among which jessamine lilies and exquisite flowers were peeping up and the coney the fawn and other animals made leonillo prick his ears and wistfully seek from his masters eye permission to dash off in pursuit  or the oaks of carmel with many a dark leaved evergreen towered in impenetrable thicket and at an opening glade might be beheld on the northeast that goodly mountain lebanon rising in a thick clothing of wood and beyond in sharp cool softness the white cone of raindistilling hermon  far to the west lay the glorious glittering sheet of the mediterranean but nearer almost beneath his feet was the curving bay and harbour of ptolemais filled with white sails the white city of acre full of fortresses and towers while on the plain beside it green with verdure as richards own home greenwood of odiham lay the white tents of the christian army in so clear an atmosphere that he could see the flash of the weapons of the men on guard and almost distinguish the blazonry of the banners  richard dismounted to gather some roses and jessamine for the princess and to collect some of the curious fossil echini which he believed to be olives turned to stone by the prophet elijah as a punishment to a churlish peasant who refused him a meal  he thought that such treasures would be a welcome addition to the store he was accumulating for the good old grand prior  he gave his horse to hob longbow his only attendant except a young sicilian lad  this same longbow had stuck to him with a pertinacity that he could not shake off and in truth had hitherto justified the princes prediction that he would be a brave and faithful fellow when his allegiance was no further disturbed by the proximity of the outlawed montforts  there had been nothing to lead richard to think he ought to indicate either him or nick dustifoot to the prince as the persons who had been connected with guy in italy  presently leonillo bounded forward and richard became aware of the figure of a man in light armour standing partly hidden among the brushwood but looking down intently into the christian camp  the dog leapt up fawning on the stranger with demonstrations of rapture and he turning in haste stood face to face with richard  here was his exclamation and a grasp was instantly laid upon his sword  simon burst from richards lips at the same moment dost not know me  thou boy and the hold was relaxed  what lucky familiar sent thee hither  whatthou art grown such a huge fellow that i had wellnigh struck thee down for longshanks himself had it not been for thy voice  thou hast his very bearing  simon again repeated richard in his extremity of amazement what dost thou  how camest thou here  whence  that thou shalt soon see said simon  a right free and merry home and company have we up yonderand he pointed towards mount lebanon  thou and guy  no no guy turned craven  could not endure our wanderings in the marshes and hills pined for his wife forsooth fell sick and must needs go and give himself up to the pope so he sings the penitential psalms night and day  and we heard thou wast dead at siena  thou hearest many a false tale said simon  of my death thou shalt judge if thou wilt turn thy horse and ride with me to our hillfort of ain gebel in galilee  they say tis the very one which king david or king herod whichever it was could only take by letting down his menatarms in boxes  i should like to see the boxes that we could not send skimming down the abyss  and a wondrous place they have left usvaults as cool as a convent winecellar fountains out of the rock marble columns  but brother for whom do you hold it  for the king of cyprus or   for myself boy  for king simon an it like you better  none can touch me or my merry band there and a goodly company we are pilgrims grown wiser and runaway captives and druses and bold arabs too  and the choicest of many a heretic armenian merchants caravan is ours and of many a saracen village corn and wine fair dames and damascus blades and arab steeds  nothing has been wanting to me but thee and vengeance and both are i hope on the way  not i certainly said richard shrinking back in horror  ia sworn crusader  tush what are we but crusaders too boy  tis all service against the moslem  thy patron saint sent thee to me today from special care for thy safety  how so exclaimed richard  if peril threaten my lord i must be with him at once  much hast thou gained by hanging on upon him said simon scornfully glancing at richards heels not so much as a pair of gilt spurs  creeping after him like a hound thou hast not even the bones  i have all i seek said richard  i have his brotherly kindness i have the opportunity of redeeming my name  nay i should even regret any honour that took me from the services i now perform simon didst thou but know his love for our father  silence base caitiff thundered simon i know his deeds and that is enough for me  look here meanspirited as thou wert to be taken with his hypocrisy i have pity on thee yet  i would spare thee what awaits thee in the camp  for heavens sake simon dost know of any attack of the emir  the princess must at once be conveyed into the town  as thou art a man a christian speak plainly  foolish lad the infidels are quiet enough  no peril threatens the camp  only if thou wilt run thy head into it thou art like to find it too hot to hold thee  i am afraid of no accusations said richard my lord knows and trusts me  simon laughed a loud ringing scornful laugh  wilful will to water he said  well thou besotted lad if it be not too late when thou getst into the hands of crookbacked edmund and red gilbert remember the way to galilee that is all  i tell thee simon said richard turning round and fully facing him i would rather perish an innocent man by the hands of the provost marshal than darken my soul with thy counsels of blood  o simon  what thy purpose may be i know not but canst thou deem it faithfulness to our father saint as he was to live this dark wild life so utterly abhorrent to him  let those look to that who slew him and made me such as i am returned simon turning from him and gazing steadfastly down into the camp  suddenly a gleam of fierce exultation lighted up his face and again facing richard he exclaimed yes go home tame cringing spaniel and see whether a montfort is still in favour below there see if proud edward is still ready to meet thy fawning with his scornful patronage  see if the honour of a murdered father has not been left in better hands than thine  and when thou hast had thy lesson find the way to ain gebel or ask nick dustifoot  richard with a startled exclamation looked down but could discern nothing unusual in the camp  the royal banner hung in heavy folds over the princes pavilions and all was evidently still in the same noontide repose or rather exhaustion to which the syrian sun reduced even the hardy active englishmen  what mean you he began but simon was no longer beside him  he called but echo alone answered and all he could do was to throw himself on his horse and hurry down the mountain side with a vague presentiment of evil and a burning desire to warn his lord or share his peril  he understood simons position  many of the almost inaccessible rocks where the sons of anak had built their cyclopean fortresses and which had been abodes of almost fabulous beauty and strength in the herodian days had been resorted to again by the crusaders and had served as isolated strongholds whence to annoy the enemy frightfully lawless had in too many instances been the life there led more especially by the levantborn sons of europeans and in the universal disorganization of the kingdom of jerusalem that took place in consequence of the disputed rights of cyprus and hohenstaufen most of them had become free from all control  if the garrisons bore the christian name at all it chiefly was as an excuse for preying on all around but too often they were renegades of every variety of nation drawn together by the vilest passions commanded by some reckless adventurer and paying a species of allegiance to any power that either endangered them or afforded them the hopes of plunder  bloodthirsty and voluptuous alike they were viewed with equal terror by the frank pilgrim the syriac villager the armenian merchant and the saracen hadjiwhose ransom and whose spoil enriched their chambers with all that the licentious tastes of east and west united could desire  there were comparatively few of these nests of iniquity in these latter days of the crusades but some still survived and richard had seen some of their captains with their followers at the siege of nazareth where the atrocities they had committed had been such as to make the english army stand aghast as a member of such a crew simon could hardly fail to find means of attempting that revenge on which it was but too evident that he was still bent and richard as every possible risk rose before him urged his horse to perilous speed down the steep descent and chid every obstacle though in fact the descent which ordinarily occupied two hours for men who cared for their own necks was effected by him in a quarter of the time  he came to the entrenched camp  the entrance where the prince made so strict a point of keeping a sentinel was completely unguarded  the foremost tents were empty but there was a sound as of the murmuring voices of numbers towards the centre of the camp  the next moment he met hamlyn de valence riding quickly and followed by two attendants  hamlyn a moment he gasped  has aught befallen the prince  you were aware of it then said hamlyn checking his horse and looking him full in the face  answer me for heavens sake  is all well with the princes  as well as your house desiresor it may be somewhat better said hamlyn but let me pass  i am on an errand of life or death  so saying hamlyn dashed forwards and richard in double alarm made his way to the space in the centre of the camp where he found himself on the outskirts of a crowd talking in the various tongues of english french and lingua franca  he livesthe good princess the dogs of infidelspoison were the words he caught  he flung himself from his horse and was about to interrogate the nearest man when john of dunster came hurrying towards him from the tents and threw himself upon him sobbing with agitation and dismay  what is it  speak john  the prince  oh if you had but been there  it will not cease bleeding  o richard he looks worse than my father when he came home  let me hear  where  how is he hurt  in the arm and brow said the boy  the arm said richard much relieved  ah but they say the dagger is poisoned  stay richard ill tell you all  dame idonea turned me out of the tent and she will not let any one in  it was thuseven now the prince was lying on the day bed in his own outer tent no one else there save myself  i believe everybody was asleep i know i waswhen nick dustifoot called me and bade me tell the prince there was a messenger from the emir of joppa asking to see him  so the prince roused himself up and bade him come in  he was one of those quickeyed moorishlooking infidels in the big turbans and great goats hair cloaks and he went down on his knees and hit the ground with his forehead and said salam aleikumtraitor that he wasand gave the prince a letter  well the prince muttered something about his head aching so sorely that he could scarce see the writing and had just put up his hand to shade his eyes from the light when the dog was out with a dagger and fell on him  the princes arm being raised caught the stroke you see and that moment his foot was up said john acting the kick and down went the rogue upon his back  and ii threw myself right down over him  did you my brave little fellow  well done of you cried richard  and the prince wrested the dagger out of the rogues hand only he tore his own forehead sorely as the point flew up with the shock and then stabbed the villain to the heartsee how the blood rushed over me  then the prince pulled me up and called me a brave lad and set me on my feet and asked me if i were sure i was not hurt and by that time the archers were coming in when all was over and long robin must needs snatch up a joint stool and have a stroke at the moors head  i trow the prince was wrath with the cowardly clown for striking a dead man  he said i alone had been any aid  well anxiously asked richard gathering intense alarm as he saw that the boys trouble still exceeded his elation even at such commendation as this  but then said john sadly even while he called it nothing there came a dizziness over him  and even then the princess had heard the outcry and came in haste with dame idonea  and so soon as the dame had picked up the dagger and looked well at it and smelt it she said there was poison on it  no sooner did the princess hear that than without one word she put her lips to his arm to suck forth the venom  he was for withholding her but the dame said that was the only safeguard for his life and she lookedoh so imploring  blessings on the sweet princess and true wife cried the menat arms great numbers of whom had gathered round the little eyewitness to hear his account  and so is he saved said richard with a long breath  ah but said john his eyes beginning to fill with tears there is the grand master of the templars come now and he says that to suck the poison is of no avail and that nothing will save him but cutting away the living flesh as i would carve the wing of a bustard and dame idonea says that is just the way king coeur de lion died and the princess is weeping and the wound will not stop bleeding and hamlyn is gone to acre for a surgeon and they are all wrangling and dame idonea boxed my ears at last and said i was gaping there the boy absolutely burst into sobs and tears and at the same moment a growl arose among the archers of curses on the moslem hounds not one shall escape  death to every captive in our hands  nay nay exclaimed richard looking up in horror the poor captives are utterly guiltless  far more justly make me suffer murmured he sadly  all tarred with the same stick said the nearest serve them as they deserve  think added richard if the prince would see no dishonour done to the dead carcase of the murderer himself would he be willing to have ill worked on living men sackless of the wrong  english turning butchersthat were fit work for paynims  no no not one shall live to laugh at our edwards fall burst out the men and a voice among them added sure the young squire seems to know a vast deal about the guilty and the guiltlessthe montfort ay  away with all foes to our edward  best withdraw yourself sir said hob longbow their blood is up baulk them of their prey and they will set on you next  richard just then beheld a person from whose interposition he had much greater hopes namely the earl of gloucester who though still a young man was the chief english noble in the camp and whose special charge the saracen captives were  he hurried towards him and asked tidings of the prince  ill tidings i trow said the earl bitterly  ay richard de montfort you had best take heed to yourself he was your best friend and a sore lookout it is for us all  between the old dotard his father and the poor babes his children england is in woeful plight  would that your fathers wits were among us still  theres some curse on this fools errand of a crusade for here is the sixth prince it hath slain and well if we lose not our princess too  but what is all this uproar  the menatarms my lord said richard fierce to visit the crime on the captives  a good riddance said earl gilbert the miscreants eat as much as ten score yeomen and my knaves are weary with guarding them  if this matter brings all the pagans in palestine on our hands we shall have enough to do without looking after this nest of heathens  but would the prince have it so  i fear me the prince is like to have little will in the matter  no no im not the man to order a butchery but if the honest fellows must needs shed blood for blood im not going to meddle between them and the heathen wolves  assuredly nothing was to be done with the red de clare and richard pushed on with throbbing dismayed heart to the tent dreading to behold the condition of him whom he best loved and honoured on earth the tent was crowded but richards unusual height enabled him to see over the heads of those nearest that edward was sitting on the edge of his couch his wife and dame idonea endeavouring to check the flow of blood from his wound  the elbow of his other arm was on his knee and his head on his hand but the opening of the curtain let in the light he looked up and richard saw how deathly white his face had become and the streaks of blood from the scratch upon his brow he greeted richard however with the look of recognition to which his young squire had now become usednot exactly a smile but a wellsatisfied welcome and though he spoke low and feebly to his brother who stood near him richard caught the words with a thrill of emotion  let him near me edmund  he hath a ready hand and may aid thee sweet wife  thou art wearying thyself  then as richard approached thou hast sped well  i looked not for thee so soon  alack my lord said richard i hurried on to warn you  ah would i had been in time  thy little pupil john did all man could do said edward languidly smiling  but whathast aught in charge to say to me  be brief for i am strangely dizzy  my lord said richard the archers and menatarms are furiously wrath with the saracens  they would wreak their vengeance on the prisoners who at least are guiltless  the knaves exclaimed edward promptly  why looks not gloucester to this  my lord the earl saith that he would not command the slaughter but that he will not forbid it  saints and angels burst forth the prince and to the amazement of all he started at once on his feet and striding through the bystanders to the opening of the tent he looked out on the crowd who were already rushing towards the inclosure where their victims were penned  raising his mighty voice as in a battleday he called aloud to them to halt turn back and hear him  they turned and beheld the lofty form in the entrance of the tent wrapped in a long loose robe which as well as his hair was profusely stained with blood his wan face however making that marble dignity and sternness of his even more awful and majestic as he spoke aloud so men you would have me go down to my grave bloodstained and accursed by the death of guiltless captives  and i pray you what is to be the lot of our countrymen now on pilgrimage to jerusalem if you thus deal with our prisoners taken in war  senseless bloody minded hounds that ye are mark my words  the life of one of you for the life of a saracen captive and should i die i lay my curse on ye all if every man of them be not set free the hour my last breath is drawn  do you hear me ye cravens  unsparing unconciliatory as ever even when most merciful and generous edward turned but reeled as he reentered the tent and his dizziness recurring needed the support of both his brother and richard to lay him down on the couch  the grand master of the temple renewed his assurance that this was a token of the poison and eleanor was unheeded when she declared that her dear lord had been affected in the same manner before his wound ever since indeed the whit sunday when he had ridden home from the great church of st john of acre in the full heat of the sun  dame idonea was muttering the mediaeval equivalent for fiddlesticks as plain as her respect for the temple would allow her  at that moment the leech whom hamlyn had been sent into the town to summon made his appearance and fully confirmed the templars opinion  neither the wizened greek physician nor the dignified templar considered the soft but piteous assurance of the wife that the venom had at once been removed by her own lips as more than mere feminine folly and dame idoneas real experience of knights thus saved and on the other hand of the fatal consequences of rude surgery in such a climate were disregarded as an old womans babble her voice waxed shrill and angry and her antagonists replies in lingua franca mixed with arabic latin and greek rang through the tent till the prince could bear it no longer  peace he said with an asperity unlike his usual stern patience i had liefer brook your knives than your tongues  without further jangling tell me clearly learned physician the peril of either submitting or not submitting to your steel  the greek told with as little tergiversation as was in his nature that he viewed a refusal as certain death but several times dame idonea was bursting out upon him and edward had to hold up his finger to silence her  now kind lady quoth he let me hear the worst you foretell for me from your experience  dame idonea did not spare him either the fate of coeur de lion the dangers of fever and pain and above all of that strange enchantment that binds the teeth together and forbids a man to swallow his food poor eleanor looked at him imploringly all the time but as none of them had ever heard of the circulation of the blood they could not tell that her simple remedy had been truly efficacious and that if it had been otherwise the incisions would now come too late  thus the balance of prudence made itself appear to be on the side of the physician and for him the prince decided  mi dona he said ever his most caressing term for her it must be so  i think not lightly of what thou hast done for me but as matters stand too much hangs upon this life of mine for me not to be bound to run no needless risk for fear of a little pain  if i live and speak now next to highest heaven it is owing to thee and when we came on this holy war sweet eleanor didst thou not promise to hinder me from naught that a true warrior of the cross ought to undergo  and is this the land to shrink from the cross  alas to eleanor the pang was the belief in the uselessness of his suffering and danger  she never withstood his will but physically she was weak and her weeping was piteous in its silence  edward bade his brother lead her away and edmund after the usual fashion vented his own perplexity and distress upon the most submissive person in his way  he assumed more resistance on the part of his gentle sisterinlaw than she made and carrying her from the tent roughly told her silent as she was that it was better that she should scream and cry than all england wail and lament  and so eleanors devoted deed the true saving of her husband has lived on as a mere delusive tradition weakly credited by the romantic while the credit of his recovery has been retained by the knighttemplars leech  not a sound was uttered by the prince while under those hands but when his wife was permitted to return to him she found him in a dead faint and the silver reliquary she had left with him crushed flat and limp between his fingers  richard had given his attendance all the time and for several hours afterwards during which the princess hung over her husband endeavouring to restore him from the state of exhaustion in which he scarcely seemed conscious of anything but her presence  late in the evening some one came to the entrance of the tent and beckoned to the young squire he came out expecting to receive some message but to his extreme surprise found himself in the grasp of the provost marshal  on what charge he demanded so soon as he was far enough beyond the precincts of his tent not to risk a disturbance  by the command of the council  on the charge of being privy to the attempt on the princes life  by whom preferred asked richard  by the lord hamlyn de valence  richard attempted not another word  in effect the condition of the prince seemed to him so hopeless that his most acute suffering at the moment was in the being prevented from ministering to him or watching for a last word or look of recognition  he had no heart for selfvindication even if he had not known its utter futility with men who had been prejudiced against him from the outset  nor had he the opportunity for the provost marshal conducted him at once to the tent where he was to be in ward for the night a heap of straw for him to lie upon and a guard of half a dozen archers outside and there was he left to his despairing prayers for the princes life he could dwell on nothing else there was no room in his mind for any thought but of that glory of manhood thus laid low and of the anguish of the sweet face of the princess  sir there was a low murmur near himnow is the time  i have brought an archers gown and barrett and we may easily get past the yeomen  these last words were uttered as on hands and knees a figure whose dark outline could barely be discerned crept under the border of the tent  who art thou hastily inquired richard  you should know me siri have done you many a good turn and served your house truly  talk not of truth thou traitor said richard recognizing dustifoots voice  knowst thou that but for the princes clemency thou hadst a year ago been out of the reach of the cruel evil thou hast now shared in  nay now lord richard returned the man you should not treat thus an honest fellow that would fain do you service  i need no service such as thine returned richard  thy service has made my brothers murderers and brought ruin and woe unspeakable upon the land  beshrew me muttered the man but one would have thought the young damoiseau would have had more feeling about his fathers death  but i swore to do sir simons bidding so that is no concern of mine and he bade me if any one strove to lay hands on you sir to lead you down to kishon brook where he will meet us with a plump of spears  meet him then said richard and say to him that if from his crag above on carmel he sees me hung on the gallows tree as a traitor he may count that i am willingly offered for our family sin  ay and that if he thinks an old mans hairs brought down to the grave a brokenhearted wife helpless orphans and a land without a head to be a grateful offering to my father let him enjoy the thought of how the righteous earl would have viewed all the desolation that will fall on england without the oneone scholar who knew how to value and honour his lessons  hush  sir hastily interposed dustifoot but it was too late the murmur of voices had already been caught by the guard and quick as he was to retreat their torches discovered him as he was creeping out and he was dragged back by the feet and the light held up to his face while many voices proclaimed him as the rogue who had been foremost in admitting the assassin to the royal tent  it was from the tumult of voices that richard first understood that on examining the body of the murderer it had been ascertained that he was neither a bedouin nor one of the assassins belonging to the old man of the mountain but an european probably a provencal and this added to hamlyns representation of richards words together with what the earls of lancaster and gloucester recollected had directed the suspicion upon himself  and here was as it seemed undeniable evidence of his connection with the plot  the miserable dustifoot vainly imploring his intercession was tied hand and foot and the guard returned to the outside of the tent except one archer who thought it needful to bring in his torch and keep the prisoners in sight  the night passed wearily and with morning dustifoot was removed to a place of captivity more befitting his degree but of the prince richard only heard that he continued to be in great danger  no attempt on the part of the council was made to examine their prisoner and richard suspected as time wore on that no one chose to act in this time of suspense for fear of incurring the lionlike wrath of edward in the event of his recovery but that in case of his death small would be his own chances of life  death had fewer horrors for the lonely boy than it would have had for one with whom life had been brighter  in battle for the cross or in shielding his princes life it would have been welcome but death branded with vile ingratitude as a traitor to that master was abhorrent  shrunk up in the corner of the tent half asleep after the nights vigil yet too miserable for the entire oblivion of rest richard spent the day in dull despair listening for sounds without with an intensity of attention that seemed to pervade every limb and yet with snatches of sleep that brought dreams more intolerable than the reality which they yet seemed to enhance  at last however the sultry closeness of the day subsided the angelus bell sounded far off from the churches and convents of acre and near from the chapel tent and the devotions that it proclaimed were not ended when richard heard the cry of the crusading watch remember the holy sepulchre  yes the holy sepulchre might not be recovered and reached by the english army but it might still be remembered and therein be laid down all struggles of the will all rebellious agony at the being misunderstood misused vituperated all suffering might there be offered up nor could the most ignominious death stand between him and the thought of that holy tomb and of the joy beyondson of a man who sorely tried had drawn his sword against his king brother of wilful murderers perhaps to die innocent was the best fate he could hope and in accordance with the doctrine of his time he hoped that his death might serve as a part of a sacrifice for the family guilt  nay the prince gone wherefore should he wish to live  dont you see  the princes signet  he said i should bring him clown that thou art hast no eyes nor ears  what dont you know me i am the young lord of dunster the princes footpage  it is his command  and amid some perplexed mutterings from the guard little john of dunster burst into the tent  up up he cried you are to come to the prince instantly  how fares herichards one question of the day  sorely ill at ease said the boy but he wants you he calls for you and no one would tell him where you were so i spoke out at last and he bade me take his ring and bring you for tis his pleasure  come now for the earl of lancaster and hamlyn are gone to take the princess to acre and my lord of gloucester has taken his red head off to sleep and no one is there but old raymond and some of the grooms  the princess gone  ay and dame idonea with her  so we shall hear no more of king coeur de lion  hamlyn swears she was on his crusade  do you think she was richard nobody knows how old she is  richard was a great deal too anxious to ask questions himself to be able to answer this query  and as the yeomen let him pass them only begging him to bear him out with the princes he hastily gathered from the boy all that he could tell  the prince had it appeared been in a most suffering state from pain and fever all the night and the ensuing day and had hardly noticed any one but his devoted wife who had attended him unremittingly until with the cooler air of evening she saw him slightly revived but was herself so completely spent and so unwell as to be incapable of opposing his decision that she should at once be carried into the city to receive the succours her state demanded  when she was gone edward who had perhaps sought to spare her the sight of his last agony had roused himself to make his will and choose protectors for his father and young children and it was after this that his inquiries became urgent for richard de montfort  he was at length answered by the indignant little footpage and greatly resenting the action of the council he had as john said frowned and spoken like himself and sent the little fellow in quest of the young esquire  the tent was nearly dark and richard could only see the outline of the tall form laid prostrate but the voice he had feared never to hear again spoke though slowly and wearily and a hand was held out  welcome cousin he said  poor boy they must needs have at thee ere the breath was out of my body but for that at least they shall wait and longer if my word and will can avail after i am gone what has given them occasion against thee richard  alas my lord you are too ill at ease to vex yourself with my matters  nay but i must see thee righted richard there are services for thee to do to me  hark thee  i have bequeathed thee thy mothers lands at odiham which my father gave to me  so mayest thou do for henry whateer he will brook he added with a languid smile holding richards hand in such a manner as to impress that though his words came very tardily he did not mean to be interrupted methinks henry will not grudge a kindly thought and a few prayers for his old comrade  and richard strive to be near my poor boys strive that they be bred in strict selfrule and let them hear of the purposes thy father left to me  i think thou knowst them or canst divine them better than any other near me  thou shall be with them ifif heaven and the blessed saints bear my sweet wife through this trouble  she will love and trust thee  edwards voice broke down in a halfstrangled sob between grief and pain he could not contemplate the thought of his wife and weakness had broken down much of his power over himself  he did not speak at once or invite an answer and when he did his words were an exclamation of despairing weariness at the trumpet of a gnat that hovered above him  richard presently understood that the thin goats hair curtains which even the crusaders had learnt to adopt from their oriental neighbours as protections against these enemies being continually disarranged to give the prince drink or to put cool applications to his wound the winged foes were sure to enter and with their exasperating hum further destroy all chance of rest  the prince had not slept since he had been wounded and was wellnigh distraught with wakefulness and with the continual suffering which was only diminished at the first moment that a cold lotion touched his arm  the hospitaliers had sent in some ice from mount hermon but no one knew how to apply it and even dame idonea had despised it  fortunately however richard had spent a few weeks on his first arrival in the infirmary of the knights of st john and before his recovery had become familiar with their treatment of both ice and mosquito curtains and when edmund of lancaster came into the tent cautiously in early dawn he could hardly credit his eyes for the squire whom he believed to be in close custody was beside his brother holding the cold applications on the arm and it was impossible to utter inquiry or remonstrance for the prince was in the profoundest most tranquil slumber  nor did he awake till the camp was astir in the morning with the activity that in this summer time could only be exerted before the sun had come to his full strength  then when at length he opened his eyes he pronounced himself to be greatly refreshed and the physician at the same time found the state of the wound greatly improved  a cheerful answer was returned by the patient to the message of anxious inquiry sent from his princess at acre and then looking up kindly at richard he said boy if my wife saved my life once i think thou hast saved it a second time  brother here broke in the earl of lancaster i would not grieve you but for your own safety you ought to know of the grave suspicion that has fallen on this youth  i know that you all have suspected him from the first edmund returned the prince coolly but i little expected that the first hour of my sickness would be spent in slaking your hatred of him  you do not know the reasons brother said edmund confused nor are you in a state to hear them  wherefore not said edward  thanks to him i have my wits clear and cool and ere the day is older his cause shall be heard  fetch gloucester fetch the rest of the council and let me hear your witnesses against him  what do you think i could rest or amend while i know not whether i have a traitor or not beside me  there could be no doubt that edward was fully himself after his nights rest determined and prompt as ever  no one durst withstand him and edmund went to take measures for his being obeyed meantime the prince grasped richard by the wrist and looking him through with the keen blue eyes that seemed capable of piercing any disguise he said boy hast thou aught that thou wouldst tell to thy kinsman edward in this strait that thou couldst not say to the prince in council  sir said richard with choking voice i was on my way to give that very warning when i found that the blow had fallen  my lord he added lowering his tone as he knelt by the princes couch simon lives i met him on mount carmel  i thought so muttered the prince  and this is his work  richard hurriedly told the circumstances of the encounter a matter on which he had the less scruple as simon was entirely out of reach he had hardly completed his narration when prince edmund returned and with him came others of the council  edmund was followed by his squire hamlyn and some of the archers were left without  richard had told his tale but had had no assurance of how the prince would act upon it nor how far the brand of shame might be made to rest on him and his unhappy house  he had avowed his brothers guilt to the prince alas must it again be blazoned through the camp  the greetings and inquiries of the new arrivals were hastily got over by the prince who layholding truly a bed of justicepartly raised by his cushions with bloodless cheeks indeed but with flashing eyes and lips set to all their wonted resoluteness  let me hear my lords he said whereforeso soon as i was disabledyou thought it meet to put mine own body squire and kinsman in ward  sir said the provost marshal these knaves of mine have let an accomplice escape who peradventure might have been made to tell more  an accomplice  of whom demanded the prince  of thethe assassin my lord on whom your own strong hand inflicted chastisement  this dustifoot who was the yeoman on guard by your tent and introduced him to your presence was seized by the villains at night endeavouring to hold converse with this gentleman and was by them taken into custody whence i grieve to say he hath escaped  give his guard due punishment said edward shortly  but how concerns this the lord richard de montforts durance  sir added the earl of gloucester is it known to you that the dog of a murderer was yet no moslem  what of that sharply demanded edward  there can scarcely be a doubt continued the redhaired earl that an attempt on your life my lord could only come from one quarter  oh dryly replied edward good cause for you to be willing that the saracen captives should be massacred  sir i did not then know that the miscreant was not of their faith said gloucester  i now believe that the same revenge that caused the death of lord henry of almayne has now nearly quenched the hope of england that if you will not be warned my lord worse evil may yet betide  gloucester spoke with much feeling but edward did not show himself touched he only said all this may be very well but my question is not answeredwhy was my squire put in ward  speak hamlyn said edmund of lancaster say to the prince what thou didst tell me  hamlyn stood forth excusing himself for the painful task of accusing his kinsman but seeing the princes impatient frown he came to the point and declared that richard de montfort on meeting him speeding to acre had eagerly asked him if aught had befallen the prince and had looked startled and confused on being taxed with being aware of what had taken place  well said edward  gloucester next beckoned a yeoman forward who much confused under the princes keen eye stammered out that he did not wish to harm the young gentleman but that he had seemed mighty anxious to spare the pagan hounds of prisoners and had even been heard to say that their revenge would better fall on himself  and is this all for which you had laid hands on him said the prince looking from one to the other  nay brother said edmund  it might have been unmarked by thee but in the first hour myself and others heard him speak of having made speed to warn thee but finding it too late  therefore did we conclude that it were well to have him in ward lest as in the former unhappy matter he should have been conversant with traitors and thus that we might obtain intelligence from him  remember likewise the fellow who was found in the tent  so said edward an honourable youth hath been treated as a traitor because of another springalds opinion of his looks and because a few yeomen thought he seemed overanxious to save a few wretched captives whom they knew to be guiltless  will there ever come a time when englishmen will learn what is witness  his name and lineage brother began edmund  that gentles is the witness upon which the wolf slew the lamb for fouling the stream  then you will not examine him asked gloucester  not as a suspected felon said edward  one who by your own evidence was heedless of himself in seeking to save the helpless nay who spake of hasting to warn mescarce merits such usage  what consorts with his honour and my safety i can trust to him to tell me as true friend and liegeman and the confiding smile with which he looked at richard was like a sunbeam in a dark cloud  my lord prince objected gloucester we cannot think that this is for your safety  see here gloucester said edward  till my arm can keep my head again double the guards and search all envoys under whatever pretext they may enter but never for the rest of thy life brand a man with imprisonment till you have reasonable proof against him thanks for your care of me my lords but i can scarce yet brook long converse  the council is dismissed  richard infinitely relieved could hardly wait till he could safely speak to the prince to express his gratitude and joy that he had been not only defended but freed from all examination so as to have been spared from denouncing his brother and that the family had been spared from this additional stigma  edward who like all reserved men could not endure the expression of thanks even while their utter omission would have been wounding cut him short  tush boy simon is as much my cousin as thy brother and i would not help to throw fresh stains on the name that but for my fathers selfish counsellors would stand highest at home  besides he added as one half ashamed of his generosity and willing to qualify it supposing it got abroad that he had aimed this stroke at the heir of englandwhy then englands honour would be concerned and we should have stout gilbert de clare and all the rest of them wild to storm simon in his galilean fastness without king herods boxes i trow  then would all the druses and the maronites and the saracens and the halfbreeds the worst of the whole come down on them in some impassable gorge and the troops i have taken such pains to keep in health and training would leave their bones in those doleful passes and not for the sake of the holy sepulchre but of my private quarrel  no no richard we will keep our own counsel and do our best that simon may not get another chance before i can move within the walls of acre and then we will spread our sails and pray that the holy land may make a holier man of him    chapter xiithe garden of the hospital    and who is yon page lying cold at his kneescott  edward differed from coeur de lion in this that he was one of the most abstemious men in his army and disciplined himself at least as rigidly as he did other people  and it was probably on this account that he did not fulfil dame idoneas predictions but recovered favourably and by the end of a fortnight was able in the first coolness of early morning to ride gently into the city of acre where a few days previously the princess eleanor had given birth to a daughter  she was christened joan on the day of her fathers arrival and afterwards became the special spoilt favourite of edward whose sternness gave place to excessive fondness among his children  moreover she in the end became the wife of that same red haired earl gilbert of gloucester who at this time stood holding his wax taper and looking at the small swaddled morsel of royalty with all a bachelors contempt for infancy and little dreaming that he beheld his future countess  prince edward had accepted the invitation of sir hugh de revel grand master of the order of st john to take up his quarters in the commandery of the brotherhood and richard was greatly relieved to have him there since no watch or ward in the open camp could be so secure as this double fortress protected in the first place by the walls of the city and in the second by those of the hospital itself with its strict military and monastic discipline  a wonderful place was that hospitalinfirmary monastery and castle all in one and with a certain eastern grace and beauty of its own  the deep massive walls heavy towers and portcullised gateway were in the most elaborate and majestic style of defensive architecture and the main building rose to a great height filled with galleries of small bare rigidlooking cells just large enough for a knight his pallet and his armour  below was a noble vaulted hall the walls hung with welltried hawberks and shields and helmets which had stood many a dint captured crescents and green banners waved as trophies over crooked scymetars and damascus blades inlaid with sentences from the koran in gold and twisted cuirasses rich with barbaric gold and gems the blazoned arms of the noblest families of france spain england germany and italy decked the panels and brightened the windows while the stone pulpit for the reader showed that it was still a convent refectory  the chapel was grave and massive but at the same time gorgeous with colouring suited to eyes accustomed to oriental brightness of hue the chancel walls were inlaid with the porphyry jasper and marble of exquisite tints that came from the mountains around the shrines were touched with gold and the roofs and vaultings painted with fretwork of unapproachable brilliance and purity of tints yet all harmonizing together as only eastern colouring can harmonize and giving a sense of rest and coolness  within those huge thick walls whose windows sunk deep into their solid mass only let in threads of jewelled light under their solemn circular richly carved brows between those marble pillars the elder ones round and solid with romanesque mighty strength the new graceful clusters of shining bloodred marble shafts surrounding a slender white one all banded together with gold under the vaults of the stone roof upon the mosaic floorthere was always a still refreshing coolness like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land  one transept had a window communicating with the upper room of the infirmary so that the sick who there lay in their beds might take part in the services in the chapel  the outer court with the great fortified gateway towards the street was a tiltyard where martial exercises took place as in any other castle but pass through the great hall to the inner court of which the chapel formed one side and where could such cloisters have been found in the west  their heavy columns and deepbrowed arches clinging against the thick walls afforded unfailing shelter from the sun and their coolness was increased by the marble of the pavement inlaid in rich intricate mosaics  extending around the interior of the external wall they enclosed an exquisite eastern garden perfumed with flowering shrubs shady with trees and lovely with tall white lilies hollyhocks purple irises stars of bethlehem and many another eastern flower which would send forth seeds or roots for the supply of the trim gardens of western convents  the soft bubbling of fountains gave a sense of delicious freshness doves flew hither and thither and their soft murmuring was heard in the branches and at certain openings in their foliage might be seen the azure of the mediterranean which little john of dunster persisted in calling too bluewhy could it not be a sober propercoloured sea like his own bristol channel  richard was very happy here  there was something of the same charm as in modern days is experienced in staying at a college  the brethren were thorough monks in religious observance but they were also highbred nobles and had seen many wild adventures and hard fought battles and moreover had entertained in turn almost every variety of pilgrim who had visited the holy land so that none could have been found who had more of interest to tell or more friendly hospitable kindness towards their guests  richard was a favourite there not only as a friend of reginald ferrers but as acquainted with the grand prior sir robert darcy whose memory was still green in palestine  tales of his feats of mighty strength still lingered at acre how he had held together by his single arm the gates of a house in the retreat from damietta against a whole troop of mamelukes until every christian had left it on the other side and then had slowly followed them not a moslem daring to attack him how he had borne off wounded knights on his back and on sultry marches would load himself with the armour of any one who was exhausted and never fail to declare it was exactly what he liked best  more than once it had been intimated that richard de montfort would be gladly accepted as a brother of the order and he often thought over the offer but not only was he unwilling to separate himself from the prince but he felt it needful at any rate to return to england to judge of the condition of his brother henry ere becoming one of an order where he could no longer dispose of himself  he was resolved never to quit the prince till he had seen him beyond the reach of any machination of his brothers nor indeed was it easy to think of parting at all for edward who had relaxed all coldness of manner towards him ever since the affair at trapani had now become warmly affectionate and confidential  the prince was still far from having regained his usual health his arm was still in a scarf and was often painful and the least exposure to the sun brought on violent headache which some attributed to the poison in the scratch on his forehead but the hospitaliers more reasonably ascribed to a slight sunstroke  their character of infirmarers rendered them especially considerate hosts and they never overwhelmed their guest with the stiff formalities of courtesy for his ranks sake but allowed him to follow his inclination and this led him to spend great part of his time in a pavilion a thoroughly eastern erection which stood in the garden at the top of the white marble steps leading to a fountain of delicious sparkling water and sheltered from the sun by the dark solid horizontal branches of a noble cedar of lebanon which tradition connected with the visit of the empress helena  here lying upon mats placed on the steps the convalescent prince would rest for hours sometimes holding converse with the grand master or counsel with his visitors from the camp but more often in the dreamy repose of recovery silent or talking to richard of matters that lay deep within his heart but which perhaps nothing but this softening species of waking dream would have drawn from him  he would dwell on those two hero models of his boyhood so diverse yet so closely connected together by their influence upon his character louis of france and simon of leicester and of the impression both had left that judgment mercy faith and the subjects welfare were the primary duties of a sovereignan idea only now and then glimpsed by the feudal sovereigns who thought that the people lived for them rather than they for the people  and when as in england the kings goodnature had been abused by swarms of foreignborn relations who had not even his claims on the people no wonder the yoke had been galling beyond endurance  of the end edward could not bear to thinkof the broken friendshipsthe enmity of kindredthe faults on either side that had embittered the strife till he had been forced to become the sword in the hands of the royal party to liberate his fatherand with consequences that had so far outrun his powers of controlling them  to make england the land of law peace and order that simon de montfort would fain have seen it was his present aspiration and then he said when all was purified at home it might yet be permitted to him to return and win back the holy city jerusalem to the christian world  in the meantime as a memorial of this his earnest longing he was causing at great expense and labour one of the huge stones of the temple to be transported over the hills and embarked on board a ship to carry home with him  richard meantime learnt to know and love his prince with a more devoted love if that were possible and to grieve the more at the persistent hatred of his brothers who utterly uncomprehending their fathers high purposes themselves sought blindly to slake their vengeance for the ruin they had themselves provoked and upon one who mourned him far more truly than they could ever do  a few days had thus passed when richard was one day called by his friend sir raynald into the infirmary to speak a few kind words to a dying english pilgrim who had come from his native country and confided to him his dearlypurchased palm and scallop shell to be conveyed to his aged mother  as richard was passing along the great lofty chamber two rows of beds were arranged one of the patients rather hastily as it seemed to him enveloped himself in his coverlet leaving nothing visible but a great black patch which seemed to cover the whole side of his face  that is a strange varlet said raynald as they passed him it is an old wound that the patch covers not what has brought him here and what the nature of his ailment may be not one of our infirmarers can make out his tongue is purple and he hath such strange shiverings and contortions in all his limbs that they are at their wits end and some hold that he must have undergone some sorcery in his passage through the infidel domains  he came from the east then asked richard  yea verily  we have many more sick among the returning than the outgoing pilgrims  and what is his nation  nay all the scanty words he hath spoken have been in lingua franca and he hath been in such trances and trembling fits that it hath not been easy to question him  nor is it our custom to trouble a pilgrim with inquiries  how did he enter said richard  brother antonio found him yestereve cast down gasping for breath by the gate of the hospital just able to entreat for the love of st john to be admitted  he had all the tokens of a pilgrim about him and seemed better at first walked lustily to bath and bed and did not show himself helpless but i much suspect his disease is the work of the arch enemy for he is always at his worst if one of our brethren in full orders comes near him  you saw how he cowered and hid himself when i did but pass through the hall  i shall speak to the preceptor and see if it were not best to try what exorcism will do  there was something in all this that made richard vaguely uneasy after the recent attack upon the prince he suspected all that he did not fully understand and though in the guarded precincts of the hospital he had once dismissed his anxiety it returned upon him in redoubled force  he thought of nick dustifoot but that worthy was of a uniform tint of whitey brown skin hair and all and richard had assured himself that the strange patient had black hair and a brown skin but that was all that he could guess at  the exorcism would however be an effectual means of disclosing the myster wights person and it sometimes included measures so strong that few pretences could hold out against them  but it was too serious and complicated a ceremony to be got up at short notice and when they met in the refectory for supper raynald told richard that the grand master intended to make a personal inspection next day before deciding on using his spiritual weapons  and then cried john of dunster dancing round you will let me be there  pray good father let me be there  oh i hope there will be a rare smell of brimstone and the foul fiend will come out with huge claws and a forked tail  i dont care to see him if he only comes out like a black crow i can see crows enough in the trees at dunster  peace john this is no place for idle talk said richard gravely stand aside here comes the prince  the prince had spent a fatiguing day over the terms of the ten years ten months ten weeks ten days ten hours and ten minutes truce with the emir of joppa he ate little and after the meal took richards arm and craved leave from the grand master to seek the fresh air beneath the cedar tree  and when there he could not endure the return to the closeness of his own apartment but declared his intention of sleeping in the pavilion  he dismissed his attendants saying he needed no one but richard who since his illness had always slept upon cushions at his feet  where was richard  he presently appeared carrying on one arm a mantle and over the other shoulder the princes immense twohandled sword while his own sword was in his belt  leonillo followed him  how now said edward are we to have a joust  dost look for phantom saracens out of yonder fountain such as my dona tells me rise out of the fair wells in castille wring their hands and pray for baptism  you said your hand should keep your head my lord said richard this is but a lone place  what amid all the guards of the good fathers  well old comrade as he took his sword in his right hand i am glad to handle thee once more and i hope soon to grasp thee as i am wont with both hands  lay it down richard  therethanksthat is well  i wonder what my father would have thought if one of his many crusading vows had led him hither  should we ever have had him back again  how well this dreamy leisure would have suited him  it would almost make a troubadour of a rough warrior like me  see the towers and pinnacles against the sky and the lights within the windowsand the stars above like lamps of gold and the moonshine sparkling on the bubbles of the water ever floating off yet ever in the same place were the good old man here how peacefully would he sing and pray and dream free from debts parliament and barons  ah had his kinsmen let him keep his vow it had been happier for us all  so mused the prince and with a weary smile resigned himself to rest  but richard was too full of vague uneasiness to sleep  he could not dismiss from his mind the thought of the unknown pilgrim and was resolved to relax no point of vigilance until the full investigation should have satisfied him that his fears were unfounded  he had been accustomed to watching and broken rest during the princes illness and though he durst not pace up and down for fear of disturbing the sleepernay could hardly venture a movementhe strained his eyes into the twilight and told his beads fervently but sleep hung on him like a spell and even while sitting upright there were strange dreams before him and one that he had had before though with a variation  it was the field of evesham once more but this time the strange pilgrim rose in his dark wrappings before him and suddenly developed into that same shadowy form of his father who again struck him on the shoulder with his sword and dubbed him again the knight of death  hark there was a growl from leonillo a footstep a dark figurethe pilgrim himself  richard shouted aloud grasped at his sword and flung himself forward  montforts vengeance  the sound rang in his ears as a sharp pang thrilled through his side the hot blood welled up and he was dashed to the ground but even in falling he heard the princes what treason is this and felt the rising of the mighty form  at the same moment the murderer was in the grasp of that strong right hand and was dragged forward into the full light of the lamp that hung from the roof of the pavilion  thou he gasped  whowhat  richard exclaimed the prince and relaxing his hold simon de montfort thou hast slain thy brother  the sudden shock and awe had overwhelmed simon who was indeed weaponless since his dagger remained in richards wound  he silently assisted the prince in lifting richard to the cushions of the couch and the low groan convinced them that he lived  looked anxiously for the wound  the dagger had gone deep between the ribs and little but the haft could be seen  poisoned edward asked looking up at simon  no  it failed once  he may live said simon with bent brows and folded arms  no no  my deathblow gasped richard with sobbing breath  best so ifoh could i but speak  the prince raised him supporting his head on his own broad breast and shoulder and signed to simon to hold to his lips the cup of water that stood near  richard slightly revived and in this posture breathed more easily  he might yet live  call speedy aid said the prince who seemed to have utterly forgotten that he was practically alone with his persevering and desperate enemy  wait  oh wait cried richard holding out his hand it would be vain but it will be all joy did i but know that there will be no more of this  simon he loved my fatherhe has spared thee again and again  simon said the prince for this dear youths sake and thy fathers i raise no hand against thee  bitter wrong has been done to thy house by what persons and how provoked it skills not now to ask  twice thy fury has fallen on the guiltless  enough blood has been shed  let there be peace henceforth  simon stood moody with folded arms and richard groaned and essayed to speak  peace boy tenderly said edward and thou simon hear me  i loved thy father and knew the upright noble spirit that arrayed him against us  heaven is my witness that i would have given my life to have been able to save him on yon wretched battlefield  but he fell in fair fight in helm and corselet like a good knight  peace be with him  surely in this land of pardon and redemption his son and nephew may cease to seek one anothers blood for his sake  cheer thy brother by letting him feel his brave deed hath not been fruitless free thou shalt godo what thou wilt no word of mine shall betray that this deed is thine  lay aside thy purpose entreated richard  bind him by oath my lord  nay said the prince  here on foreign soil the strife lies between the cousins the sons of henry and of eleanor and if simon must needs still slake his revenge in my blood he may have better success another time  or so soon as i can wear my armour again i offer him a fair combat in the lists man to man better so than staining his soul with privy murderbut i had far rather that it should be peace between usand that thou shouldst see it  and edward still supporting richard on his breast held out his right hand to simon adding let not thy brothers blood be shed in vain  richard made a gesture of agonized entreaty  my fathermy father he said  he forgavehe hated blood simon didst but know  i see said simon impatiently that heaven and earth alike are set against my purpose  fear not for his days richard they are safe from me and here is my hand upon it  the tone was sullen and grudging and richard looked scarcely comforted but the prince was in haste that he should be succoured at once and even while receiving simons unwilling hand said we lose time  speed near enough to the spital to be heard and shout for aid  then seek thine own safety  i will say no more of thy share in this matter  simon lingered one moment  boy he said i told thee thou wast over like him  live live if thou canst  alas  i had thought to make surer work this time but thou dost pardon me the mischance  more than pardonthank theesince he is safe whispered richard and as simon bent over him the boy crossed his brow and returned a look of absolute joy  simon sped away and the prince when left alone with richard put no restraint upon the warmth of his feelings and his tears fell fast and freely  boy boy he said i little thought thou wast to bear what was meant for me  and then with tenderness that would have seemed foreign to his nature he inquired into the pain that richard was suffering tried to make his position more easy and lamented that he could not venture to draw out the weapon until the leeches should come  it has been my best hope said richard and now that it should have been thus  with your goodness i have nothingnothing to wish sir raynald will be herei have only my charge for henry to give himand poor leonillo  i will bear thy charges to henry said the prince  nor shall he think thou didst betray his secret  i will watch over him so far as he will let me and do all i may for his child  yet it may be thou wilt still return  i hear the stir in the house  they will be here anon  thou must live richard my friend where i have few friends i thought to have knighted thee boy when thou hadst won fame  oh would that i had shown thee more of my love while it was time  all all i hoped or longed for i have murmured richard  if you see henry my lord bear him my greetingsand to poor adamyea and my mother  oh would that i could make them all know your kindness and my joythat it should be thus  by this time the whole hospital was astir and the knights and lay brethren came flocking out in consternation and dread of finding their royal host himself murdered within their cloisters  great was the confusion and eager the search for the assassin while others crowded round the prince who still would not give up his post of supporting the sufferer in his arms while a few moments examination convinced the experienced infirmarers that the wound was mortal and that the extraction of the dagger would but hasten death which could not be other than very near  indeed richard already spoke with such difficulty that only the princes ear could detect his entreaty that raynald ferrers might act as his priest  raynald was already near only withheld by the crowd of knights of higher degree who had thronged before him  richard looked up to him with a face that in all its mortal agony seemed to ask congratulation  the power of making confession was gone and when raynald would have offered to take him in his own arms both he and the prince showed disinclination to the move  so thus they still remained while the young knightly priest spoke the words of absolution and then across the solemn darkness of the garden amid the light of tapers the host was borne from the chapel while the low subdued chant of the brethren swelled up through the night air  poor little john of dunster with his arms round leonillos neck to keep him from disturbing his master knelt sobbing as though his heart would break but trying to stifle the sounds as the priests voice came grave and full on the silent air responded to by the gathered tones of the brethren  the fountain bubbled on and the wakening birds began to stir in the trees  once more richard opened his eyes looked up at his prince and smiled  that smile remained while edward kissed his brow with fervour laid him down on the cushions and rising to his feet bowed his head to the grand master but did not even strive to speak and gravely walked across the cloister with a slow though steady step to his own chamber  no one saw him again till the sun was high when with looks as composed as ever he went forth to lay his pages head in the grave and thence visit and calm the fears of his princess  search had everywhere been made for the assassin but no traces of him were found  only the strange pilgrim had vanished in the confusion and the prince never contradicted the grand master in his indignation that a moslem hound should have assumed such a disguise    chapter xiiithe beggar and the prince    this favour only that thou wouldst stand out of my sunshine diogenes  it was the last week of august 1274 the morrow of the most splendid coronation that england had ever beheld either for the personal qualities and appearance of the sovereigns or for the magnificence of the adornments and the bounteous feasting of multitudes  a whole fortnight of entertainments to rich and poor had been somewhat exhausting even to the guests and the suburbs of london wore an unusually sleepy and quiescent appearance in the hot beams of the august sun  bethnal green lay very silent parched and weary not even enlivened by its usual gabbling flocks of geese all of whom poor things except the patriarchal gander and one or two of his ladies had gone to the festivalbut to return no more  one of those who had been in the midst of the pageant and had returned unscathed was blind hal of bethnal green  many a coin had gone into his scripuncontested king of the beggars as he was many a savoury morsel had been conveyed to him and his child by his admiring brethren of the wallet with many a gibing scoff had he driven from the field presuming mendicants not of his own fraternity and with halfbitter halfamused remarks had he listened to the rapturous descriptions of the splendours of king queen and their noble suite  and pretty bessee had clung fast to his hand and discreetly guided him through every maze of the crowd with the strange dexterity of a child bred up in throngs  and now tired out with the longcontinued festivities the beggar sat in front of his hut basking in the sun and more than half asleep while bessee her lap full of heatherblossoms and long bents of grass was endeavouring to weave herself chains bracelets and coronals in imitation of those which had recently dazzled her eyes  she had just encircled her dark auburn locks with a garland of purple heather studded here and there with white or gold when starting upon her little bare but delicately clean pink feet she laid her hand on her fathers lap and said father hark  i see two of the good red monks coming  well child and wherefore waken me  they are after their own affairs i trow  moreover i hear no horses feet  they are not riding said bessee and they are walking this way they have a dog too  oh such a gallant glorious dog father  ah cried she joyfully tis the good father grand prior and she was about to start forward but the blind mans ear could now distinguish the footfalls and holding her fast he almost gaspedand the other childwho is he  no knight at our spital  a stranger father  so tall so tall his mantle hardly reaches his knee his robe leaves his ankles bare o father they are coming  let me go to meet dear good father robert  but whatoh is the fit coming  father robert will stop it  hush thy prattle said the beggar clutching her fast and listening as one all ear and by this time the two knights were close at hand the taller holding the dog straining in a leash while the good grand prior spoke  how fares it with thee friend  and thou my pretty one  no mishaps among the throng  none returned hal though the king and his suite did let loose five hundred chargers in the crowd at their dismounting to trample down helpless folk and be caught by rogues  largesse they called it  fair and convenient largesseeasily providing for those that received it  no harm was done briefly but sharply exclaimed the strange knight and the blind man who had as little bessee at least perceived been turning his acute ear in that direction all the time he had been speaking now let his features light up with sudden perception  but sir robert darcy thinking that he only now became aware of the strangers presence said a knight is here from the east who brings thee tidings my son  sir robert would have said more but the beggar standing up cut him short by saying so cousin you have yet to learn the vanity of disguises and feignings towards a blind man  nay fair cousin was the answer my feigning was not towards you but i doubted me whether you would have the world see me visit you in my proper character  will not you give me a hand henry  first say to me said henry embracing with his maimed arm his staff planted in front of him defiantly and still holding tight his little daughter in his hand what brings you here to break into the peace of the poor remnant of a man you have left  i come said edward patiently to fulfil my lastmy parting promise to one who loved us bothand gave his life for me  loved you ay and well enough to betray me to you said henry bitterly  no henry de montfort ten thousand times no said edward  i would maintain in the lists the honour and loyalty of my richard towards you and me and all others  his faithfulness to you brought him into peril of death and disgrace in the wretched matter of poor henry of almayne and he would have met both rather than have broken his faith  then said henry still with the same mocking tone how was it that my worthless existence became known to his grace  i knew of your having vanished from evesham abbey returned edward and thus knowing i understood a letter the writing of which had brought suspicion on richard and which was brought back to me when we were seeking into  into the deed of simon and guy said henry  poor henry  it was a foul crime and father robert can bear me witness that i did penance for it when that kindly heart of his was laid in st peters abbey  then henry thou ownst thy kinship to us still said edward earnestly  give me thine hand man and let me embrace my lovely little kinswomana queen in her trappings  ah henry  heaven hath dealt lovingly with thee in sparing thee thy child  you have children left said henry quickly and not withholding a handwhich be it remarked was as delicately shaped and well kept as that which took it  twice had the beggar received a dole at westminster at the obsequies of edwards little sons yea though he and all his brethren of the dish had all the winter before had alms given them to purchase their prayers for the health of the last  threebut three out of six answered edward nor dare i reckon on the life of the frail babe that england hailed yesterday as my heir i sometimes deem that the blight of broken covenants has fallen on my sons  they were none of your breaking said henry  sayst thou so exclaimed edward looking up with the animation of a man hearing an acquittal from a quarter whose sincerity he could thoroughly trust  but henry made no courtly answer  pshaw no living man that had to deal with or for your father could keep a covenant  you were but the spearpoint of the broken reed good cousin and we pitied and excused you accordingly  your father did said edward hoarsely  he could brook pity from the great simon better than from the blind beggar  ay marry that did he returned henry as he closed his visor that last morn after looking out on that wild welsh border scum that my fair brotherinlaw had marshalled against us  by the arm of st james said he if edward take not heed that rascaille will deal with us in a way that will be worse for him than for us  a true foreboding said the king  henry do thou come and be with me  all are gone  scarce a face that i left in england has welcomed me on my return  come thou in what guise thou wiltearl counsellor or bedesmanonly be with me and speak to me thy fathers words  whoi my lord returned henry  i am no man to speak my fathers words  they flew high over my head and were only caught by grave youths such as yourself  i who was never trusted with so much as a convoy  no no all the counsel i shall ever give is to the beggars which coatofarms is like to rain clipped silver and which honest round penny pieces  poor richard he bore the best brain of us all and might have served your purpose  sit down and tell me of the ladbessee little one bring out the jointstool for the holy father  and henry de montfort made way on the rude bench outside his hut with all the ease and courtesy of the earl of leicester receiving his kinsman the king  but meantime the dog which had been straining in the leash held by edward throughout the conference leapt forward and vehemently solicited the beggars caresses  ah leonillo he said recognizing him at once thou hast lost thy master  poor dog thou art the one truly loyal to thy masters blood  it was richards charge to take him to thee said edward  but if he be burdensome to thee i would gladly cherish him or would commit him to faithful gourdon with whom he might be happier  since he lost his master the poor hound hath much pined away and will take food from none but me or little john of dunster  leonillo however who seemed to have an unfailing instinct for a montfort was willingly accepting the eager and delighted attentions of the little girl though he preferred those of her father and cowered down beneath his hand with depressed ears and gently waving tail as though there were something in the touch and voice that conferred what was as near bliss as the faithful creature could enjoy without his deity and master  meantime the grand prior discreetly removed his jointstool out of hearing of the two cousins and called the little maid to rehearse to him the credo and ave with their english equivalentsa task that pretty bessee highly disapproved after the fortnights dissipation and would hardly have performed for one less beloved of children than father robert  the good grand prior knew that the king would have much to say that would beseem no ear save his kinsmans and in effect edward told what none besides would ever hear respecting the true author of the attempts on his own life  spiteful fox  such simon ever was was the beggars muttered comment  well that he knows not of my poor child  so cousin thou hast kept his counsel he added in a different tone  i thank thee in the name of montfort and leicester  it was well and nobly done  and henry de montfort held out his hand with the dignity of head of the family whose honour edward had shielded  it was for thy fathers sake and richards said edward receiving the acknowledgment as it was meant  ah well said henry relapsing into his usual halfscoffing tone in that boy our montfort blood seems to have run clear of the taint it got from the shefiend of anjou  thy share was from a mocking fiend returned the king  ay and a fair portion it is said the beggar  my jest and my song have borne me through more than my sword and spurs ever didand have been more to me than english earldom or french county  poor richard he added with feeling i told him his was the bondage and mine the freedom  alas  i fear that so it was said edward  my favour only embittered his foes  had i known how it would end i had never taken him to me but my heart yearned to my uncles goodly son  maybe it is well said henry  had the boy grown up verily like my father thou and he might have fallen out or if notwhy you knights and nobles ride in miry bloody ways and tis a wonder if even the best of you does not bring his harness home befouled and besmirchednot as shining bright as he took it out  well what didst thou with the poor lad  cut him in fragments  you mince your best loved now as fine as if they were traitors  no said edward the boy lies sleeping in the church of st john at acre  i rose from my sickbed that i might lay him in his grave as a brother  lights burn round him and masses are said and the brethren were left in charge to place his effigy on his tomb in carven stone  one day i trust to see it  my brother alexander of scotland llewellyn of wales and i have sworn to one another to bring all within these four seas into concord and good order and then we may look for such a blessing on our united arms as may bear us onward to jerusalem  then come with us henry and let us pray together at richards grave  i may safely promise said henry smiling if this same crusade is to be when peace and order are within the four seas  moreover thou wilt have ruined my trade by that time  nay henry cease fooling  seeif thou wilt not be thyself i will find thee a lodge in any park of mine  none shall know who thou art but thou shalt have free range and  and weary of my life  no no cousin  i am in thy power now and thou canst throw me into prison as the attainted lord de montfort do so if thou wilt but i were fooling indeed to give up my free range my power my authority to be a poor suspected pitied maimed pensioner on thy bounty  park quotha with none to speak to from morn to night  i can have my will of any park of thine i please whenever i choose  edward would have persisted but henry silenced him effectually with a sarcastic hint that his favours had done little for richard  then the king prayed at least that he would consider his child but to the proposal of taking her to the palace henry returned an indignant negative  he had seen enough of the court ladies he said  a hot glow of anger lighted edwards cheek for he loved his mother but the blind beggar could not be the subject of his wrath and he merely said thou didst not know my wife  ay i will believe the court as perfect as thou thinkest to make the isle but bessee shall not bide there  she is the blind beggars child and such shall she remain  send me to a dungeon as i said and thou canst pen her in a convent or make her a menial to thy princesses as thou wilt but while my life and my freedom are my own i keep my child  i could find it in my heart to arrest thee said edward when i look at that beautiful child and think to what thou wouldst bring her  she is fair then said the beggar eagerly  fair  she is the loveliest child mine eyes have looked on  though some of mine own have been very lovely  but she hath the very features of our royal linethough with eyes deep and dark like thy fathers or my richardsand a dark glow of sunny health on her fair skin  she bears her too right royally  henry thou canst not wreck the fate of a child like that  no assuredly said henry dryly  i have not done so ill by her hitherto by thine own showing that i should not be trusted with her for the future  the parting would be bitter began edward but thou shouldst see her often  slay me and make her a ward of the crown said henry  otherwise i will need no mans leave for seeing my daughter  but ask her  if she will go with thee i will say no more  king edward was fond of childrenmost indulgent to his own and kind to all little ones who attracted by the sweetness which his stern grave beautiful countenance would assume when he looked at them always made friends with him readily  so he trusted to this fascination in the case of the little lady elizabeth  he held out his hands to her and claimed her as his cousin and she came readily to him and stood between his knees  little cousin he said wilt thou come home with me to be with my two little maids the elder much of thine age  you are a red monk said bessee amazed  thats his shell bessee said her father he has come amasking and forgot his part  i dont like masking said bessee trying to get away  then we will mask no more said edward  thou hast looked in my face long enough with those great black eyes  dost know me child  bessee cast the black eyes down and coloured  dost know me he repeated  i think she whispered at last that you are masking still  you are likelike the king that was crowned at the abbey  well said little maid  and shall i take thee home and give thee pearls and emeralds to braid thy locks instead of these heath bells  father said bessee trying to withdraw her little hands out of edwards large one which held both fast  o father is he masking still  no child it is the king indeed said henry  hear what he saith to thee  and again edward spoke of all that would tempt a child  father said bessee if father comes  no bessee said her father i have done with palaces  no places they for blind beggars  oh let me go let me go cried bessee struggling  and as the king released her hands she flew to her father  he would lose himself without me  i must be with father  o king go away father dont let him take me  let me cry for jock of the wooden spoon and trig one leg and hedgerow wat  hush hush bess said henry not desirous that his royal cousin should understand the strength of his bodyguard of honour  the king here is as trusty and loyal as the boldest beggar among us  he only gave thee thy choice between him and me  thee thee father  he cant want me  he has two eyes and two hands and a queen and two little girls and thou hast only me and she clung round her fathers neck  little one said edward thou needst not shrink from me  i will not take thee away  thy father hath a treasure and tis his part to strive not to throw it away  only should either thou or he ever condescend so far as to seek for counsel with this poor cousin of thine send this token to me and i will be with thee  but it was full nine years ere edward saw that jewel again  meantime he was not entirely without knowledge of his kinsman  on every great occasion the figure conspicuous for the scrupulous cleanliness of the dark russet gown and the careful arrangement of the hair and beard and the fillet which covered the eyes as well as for a lordly bearing that even the stoop of blindness could not disguise was to be seen dominating over all the other beggars sitting on the steps of church or palace gates as if they had been a throne troubling himself little to beg but exchanging shrewd remarks with all who addressed him and raising many a laugh among the bystanders leonillo lay contented at his feet but after just enough time had elapsed to show that he cared not for the kings remonstrance he ceased to be accompanied by his little daughter and was led by a boy in her stead  the king making inquiries of the grand prior learnt that pretty bessee was daily deposited at the sisterhood of poor clares where she remained while her father was out on his begging expeditions and learnt such breeding as convents then gave  in sooth said sir robert honest hal believes it is all for good will and charity and love to the pretty little wench and so it is in great part  but methought it best to give a hint to the mother prioress that the child came of good blood  she is a discreet lady and knows how to deal with her and truly she tells me their house has prospered since the little one came to them  every feastday morn have they found their almsdish weightier with coin than ever she knew it before  when edward repeated this intelligence to his queen she recollected dame idoneas gossiping informationthat brave sir robert the flower of the house of darcy had only entered the order of st john when fair alda braithwayte in the strong enthusiasm of the franciscan preaching had pleaded a vow of virginity against all suitors and had finally become a sister of the poor clares  and after all his wars and wanderings the regulations of his order had ended by bringing the hospitalier in his old age into the immediate neighbourhood of prioress alda and into that distant business intercourse that the heads of religious houses had from time to time to carry on together  the world passed on  eleanor de montfort came from france and the king himself acted the part of a father to her at her marriage with llewellyn of wales  he knewthough she little guessedthat the beggar by whom her jewelled train swept with rustling sound was the firstborn of her fathers house and should have held her hand  two years only did that marriage last eleanor died leaving an infant daughter and llewellyn soon after was in arms against the english perhaps edward bethought him of his cousins ironical promise to go with him to the east after the pacification of the whole island when he found himself obliged to summon the fierce pyrenean to pursue the wild welsh in their mountains    chapter xivthe queen of the dewdrops    this is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever ran on a green sward winters tale  it was the summer of 1283 the babe of carnarvon had been accepted as the native prince speaking no tongue but welsh and edward had since been employed in establishing his dominion over wales  his whitsuntide was kept by the queens special entreaty at st winifreds well  such wonders had been told her of the miracles wrought by this favourite welsh saint that she hoped that by early placing her little welshborn son under such protection she might secure for him healthier and longer life than had been the share of his brethren  so to holywell went the court and army  some lodged in the convent attached to the well but many and many more dwelt in tents or lodged in cottages or raised huts of boughs of trees  noble ladies of eleanors suite were glad to obtain a lodging in rude welsh huts and as the weather was beautiful there was plenty of gay feasting dancing and jousting on the greensward when the religious observances of the day were over  pilgrims thronged from all parts attracted both by the presence of the court and the unusual tranquillity of wales and for nearly a mile around the holywell it was like one great motley fair resorted to by persons of all stations  beggars of course were there in numbers and among them the unfailing blind beggar of bethnal green who always made a pilgrimage in the summer to some station of easy access from london but whom some wondered to see at such a distance  had he scented that the court was coming asked the young nobles  not he he never haunted courts  he would have kept away had he known that such a gabbling flock of popinjays were on the wing thither  but the young gallants were chiefly bent on speculating on the vision of loveliness that had flashed on the eyes of some early visitants at the well  a maiden in a dark pilgrim dress and broad hat which however could not entirely conceal a glowing complexion at once rich and pure perfect features magnificent dark eyes and hair and a tall form which though very youthful was of unmistakable dignity and grace  she was always at the well exceedingly early in the morning moving slowly round it on her beautiful bare feet and never looking up from the string of dark beadsthe larger ones of amber which she held in her fingersas her lips conned over the prayers connected with each  no ring was on the delicate hand no earring in the ear there was no ornament in the dress but such a garb was wont to be assumed by ladies of any rank when performing a vow and its simplicity at once enhanced her beauty and added to the general curiosity  between four and six in the dewy freshness of morning seemed to be her time for devotion and though the habits of the court were early it was only the first astir who caught a sight of this queen of the dewdrops as it was the fashion to call her  late comers never caught sight of her and affected incredulity when the younger and more active knights and squires raved about her  then it was reported that the king himself had been seen speaking to her and thereupon excitement grew the more intense because edwards exclusive devotion to his queen had been such that from his youth up the most determined scandal had never found a wandering glance to note in him  she was the princess of franceof navarreof aragonin disguise nay at the whitsunday banquet there were those who cast anxious glances to the door expecting that in the very land of king arthur she would walk in like his errant dames at pentecost to demand a champion  and when a joust was given on the sward young sir john de mohun the lord of dunster announced his intention of tilting in honour of no one save the queen of the dewdrops  the ladies of the court were rather scandalized and appealed to the king whether the choice of an unknown girl of no acknowledged rank should be permitted but the king strict punctilious man as he was only laughed and adjudged the queen of the dewdrops to be fully worthy of the honour  after this early rising became the fashion of holywell  all the gentlemen got up early to look at the queen of the dewdrops and all the ladies got up early to see that the gentlemen did not get into mischief and the maidens devotions became far from solitary but she moved on with a sort of superb unconcern never lifting the dark fringes that veiled the eyes so steadily fixed on the beads that dropped through her fingers until as she finished she raised up her head with a straightforward fearless look at the way she was going so completely selfpossessed that no one ventured to accost her and to follow her at less than such a respectful distance that she was always lost sight of in the wood  at last late one evening there was a sudden start of exultant satisfaction among some of the young men who were lounging on the green for the most part not the nobles of the court but certain young merchants of london and bristol who had followed the course of pilgrimage by the magnetism of fashionable resort  the queen of the dewdrops was seen carrying a pitcher  up started four or five gallants offering assistance and standing round her wrangling with one another and besetting her steps  let me pass gentles she said with dignity i am carrying wine in haste to my father  nay fair one you pass not our bounds without toll said the portliest of the set  hush rudesby fair dames in disguise must be treated after other sort  every variety of halfinsulting compliment was pouring upon her but she with head erect and steady foot still quietly moved on taking no notice till a hand was laid on her pitcher  let go then she said in no terrified voice  let go sir or i can summon help  and as if to realize her words the intrusive hand was thrust aside by a powerful arm and a voice exclaimed   this lady is to pass free sir  none of your insolence  a courtgallant passed round the hostile bourgeoise none of your court airs sir  no airsbut those of an honest englishman who will not see a woman cowardly beset  will silkjerkin not bide a buffet quoth the bully of the party clenching his fist  as many as thou wilt returned silkjerkin so soon as i have seen the lady safe home  ho hoa fetch that and the fellow a coarse rudelooking man though rather expensively dressed flourished his fist in the face of the young man but was requited that instant with a round blow that levelled him with the ground  the others fell back from the tall stronglimbed openfaced youth and the girl took the opportunity of moving forward swiftly indeed but so steadily as to betray no air of terror  meantime the young gentlemans voice might be heard assuring his adversaries that he was ready to encounter one or all of them so soon as he had escorted the lady safe home  perhaps she hoped that another attack would delay him but if so her expectations were disappointed for in a second or two his quick firm tread followed her and just as she had gained the mazy woodpath he was beside her  thanks sir she said for the service you have done me but i am now in safety  nay lady do me the grace of letting me bear your load  thanks again she said but i feel no weight  but my knighthood does seeing you thus laden  spare your knighthood the sight then she said smiling and looking up with a glance of brightness such as her hitherto sedate face had never before revealed to him  that cannot be he exclaimed with fervency  you bid me in vain leave you till i see you safe and while with you all laws of courtesy call on me to bear your burthen  so lady  and he laid his hand upon the leathern thong that sustained the pitcher but at that moment three or four heaps of rags that had been lying under the trees by the woodland path erected themselves and one in especial whom the young knight had observed as a frightful cripple seated by day near the well now came forward brandishing his crutch in a formidable manner and uttering a howl of defiance  but the lady silenced him at once   peace good trig nothing is amiss  it is only this gentlemans courtesy  he hath done me good service on the green yonder  and as her strange bodyguard retreated growling she perhaps to show her confidence resigned her pitcher into the knights hand  so fair queen of the dewdrops he said half bewildered thou dost work miracles  ay when the dew is on the grass and the nightingale sings she returned gaily by day the enchantment is over  by this time they had reached a low turf hut and the maiden turning at the door held out her hand and said thanks fair sir i must enter my enchanted palace alone but grammercy for thy kind service and farewell  the maiden and the pitcher vanished  the knight watched the rude door in vainhe only saw a few streaks of light through the boards then he bethought him of questioning her guards but when he reached their tree they were gone  it was fast growing dark and he was one of the kings personal attendants and subject to the strict regulations of his household so dazed and bewildered as he was he walked hastily back to the hospice where the king and queen lodged supper had already begun and the glare of lights dazzled his eyes in his bewilderment he served the king with mustard instead of honey from the great silver ship full of condiments in the centre of the table  hows this sir john said the king who always had a kindly corner in his heart for this young knight  are these the idle days of thy crusade come again  i could wellnigh think so halfwhispered sir john  he looks moonstruck cried that spoilt ten years old damsel joan of acre clasping her hands with mischievous fun  oh has he seen the queen of the dewdrops  what dost thou know of the queen of the dewdrops my lady malapert said king edward marking the red flush that mounted to the very brow of the downright young knight  oh i know that she is at the well every morning and is as lovely as the dawn  ay and vanishes so soon as the sun is up but not ere she has bewitched every knight of them all  and did not my lord of dunster hold the field in her honour against all comers  no wonder she appears to himoh tell us sir john what like was she  hush joan said queen eleanor bending forward no infanta in my time ever said so much in a breath  no ladymother because you had to speak whole mouthfuls of grave castillian words  now good english can be run off in a breath reyna del rociothats more majestic but not so like fairyland as queen of the dewdrops  princess joans mouth was effectually stopped this time  the adventure of the evening had led to the discovery of the hut of the queen of the dewdrops  the young knight had as usual been betimes at the well but the maiden did not appear there  then he questioned the cripplewho by day was an absolute helpless cripple but the man utterly denied all knowledge of any such circumstance he why poor wretch that he was he never hobbled further than the shed close behind the well he would give the world if he could get as far as the woodhe knew nothing about ladies or pilgrimssuch a leg as his was enough to think about  and the display to which he forthwith treated the knight of dunster was highly convincing as to his incapacity  into the wood wandered the muchconfused knight recognizing step by step the path of the night before  the turf hut was before himthe door was openand in the doorway sat the maiden herself spinning the distaff by her side the spindle dancing on the ground and the pilgrims hat no longer hiding her beauteous brow and wealth of dark braided hair  but intolerable sight seven or eight of last nights loungers were dispersed hither and thither in the bushes gazing with all their eyes endeavouring to attract her attention some by conversations with one another one richlydressed gascon squire of the train of edwards ally the count de bearn by singing a provencal love ditty while a merchant of bristol set up a counter attempt with a long doleful english ballad  all the time the fair spinster sat in the doorway with the utmost gravity twisting her thread and twirling her spindle but it might be observed that she had so placed herself as to have full command of the door and to be able to shut herself in whenever she chose  no one had yet ventured to accost her  there was something in her air that rendered it almost impossible for any one to force himself upon her and a sort of fear mingled with the impression she made however the young knight although a bashful man by nature had one advantage in his court breeding and another in the acquaintance he had made last night  he walked straight up and doffing his velvet cap began greet you well fair queen  i could not but take your challenge to see whether your power lasted when the dew was off  the damsel rose with due courtesy as he approached but ere she had attempted an answer nay even before the words were out of his mouth the gascon was shouting in french that this was no fair play he had stolen a march and the merchant had sprung forward saying girl beware court gallants mean not well by country wenches  thou liest in thy throat burst forth the knight  discourteous lubber to call such a queen of beauty a country wench  listen to me girl  lady hear me  hearken not to the popinjay foreigner  these and many more tumultuary exclamations threats and entreaties crowded on one another and the various speakers were laying hand on staff or sword and glaring angrily on one another when the word peace in the maidens clear silvery notes sounded among them  they all turned as she stood in the doorway drawn up to her full height  peace she said i can have no brawling here  my father was grievously sick yesterday and is still ill at ease  one by one speak your business and begone  you first sir to the gascon she said in french  ah fair lady what business could be mine save to tell you how lovely you are  you have said she answered without a blush waving him aside now you sir to the tuneful merchant of bristol  i told you madam he meant not well  those aliens never do  you too have said she answered  the merchant would have persisted but a london merchant a much more substantial and considerable character pushed him aside and the numbers being all against him he was forced to give way   young woman said the merchant you are plainly of better birth and breeding than you choose to affect  now i am thinking of getting married  i have ships at sea and stuffs and jewels coming from venice and araby and i am like to be lord mayor ere long but theres that i like in your face and discreet bearing and ill make you my wife and give you all my keysyour father willing  your turns out old burgher said a big burly and much younger man pressing forward  pretty wench  im not like to be lord mayor nor nothing of that sort but im a score of years nigher thine age and a lusty fellow to boot that could floor any man at singlestick within the four seas  ay and have been thought comely too though joyce o the haugh did play me false and i come o this pilgrimage just to be merry and forget it  if thou wilt take me and come back to spite joyce thou shalt be hostess of the black bull at brentford where all the great folk from the north ever put up when they come to town the merriest and richest hostel and will have the comeliest host and hostess round about london town  the lady bowed her head  perhaps those rosy lips were trying hard to keep from laughing  a hostels no place for a discreet dame to bide in put forth an honest voice  maiden i know not who or what you are but i came o this pilgrimage to please my old mother who said i might do my soul good and bring home a wifebetter over the moor than over the mixenand i know she would give thee a right good welcome  im baldric of the cheddar cliff and we have held our land ever since the old days or ever the norman kings came here  three hundred kine woman and seven score swine and many an acre of good corn land under the hill  the lady had never looked up while these suitors were speaking  when baldric of cheddar had done she gave one furtive glance through her long eyelashes as if to see if there were any more and then her cheek flushed  there still remained the knight  some others had slunk away when brought to such close quarters but he stepped forth more hesitatingly and said lady i know not whether the bare rock and castle i have to offer can weigh against the ships the hostel or the swine  i have few of either i am but a poor baron but such as i am i am wholly yours  thine eyes have bound me to you for ever and all i seek is leave to make myself better known and to ask that your noble father may not deem me wholly unworthy to be your suitor  the lady trembled a little but she held her place in the doorway gentles she said i thank ye for the honour ye have done me but i may not dispose of mine own self  my father is ill at ease and can see no one but he bids me tell you that he will meet all who have aught to say to him under the trysting tree at bethnal green the day after the midsummer feast  with these words she retired into her hut and closed the door  she was seen again no more that day and on the next the hut stood open empty and deserted    chapter xvthe beggars dowry    but first you shall promise and have it well knowne the gold that you drop shall all be your owne with that they replyed contented we bee then heres quoth the beggar for pretty bessee old ballad  the day after midsummer had come and towards the fine elm tree that then adorned the centre of bethnal green three horsemen were wending their way  each had his steed a good deal loaded  each looked about him anxiously  by st boniface said one the girls father is not there  saucy little baggage was she deluding us all  belike he is bringing too long a train of mules with her dowry to make much speed quoth the merchant  he will think it needful to collect all his gear to meet the offers of master lambert of cripple gate  ha  sir knight well met  you are going to try your venture  i must  so it were not all enchantment said the knight almost breathlessly gazing round him  yet he said almost to himself those eyes had a soul and memories that neer came out of fairyland  ha exclaimed the innkeeper theres old blind hal under the tree ill tell him to get out of our way  hal he shouted heres a tester for thee but thoust best keep out of the way of the mules  what mules master samson coolly demanded hal who had comfortably established himself under the tree with his back against the trunk  the mules that the brave burgess is going to bring his daughters dowry on  they are cranky brutes hal bad customers for blind men best let me give thee a hand out of the way  but who is this burgess that you talk of asked the beggar  the father of the pilgrim lass that prayed at st winifreds well said samson  and was called queen of the dewdrops  ay ay old fellow  thou knowest every bird that flies  she is to be my wife i tell thee and a right warm corner shall she keep for thee at the black bull for thou canst make sport for the guests right well  i hope she will keep a warm corner for me said the beggar for no man will treat for her marriage save myself  thou  old man who sent thee here to insult us cried the merchant  none master lambert  i trysted you to meet me here if you purposed still to seek my child in marriage  thy child cried all three vehemently  my child answered the beggar  mine own lawful child  there was a silence  presently samson growled i mind me he used to have a little blackeyed brat with him  caitiff exclaimed the merchant ill have thy old vagabond bones in the fleet for daring so to cheat his graces lieges  if you can prove a cheat against me i will readily abye it sir returned the beggar  palming a beggars brat off for a noble dame  so please you sir interrupted the beggar keep truth with you what did the child or i ever profess save what we were  no foul words here  i trysted you to meet me here anent her marriage  have you any offers to make me  aye of a cell in the fleet if you persist in your insolence cried the merchant  thanks quietly said the beggar  and you master samson  tis a sweet pretty lass said samson ruefully and pity of her too but you see a man like me must look to his credit  ill give her twenty marks to help her to a husband hal only let her keep out of my sight for ever and a day  i thought i heard another voice said the beggar  i trow the third suitor has made off without further ado  not so fair sir said a voice close to him thick and choked with feeling  your daughter is too dear to me for me thus to part even were mine honour not pledged  sir knight interfered the merchant you will get into a desperate coil with your friends  i am my own master answered the knight  my parents are dead  i am of age and sir i offer myself and all that is mine to your fair daughter as i did at saint winifreds well as one bound both by honour and love  it is spoken honourably said hal but sir canst thou answer me with her dowry  tell down coin for coin  he held up a heavy leathern bag  the knight who had come prepared took down another such bag from his saddlebow  down went one silver piece from the knight  down went another from the beggar  stay stay cried samson  i can play at that game too  no no master samson said the beggar your pretensions are resigned  your chance is over  mark after markcrown after crownall the dunster rents all the old hoards with queer figures of saxon kings lay on the grass still for each the beggar had rained down its fellow and inexhaustible seemed the bags that he sat upon  samson bit his lips and the merchant muttered with vexation  it could not be fairly come by  he must be the president of a den of robbers it should be looked to  the last bag of the knight lay thin and exhausted the beggar clutched one bursting with repletion  i could not put the lands and castle of dunster into a bag and add thereto said the knight at last  would that i could my sword my spurs and knightly blood to boot and lay them at your daughters feet  let them weigh in the balance said the beggar and therewith thy truth to thy word  and will you own me exclaimed the knight  will you take me to your daughter  nay i said not so returned blind hal  i am not in such haste come back on this day week when i shall have learnt whether thou art worthy to match with my child  worthy john of dunster chafed and bit his lips at such words from a beggar  ay worthy repeated the beggar guessing his irritation  i like thee well as a man of thy word so far but i must know more of him who is to mate with my pretty bessee  it was that evening that a page entered the royal apartments and giving a ring to the king informed him that a blind beggar had sent it in and entreated to speak with him  pray him to come hither said the king and lead him carefully thou joan hadst better seek thy mother and sister  o sweet father cried joan dont order me off  this can be no state business  prithee let me hear it  that must be as my guest pleases joan he answered and thou must be very discreet or we shall have him reproaching me for trying to rule the realm when i cannot rule my own house  father i verily think you are afraid of that beggar  i am sure he is as mysterious as the queen of the dewdrops cried the mischievous girl  the curtain over the doorway was drawn back and the beggar was led into the chamber  the king advanced to meet him and took his hand to lead him to a seat  good morrow to thee he said cousin i am glad thou art come at last to see me  thanks my lord said the beggar with more of courtly tone than when they had met before and yet joan thought she had never seen her father addressed so much as an equal are any here present with you  only my wilful little crusading daughter joan said edward beckoning to her and putting her proud reluctant fingers into the hand of the beggar who bent and raised them to his lipsas the fashion then waswhile the maiden reddened and looked to her father but saw him only smiling she shall leave us he added if thy matters are for my private ear  in what can i aid thee  in this matter of daughters answered the beggar not that i need aid of yours but counsel  i would know if the heir of old reginald mohunjohn i think they call himbe a worthy mate for my wench  joan had in the meantime placed herself between her fathers knees where she stood regarding this wonderful beggar with the most unmitigated astonishment  john of dunster said the king stroking down joans hair thou knowst his lineage as well as i cousin  his lineage true replied henry but look you my lord my child the light of mine eyes may not go from me without being assured that it is to one who will i say not equal her in birth but will be a faithful and loving lord to her  hath he sought her asked the king  even so my liege  the maid is scarce sixteen i thought to have kept her longer but so it wasold winny her mothers old nurse fell sick and died in the winter and the dominican who came to shrive her must needs craze the poor fool with threats that she did a deadly sin in bringing my sweet wife and me together and for all the grand prior who monk as he is has a soldiers sense could say of the love that conquered death nothing would serve the poor woman to die in peace till my bessee had vowed to make a six weeks station at her patronesss well where we were wedded and pray for her soul and her blessed mothers  so there we journeyed for our summer roaming and all had been well had you not come down on us with all the idle danglers of the court to gaze and rhyme and tilt about the first fair face they saw  even then so discreet was the girl that no more had befallen but as illluck would have it my old evesham keepsake touching his side burst forth again one evening and left me so spent that bessee sent the boy to get me a draught of wine  the boymountebank as he islost her groat and played truant and she poor wench got into such fear for me that she went herself and fell in with a sort of insolent masterful rogues from whom this young knight saved her  i took her home safe enough after that and thought to be rid of the knaves when they saw my wallet and so truly i am all save this lad  o father it is true love whispered joan  what hast to do with true love popinjay  and so john of dunster came undaunted to the breach did he henry  not a whit dismayed he  now either that is making light of his honour or tis an honour higher than most lads understand  cousin i would have the child be loved as her father and mother loved  and methinks she affects this blade  the child hath been less like my merry lark since we met him  a plague on the springalds  but you know him  has he your good word  john of dunster said the king  henry didst thou not know for whose sake i had loved and proved him  he was richards pupil  i was forced to take the child with me for old sir reginald had been unruly enough and i thought would be the less troublesome to my father were his son in my keeping  but i half repented when i saw what a small urchin it was to be cast about among grooms and pages but richard aided the little uncouth varlet nursed him when sick guarded him when well trained him to be loyal and steadfast  the little fellow came bravely to my aid in my grapple with the traitor before acre and when the blow had fallen on richard the boys grief was such that i loved him ever after  and of late i have had no truer trustier warrior  i warrant me he was too shy to tell thee that i knighted him last year in the midst of some of the best feats of arms i ever beheld against the welsh  whatever john de mohun saith is sooth and i would rather mate my daughter with him than with many a man of fairer speech  then shall he have my pretty bessee said the beggar lingering over the words  but one boon i would further ask cousin that thou breathe no word to him of my having sought thee  the young lord of dunster had not been noted for choiceness of apparel but when he repaired to the trystingtree none could have found fault with the folds of his long crimson tunic worked with the black and gold colours of his family nor with the sit of the broad belt that sustained his sword assuredly none with his beautiful sleek black charger  but under the tree stood not the blind beggar but the beggars boy  blind hal bids you meet him at the spital at your good pleasure said the boy and like the mountebank he was tumbled three times head over heels  john de mohun looked round and about and saw no alternative but to obey  all his love was required to endure so strange a fatherin law who did not seem in the least grateful for the honour intended to his daughter but the knights word was pledged and he rode towards the hospital  the court of the hospital was full of steeds and servingmen  a strange conviction came over john that he saw the kings strong white chargeray and the palfreys of the elder princesses and he asked the laybrother who offered to take his horse if the king were there  the brother only replied by motioning him towards the inner quadrangle  he passed on accordingly and as he went the bells broke forth into a merry peal  on the top of the steps leading to the arched doorway he saw a scarlet cluster of knights and among them the grand prior robed as for mass  a space was clear within the deep porch and there stood the beggar in his russet suit  sir john de mohun of dunster he said thou art come hither to espouse my daughter  i hope so sir said john somewhat taken by surprise  come hither maiden said her father  the cluster of knights opened and from within the church there appeared before the astonished bridegroom the stately form of king edward leading in his hand the darktressed darkhaired maiden dressed in spotless white the only adornment she wore a circlet of diamonds round her flowing dark hairthe queen indeed of the dew drops  and behind her walked with calm dignity the beautiful princess eleanor now nearly a woman holding with a warning hand the merry mischievous joan  well might john of dunster stand dazzled and amazed but hesitation or delay there was none  then and there by the grand prior himself was the ceremony performed without a word of further explanation the rite over when the bridegroom took the brides hand to follow as all were marshalled on their way he knew not whither she looked up to him through her dark eyelashes and murmured they would not have it otherwise  deem you that i would said the knight fervently pressing her hand  i deemed that you should know allwho i am she faltered  my wife the lady of dunster  that is all i need to know replied sir john with the honest trustworthy look that showed it was indeed enough to secure his heartwhole love and reverence  the great hall of the spital was decked for the bridal feast  the bride and bridegroom were placed at the head of the table and the king gave up his place beside the bride to her blind father  all the space within the cloister without was strewn with rushes where sat and feasted the whole fraternity of beggars and well did the grand prior and his knights do their part in the entertainment  then when the banquet was drawing to its close the blind beggar bade the boy that waited near him fetch his harp  and as had often before been his practice he sang in a deep manly voice to the boys accompaniment on his harp  but the song that then he sang had never been heard before nor was its exact like ever heard again though tradition has handed down a few of the main features and as may be seen by this veracious narration somewhat vulgarized them   a poore beggars daughter did dwell on a greene who might for her faireness have well been a queene a blithe bonny lasse and a dainty was she and many one called her pretty bessee   even the king who had so well guarded the secret was entirely unprepared to hear the montfort parentage thus publicly avowed and the bride who had as little known of her fathers intentions sat with downcast eyes blushing and tearful while the beggars recitative went briefly and somewhat tremulously over his resuscitation under the hands of the fair and faithful isabel  her hand was held by her bridegroom from the first with a pressure meant to assure her that no discovery could alter his love and regard but when the name of montfort sounded on his ear the hand wrung hers with anxiety and when the entire tale had been told and the last chord was dying away he murmured look up at me my loveliest  now i know why i first loved thine eyes  thou art dearer to me than ever for the sake of my first and best friend  his words were only for herself  the king was saying aloud  well sung fair cousin  a health my lords and knights for sir henry de montfort earl of leicester  not so lords and knights called this strange personage the only one who would thus have contradicted the king the earl of leicester has long ago been dead as you have heard  if you drink let it be to blind hal of bethnal green  nor could all the entreaties of daughter soninlaw nor king move him from his purpose of living and dying as blind hal the beggar he had tasted too long of liberty he said to put himself under constraint  to live in somersetshire as his daughter wished would have been banishment and solitude to one used to divert himself with every humour of the city and to be as he declared a far more complete king of the beggars than ever his cousin edward was over england  all he would consent to was that a room in a lodge in windsor park should be set apart for him under charge of adam de gourdon who had been present at this scene and was infinitely rejoiced at the sight of a scion of the house of montfort  for the rest he bade every one to forget his avowal which as he said he had only made that the blanch lion might share with the mohun cross and as he added to princess eleanor that you court dames may never flout at pretty bessee  had the cheddar yeoman been the true man none had ever known that she was a montfort  would you have given her to the cheddar yeoman burst out joan furiously  that he will say so to anger thee is certain joan said the king  farewell henry  remember i hold thee bound to be my comrade when i can return to the holy war  ay when you have tamed scotland even as you have tamed wales returned henry  no fear of my good brother alexanders realm needing such taming heaven forbid said edward  but the beggar parted from him with a laugh    chapter xvithe pages memory    the pure calm picture of a blameless friend lyra apostolica  ten years later king edward was walking in the park at windsor with slow and weary steps  his rich dark brown hair and beard were lined with gray his face was not only grave but worn and melancholy and more severe than ever  the sorrow of his life his queens death had fallen on him and with her had gone much of softening influence the only son who had been spared to him was though a mere child grieving him by the wayward frivolities not of a strong but of a weak nature he had wrought much for his countrys good but had often been thwarted and never thanked his mercies and benefits were forgotten his justice counted as harshness and hatred and opposition had met him everywhere  above all and weighting him perhaps most severely was that his first step beyond his just bounds had been taken in the north  john baliol was indeed king but edward in his zeal for discipline had bound scotland with obligationsfor her good indeed but beyond his just right to impose and the sense of aggression was embittering him against the scottish resistance while at the same time adding to his sadness  a knight came forth from one of the paths that led into that along which he was pacing with folded arms and unwilling to break upon his mood stood waiting till edward himself looked up and asked impatiently so sir john what now  another outbreak of those intolerable scotch  not so my lord but the bailiff of acre awaits to see you  bailiff of acre  what is the bailiff of acre to me  i cannot hear all their importunities for a crusade  heaven knows how gladly i would hasten to the holy war if these savage scots would give me peace at home  i am weary of their solicitations  cannot you tell him i would be private john  my lord he says he has matter for your private ear concerning one whom you met in palestineand my lord you will sure remember him sir reginald ferrers  the friend of richard said edward with a changed countenance bring him with you to your fatherinlaws lodge john  if there be aught to hear of the house of montfort it concerns him and you likewise  i was on my way thither  in a short time the woodland lodge in one of the most beautiful glades of windsor forest beheld the king seated on a bench placed beneath a magnificent oak standing alone in its own glade and beside him the blind beggar in his russet suit far less changed than his royal cousin during these years  since edwards great sorrow henry de montfort had held less apart from him and whenever the king was at leisure to snatch a short retirement at one of his hunting lodges he always sent an intimation to the beggar who would journey down on a sober ass and under the care of de gourdon now the chief of the hunting staff would meet the king in some sylvan glade  why it was a comfort to edward to be with him it would be hard to say probably from the habit of old fellowship for henrys humour had not grown more courtly or less caustic  from under the trees came john de mohun now a brave stout hearty looking english baron and with him wrapped in a battered and soiled scarlet mantle a warworn soldier his complexion tanned to deep brown his hair bleached with toil and sun a scar on his cheek a halt on his stepaltogether a man in whom none would have recognized the bright graceful highspirited young hospitalier of twenty years since  only when he spoke and the smiling light beamed in his eye could he be known for sir reginald ferrers  he would have bent his knee but edward took his hand and bowing his own bared head said it is we who should crave a blessing from you holy father last defender of the sacred land  alas my lord said sir raynald as he made the gesture of blessing heavens will he done  had we but been worthier  sir he added i am in no guise for a royal presence but i have been sent home from cyprus to recover from my wounds and i had a message for you which i deemed you would gladly hear before i had joined mine order  a message said edward  a message from a dying penitent craving pardon replied sir raynald  if it concerns the house of montfort speak on said edward  none are so near to it as those present with me  thou hast guessed right my lord king replied sir raynald  it does concern that house  have i your license to tell my tale at some length  edward gave permission and a seat having been brought sir raynald proceeded to speak of that last siege of acre when amid the multitudinous tribunals of mixed races and the many sanctuaries which sheltered crime the unhappy city had become a disgrace to the christian name  the sultan malek seraf was concentrating his forces on it all the unwarlike inhabitants had been sent away and the knights of the two orders with the king of cyprus and his troops had shut themselves up for their last resistancewhen among the mercenaries who enrolled themselves in the pay of the hospitaliers came a sunburnt warrior who had evidently had long experience of eastern warfare though his speech was english french or provencal according to the person who addressed him  fierce and dreadful was the daily strife the new soldier fought well but he was not noticed till one night  ah sir said the hospitalier even then our holy and beautiful house was in dire confusion our garden trodden down and desolate  one night i heard strange choking sobs as of one in anguish  i deemed that one of our wounded had in delirium wandered into the garden and was dying there  but i found at the foot of the stone cross we set beside the fountain where the attempt on you sir was madethis warrior lying so writhing with anguish that i could scarce believe it was grief not pain that thus wrought with him  i lifted him up and spake of repentance and pardon  no pardon for him he said it was here that he had slain his brother  i spake long and earnestly with him but he called himself sacrilegious murderer again and again  nay he had even when after that wretched night you wot of sir he left our housein his despair and hope to leave remorse behind he had become a moslem and fought in the saracen ranks  all hope he spurned  no mercy for him was his cry  i would have deemed sobut oh i thought of richards parting hope i remembered our german brethrens tale how the holy father the pope said there was as little hope of pardon as that his staff should bud and blossom and lo in one night it bore bud and flower  i besought him for richards sake to let me strive in prayer for him  all day we fought on the wallsall night beside richards cross did he lie and weep and groan and i would pray till strength failed both of us  day after day night after night and still the miserable man looked gray with despair and still he told me that he knew absolution would but mock his doom  he could fear but could not sorrow  and still i spoke of the saviours love of manand still i prayed and all our house prayed with me though they knew not who the sinner was for whom i besought their prayers at lastit was the day when the towers on the walls had been woni came back from the breach and scarce rested to eat bread ere i went on to the cedar and the cross  beside it knelt sir simon  father he said i trust that the pardon that takes away the sin of the world will take away mine  grant me absolution  he was with us when ere dawn such of us as still lived met for our last mass in our beautiful chapel  he went forth with us to the wall  by and by the command was given that we should make a sally upon the enemys camp  we went back for the last time to our house to fetch our horses i knew there could be no return and went for one last look into our chapel and at richards tomb  upon it lay the knight horribly scathed with greek firehe had dragged him there to die he was dead but his looks were upward his face was as calm as richards was my lord when we laid him down by the fountain  and now his message my lord  he bade me say if i survived the siege that he had often cursed you for the worse revenge of letting him live to his remorsenow he blessed you for sparing him to repent  and richards grave has passed to the infidels said edward after a long silence  even as the graves of our brethrenthe holiest grave of all said the knight hospitalier  cheer up and hope father said the king  let me see peace and order at home and we will win back acre ay and jerusalem from the infidels  alas our young hopes and joys may never return but home purified then may god bless our arms beneath the cross   fifteen years more and in the beautiful westminster abbey amid the gorgeous tombs there stood four sorrowful figures  a sturdy knight with bowed head and mournful look carefully guided a whitehaired whitebearded old man while a beautiful matronly lady was handed by her tall handsome son  among the richly inlaid shrines and monuments they sought out one the latest of all but consisting of one enormous block of stone with no ornament save one slender band of inscription  ah said the knight well do i remember the shipping of that stone from acre little guessing its purpose  then it is indeed a stone from the ruined temple of jerusalem said the lady  read the inscription my son  the young man read and translated    edwardus primus  malleus scotorum          pactum serva edward the first  the hammer of the scots  keep covenant   it was scarce worth while to bring a stone from jerusalem to mark it with the hammer of the scots said the lady  alas my cousin edward sighed the beggar  ever with a great scheme ever going earnestly on to its fulfilment with a mind too far above those of other men to be understood or loved as thou shouldst have been  alack that the scottish temptation came between thee and the brightness of thy glory  art thou indeed gonelike richardto jerusalem and shall i yet follow thee there  let us pray for the peace of his soul children for a greater and better man lies here than england knows or heeds    footnotes  1  psalm cxxvi 6 7
