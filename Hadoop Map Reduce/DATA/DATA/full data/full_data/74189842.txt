although it can be read as a separate story is the third of the trilogy of which marie and child of storm are the first two parts  it narrates through the mouth of allan quatermain the consummation of the vengeance of the wizard zikali alias the opener of roads or thethingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn upon the royal zulu house of which senzangacona was the founder and cetewayo our enemy in the war of 1879 the last representative who ruled as a king  although of course much is added for the purposes of romance the main facts of history have been adhered to with some faithfulness  with these the author became acquainted a full generation ago fortune having given him a part in the events that preceded the zulu war  indeed he believes that with the exception of colonel phillips who as a lieutenant commanded the famous escort of twentyfive policemen he is now the last survivor of the party who under the leadership of sir theophilus shepstone or sompseu as the natives called him from the zambesi to the cape were concerned in the annexation of the transvaal in 1877  recently also he has been called upon as a public servant to revisit south africa and took the opportunity to travel through zululand in order to refresh his knowledge of its people their customs their mysteries and better to prepare himself for the writing of this book  here he stood by the fatal mount of isandhlawana which with some details of the battle is described in these pages among the graves of many whom once he knew colonels durnford pulleine and others  also he saw ulundis plain where the traces of war still lie thick and talked with an old zulu who fought in the attacking impi until it crumbled away before the fire of the martinis and shells from the heavy guns  the battle of the wall of sheet iron he called it perhaps because of the flashing fence of bayonets  lastly in a mealie patch he found the spot on which the corn grows thin where king cetewayo breathed his last poisoned without a doubt as he has known for many years  it is to be seen at the kraal ominously named jazi or translated into english finished  the tragedy happened long ago but even now the quietfaced zulu who told the tale looking about him as he spoke would not tell it all  yes as a young man i was there at the time but i do not remember i do not knowthe inkoosi lundanda ie this chronicler so named in past years by the zulus stands on the very place where the king diedhis bed was on the left of the doorhole of the hut and so forth but no certain word as to the exact reason of this sudden and violent death or by whom it was caused  the name of that destroyer of a king is for ever hid  in this story the actual and immediate cause of the declaration of war against the british power is represented as the appearance of the white goddess or spirit of the zulus who is or was called nomkubulwana or inkosazanayzulu ie the princess of heaven  the exact circumstances which led to this decision are not now ascertainable though it is known that there was much difference of opinion among the zulu indunas or great captains and like the writer many believe that king cetewayo was personally averse to war against his old allies the english  the authors friend mr j y gibson at present the representative of the union in zululand writes in his admirable history there was a good deal of discussion amongst the assembled zulu notables at ulundi but of how counsel was swayed it is not possible now to obtain a reliable account  the late mr f b fynney frgs who also was his friend in days bygone and with the exception of sir theophilus shepstone who perhaps knew the zulus and their language better than any other official of his day speaking of this fabled goddess wrote i remember that just before the zulu war nomkubulwana appeared revealing something or other which had a great effect throughout the land  the use made of this strange traditional guardian angel in the following tale is not therefore an unsupported flight of fancy and the same may be said of many other incidents such as the account of the reading of the proclamation annexing the transvaal at pretoria in 1877 which have been introduced to serve the purposes of the romance  mameena who haunts its pages in a literal as well as figurative sense is the heroine of child of storm a book to which she gave her own poetic title   1916 the author    chapter i     allan quatermain meets anscombe      you my friend into whose hand if you live i hope these scribblings of mine will pass one day must well remember the 12th of april of the year 1877 at pretoria  sir theophilus shepstone or sompseu for i prefer to call him by his native name having investigated the affairs of the transvaal for a couple of months or so had made up his mind to annex that country to the british crown  it so happened that i allan quatermain had been on a shooting and trading expedition at the back of the lydenburg district where there was plenty of game to be killed in those times  hearing that great events were toward i made up my mind curiosity being one of my weaknesses to come round by pretoria which after all was not very far out of my way instead of striking straight back to natal  as it chanced i reached the town about eleven oclock on this very morning of the 12th of april and trekking to the church square proceeded to outspan there as was usual in the seventies  the place was full of people english and dutch together and i noted that the former seemed very elated and were talking excitedly while the latter for the most part appeared to be sullen and depressed  presently i saw a man i knew a tall dark man a very good fellow and an excellent shot named robinson  by the way you knew him also for afterwards he was an officer in the pretoria horse at the time of the zulu war the corps in which you held a commission  i called to him and asked what was up  a good deal allan he said as he shook my hand  indeed we shall be lucky if all isnt up or something like it before the day is over  shepstones proclamation annexing the transvaal is going to be read presently  i whistled and asked  how will our boer friends take it  they dont look very pleased  thats just what no one knows allan  burgers the president is squared they say  he is to have a pension also he thinks it the only thing to be done  most of the hollanders up here dont like it but i doubt whether they will put out their hands further than they can draw them back  the question iswhat will be the line of the boers themselves  there are a lot of them about all armed you see and more outside the town  what do you think  cant tell you  anything may happen  they may shoot shepstone and his staff and the twentyfive policemen or they may just grumble and go home  probably they have no fixed plan  how about the english  oh we are all crazy with joy but of course there is no organization and many have no arms  also there are only a few of us  well i answered i came here to look for excitement life having been dull for me of late and it seems that i have found it  still i bet you those dutchmen do nothing except protest they are slim and know that the shooting of an unarmed mission would bring england on their heads  cant say i am sure  they like shepstone who understands them and the move is so bold that it takes their breath away  but as the kaffirs say when a strong wind blows a small spark will make the whole veld burn  it just depends upon whether the spark is there  if an englishman and a boer began to fight for instance anything might happen  goodbye i have got a message to deliver if things go right we might dine at the european tonight and if they dont goodness knows where we shall dine  i nodded sagely and he departed  then i went to my wagon to tell the boys not to send the oxen off to graze at present for i feared lest they should be stolen if there were trouble but to keep them tied to the trektow  after this i put on the best coat and hat i had feeling that as an englishman it was my duty to look decent on such an occasion washed brushed my hairwith me a ceremony without meaning for it always sticks upand slipped a loaded smith  wesson revolver into my inner poacher pocket  then i started out to see the fun and avoiding the groups of surlylooking boers mingled with the crowd that i saw was gathering in front of a long low building with a broad stoep which i supposed rightly to be one of the government offices  presently i found myself standing by a tall rather looselybuilt man whose face attracted me  it was cleanshaven and much bronzed by the sun but not in any way goodlooking the features were too irregular and the nose was a trifle too long for good looks  still the impression it gave was pleasant and the steady blue eyes had that twinkle in them which suggests humour  he might have been thirty or thirtyfive years of age and notwithstanding his rough dress that consisted mainly of a pair of trousers held up by a belt to which hung a pistol and a common flannel shirt for he wore no coat i guessed at once that he was englishborn  for a while neither of us said anything after the taciturn habit of our people even on the veld and indeed i was fully occupied in listening to the truculent talk of a little party of mounted boers behind us  i put my pipe into my mouth and began to hunt for my tobacco taking the opportunity to show the hilt of my revolver so that these men might see that i was armed  it was not to be found i had left it in the wagon  if you smoke boer tobacco said the stranger i can help you and i noted that the voice was as pleasant as the face and knew at once that the owner of it was a gentleman  thank you sir  i never smoke anything else i answered whereon he produced from his trousers pocket a pouch made of lion skin of unusually dark colour  i never saw a lion as black as this except once beyond buluwayo on the borders of lobengulas country i said by way of making conversation  curious answered the stranger for thats where i shot the brute a few months ago  i tried to keep the whole skin but the white ants got at it  been trading up there i asked  nothing so useful he said  just idling and shooting  came to this country because it was one of the very few i had never seen and have only been here a year  i think i have had about enough of it though  can you tell me of any boats running from durban to india  i should like to see those wild sheep in kashmir  i told him that i did not know for certain as i had never taken any interest in india being an african elephanthunter and trader but i thought they did occasionally  just then robinson passed by and called to me  theyll be here presently quatermain but sompseu isnt coming himself  does your name happen to be allan quatermain asked the stranger  if so i have heard plenty about you up in lobengulas country and of your wonderful shooting  yes i replied but as for the shooting natives always exaggerate  they never exaggerated about mine he said with a twinkle in his eye  anyhow i am very glad to see you in the flesh though in the spirit you rather bored me because i heard too much of you  whenever i made a particularly bad miss my gunbearer who at some time seems to have been yours would say ah if only it had been the inkosi macumazahn how different would have been the end  my name is anscombe maurice anscombe he added rather shyly  afterwards i discovered from a book of reference that he was a younger son of lord mountford one of the richest peers in england  then we both laughed and he said  tell me mr quatermain if you will what those boers are saying behind us  i am sure it is something unpleasant but as the only dutch i know is guten tag and vootsack goodday and get out that takes me no forwarder  it ought to i answered for the substance of their talk is that they object to be vootsacked by the british government as represented by sir theophilus shepstone  they are declaring that they won the land with their blood and want to keep their own flag flying over it  a very natural sentiment broke in anscombe  they say that they wish to shoot all damned englishmen especially shepstone and his people and that they would make a beginning now were they not afraid that the damned english government being angered would send thousands of damned english rooibatjes that is redcoats and shoot them out of evil revenge  a very natural conclusion laughed anscombe again which i should advise them to leave untested  hush  here comes the show  i looked and saw a body of blackcoated gentlemen with one officer in the uniform of a colonel of engineers advancing slowly  i remember that it reminded me of a funeral procession following the corpse of the republic that had gone on ahead out of sight the procession arrived upon the stoep opposite to us and began to sort itself out whereon the english present raised a cheer and the boers behind us cursed audibly  in the middle appeared an elderly gentleman with whiskers and a stoop in whom i recognized mr osborn known by the kaffirs as malimati the chief of the staff  by his side was a tall young fellow yourself my friend scarcely more than a lad then carrying papers  the rest stood to right and left in a formal line  you gave a printed document to mr osborn who put on his glasses and began to read in a low voice which few could hear and i noticed that his hand trembled  presently he grew confused lost his place found it lost it again and came to a full stop  a nervousnatured man remarked mr anscombe  perhaps he thinks that those gentlemen are going to shoot  that wouldnt trouble him i answered who knew him well  his fears are purely mental  that was true since i know that this same sir melmoth osborn as he is now as i have told in the book i called child of storm swam the tugela alone to watch the battle of indondakasuka raging round him and on another occasion killed two kaffirs rushing at him with a right and left shot without turning a hair  it was reading this paper that paralyzed him not any fear of what might happen  there followed a very awkward pause such as occurs when a man breaks down in a speech  the members of the staff looked at him and at each other then behold you my friend grabbed the paper from his hand and went on reading it in a loud clear voice  that young man has plenty of nerve said mr anscombe  yes i replied in a whisper  quite right though  would have been a bad omen if the thing had come to a stop  well there were no more breakdowns and at last the long document was finished and the transvaal annexed  the britishers began to cheer but stopped to listen to the formal protest of the boer government if it could be called a government when everything had collapsed and the officials were being paid in postage stamps  i cant remember whether this was read by president burgers himself or by the officer who was called state secretary  anyway it was read after which there came an awkward pause as though people were waiting to see something happen  i looked round at the boers who were muttering and handling their rifles uneasily  had they found a leader i really think that some of the wilder spirits among them would have begun to shoot but none appeared and the crisis passed  the crowd began to disperse the english among them cheering and throwing up their hats the dutch with very sullen faces  the commissioners staff went away as it had come back to the building with blue gums in front of it which afterwards became government house that is all except you  you started across the square alone with a bundle of printed proclamations in your hand which evidently you had been charged to leave at the various public offices  let us follow him i said to mr anscombe  he might get into trouble and want a friend  he nodded and we strolled after you unostentatiously  sure enough you nearly did get into trouble  in front of the first office door to which you came stood a group of boers two of whom big fellows drew together with the evident intention of barring your way  mynheeren you said i pray you to let me pass on the queens business  they took no heed except to draw closer together and laugh insolently  again you made your request and again they laughed then i saw you lift your leg and deliberately stamp upon the foot of one of the boers  he drew back with an exclamation and for a moment i believed that he or his fellow was going to do something violent  perhaps they thought better of it or perhaps they saw us two englishmen behind and noticed anscombes pistol  at any rate you marched into the office triumphant and delivered your document  neatly done said mr anscombe  rash i said shaking my head very rash  well hes young and must be excused  but from that moment i took a great liking to you my friend perhaps because i wondered whether in your place i should have been daredevil enough to act in the same way  for you see i am english and i like to see an englishman hold his own against odds and keep up the credit of the country  although of course i sympathized with the boers who through their own fault were losing their land without a blow struck  as you know well for you were living near majuba at the time plenty of blows were struck afterwards but of that business i cannot bear to write i wonder how it will all work out after i am dead and if i shall ever learn what happens in the end  now i have only mentioned this business of the annexation and the part you played in it because it was on that occasion that i became acquainted with anscombe  for you have nothing to do with this story which is about the destruction of the zulus the accomplishment of the vengeance of zikali the wizard at the kraal named finished and incidentally the love affairs of two people in which that old wizard took a hand as i did to my sorrow  it happened that mr anscombe had ridden on ahead of his wagons which could not arrive at pretoria for a day or two and as he found it impossible to get accommodation at the european or elsewhere i offered to let him sleep in mine or rather alongside in a tent i had  he accepted and soon we became very good friends  before the day was out i discovered that he had served in a crack cavalry regiment but resigned his commission some years before  i asked him why  well he said i came into a good lot of money on my mothers death and could not see a prospect of any active service  while the regiment was abroad i liked the life well enough but at home it bored me  too much society for my taste and that sort of thing  also i wanted to travel nothing else really amuses me  you will soon get tired of it i answered and as you are well off marry some fine lady and settle down at home  dont think so  i doubt if i should ever be happily married i want too much  one doesnt pick up an earthly angel with a castiron constitution who adores you which are the bare necessities of marriage under every bush here i laughed also he added the laughter going out of his eyes i have had enough of fine ladies and their ways  marriage is better than scrapes i remarked sententiously  quite so but one might get them both together  no i shall never marry although i suppose i ought as my brothers have no children  wont you my friend thought i to myself when the skin grows again on your burnt fingers  for i was sure they had been burnt perhaps more than once  how i never learned for which i am rather sorry for it interests me to study burnt fingers if they do not happen to be my own  then we changed the subject  anscombes wagons were delayed for a day or two by a broken axle or a bog hole i forget which  so as i had nothing particular to do until the natal postcart left we spent the time in wandering about pretoria which did not take us long as it was but a little dorp in those days and chatting with all and sundry  also we went up to government house as it was now called and left cards or rather wrote our names in a book for we had no cards being told by one of the staff whom we met that we should do so  an hour later a note arrived asking us both to dinner that night and telling us very nicely not to mind if we had no dress things  of course we had to go anscombe rigged up in my second best clothes that did not fit him in the least as he was a much taller man than i am and a black satin bow that he had bought at beckets store together with a pair of shiny pumps  i actually met you my friend for the first time that evening and in trouble too though you may have forgotten the incident we had made a mistake about the time of dinner and arriving half an hour too soon were shown into a long room that opened on to the verandah  you were working there being i believe a private secretary at the time copying some despatch i think you said that which gave an account of the annexation  the room was lit by a paraffin lamp behind you for it was quite dark and the window was open or at any rate unshuttered  the gentleman who showed us in seeing that you were very busy took us to the far end of the room where we stood talking in the shadow  just then a door opened opposite to that which led to the verandah and through it came his excellency the administrator sir theophilus shepstone a stout man of medium height with a very clever thoughtful face as i have always thought one of the greatest of african statesmen  he did not see us but he caught sight of you and said testily  are you mad to which you answered with a laugh  i hope not more than usual sir but why  have i not told you always to let down the blinds after dark yet there you sit with your head against the light about the best target for a bullet that could be imagined  i dont think the boers would trouble to shoot me sir  if you had been here i would have drawn the blinds and shut the shutters too you answered laughing again  go to dress or you will be late for dinner he said still rather sternly and you went  but when you had gone and after we had been announced to him he smiled and added something which i will not repeat to you even now  i think it was about what you did on the annexation day of which the story had come to him  i mention this incident because whenever i think of shepstone whom i had known off and on for years in the way that a hunter knows a prominent government official it always recurs to my mind embodying as it does his caution and appreciation of danger derived from long experience of the country and the sternness he sometimes affected which could never conceal his love towards his friends  oh there was greatness in this man although they did call him an african talleyrand  if it had not been so would every native from the cape to the zambesi have known and revered his name as perhaps that of no other white man has been revered but i must get on with my tale and leave historical discussions to others more fitted to deal with them  we had a very pleasant dinner that night although i was so ashamed of my clothes with smart uniforms and white ties all about me and anscombe kept fidgeting his feet because he was suffering agony from his new pumps which were a size too small everybody was in the best of spirits for from all directions came the news that the annexation was well received and that the danger of any trouble had passed away  ah if we had only known what the end of it would be  it was on our way back to the wagon that i chanced to mention to anscombe that there was still a herd of buffalo within a few days trek of lydenburg of which i had shot two not a month before  are there by jove he said  as it happens i never got a buffalo always i just missed them in one sense or another and i cant leave africa with a pair of bought horns  lets go there and shoot some  i shook my head and replied that i had been idling long enough and must try to make some money news at which he seemed very disappointed  look here he said forgive me for mentioning it but business is business  if youll come you shant be a loser  again i shook my head whereat he looked more disappointed than before  very well he exclaimed then i must go alone  for kill a buffalo i will that is unless the buffalo kills me in which case my blood will be on your hands  i dont know why but at that moment there came into my mind a conviction that if he did go alone a buffalo or something would kill him and that then i should be sorry all my life  they are dangerous brutes much worse than lions i said  and yet you who pretend to have a conscience would expose me to their rage unprotected and alone he replied with a twinkle in his eye which i could see even by moonlight oh quatermain how i have been mistaken in your character  look here mr anscombe i said its no use  i cannot possibly go on a shooting expedition with you just now  only today i have heard from natal that my boy is not well and must undergo an operation which will lay him up for quite six weeks and may be dangerous  so i must get down to durban before it takes place  after that i have a contract in matabeleland whence you have just come to take charge of a trading store there for a year also perhaps to try to shoot a little ivory for myself  so i am fully booked up till let us say october 1878 that is for about eighteen months by which time i daresay i shall be dead  eighteen months replied this cool young man  that will suit me very well  i will go on to india as i intended then home for a bit and will meet you on the 1st of october 1878 after which we will proceed to the lydenburg district and shoot those buffalo or if they have departed other buffalo  is it a bargain  i stared at him thinking that the administrators champagne had got into his head  nonsense i exclaimed  who knows where you will be in eighteen months  why by that time you will have forgotten all about me  if i am alive and well on the 1st of october 1878 i shall be exactly where i am now upon this very square in pretoria with a wagon or wagons prepared for a hunting trip  but as not unnaturally you have doubts upon that point i am prepared to pay forfeit if i fail or even if circumstances cause you to fail  here he took a chequebook from his lettercase and spread it out on the little table in the tent on which there were ink and a pen adding  now mr quatermain will it meet your views if i fill this up for 250  no i answered taking everything into consideration the sum is excessive  but if you do not mind facing the risks of my nonappearance to say nothing of your own you may make it 50  you are very moderate in your demands he said as he handed me the cheque which i put in my pocket reflecting that it would just pay for my sons operation  and you are very foolish in your offers i replied  tell me why do you make such crackbrained arrangements  i dont quite know  something in me seems to say that we shall make this expedition and that it will have a very important effect upon my life  mind you it is to be to the lydenburg district and nowhere else  and now i am tired so lets turn in  next morning we parted and went our separate ways    chapter ii     mr marnham      so much for preliminaries now for the story  the eighteen months had gone by bringing with them to me their share of adventure weal and woe with all of which at present i have no concern  behold me arriving very hot and tired in the postcart from kimberley whither i had gone to invest what i had saved out of my matabeleland contract in a very promising speculation whereof today the promise remains and no more  i had been obliged to leave kimberly in a great hurry before i ought indeed because of the silly bargain which i have just recorded  of course i was sure that i should never see mr anscombe again especially as i had heard nothing of him during all this while and had no reason to suppose that he was in africa  still i had taken his 50 and he might come  also i have always prided myself upon keeping an appointment  the postcart halted with a jerk in front of the european hotel and i crawled dusty and tired from its interior to find myself face to face with anscombe who was smoking a pipe upon the stoep  hullo quatermain he said in his pleasant drawling voice here you are up to time  i have been making bets with these five gentlemen and he nodded at a group of loungers on the stoep as to whether you would or would not appear i putting ten to one on you in drinks  therefore you must now consume five whiskies and sodas which will save them from consuming fifty and a subsequent appearance at the police court  i laughed and said i would be their debtor to the extent of one which was duly produced  after it was drunk anscombe and i had a chat  he said that he had been to india shot or shot at whatever game he meant to kill there visited his relations in england and thence proceeded to keep his appointment with me in africa  at durban he had fitted himself out in a regal way with two wagons full teams and some spare oxen and trekked to pretoria where he had arrived a few days before  now he was ready to start for the lydenburg district and look for those buffalo  but i said the buffalo probably long ago departed  also there has been a war with sekukuni the basuto chief who rules all that country which remains undecided although i believe some kind of a peace has been patched up  this may make hunting in this neighborhood dangerous  why not try some other ground to the north of the transvaal for instance  quatermain he answered i have come all the way from england i will not say to kill but to try to kill buffalo in the lydenburg district with you if possible if not without you and thither i am going  if you think it unsafe to accompany me dont come i will get on as best i can alone or with some other skilled person if i can find one  if you put it like that i shall certainly come i replied with the proviso that should the buffalo prove to be nonexistent or the pursuit of them impossible we either give up the trip or go somewhere else perhaps to the country at the back of delagoa bay  agreed he said after which we discussed terms he paying me my salary in advance  on further consideration we determined as two were quite unnecessary for a trip of the sort to leave one of my wagons and half the cattle in charge of a very respectable man a farmer who lived about five miles from pretoria just over the pass near to the famous wonderboom tree which is one of the sights of the place  should we need this wagon it could always be sent for or if we found the lydenburg huntingground which he was so set upon visiting unproductive or impossible we could return to pretoria over the highveld and pick it up before proceeding elsewhere  these arrangements took us a couple of days or so  on the third we started without seeing you my friend or any one else that i knew since just at that time every one seemed to be away from pretoria  you i remember had by now become the master of the high court and were they informed me at your office absent on circuit  the morning of our departure was particularly lovely and we trekked away in the best of spirits as so often happens to people who are marching into trouble  of our journey there is little to say as everything went smoothly so that we arrived at the edge of the highveld feeling as happy as the country which has no history is reported to do  our road led us past the little mining settlement of pilgrims rest where a number of adventurous spirits most of them english were engaged in washing for gold a job at which i once took a turn near this very place without any startling success  of the locality i need only say that the mountainous scenery is among the most beautiful the hills are the steepest and the roads are or were the worst that i have ever travelled over in a wagon  however going softly as the natives say we negotiated them without accident and leaving pilgrims rest behind us began to descend towards the lowveld where i was informed a herd of buffalo could still be found since owing to the war with sekukuni no one had shot at them of late  this war had been suspended for a while and the landdrost at pilgrims rest told me he thought it would be safe to hunt on the borders of that chiefs country though he should not care to do so himself  game of the smaller sort began to be plentiful about here so not more than a dozen miles from pilgrims rest we outspanned early in the afternoon to try to get a blue wildebeeste or two for i had seen the spoor of these creatures in a patch of soft ground or failing them some other buck  accordingly leaving the wagon by a charming stream that wound and gurgled over a bed of granite we mounted our salted horses which were part of anscombes outfit and set forth rejoicing  riding through the scattered thorns and following the spoor where i could within half an hour we came to a little glade  there not fifty yards away i caught sight of a single blue wildebeeste bull standing in the shadow of the trees on the further side of the glade and pointed out the ugly beast for it is the most grotesque of all the antelopes to anscombe  off you get i whispered  its a lovely shot you cant miss it  oh cant i replied anscombe  do you shoot  i refused so he dismounted giving me his horse to hold and kneeling down solemnly and slowly covered the bull  bang went his rifle and i saw a bough about a yard above the wildebeeste fall on to its back  off it went like lightning whereon anscombe let drive with the left barrel of the express almost at hazard as it seemed to me and by some chance hit it above the near foreknee breaking its leg  that was a good shot he cried jumping on to his horse  excellent i answered  but what are you going to do  catch it  it is cruel to leave a wounded animal and off he started  of course i had to follow but the ensuing ride remains among the more painful of my hunting memories  we tore through thorn trees that scratched my face and damaged my clothes we struck a patch of antbear holes into one of which my horse fell so that my stomach bumped against its head we slithered down granite koppies and this was the worst of it at the end of each chapter so to speak always caught sight of that accursed bull which i fondly hoped would have vanished into space  at length after half an hour or so of this game we reached a stretch of open rolling ground and there not fifty yards ahead of us was the animal still going like a hare though how it could do so on three legs i am sure i do not know  we coursed it like greyhounds till at last anscombe whose horse was the faster came alongside of the exhausted creature whereon it turned suddenly and charged  anscombe held out his rifle in his right hand and pulled the trigger which as he had forgotten to reload it was a mere theatrical performance  next second there was such a mixup that for a while i could not distinguish which was anscombe which was the wildebeeste and which the horse  they all seemed to be going round and round in a cloud of dust  when things settled themselves a little i discovered the horse rolling on the ground anscombe on his back with his hands up in an attitude of prayer and the wildebeeste trying to make up its mind which of them it should finish first  i settled the poor things doubts by shooting it through the heart which i flatter myself was rather clever of me under the circumstances  then i dismounted to examine anscombe who i presumed was done for  not a bit of it  there he sat upon the ground blowing like a blacksmiths bellows and panting out  what a glorious gallop  i finished it very well didnt i  you couldnt have made a better shot yourself  yes i answered you finished it very well as you will find out if you will take the trouble to open your rifle and count your cartridges  i may add that if we are going to hunt together i hope you will never lead me such a fools chase again  he rose opened the rifle and saw that it was empty for although he had never reloaded he had thrown out the two cartridges which he had discharged in the glen  by jingo he said you must have shot it though i could have sworn that it was i  quatermain has it ever struck you what a strange thing is the human imagination  drat the human imagination i answered wiping away the blood that was trickling into my eye from a thorn scratch  lets look at your horse  if it is lamed you will have to ride imagination back to the wagon which must be six miles away that is if we can find it before dark  sighing out something about a painfully practical mind he obeyed and when the beast was proved to be nothing more than blown and a little bruised made remarks as to the inadvisability of dwelling on future evil events which i reminded him had already been better summed up in the new testament  after this we contemplated the carcasse of the wildebeeste which it seemed a pity to leave to rot  just then anscombe who had moved a few yards to the right out of the shadow of an obstructing tree exclaimed  i say quatermain come here and tell me if i have been knocked silly or if i really see a quite uncommon kind of house built in ancient greek style set in a divine landscape  temple to diana i expect i remarked as i joined him on the further side of the tree  i looked and rubbed my eyes  there about half a mile away situated in a bay of the sweeping hills and overlooking the measureless expanse of bushveld beneath was a remarkable house at least for those days and that part of africa  to begin with the situation was superb  it stood on a green and swelling mound behind which was a wooded kloof where ran a stream that at last precipitated itself in a waterfall over a great cliff  then in front was that glorious view of the bushveld at which a man might look for a lifetime and not grow tired stretching away to the oliphants river and melting at last into the dim line of the horizon  the house itself also although not large was of a kind new to me  it was deep but narrow fronted and before it were four columns that carried the roof which projected so as to form a wide verandah  moreover it seemed to be built of marble which glistened like snow in the setting sun  in short in that lonely wilderness at any rate from this distance it did look like the deserted shrine of some forgotten god  well im bothered i said  so am i answered anscombe to know the name of the lydenburg district architect whom i should like to employ though i suspect it is the surroundings that make the place look so beautiful hullo here comes somebody but he doesnt look like an architect he looks like a wicked baronet disguised as a boer  true enough round a clump of bush appeared an unusual looking person mounted on a very good horse  he was tall thin and old at least he had a long white beard which suggested age although his figure so far as it could be seen beneath his rough clothes seemed vigorous  his face was clean cut and handsome with a rather hooked nose and his eyes were grey but as i saw when he came up to us somewhat bloodshot at the corners  his general aspect was refined and benevolent and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived that he was a person of gentle breeding  and yet there was something about him something in his atmosphere so to speak that i did not like  before we parted that evening i felt sure that in one way or another he was a wrongdoer not straight also that he had a violent temper  he rode up to us and asked in a pleasant voice although the manner of his question which was put in bad dutch was not pleasant  who gave you leave to shoot on our land  i did not know that any leave was required it is not customary in these parts i answered politely in english  moreover this buck was wounded miles away  oh he exclaimed in the same tongue that makes a difference though i expect it was still on our land for we have a lot it is cheap about here  then after studying a little he added apologetically you mustnt think me strange but the fact is my daughter hates things to be killed near the house which is why theres so much game about  then pray make her our apologies said anscombe and say that it shall not happen again  he stroked his long beard and looked at us for by now he had dismounted then said  might i ask you gentlemen your names  certainly i replied  i am allan quatermain and my friend is the hon maurice anscombe  he started and said  of allan quatermain of course i have heard  the natives told me that you were trekking to those parts and if you sir are one of lord mountfords sons oddly enough i think i must have known your father in my youth  indeed i served with him in the guards  how very strange said anscombe  hes dead now and my brother is lord mountford  do you like life here better than that in the guards  i am sure i should  both of them have their advantages he answered evasively of which if as i think you are also a soldier you can judge for yourself  but wont you come up to the house  my daughter heda is away and my partner mr rodd as he mentioned this name i saw a blue vein which showed above his cheek bone swell as though under pressure of some secret emotion is a retiring sort of a manindeed some might think him sulky until they came to know him  still we can make you comfortable and even give you a decent bottle of wine  no thank you very much i answered we must get back to the wagon or our servants will think that we have come to grief perhaps you will accept the wildebeeste if it is of any use to you  very well he said in a voice that suggested regret struggling with relief  to the buck he made no allusion perhaps because he considered that it was already his own property  do you know your way  i believe your wagon is camped out there to the east by what we call the granite stream  if you follow this kaffir path and he pointed to a track near by it will take you quite close  where does the path run to  i asked  there are no kraals about are there  oh to the temple as my daughter calls our house  my partner and i are labour agents we recruit natives for the kimberley mines he said in explanation adding where do you propose to shoot  i told him  isnt that rather a risky district he said  i think that sekukuni will soon be giving more trouble although there is a truce between him and the english  still he might send a regiment to raid that way  i wondered how our friend knew so much of sekukunis possible intentions but only answered that i was accustomed to deal with natives and did not fear them  ah he said well you know your own business best  but if you should get into any difficulty make straight for this place the basutos will not interfere with you here  again i wondered why the basutos should look upon this particular spot as sacred but thinking it wisest to ask no questions i only answered  thank you very much  well bear your invitation in mind mr  marnham  marnham i repeated after him  goodbye and many thanks for your kindness  one question broke in anscombe if you will not think me rude  what is the name of the architect who designed that most romanticlooking house of yours which seems to be built of marble  my daughter designed it or at least i think she copied it from some old drawing of a ruin  also it is marble theres a whole hill of the stuff not a hundred yards from the door so it was cheaper to use than anything else  i hope you will come and see it on your way back though it is not as fine as it appears from a distance  it would be very pleasant after all these years to talk to an english gentleman again  then we parted i rather offended because he did not seem to include me in the description he calling after us  stick close to the path through the patch of big trees for the ground is rather swampy there and its getting dark  presently we came to the place he mentioned where the timber although scattered was quite large for south africa of the yellowwood species and interspersed wherever the ground was dry with huge euphorbias of which the tall fingerlike growths and sad grey colouring looked unreal and ghostlike in the waning light  following the advice given to us we rode in single file along the narrow path fearing lest otherwise we should tumble into some bog hole until we came to higher land covered with the scattered thorns of the country  did that bush give you any particular impression asked anscombe a minute or two later  yes i answered it gave me the impression that we might catch fever there  see the mist that lies over it and turning in my saddle i pointed with the rifle in my hand to what looked like a mass of cotton wool over which without permeating it hung the last red glow of sunset producing a curious and indeed rather unearthly effect  i expect that thousands of years ago there was a lake yonder which is why trees grow so big in the rich soil  you are curiously mundane quatermain he answered  i ask you of spiritual impressions and you dilate to me of geological formations and the growth of timber  you felt nothing in the spiritual line  i felt nothing except a chill i answered for i was tired and hungry  what the devil are you driving at  have you got that flask of hollands about you quatermain  oh those are the spirits you are referring to i remarked with sarcasm as i handed it to him  he took a good pull and replied  not at all except in the sense that bad spirits require good spirits to correct them as the bible teaches  to come to facts he added in a changed voice i have never been in a place that depressed me more than that thrice accursed patch of bush  why did it depress you i asked studying him as well as i could in the fading light  to tell the truth i feared lest he had knocked his head when the wildebeeste upset him and was suffering from delayed concussion  cant tell you quatermain  i dont look like a criminal do i well i entered those trees feeling a fairly honest man and i came out of them feeling like a murderer  it was as though something terrible had happened to me there it was as though i had killed someone there  ugh and he shivered and took another pull at the hollands  what bosh i said  besides even if it were to come true i am sorry to say ive killed lots of men in the way of business and they dont bother me overmuch  did you ever kill one to win a woman  certainly not  why that would be murder  how can you ask me such a thing  but i have killed several to win cattle i reflected aloud remembering my expedition with saduko against the chief bangu and some other incidents in my career  i appreciate the difference quatermain  if you kill for cows it is justifiable homicide if you kill for women it is murder  yes i replied that is how it seems to work out in africa you see women are higher in the scale of creation than cows therefore crimes committed for their sake are enormously greater than those committed for cows which just makes the difference between justifiable homicide and murder  good lord what an argument he exclaimed and relapsed into silence  had he been accustomed to natives and their ways he would have understood the point much better than he did though i admit it is difficult to explain  in due course we reached the wagon without further trouble while we were shielding our pipes after an excellent supper i asked anscombe his impressions of mr marnham  queer cove i think he answered  been a gentleman too and still keeps the manners which isnt strange if he is one of the marnhams for they are a good family  i wonder he mentioned having served with my father  it slipped out of him  men who live a lot alone are apt to be surprised into saying things they regret afterwards as i noticed he did  but why do you wonder  because as it happens although i have only just recalled it my father used to tell some story about a man named marnham in his regiment  i cant remember the details but it had to do with cards when high stakes were being played for and with the striking of a superior officer in the quarrel that ensued as a result of which the striker was requested to send in his papers  it may not have been the same man  perhaps not for i believe that more than one marnham served in that regiment  but i remember my father saying by way of excuse for the person concerned that he had a most ungovernable temper i think he added that he left the country and took service in some army on the continent  i should rather like to clear the thing up  it isnt probable that you will for even if you should ever meet this marnham again i fancy you would find he held his tongue about his acquaintance with your father  i wonder what miss heda is like went on anscombe after a pause  i am curious to see a girl who designs a house on the model of an ancient ruin  well you wont for shes away somewhere  besides we are looking for buffalo not girls which is a good thing as they are less dangerous  i spoke thus decisively because i had taken a dislike to mr marnham and everything to do with him and did not wish to encourage the idea of further meetings  no never i suppose  and yet i feel as though i were certainly destined to see that accursed yellowwood swamp again  nonsense i replied as i rose to turn in  ah if i had but known    chapter iii     the hunters hunted      while i was taking off my boots i heard a noise of jabbering in some native tongue which i took to be sisutu and not wishing to go to the trouble of putting them on again called to the driver of the wagon to find out what it was  this man was a cape colony kaffir a fingo i think with a touch of hottentot in him  he was an excellent driver indeed i do not think i have ever seen a better and by no means a bad shot  among europeans he rejoiced in the name of footsack a boer dutch term which is generally addressed to troublesome dogs and means get out  to tell the truth had i been his master he would have got out as i suspected him of drinking and generally did not altogether trust him  anscombe however was fond of him because he had shown courage in some hunting adventure in matabeleland i think it was at the shooting of that very darkcoloured lion whose skin had been the means of making us acquainted nearly two years before indeed he said that on this occasion footsack had saved his life though from all that i could gather i do not think this was quite the case  also the man who had been on many hunting trips with sportsmen could talk dutch well and english enough to make himself understood and therefore was useful  he went as i bade him and coming back presently told me that a party of basutos about thirty in number who were returning from kimberley where they had been at work in the mines under the leadership of a bastard named karl asked leave to camp by the wagon for the night as they were afraid to go on to tampel in the dark  at first i could not make out what tampel was as it did not sound like a native name  then i remembered that mr marnham had spoken of his house as being called the temple of which of course tampel was a corruption also that he said he and his partner were labour agents  why are they afraid i asked  because baas they say that they must go through a wood in a swamp which they think is haunted by spooks and they much afraid of spooks that is of ghosts  what spooks i asked  dont know baas  they say spook of some one who has been killed  rubbish i replied  tell them to go and catch the spook we dont want a lot of noisy fellows howling chanties here all night  then it was that anscombe broke in in his humorous rather drawling voice  how can you be so hardhearted quatermain  after the supernatural terror which as i told you i experienced in that very place i wouldnt condemn a kicking mule to go through it in this darkness  let the poor devils stay i daresay they are tired  so i gave in and presently saw their fires beginning to burn through the end canvas of the wagon which was unlaced because the night was hot  also later on i woke up about midnight i think and heard voices talking one of which i reflected sleepily sounded very like that of footsack  waking very early as is my habit i peeped out of the wagon and through the morning mist perceived footsack in converse with a particularly villainouslooking person  i at once concluded this must be karl evidently a bastard compounded of about fifteen parts of various native bloods to one of white who to add to his attractions was deeply scarred with smallpox and possessed a really alarming squint  it seemed to me that footsack handed to this man something that looked suspiciously like a bottle of squareface gin wrapped up in dried grass and that the man handed back to footsack some small object which he put in his mouth  now i wondered to myself what is there of value that one who does not eat sweets would stow away in his mouth  gold coin perhaps or a quid of tobacco or a stone  gold was too much to pay for a bottle of gin tobacco was too little but how about the stone  what stone  who wanted stones  then suddenly i remembered that these people were said to come from kimberley and whistled to myself  still i did nothing principally because the mist was still so dense that although i could see the mens faces i could not clearly see the articles which they passed to each other about two feet lower where it still lay very thickly and to bring any accusation against a native which he can prove to be false is apt to destroy authority  so i held my tongue and waited my chance  it did not come at once for before i was dressed those basutos had departed together with their leader karl for now that the sun was up they no longer feared the haunted bush  it came later thus we were trekking along between the thorns upon a level and easy track which enabled the driver footsack to sit upon the voorkisse or driving box of the wagon leaving the lad who is called the voorlooper to lead the oxen  anscombe was riding parallel to the wagon in the hope of killing some guineafowl for the pot though a very poor shot with a rifle he was good with a shotgun  i who did not care for this small game was seated smoking by the side of footsack who i noted smelt of gin and generally showed signs of dissipation  suddenly i said to him  show me that diamond which the bastard karl gave you this morning in payment for the bottle of your masters drink  it was a bow drawn at a venture but the effect of the shot was remarkable  had i not caught it the long bamboo whip footsack held would have fallen to the ground while he collapsed in his seat like a man who has received a bullet in his stomach  baas he gasped baas how did you know  i knew i replied grandly in the same way that i know everything  show me the diamond  baas he said it was not the baas anscombes gin it was some i bought in pilgrims rest  i have counted the bottles in the case and know very well whose gin it was i replied ambiguously for the reason that i had done nothing of the sort  show me the diamond  footsack fumbled about his person his hair his waistcoat pockets and even his moocha and ultimately from somewhere produced a stone which he handed to me  i looked at it and from the purity of colour and size judged it to be a diamond worth 200 or possibly more  after careful examination i put it into my pocket saying  this is the price of your masters gin and therefore belongs to him as much as it does to anybody  now if you want to keep out of trouble tell mewhence came it into the hands of that man karl  baas replied footsack trembling all over how do i know  he and the rest have been working at the mines i suppose he found it there  indeed  and did he find others of the same sort  i think so baas  at least he said that he had been buying bottles of gin with such stones all the way down from kimberley karl is a great drunkard baas as i am sure who have known him for years  that is not all i remarked keeping my eyes fixed on him what else did he say  he said baas that he was very much afraid of returning to the baas marnham whom the kaffirs call whitebeard with only a few stones left  why was he afraid  because the baas whitebeard he who dwells at tampel is he says a very angry man if he thinks himself cheated and karl is afraid lest he should kill him as another was killed he whose spook haunts the wood through which those silly people feared to pass last night  who was killed and who killed him i asked  baas i dont know replied footsack collapsing into sullen silence in a way that kaffirs have when suddenly they realize that they have said too much  nor did i press the matter further having learned enough  what had i learned  this that messrs marnham  rodd were illicit diamond buyers idbs as they are called who had cunningly situated themselves at a great distance from the scene of operations practically beyond the reach of civilized law probably they were engaged also in other nefarious dealings with kaffirs such as supplying them with guns wherewith to make war upon the whites  sekukuni had been fighting us recently so that there would be a very brisk market for rifles  this too would account for marnhams apparent knowledge of that chiefs plans possibly however he had no knowledge and only made a pretence of it to keep us out of the country  later on i confided the whole story and my suspicions to anscombe who was much interested  what picturesque scoundrels he exclaimed we really ought to go back to the temple  i have always longed to meet some real live idbs  it is probable that you have done that already without knowing it  for the rest if you wish to visit that den of iniquity you must do so alone  wouldnt whited sepulchre be a better term especially as it seems to cover dead mens bones he replied in his frivolous manner  then i asked him what he was going to do about footsack and the bottle of gin which he countered by asking me what i was going to do with that diamond  give it to you as footsacks master i said suiting the action to the word  i dont wish to be mixed up in doubtful transactions  then followed a long argument as to who was the real owner of the stone which ended in its being hidden away be produced if called for and in footsack who ought have had a round dozen receiving a scolding from his master coupled with the threat that if he stole more gin he would be handed over to a magistratewhen we met one  on the following day we reached the hot lowlying veld which the herd of buffalo was said to inhabit  next morning however when we were making ready to begin hunting a basuto kaffir appeared who on being questioned said that he was one of sekukunis people sent to this district to look for two lost oxen  i did not believe this story thinking it more probable that he was a spy but asked him whether in his hunt for oxen he had come across buffalo  he replied that he had a herd of thirtytwo of them counting the calves but that they were over the oliphants river about fiveandtwenty miles away in a valley between some outlying hills and the rugged range of mountains beyond which was situated sekukunis town  moreover in proof of his story he showed me spoor of the beasts heading in that direction which was quite a week old  now for my part as i did not think it wise to get too near to sekukuni i should have given them up and gone to hunt something else  anscombe however was of a different opinion and pleaded hard that we should follow them  they were the only herd within a hundred miles he said if indeed there were any others this side of the lebombo mountains  as i still demurred he suggested in the nicest possible manner that if i thought the business risky i should camp somewhere with the wagon while he went on with footsack to look for the buffalo  i answered that i was well used to risks which in a sense were my trade and that as he was more or less in my charge i was thinking of him not of myself who was quite prepared to follow the buffalo not only to sekukunis mountains but over them  then fearing that he had hurt my feelings he apologized and offered to go elsewhere if i liked  the upshot was that we decided to trek to the oliphants river camp there and explore the bush on the other side on horseback never going so far from the wagon that we could not reach it again before nightfall  this then we did outspanning that evening by the hot but beautiful river which was still haunted by a few hippopotamus and many crocodiles one of which we shot before turning in  next morning having breakfasted off cold guineafowl we mounted crossed the river by a ford that was quite as deep as i liked to which the kaffir path led us and leaving footsack with the two other boys in charge of the wagon began to hunt for the buffalo in the rather swampy bush that stretched from the further bank to the slope of the first hills eight or ten miles away  i did not much expect to find them as the basuto had said that they had gone over these hills but either he lied or they had moved back again  not half a mile from the river bank just as i was about to dismount to stalk a fine waterbuck of which i caught sight standing among some coarse grass and bushes my eye fell upon buffalo spoor that from its appearance i knew could not be more than a few hours old  evidently the beasts had been feeding here during the night and at dawn had moved away to sleep in the dry bush nearer the hills  beckoning to anscombe who fortunately had not seen the waterbuck at which he would certainly have fired thereby perhaps frightening the buffalo i showed him the spoor that we at once started to follow  soon it led us into other spoor that of a whole herd of thirty or forty beasts indeed which made our task quite easy at least till we came to harder ground for the animals had gone a long way  an hour or more later when we were about seven miles from the river i perceived ahead of us for we were now almost at the foot of the hills a cool and denselywooded kloof  that is where they will be i said  now come on carefully and make no noise  we rode to the wide mouth of the kloof where the signs of the buffalo were numerous and fresh dismounted and tied our horses to a thorn so as to approach them silently on foot  we had not gone two hundred yards through the bush when suddenly about fifty paces away standing broadside on in the shadow between two trees i saw a splendid old bull with a tremendous pair of horns  shoot i whispered to anscombe you will never get a better chance  it is the sentinel of the herd  he knelt down his face quite white with excitement and covered the bull with his express  keep cool i whispered again and aim behind the shoulder halfway down  i dont think he understood me for at that moment off went the rifle  he hit the beast somewhere as i heard the bullet clap but not fatally for it turned and lumbered off up the kloof apparently unhurt whereon he sent the second barrel after it a clean miss this time  then of a sudden all about us appeared buffaloes that had i suppose been sleeping invisible to us these with snorts and bellows rushed off towards the river for having their senses about them they had no mind to be trapped in the kloof  i could only manage a shot at one of them a large and longhorned cow which i knocked over quite dead  if i had fired again it would have been but to wound a thing i hate  the whole business was over in a minute  we went and looked at my dead cow which i had caught through the heart  its cruel to kill these things i said for i dont know what use we are going to make of them and they must love life as much as we do  well cut the horns off said anscombe  you may if you like i answered but you will find it a tough job with a sheath knife  yes i think that shall be the task of the worthy footsack tomorrow he replied  meanwhile let us go and finish off my bull as footsack  co may as well bring home two pair of horns as one  i looked at the dense bush and knowing something of the habits of wounded buffaloes reflected that it would be a nasty job still i said nothing because if i hesitated i knew he would want to go alone  so we started  evidently the beast had been badly hit for the blood spoor was easy to follow  yet it had been able to retreat up to the end of the kloof that terminated in a cliff over which trickled a stream of water  here it was not more than a hundred paces wide and on either side of it were other precipitous cliffs  as we went from one of these a warhorn such as the basutos use was blown  although i heard it oddly enough i paid no attention to it at the time being utterly intent upon the business in hand  following a wounded buffalo bull up a treeclad and stony kloof is no game for children as these beasts have a habit of returning on their tracks and then rushing out to gore you  so i went on with every sense alert keeping anscombe well behind me as it happened our bull had either been knocked silly or inherited no guile from his parents  when he found he could go no further he stopped waited behind a bush and when he saw us he charged in a simple and primitive fashion  i let anscombe fire as i wished him to have the credit of killing it all to himself but somehow or other he managed to miss both barrels then trouble being imminent i let drive as the beast lowered its head and was lucky enough to break its spine to shoot at the head of a buffalo is useless so that it rolled over quite dead at our feet  you have got a magnificent pair of horns i said contemplating the fallen giant  yes answered anscombe with a twinkle of his humorous eyes and if it hadnt been for you i think that i should have got them in more senses than one  as the words passed his lips some missile from its peculiar sound i judged it was the leg off an iron pot hurtled past my head fired evidently from a smoothbore gun with a large charge of bad powder  then i remembered the warhorn and all that it meant  off you go i said we are ambushed by kaffirs  we were indeed for as we tailed down that kloof from the top of both cliffs above us came a continuous but luckily illdirected fire  leadcoated stones pot legs and bullets whirred and whistled all round us yet until the last just when we were reaching the tree to which we had tied our horses quite harmlessly  then suddenly i saw anscombe begin to limp  still he managed to run on and mount though i observed that he did not put his right foot into the stirrup  whats the matter i asked as we galloped off  shot through the instep i think he answered with a laugh but it doesnt hurt a bit  i expect it will later i replied  meanwhile thank god it wasnt at the top of the kloof  they wont catch us on the horses which they never thought of killing first  they are going to try though  look behind you  i looked and saw twenty or thirty men emerging from the mouth of the kloof in pursuit  no time to stop to get those horns he said with a sigh  no i answered unless you are particularly anxious to say goodbye to the world pinned over a broken antheap in the sun or something pleasant of the sort  then we rode on in silence i thinking what a fool i had been first to allow myself to be overruled by anscombe and cross the river and secondly not to have taken warning from that warhorn we could not go very fast because of the difficult and swampy nature of the ground also the great heat of the day told on the horses  thus it came about that when we reached the ford we were not more than ten minutes ahead of our active pursuers good runners every one of them and accustomed to the country  i suppose that they had orders to kill or capture us at any cost for instead of giving up the chase as i hoped they would they stuck to us in surprising fashion  we splashed through the river and luckily on the further bank were met by footsack who had seen us coming and guessed that something was wrong  inspan i shouted to him and be quick about it if you want to see tomorrows light  the basutos are after us  off he went like a shot his face quite green with fear  now i said to anscombe as we let our horses take a drink for which they were mad we have got to hold this ford until the wagon is ready or those devils will get us after all  dismount and ill tie up the horses  he did so with some difficulty and at my suggestion while i made the beasts fast cut the lace of his boot which was full of blood and soaked his wounded foot that i had no time to examine in the cool water  these things done i helped him to the rear of a thorn tree which was thick enough to shield most of his body and took my own stand behind a similar thorn at a distance of a few paces  presently the basutos appeared trotting along close together whereon anscombe who was seated behind the tree fired both barrels of his express at them at a range of about two hundred yards  it was a foolish thing to do first because he missed them clean for he had overestimated the range and the bullets went above their heads and secondly because it caused them to scatter and made them careful whereas had they come on in a lump we could have taught them a lesson  however i said nothing as i knew that reproaches would only make him nervous  down went those scoundrels on to their hands and knees and taking cover behind stones and bushes on the further bank began to fire at us for they were all armed with guns of one sort and another and there was only about a hundred yards of water between us  as they effected this manoeuvre i am glad to say i was able to get two of them while anscombe i think wounded another  after this our position grew quite warm for as i have said the thorn trunks were not very broad and three or four of the natives who had probably been hunters were by no means bad shots though the rest of them fired wildly  anscombe in poking his head round the tree to shoot had his hat knocked off by a bullet while a slug went through the lappet of my coat  then a worse thing happened  either by chance or design anscombes horse was struck in the neck and fell struggling whereon my beast growing frightened broke its riem and galloped to the wagon  that is where i ought to have left them at first only i thought that we might need them to make a bolt on or to carry anscombe if he could not walk  quite a long while went by before glancing behind me i saw that the oxen that had been grazing at a little distance had at length arrived and were being inspanned in furious haste  the basutos saw it also and fearing lest we should escape determined to try to end the business  suddenly they leapt from their cover and with more courage than i should have expected of them rushed into the river proposing to storm us which to speak truth i think they would have done had i not been a fairly quick shot  as it was finding that they were losing too heavily from our fire they retreated in a hurry leaving their dead behind them and even a wounded man who was clinging to a rock  he poor wretch was in mortal terror lest we should shoot him again which i had not the heart to do although as his leg was shattered above the knee by an express bullet it might have been true kindness  again and again he called out for mercy saying that he only attacked us because his chief who had been warned of our coming by the white man ordered him to take our guns and cattle  what white man i shouted  speak or i shoot  there was no answer for at this moment he fainted from loss of blood and vanished beneath the water  then another basuto i suppose he was their captain but do not know for he was hidden in some bushes called out  do not think that you shall escape white men  there are many more of our people coming and we will kill you in the night when you cannot see to shoot us  at this moment too footsack shouted that the wagon was inspanned and ready  now i hesitated what to do  if we made for the wagon which must be very slowly because of anscombes wounded foot we had to cross seventy or eighty yards of rising ground almost devoid of cover  if on the other hand we stayed where we were till nightfall a shot might catch one of us or other basutos might arrive and rush us  there was also a third possibility that our terrified servants might trek off and leave us in order to save their own lives which verily i believe they would have done not being of zulu blood  i put the problem to anscombe who shook his head and looked at his foot  then he produced a lucky penny which he carried in his pocket and said  let us invoke the fates  heads we run like heroes tails we stay here like heroes and he spun the penny while i stared at him openmouthed and not without admiration  never i thought to myself had this primitive method of cutting a gordian knot been resorted to in such strange and urgent circumstances  heads it is he said coolly  now my boy do you run and ill crawl after you  if i dont arrive you know my peoples address and i bequeath to you all my african belongings in memory of a most pleasant trip  dont play the fool i replied sternly  come put your right arm round my neck and hop on your left leg as you never hopped before  then we started and really our transit was quite lively for all those basutos began what for them was rapid firing  i think however that their best shots must have fallen for not a bullet touched us although before we got out of their range one or two went very near  there said anscombe as a last amazing hop brought him to the wagon rail there you see how wise it is give providence a chance sometimes  in the shape of a lucky penny i grumbled as i hoisted him up  certainly for why should not providence inhabit a penny as much as it does any other mundane thing  oh my dear quatermain have you never been taught to look to the pence and let the rest take care of itself  stop talking rubbish and look to your foot for the wagon is starting i replied  then off we went at a good round trot for never have i seen oxen more scientifically driven than they were by footsack and his friends on this occasion or a greater pace got out of them  as soon as we reached a fairly level piece of ground i made anscombe lie down on the cartel of the wagon and examined his wound as well as circumstances would allow  i found that the bullet or whatever the missile may have been had gone through his right instep just beneath the big sinew but so far as i could judge without injuring any bone  there was nothing to be done except rub in some carbolic ointment which fortunately he had in his medicine chest and bind up the wound as best i could with a clean handkerchief after which i tied a towel that was not clean over the whole foot  by this time evening was coming on so we ate of such as we had with us which we needed badly enough without stopping the wagon  i remember that it consisted of cheese and hard biscuits at dark we were obliged to halt a little by a stream until the moon rose which fortunately she did very soon as she was only just past her full  as soon as she was up we started again and with a breathing space or two trekked all that night which i spent seated on the after part of the wagon and keeping a sharp look out while notwithstanding the roughness of the road and his hurt anscombe slept like a child upon the cartel inside  i was very tired so tired that the fear of surprise was the only thing that kept me awake and i recall reflecting in a stupid kind of way that it seemed always to have been my lot in life to watch thus in one sense or another while others slept  the night passed somehow without anything happening and at dawn we halted for a while to water the oxen which we did with buckets and let them eat what grass they could reach from their yokes since we did not dare to outspan them  just as we were starting on again the voortrekker whom i had set to watch at a little distance ran up with his eyes bulging out of his head and reported that he had seen a basuto with an assegai hanging about in the bush as though to keep touch with us after which we delayed no more  all that day we blundered on thrashing the weary cattle that at every halt tried to lie down and by nightfall came to the outspan near to the house called the temple where we had met the kaffirs returning from the diamond fields  this journey we had accomplished in exactly half the time it had taken on the outward trip  here we were obliged to stop as our team must have rest and food  so we outspanned and slept that night without much fear since i thought it most improbable that the basutos would attempt to follow us so far as we were now within a days trek of pilgrims rest whither we proposed to proceed on the morrow but that is just where i made a mistake    chapter iv     doctor rodd      i did get a little sleep that night with one eye open but before dawn i was up again seeing to the feeding of our remaining horse with some mealies that we carried and other matters  the oxen we had been obliged to unyoke that they might fill themselves with grass and water since otherwise i feared that we should never get them on to their feet again  as it was the poor brutes were so tired that some of them could scarcely eat and all lay down at the first opportunity  having awakened footsack and the other boys that they might be ready to take advantage of the light when it came for i was anxious to be away i drank a nip of hollands and water and ate a biscuit making anscombe do the same  coffee would have been more acceptable but i thought it wiser not to light a fire for fear of showing our whereabouts  now a faint glimmer in the east told me that the dawn was coming just by the wagon grew a fairsized greenleaved tree and as it was quite easy to climb even by starlight up it i went so as to get above the ground mist and take a look round before we trekked  presently the sky grew pearly and light began to gather then the edge of the sun appeared throwing long level rays across the world  everywhere the mist lay dense as cotton wool except at one spot about a mile behind us where there was a little hill or rather a wave of the ground over which we had trekked upon the preceding evening  the top of this rise was above mist level and on it no trees grew because the granite came to the surface  having discovered nothing i called to the boys to drive up the oxen some of which had risen and were eating again and prepared to descend from my tree  as i did so out of the corner of my eye i caught sight of something that glittered far away so far that it would only have attracted the notice of a trained hunter  yes something was shining on the brow of the rise of which i have spoken  i stared at it through my glasses and saw what i had feared to see  a body of natives was crossing the rise and the glitter was caused by the rays of dawn striking on their spears and gunbarrels  i came down out of that tree like a frightened wild cat and ran to the wagon thinking hard as i went  the basutos were after us meaning to attack as soon as there was sufficient light  in ten minutes or less they would be here  there was no time to inspan the oxen and even if there had been stiff and weary as the beasts were we should be overtaken before we had gone a hundred yards on that bad road  what then was to be done run for it it was impossible anscombe could not run  my eye fell upon the horse munching the last of his mealies  footsack i said as quietly as i could never mind about inspanning yet but saddle up the horse  be quick now  he looked at me doubtfully but obeyed having seen nothing  if he had seen i knew that he would have been off  i nipped round to the end of the wagon calling to the other two boys to let the oxen be a while and come to me  now anscombe i said hand out the rifles and cartridges dont stop to ask questions but do what i tell you  they are on the rack by your side  so  now put on your revolver and let me help you down  man dont forget your hat  he obeyed quickly enough and presently was standing on one leg by my side looking cramped and tottery  the basutos are on us i said  he whistled and remarked something about chapter no 2  footsack i called bring the horse here the baas wishes to ride a little to ease his leg  he did so stopping a moment to pull the second girth tight then we helped anscombe into the saddle  which way he asked  i looked at the long slope in front of us  it was steep and bad going  anscombe might get up it on the horse before the kaffirs overtook us but it was extremely problematical if we could do so  i might perhaps if i mounted behind him and the horse could bear us both which was doubtful but how about our poor servants he saw the doubt upon my face and said in his quiet way  you may remember that our whitebearded friend told us to make straight for his place in case of any difficulty with the basutos  it seems to have arisen  i know he did i answered but i cannot make up my mind which is the more dangerous marnham or the basutos  i rather think that he set them on to us  it is impossible to solve problems at this hour of the morning quatermain and there is no time to toss  so i vote for the temple  it seems our best chance  at any rate thats your choice so lets go  then i sang out to the kaffirs the basutos are on us  we go to tampel for refuge  run  my word they did run  i never saw athletes make better time over the first quarter of a mile  we ran too or at least the horse did i hanging on to the stirrup and anscombe holding both the rifles beneath his arm  but the beast was tired also blown out with that morning feed of mealies so our progress was not very fast  when we were about two hundred yards from the wagon i looked back and saw the basutos beginning to arrive  they saw us also and uttering a sort of whistling war cry started in pursuit  after this we had quite an interesting time  i scrambled on to the horse behind anscombe whereon that intelligent animal feeling the double weight reduced its pace proportionately to a slow tripple indeed out of which it could not be persuaded to move  so i slipped off again over its tail and we went on as before  meanwhile the basutos very active fellows were coming up  by this time the yellowwood grove in the swamp of which i have already written was close to us and it became quite a question which of us would get there first i may mention that footsack  co  had already attained its friendly shelter anscombe kicked the horse with his sound heel and i thumped it with my fist thereby persuading it to a hand gallop  as we reached the outlying trees of the wood the first basuto a lank fellow with a mouth like a rat trap arrived and threw an assegai at us which passed between anscombes back and my nose then he closed and tried to stab with another assegai  i could do nothing but anscombe showed himself cleverer than i expected dropping the reins he drew his pistol and managed to send a bullet through that child of natures head so that he went down like a stone  and you tell me i am a bad shot he drawled  it was a fluke i gasped for even in these circumstances truth would prevail  wait and youll see he replied recocking the revolver  as a matter of fact there was no need for more shooting since at the verge of the swamp the basutos pulled up  i do not think that the death of their companion caused them to do this for they seemed to take no notice of him  it was as though they had reached some boundary which they knew it would not be lawful for them to pass  they simply stopped took the dead mans assegai and shield from the body and walked quietly back towards the wagon leaving him where he lay  the horse stopped also or rather proceeded at a walk  there exclaimed anscombe  did i not tell you i had a presentiment that i should kill a man in this accursed wood  yes i said as soon as i had recovered my breath but you mixed up a woman with the matter and i dont see one  thats true he replied i hope we shant meet her later  then we went on as quickly as we could which was not very fast for i feared lest the basutos should change their minds and follow us  as the risk of this became less our spirits rose since if we had lost the wagon and the oxen at least we had saved our lives which was almost more than we could have expected in the circumstances  at last we came to that glade where we had killed the wildebeeste not a week before  there lay its skeleton picked clean by the great brown kites that frequent the bushveld some of which still sat about in the trees  well i suppose we must go on to tampel said anscombe rather faintly for i could see that his wound was giving him a good deal of pain  as he spoke from round the tree whence he had first emerged appeared mr marnham riding the same horse and wearing the same clothes  the only difference between his two entries was that the first took place in the late evening and the second in the early morning  so here you are again he said cheerfully  yes i answered and it is strange to meet you at the same spot  were you expecting us  not more than i expect many things he replied with a shrewd glance at me adding i always rise with the sun and thinking that i heard a shot fired in the distance came to see what was happening  the basutos attacked you at daybreak did they not  they did but how did you know that mr marnham  your servants told me  i met them running to the house looking very frightened  you are wounded mr anscombe  yes a couple of days ago on the border of sekukunis country where the natives tried to murder us  ah he replied without surprise  i warned you the trip was dangerous did i not  well come on home where my partner rodd who luckily has had medical experience will attend to you  mr quatermain can tell me the story as we go  so we went on up the long slope i relating our adventures to which mr marnham listened without comment  i expect that the kaffirs will have looted the wagon and be on the way home with your oxen by now he said when i had finished  are you not afraid that they will follow us here i asked  oh no mr quatermain  we do business with these people also they sometimes come to be doctored by rodd when they are sick so this place is sacred ground to them  they stopped hunting you when they got to the yellowwood swamp where our land begins did they not  yes but now i want to hunt them  can you give me any help those oxen are tired out and footsore so we might be able to catch them up  he shook his head  we have very few people here and by the time that you could get assistance from the camp at barberton if the commandant is able and willing to give you any which i rather doubt they will be far away  moreover he added dropping his voice let us come to an understanding  you are most welcome to any help or hospitality that i can offer but if you wish to do more fighting i must ask you to go elsewhere  as i have told you we are peaceful men who trade with these people and do not wish to be involved in a quarrel with them which might expose us to attack or bring us into trouble with the british government which has annexed but not conquered their country  do i make myself clear  perfectly  while we are with you we will do nothing but afterwards we hold ourselves at liberty to act as we think best  quite so  meanwhile i hope that you and mr anscombe will make yourselves comfortable with us for as long as you like  in my own mind i came to the conclusion that this would be for the shortest time possible but i only said  it is most kind of you to take in complete strangers thus  no not complete i added looking towards anscombe who was following on the tired horse a few paces behind for you knew his father did you not  his father he said lifting his eyebrows  no  oh i remember i said something to that effect the other night but it was a mistake  i mixed up two names as one often does after a lapse of many years  i understand i answered but remembering anscombes story i reflected to myself that our venerable host was an excellent liar  or more probably he meant to convey that he wished the subject of his youthful reminiscences to be taboo  just then we reached the house which had a pretty patch of wellkept flowergarden in front of it surrounded by a fence covered with wire netting to keep out buck  by the gate squatted our three retainers looking very blown and rather ashamed of themselves  your master wishes to thank you for your help in a dark hour footsack and i wish to congratulate you all upon the swiftness of your feet i said in dutch  oh baas the basutos were many and their spears are sharp he began apologetically  be silent you running dog i said and go help your master to dismount  then we went through the gate anscombe leaning on my shoulder and on that of mr marnham and up the path which was bordered with fences of the monthly rose towards the house  really this was almost as charming to look at near at hand as it had been from far away  of course the whole thing was crude in detail rough halfshaped blocks of marble from the neighbouring quarry had been built into walls and columns  nothing was finished and considered bit by bit all was coarse and ugly  yet the general effect was beautiful because it was an effect of design the picture of an artist who did not fully understand the technicalities of painting the work of a great writer who had as yet no proper skill in words  never did i see a small building that struck me more  but then what experience have i of buildings and as anscombe reminded me afterwards it was but a copy of something designed when the world was young or rather when civilization was young and man new risen from the infinite ages of savagery saw beauty in his dreams and tried to symbolize it in shapes of stone  we came to the broad stoep to which several rough blocks of marble served as steps  on it in a long chair made of native wood and seated with hide rimpis sat or rather lolled a man in a dressinggown who was reading a book  he raised himself as we came and the light of the sun for the verandah faced to the east shone full upon his face so that i saw him well  it was that of a man of something under forty years of age dark powerful and wearynot a good face i thought  indeed it gave me the impression of one who had allowed the evil which exists in the nature of all of us to become his master or had even encouraged it to do so  in the psalms and elsewhere we are always reading of the righteous and the unrighteous until those terms grow wearisome it is only of late years that i have discovered or think that i have discovered what they mean  our lives cannot be judged by our deeds they must be judged by our desires or rather by our moral attitude  it is not what we do so much as what we try to do that counts in the formation of character  all fall short all fail but in the end those who seek to climb out of the pit those who strive however vainly to fashion failure to success are by comparison the righteous while those who are content to wallow in our native mire and to glut themselves with the daily bread of vice are the unrighteous  to turn our backs thereon wilfully and without cause is the real unforgiveable sin against the spirit  at least that is the best definition of the problem at which i in my simplicity can arrive  such thoughts have often occurred to me in considering the character of dr rodd and some others whom i have known indeed the germ of them arose in my mind which being wearied at the time and therefore somewhat vacant was perhaps the more open to external impressions as i looked upon the face of this stranger on the stoep  moreover as i am proud to record i did not judge him altogether wrongly  he was a blackguard who under other influences or with a few added grains of selfrestraint and of the power of recovery might have become a good or even a saintly man  but by some malice of fate or some evil inheritance from an unknown past those grains were lacking and therefore he went not up but down the hill  case for you rodd called out marnham  indeed he answered getting to his feet and speaking in a full voice which like his partners was that of an educated englishman  whats the matter  horse accident  then we were introduced and anscombe began to explain his injury  um said the doctor studying him with dark eyes  kaffir bullet through the foot some days ago  ought to be attended to at once  also you look pretty done so dont tire yourself with the story which i can get from mr quatermain  come and lie down and ill have a look at you while they are cooking breakfast  then he guided us to a room of which the double french windows opened on to the stoep a very pretty room with two beds in it making anscombe lie down on one of these he turned up his trouser undid my rough bandage and examined the wound  painful he asked  very answered anscombe right up to the thigh  after this he drew off the nether garments and made a further examination  um he said again i must syringe this out  stay still while i get some stuff  i followed him from the room and when we were out of hearing on the stoep inquired what he thought  i did not like the look of that leg  it is very bad he answered so bad that i am wondering if it wouldnt be best to remove the limb below the knee and make it a job  you can see for yourself that it is septic and the inflammation is spreading up rapidly  good heavens i exclaimed do you fear mortification  he nodded  cant say what was on that slug or bit of old iron and he hasnt had the best chance since  mortification or tetanus or both are more than possible  is he a temperate man  so far as i know i answered and stared at him while he thought  then he said with decision  that makes a difference  to lose a foot is a serious thing some might think almost as bad as death  ill give him a chance but if those symptoms do not abate in twentyfour hours i must operate  you neednt be afraid i was house surgeon at a london hospitalonce and i keep my hand in  lucky you came straight here  having made his preparations and washed his hands he returned syringed the wound with some antiseptic stuff and dressed and bandaged the leg up to the knee  after this he gave anscombe hot milk to drink with two eggs broken into it and told him to rest a while as he must not eat anything solid at present  then he threw a blanket over him and signing to me to come away let down a mat over the window  i put a little something into that milk he said outside which will send him to sleep for a few hours  so we will leave him quiet  now youll want a wash  where are you going to take mr quatermain asked marnham who was seated on the stoep  into my room he answered  why theres hedas ready  heda might return at any moment replied the doctor  also mr quatermain had better sleep in mr anscombes room  he will very likely want some one to look after him at night  marnham opened his mouth to speak again then changed his mind and was silent as a servant is silent under rebuke  the incident was quite trifling yet it revealed to me the relative attitude of these two men  without a doubt rodd was the master of his partner who did not even care to dispute with him about the matter of the use of his daughters bedroom  they were a queer couple who had it not been for my anxiety as to anscombes illness would have interested me very much as indeed they were destined to do  well i went to tidy up in the doctors room and as he left me alone while i washed had the opportunity of studying it a little  like the rest of the house it was lined with native wood which was made to serve as the backs of bookshelves and of cupboards filled with medicines and instruments  the books formed a queer collection  there were medical works philosophical works histories novels most of them french and other volumes of a sort that i imagine are generally kept under lock and key also some that had to do with occult matters there was even a bible  i opened it thoughtlessly half in idle curiosity to see whether it was ever used only to replace it in haste  for at the very page that my eye fell on i remember it was one of my favourite chapters in isaiah was a stamp in violet ink marked h ms prisonwell i wont say where  i may state however that the clue enabled me in after years to learn an episode in this mans life which had brought about his ruin  there is no need to repeat it or to say more than that gambling and an evil use of his medical knowledge to provide the money to pay his debts were the cause of his fall  the strange thing is that he should have kept the book which had probably been given to him by the prison chaplain  still everybody makes mistakes sometimes  or it may have had associations for him and of course he had never seen this stamp upon an unread page which happened to leap to my eye  now i was able to make a shrewd guess at his later career  after his trouble he had emigrated and began to practise in south africa  somehow his identity had been discovered his past was dragged up against him possibly by rivals jealous of his skill his business went and he found it advisable to retire to the transvaal before the annexation at that time the home of sundry people of broken repute  even there he did not stop in a town but hid himself upon the edge of savagery  here he foregathered with another man of queer character marnham and in his company entered upon some doubtful but lucrative form of trade while still indulging his love of medicine by doctoring and operating upon natives over whom he would in this way acquire great influence  indeed as i discovered before the day was over he had quite a little hospital at the back of the house in which were four or five beds occupied by kaffirs and served by two male native nurses whom he had trained  also numbers of outpatients visited him some of whom travelled from great distances and occasionally but not often he attended white people who chanced to be in the neighbourhood  the three of us breakfasted in a really charming room from the window of which could be studied a view as beautiful as any i know  the kaffirs who waited were well trained and dressed in neat linen uniforms  the cooking was good there was real silver on the table then a strange sight in that part of africa and amongst engravings and other pictures upon the walls hung an oil portrait of a very beautiful young woman with dark hair and eyes  is that your daughter mr marnham i asked  no he replied rather shortly it is her mother  immediately afterwards he was called from the room to speak to some one whereon the doctor said  a foreigner as you see a hungarian the hungarian women are very good looking and very charming  so i have understood i answered but does this lady live here  oh no  she is dead or i believe that she is dead  i am not sure because i make it a rule never to pry into peoples private affairs  all i know about her is that she was a beauty whom marnham married late in life upon the continent when she was but eighteen  as is common in such cases he was very jealous of her but it didnt last long as she died or i understand that she died within a year of her daughters birth  the loss affected him so much that he emigrated to south africa with the child and began life anew  i do not think that they correspond with hungary and he never speaks of her even to his daughter which suggests that she is dead  i reflected that all these circumstances might equally well suggest several other things but said nothing thinking it wisest not to pursue the subject  presently marnham returned and informed me that a native had just brought him word that the basutos had made off homeward with our cattle but had left the wagon and its contents quite untouched not even stealing the spare guns and ammunition  thats luck i said astonished but extremely strange  how do you explain it mr marnham  he shrugged his shoulders and answered  as every one knows you are a much greater expert in native habits and customs than i am mr quatermain  there are only two things that i can think of i said  one is that for some reason or other they thought the wagon tagati bewitched you know and that it would bring evil on them to touch it though this did not apply to the oxen  the other is that they supposed it but not the oxen to belong to some friend of their own whose property they did not wish to injure  he looked at me sharply but said nothing and i went on to tell them the details of the attack that had been made upon us adding  the odd part of the affair is that one of those basutos called out to us that some infernal scoundrel of a white had warned sekukuni of our coming and that he had ordered them to take our guns and cattle  this basuto who was wounded and praying for mercy was drowned before he could tell me who the white man was  a boer i expect said marnham quietly  as you know they are not particularly well affected towards us english just now  also i happen to be aware that some of them are intriguing with sekukuni against the british through makurupiji his mouth or primeminister a very clever old scamp who likes to have two stools to sit on  and doubtless will end by falling between them  well you see now that i think of it the wounded kaffir only said that they were ordered to take our guns and oxen and incidentally our lives  the wagon was not mentioned  quite so mr quatermain  i will send some of our boys to help your servants to bring everything it contains up here  cant you lend me a team of oxen i asked to drag it to the house  no we have nothing but young cattle left  both redwater and lungsickness have been so bad this season that all the horned stock have been swept out of the country  i doubt whether you could beg borrow or steal a team of oxen this side of pretoria except from some of the dutchmen who wont part  thats awkward  i hoped to be able to trek in a day or two  your friend wont be able to trek for a good many days at the best broke in the doctor who had been listening unconcernedly but of course you could get away on the horse after it has rested  you told me you left a span of oxen at pretoria said marnham why not go and fetch them here or if you dont like to leave mr anscombe send your driver and the boys  thanks for the idea  i will think it over i answered  that morning after footsack and the voorlooper had been sent with some of the servants from the temple to fetch up the contents of the wagon for i was too tired to accompany them having found that anscombe was still asleep i determined to follow his example  finding a long chair on the stoep i sat down and slumbered in it sweetly for hours  i dreamt of all sorts of things then through my dreams it seemed to me that i heard two voices talking those of our marnham and rodd not on the stoep but at a distance from it  as a matter of fact they were talking but so far away that in my ordinary waking state i could never have heard them  my own belief is that the senses and i may add the semispiritual part of us are much more acute when we lie half bound in the bonds of sleep than when we are what is called wide awake  doubtless when we are quite bound they attain the limits of their power and i think sail at times to the uttermost ends of being  but unhappily of their experiences we remember nothing when we awake  in half sleep it is different then we do retain some recollection  in this curious condition of mind it seemed to me that rodd said to marnham  why have you brought these men here  i did not bring them here he answered  luck fate fortune god or the devil call it what you will brought them here though if you had your wish it is true they would never have come  still as they have come i am glad  it is something to me living in this hell to get a chance of talking to english gentlemen again before i die  english gentlemen remarked rodd reflectively well anscombe is of course but how about that other hunter  after all in what way is he better than the scores of other hunters and kaffir traders and wanderers whom one meets in this strange land  in what way indeed thought i to myself in my dream  if you cant see i cant explain to you  but as i happen to know the man is of blood as good as mineand a great deal better than yours he added with a touch of insolence moreover he has an honest name among white and black which is much in this country  yes replied the doctor in the same reflective voice i agree with you i let him pass as a gentleman  but i repeat why did you bring them here when with one more word it would have been so easy and he stopped  i have told you it was not i  what are you driving at  do you think it is exactly convenient especially when we are under the british flag again to have two people who we both admit are english gentlemen that is clean cleareyed men considering us and our affairs for an indefinite period just because you wish for the pleasure of their society  would it not have been better to tell those basutos to let them trek on to pretoria  i dont know what would have been better  i repeat what are you driving at  heda is coming home in a day or two she might be here any time remarked rodd as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe  yes because you made me write and say that i wanted her  but what of that  nothing in particular except that i am not sure that i wish her to associate with an english gentleman like this anscombe  marnham laughed scornfully  ah i understand he said  too clean and straight  complications might ensue and the rest of it  well i wish to god they would for i know the anscombes or used to and i know the genus called rodd  dont be insulting you may carry the thing too far one day and whatever i have done i have paid for  but youve not paidyet  the man is very ill  you are a skilled doctor  if youre afraid of him why dont you kill him asked marnham with bitter scorn  there you have me replied rodd  men may shed much but most of them never shed their professional honour  i shall do my honest best to cure mr anscombe and i tell you that he will take some curing   then i woke up and as no one was in sight wondered whether or no i had been dreaming  the upshot of it was that i made up my mind to send footsack to pretoria for the oxen not to go myself    chapter v     a game of cards      i slept in anscombes room that night and looked after him  he was very feverish and the pain in his leg kept him awake a good deal  he told me that he could not bear dr rodd and wished to get away at once  i had to explain to him that this was impossible until his spare oxen arrived which i was going to send for to pretoria but of other matters including that of the dangerous state of his foot i said nothing  i was thankful when towards two in the morning he fell into a sound sleep and allowed me to do the same  before breakfast time just as i had finished dressing myself in some of the clean things which had been brought from the wagon rodd came and made a thorough and businesslike examination of his patient while i awaited the result with anxiety on the stoep  at length he appeared and said  well i think that we shall be able to save the foot though i cant be quite sure for another twentyfour hours  the worst symptoms have abated and his temperature is down by two degrees anyway he will have to stay in bed and live on light food till it is normal after which he might lie in a long chair on the stoep on no account must he attempt to stand  i thanked him for his information heartily enough and asked him if he knew where marnham was as i wanted to speak to him with reference to the despatch of footsack to fetch the oxen from pretoria  not up yet i think he answered  i fancy that yesterday was one of his wet nights excitement of meeting strangers and so on  wet nights i queried wishing for a clearer explanation  yes he is a grand old fellow one of the best but like most other people he has his little weaknesses and when the fit is on him he can put away a surprising amount of liquor  i tell you so that you should not be astonished if you notice anything or try to argue with him when he is in that state as then his temper is apt to bewell lively  now i must go and give him a pint of warm milk that is his favourite antidote and in fact the best there is  i thought to myself that we had struck a nice establishment in which to be tied literally by the leg for an indefinite period i was not particularly flush at the time but i know i would have paid a 100 to be out of it before the end i should have been glad to throw in everything that i had  but mercifully that was hidden from me  rodd and i breakfasted together and discoursed of kaffir customs as to which he was singularly well informed  then i accompanied him to see his native patients in the little hospital of which i have spoken  believing the man to be a thorough scamp as i did it was astonishing to me to note how gentle and forbearing he was to these people  of his skill i need say nothing as that was evident  he was going to perform an internal operation upon a burly old savage rather a serious one i believe at any rate it necessitated chloroform  he asked me if i would like to assist but i declined respectfully having no taste for such things  so i left him boiling his instruments and putting on what looked like a clean nightgown over his clothes and returned to the stoep  here i found marnham whose eyes were rather bloodshot though otherwise except for a shaky hand he seemed right enough  he murmured something about having overslept himself and inquired very politely for his manners were beautiful after anscombe and as to whether we were quite comfortable and so forth  after this i consulted him as to the best road for our servants to travel by to pretoria and later on despatched them giving footsack various notes to ensure the delivery of the oxen to him  also i gave him some money to pay for their keep and told him with many threats to get back with the beasts as quick as he could travel then i sent him and the two other boys off not without misgivings although he was an experienced man in his way and promised faithfully to fulfil every injunction to the letter  to me he seemed so curiously glad to go that i inquired the reason since after a journey like ours it would have been more natural if he had wished to rest  oh baas he said i dont think this tampel very healthy for coloured people  i am told of some who have died here  that man karl who gave me the diamond i think he must have died also at least i saw his spook last night standing over me and shaking his head and the boys saw it too  oh be off with your talk of spooks i said and come back quickly with those oxen or i promise you that you will die and be a spook yourself  i will baas i will he ejaculated and departed almost at a run leaving me rather uncomfortable  i believed nothing of the tale of the spook of karl but i saw that footsack believed in it and was afraid lest he might be thereby prevented from returning  i would much rather have gone myself but it was impossible for me to leave anscombe so ill in the hands of our strange hosts  and there was no one else whom i could send  i might perhaps have ridden to pilgrims rest and tried to find a white messenger there indeed afterwards i regretted not having done so although it would have involved at least a days absence at a very critical time  but the truth is i never thought of it until too late and probably if i had i should not have been able to discover anyone whom i could trust  as i walked back to the house having parted from footsack on the top of a neighbouring ridge whence i could point out his path to him i met marnham riding away  he pulled up and said that he was going down to the granite stream to arrange about setting some one up to watch the wagon  i expressed sorrow that he should have the trouble which should have been mine if i could have got away whereon he answered that he was glad of the opportunity for a ride as it was something to do  how do you fill in your time here i asked carelessly as you dont farm  oh by trading he replied and with a nod set his horse to a canter  a queer sort of trading thought i to myself where there is no store  now what exactly does he trade in i wonder  as it happened i was destined to find out before i was an hour older  having given anscombe a look and found that he was comfortable i thought that i would inspect the quarry whence the marble came of which the house was built as it had occurred to me that if there was plenty of it it might be worth exploiting some time in the future  it had been pointed out to me in the midst of some thorns in a gully that ran at right angles to the main kloof not more than a few hundred yards from the house following a path over which the stones had been dragged originally i came to the spot and discovered that a little cavity had been quarried in what seemed to me to be a positive mountain of pure white marble  i examined the place as thoroughly as i could climbing among some bushes that grew in surface earth which had been washed down from the top in order to do so  at the back of these bushes there was a hole large enough for a man to creep through  i crept through with the object of ascertaining whether the marble veins continued  to my surprise i found a stout yellowwood door within feet of the mouth of the hole  reflecting that no doubt it was here that the quarrymen kept or had kept tools and explosives i gave it a push  i suppose it had been left unfastened accidentally or that something had gone wrong with the lock at any rate it swung open  pursuing my researches as to the depth of the marble i advanced boldly and the place being dark struck a match evidently the marble did continue as i could see by the glittering roof of a cavern for such it was  but the floor attracted my attention as well as the roof for on it were numerous cases not unlike coffins bearing the stamp of a wellknown birmingham firm labelled fencing iron and addressed to messrs marnham  rodd transvaal via delagoa bay  i knew at once what they were having seen the like before but if any doubt remained in my mind it was easy to solve for as it chanced one of the cases was open and half emptied  i slipped my hand into it  as i thought it contained the ordinary kaffir gun of commerce cost delivered in africa say 35s cost delivered to native chief in cash or cattle say 10 which when the market is eager allows for a decent profit  contemplating those cases survivors probably of a much larger stock i understood how it came about that sekukuni had dared to show fight against the government  doubtless it was hence that the guns had come which sent a bullet through anscombes foot and nearly polished off both of us  moreover as further matches showed me that cave contained other storesitem kegs of gunpowder item casks of cheap spirit item bars of lead also a box marked bullet moulds and another marked percussion caps i think too there were some innocent bags full of beads and a few packages of birminghammade assegai blades  there may have been other things but if so i did not wait to investigate them  gathering up the ends of my matches and in case there should be any dust in the place that would show footmarks flapping the stone floor behind me with my pocket handkerchief i retired and continued my investigations of that wonderful marble deposit from the bottom of the quarry to which having rearranged the bushes i descended by another route leaping like a buck from stone to stone  it was just as well that i did so for a few minutes later dr rodd appeared  made a good job of your operation i asked cheerfully  pretty fair thanks he answered although that kaffir tried to brain the nurseman when he was coming out of the anesthetic but are you interested in geology  a little i replied that is if there is any chance of making money out of it which there ought to be here as this marble looks almost as good as that of carrara  but flint instruments are more my line that is in an ignorant and amateur way as i think they are in yours for i saw some in your room  tell me what do you think of this  is it a scraper and i produced a stone out of my pocket which i had found a week before in the bushveld  at once he forgot his suspicions of which i could see he arrived very full indeed  this curious man as it happened was really fond of flint instruments of which he knew a great deal  did you find this here he asked  i led him several yards further from the mouth of the cave and pointed out the exact spot where i said i had picked it up amongst some quarry debris  then followed a most learned discussion for it appeared that this was a flint instrument of the rarest and most valuable type one that noah might have used or job might have scraped himself with and the question was how the dickens had it come among that quarry debris  in the end we left the problem undecided and having presented the article to dr rodd a gift for which he thanked me with real warmth i returned to the house filled with the glow that rewards one who has made a valuable discovery  of the following three days i have nothing particular to say except that during them i was perhaps more acutely bored than ever i had been in my life before  the house was beautiful in its own fashion the food was excellent there was everything i could want to drink and rodd announced that he no longer feared the necessity of operation upon anscombes leg  his recovery was now a mere matter of time and meanwhile he must not use his foot or let the blood run into it more than could be helped which meant that he must keep himself in a recumbent position  the trouble was that i had nothing on earth do except study the characters of our hosts which i found disagreeable and depressing  i might have gone out shooting but nothing of the sort was allowed upon the property in obedience to the wish of miss heda a mysterious young person who was always expected and never appeared and beyond it i was afraid to travel for fear of basutos  i might have gone to pilgrims rest or lydenburg to make report of the nefarious deeds of the said basutos but at best it would have taken one or two days and possibly i should have been detained by officials who never consider any ones time except their own  this meant that i should have been obliged to leave anscombe alone which i did not wish to do so i just sat still and as i have said was intensely bored hanging about the place and smoking more than was good for me  in due course anscombe emerged on to the stoep where he lay with his leg up and was also bored especially after he had tried to pump old marnham about his past in the guards and completely failed  it was in this mood of utter dejection that we agreed to play a game of cards one evening  not that either of us cared for cards indeed personally i have always detested them because with variouscoloured counters to represent money which never passed they had formed one of the afflictions of my youth  it was so annoying if you won to be handed a number of green counters and be informed that they represented so many hundreds or thousands of pounds or viceversa if you lost for as it cost no one anything my dear father insisted upon playing for enormous stakes  never in any aspect of life have i cared for fooling  anscombe also disliked cards i think because his ancestors too had played with counters such as some that i have seen belonging to the cocoatree club and other gambling places of a past generation marked as high as a thousand guineas which counters must next morning be redeemed in hard cash whereby his family had been not a little impoverished  i fancy you will find they are highfliers he said when the pair had left to fetch a suitable table for the night being very hot we were going to play on the stoep by the light of the hanging paraffin lamp and some candles  i replied to the effect that i could not afford to lose large sums of money especially to men who for aught i knew might then be engaged in marking the cards  i understand he answered  dont you bother about that old fellow  this is my affair arranged for my special amusement  i shant grumble if the fun costs something for i am sure there will be fun  all right i said only if we should happen to win money its yours not mine  to myself i reflected however that with these two opponents we had about as much chance of winning as a snowflake has of resisting the atmosphere of the lower regions  presently they returned with the table which had a green cloth over it that hung down halfway to the ground  also one of the native boys brought a tray with spirits from which i judged by various signs old marnham who had already drunk his share at dinner had helped himself freely on the way  soon we were arranged anscombe who was to be my partner opposite to me in his long chair and the game began  i forget what particular variant of cards it was we played though i know it admitted of high and progressive stakes  at first however these were quite moderate and we won as i suppose we were meant to do  after half an hour or so marnham rose to help himself to brandy and water a great deal of brandy and very little water while i took a nip of hollands and anscombe and rodd filled their pipes  i think this is getting rather slow said rodd to anscombe  i vote we put a bit more on  as much as you like answered anscombe with a little drawl and twinkle of the eye which always showed that he was amused both quatermain and i are born gamblers  dont look angry quatermain you know you are  only if we lose you will have to take a cheque for i have precious little cash  i think that will be good enough replied the doctor quietlyif you lose  so the stakes were increased to an amount that made my hair stand up stiffer even than usual and the game went on  behold a marvel came to pass  how it happened i do not know unless marnham had brought the wrong cards by mistake or had grown too fuddled to understand his partners telegraphic signals which i being accustomed to observe saw him make not once but often still we won  what is more with a few setbacks we went on winning till presently the sums written down to our credit for no actual cash passed were considerable  and all the while at the end of each bout marnham helped himself to more brandy while the doctor grew more mad in a suppressedthunder kind of a way for my part i became alarmed especially as i perceived that anscombe was on the verge of breaking into open merriment and his legs being up i could not kick him under the table  my partner ought to go to bed  dont you think we should stop i said  on the whole i do replied rodd glowering at marnham who somewhat unsteadily was engaged in wiping drops of brandy from his long beard  dd if i do exclaimed that worthy  when i was young and played with gentlemen they always gave losers an opportunity of revenge  then replied anscombe with a flash of his eyes let us try to follow in the footsteps of the gentlemen with whom you played in your youth  i suggest that we double the stakes  thats right  thats the old form said marnham  the doctor half rose from his chair then sat down again watching him i concluded that he believed his partner a seasoned vessel was not so drunk as he pretended to be and either in an actual or a figurative sense had a card up his sleeve  if so it remained there for again we won all the luck was with us  i am getting tired drawled anscombe  lemon and water are not sustaining  shall we stop  by heaven no shouted marnham to which anscombe replied that if it was wished he would play another hand but no more  all right said marnham but let it be for double or quits  he spoke quite quietly and seemed suddenly to have grown sober now i think that rodd made up his mind that he really was acting and that he really had that card up his sleeve  at any rate he did not object  i however was of a different opinion having often seen drunken men succumb to an access of sobriety under the stress of excitement and remarked that it did not last long  do you really mean that i said speaking for the first time and addressing myself to the doctor  i dont quite know what the sum involved is but it must be large  of course he answered  then remembering that at the worst anscombe stood to lose nothing i shrugged my shoulders and held my tongue  it was marnhams deal and although he was somewhat in the shadow of the hanging lamp and the candles had guttered out i distinctly saw him play some hocuspocus with the cards but in the circumstances made no protest  as it chanced he must have hocuspocused them wrong for though his hand was full of trumps rodd held nothing at all  the battle that ensued was quite exciting but the end of it was that an ace in the hand of anscombe who really was quite a good player did the business and we won again  in the rather awful silence that followed anscombe remarked in his cheerful drawl  im not sure that my addition is quite right well check that in the morning but i make out that you two gentlemen owe quatermain and myself 749 10s  then the doctor broke out  you accursed old fool he hissedthere is no other word for itat marnham  how are you going to pay all this money that you have gambled away drunken beast that you are  easily enough you felon shouted marnham  so and thrusting his hand into his pocket he pulled out a number of diamonds which he threw upon the table adding theres what will cover it twice over and there are more where they came from as you know well enough my medical jailbird  you dare to call me that gasped the doctor in a voice laden with fury so intense that it had deprived him of his reason youyoumurderer  oh why dont i kill you as i shall some day and lifting his glass which was half full he threw the contents into marnhams face  thats a nice man for a prospective soninlaw isnt he exclaimed the old scamp as seizing the brandy decanter he hurled it straight at rodds head only missing him by an inch  dont you think you had both better go to bed gentlemen i inquired  you are saying things you might regret in the morning  apparently they did think it for without another word they rose and marched off in different directions to their respective rooms which i heard both of them lock  for my part i collected the ious also the diamonds which still lay upon the table while anscombe examined the cards  marked by jove he said  oh my dear quatermain never have i had such an amusing evening in all my life  shut up you silly idiot i answered  therell be murder done over this business and i only hope it wont be on us    chapter vi     miss heda      it might be thought that after all this there would have been a painful explanation on the following morning but nothing of the sort happened  after all the greatest art is the art of ignoring things without which the world could scarcely go on even among the savage races  thus on this occasion the two chief actors in the scene of the previous night pretended that they had forgotten what took place as i believe to a large extent truly  the fierce flame of drink in the one and of passion in the other had burnt the web of remembrance to ashes  they knew that something unpleasant had occurred and its main outlines the rest had vanished away perhaps because they knew also that they were not responsible for what they said and did and therefore that what occurred had no right to a permanent niche in their memories  it was as it were something outside of their normal selves  at least so i conjectured and their conduct seemed to give colour to my guess  the doctor spoke to me of the matter first  i fear there was a row last night he said it has happened here before over cards and will no doubt happen again until matters clear themselves up somehow  marnham as you see drinks and when drunk is the biggest liar in the world and i i am sorry to say am cursed with a violent temper  dont judge either of us too harshly  if you were a doctor you would know that all these things come to us with our blood and we didnt fashion our own clay did we  have some coffee wont you  subsequently when rodd wasnt there marnham spoke also and with that fine air of courtesy which was peculiar to him  i owe a deep apology he said to yourself and mr anscombe i do not recall much about it but i know there was a scene last night over those cursed cards  a weakness overtakes me sometimes  i will say no more except that you who are also a man who perhaps have felt weaknesses of one sort or another will i hope make allowances for me and pay no attention to anything that i may have said or done in the presence of guests yes that is what pains mein the presence of guests  something in his distinguished manner caused me to reflect upon every peccadillo that i had ever committed setting it in its very worst light  quite so i answered quite so  pray do not mention the matter any more although these words seemed to jerk themselves out of my throat you did call each other by such very hard names  i daresay he answered with a vacant smile but if so they meant nothing  no i understand just like a lovers quarrel  but look here you left some diamonds on the table which i took to keep the kaffirs out of temptation  i will fetch them  did i  well probably i left some ious also which might serve for pipelights  so suppose we set the one against the other  i dont know the value of either the diamonds or the pipelights it may be less or more but for gods sake dont let me see the beastly things again  theres no need i have plenty  i must speak to anscombe i answered  the money at stake was his not mine  speak to whom you will he replied and i noted that the throbbing vein upon his forehead indicated a rising temper  but never let me see those diamonds again  throw them into the gutter if you wish but never let me see them again or there will be trouble  then he flung out of the room leaving his breakfast almost untasted  reflecting that this queer old bird probably did not wish to be crossquestioned as to his possession of so many uncut diamonds or that they were worth much less than the sum he had lost or possibly that they were not diamonds at all but glass i went to report the matter to anscombe  he only laughed and said that as i had got the things i had better keep them until something happened for we had both got it into our heads that something would happen before we had done with that establishment  so i went to put the stones away as safely as i could  while i was doing so i heard the rumble of wheels and came out just in time to see a cape cart drawn by four very good horses and driven by a hottentot in a smart hat and a red waistband pull up at the garden gate  out of this cart presently emerged a neatly dressed lady of whom all i could see was that she was young slender and rather tall also as her back was towards me that she had a great deal of auburn hair  there said anscombe  i knew that something would happen heda has happened  quatermain as neither her venerated parent nor her loving fiance for such i gather he is seems to be about you had better go and give her a hand  i obeyed with a groan heartily wishing that heda hadnt happened since some sense warned me that she would only add to the present complications  at the gate having given some instructions to a very stout young coloured woman who i took it was her maid about a basket of flower roots in the cart she turned round suddenly and we came face to face with the gate between us  for a moment we stared at each other i reflecting that she really was very pretty with her delicatelyshaped features her fresh healthylooking complexion her long dark eyelashes and her lithe and charming figure  what she reflected about me i dont know probably nothing half so complimentary suddenly however her large greyish eyes grew troubled and a look of alarm appeared upon her face  is anything wrong with my father she asked  i dont see him  if you mean mr marnham i replied lifting my hat i believe that dr rodd and he  never mind about dr rodd she broke in with a contemptuous little jerk of her chin how is my father  i imagine much as usual  he and dr rodd were here a little while ago i suppose that they have gone out as a matter of fact they had but in different directions  then thats all right she said with a sigh of relief  you see i heard that he was very ill which is why i have come back  so thought i to myself she loves that old scamp and shedoesnt love the doctor  there will be more trouble as sure as five and two are seven  all we wanted was a woman to make the pot boil over  then i opened the gate and took a travelling bag from her hand with my politest bow  my name is quatermain and that of my friend anscombe  we are staying here you know i said rather awkwardly  indeed she answered with a delightful smile what a very strange place to choose to stay in  it is a beautiful house i remarked  not bad although i designed it more or less  but i was alluding to its inhabitants  this finished me and i am sure she felt that i could think of nothing nice to say about those inhabitants for i heard her sigh  we walked side by side up the rosefringed path and presently arrived at the stoep where anscombe whose hair i had cut very nicely on the previous day was watching us from his long chair  they looked at each other and i saw both of them colour a little out of mere foolishness i suppose  anscombe i said this is and i paused not being quite certain whether she also was called marnham  heda marnham she interrupted  yesmiss heda marnham and this is the honourable maurice anscombe  forgive me for not rising miss marnham said anscombe in his pleasant voice by the way hers was pleasant too full and rather low with just a suggestion of something foreign about it  a shot through the foot prevents me at present  who shot you she asked quickly  oh only a kaffir  i am so sorry i hope you will get well soon  forgive me now i must go to look for my father  she is uncommonly pretty remarked anscombe and a lady into the bargain  in reflecting on old marnhams sins we must put it to his credit that he has produced a charming daughter  too pretty and charming by half i grunted  perhaps dr rodd is of the same way of thinking  great shame that such a girl should be handed over to a medical scoundrel like dr rodd  i wonder if she cares for him  just about as much as a canary cares for a tomcat  i have found that out already  really quatermain you are admirable  i never knew anyone who could make a better use of the briefest opportunity  then we were silent waiting not without a certain impatience for the return of miss heda  she did return with surprising quickness considering that she had found time to search for her parent to change into a clean white dress and to pin a single hibiscus flower on to her bodice which gave just the touch of colour that was necessary to complete her costume  i cant find my father she said but the boys say he has gone out riding  i cant find anybody  when you have been summoned from a long way off and travelled posthaste rather to your own inconvenience it is amusing isnt it  wagons and carts in south africa dont arrive like express trains miss marnham said anscombe so you shouldnt be offended  i am not at all offended mr anscombe  now that i know there is nothing the matter with my father imbut tell me how did you get your wound  so he told her with much amusing detail after his fashion  she listened quietly with a puckered up brow and only made one comment  it was  i wonder what white man told those sekukuni kaffirs that you were coming  i dont know he answered but he deserves a bullet through him somewhere above the ankle  yes though few people get what they deserve in this wicked world  so i have often thought  had it been otherwise for example i should have been  what would you have been she asked considering him curiously  oh a better shot than mr allan quatermain and as beautiful as a lady i once saw in my youth  dont talk rubbish before luncheon i remarked sternly and we all laughed the first wholesome laughter that i had heard at the temple  for this young lady seemed to bring happiness and merriment with her  i remember wondering what it was of which her coming reminded me and concluding that it was like the sight and smell of a peach orchard in full bloom stumbled on suddenly in the black desert of the burnt winter veld  after this we became quite friendly  she dilated on her skill in having produced the temple from an old engraving which she fetched and showed to us at no greater an expense than it would have cost to build an ordinary house  that is because the marble was at hand said anscombe  quite so she replied demurely  speaking in a general sense one can do many things in lifeif the marble is at hand  only most of us when we look for marble find sandstone or mud  bravo said anscombe i have generally lit upon the sandstone  and i on the mud she mused  and i on all three for the earth contains marble and mud and sandstone to say nothing of gold and jewels i broke in being tired of silence  but neither of them paid much attention to me  anscombe did say out of politeness i suppose that pitch and subterranean fires should be added or some such nonsense  then she began to tell him of her infantile memories of hungary which were extremely faint of how they came this place and lived first of all in two large kaffir huts until suddenly they began to grow rich of her school days at maritzburg of the friends with whom she had been staying and i know not what until at last i got up and went out for a walk  when i returned an hour or so later they were still talking and so continued to do until dr rodd arrived upon the scene  at first they did not see him for he stood at an angle to them but i saw him and watched his face with a great deal of interest it or rather its expression was not pleasant before now i have seen something like it on that of a wild beast which thinks that it is about to be robbed of its prey by a stronger wild beast in short a mixture of hate fear and jealousyespecially jealousy at the last i did not wonder for these two seemed to be getting on uncommonly well  they were so to speak well matched  she of course was the better looking of the two a really pretty and attractive young woman indeed but the vivacity of anscombes face the twinkle of his merry blue eyes and its general refinement made up for what he lackedregularity of feature  i think he had just told her one of his good stories which he always managed to make so humorous by a trick of pleasing and harmless exaggeration and they were both laughing merrily  then she caught sight of the doctor and her merriment evaporated like a drop of water on a hot shovel  distinctly i saw her pull herself together and prepare for something  how do you do she said rapidly rising and holding out her slim sunbrowned hand  but i need not ask you look so well  how do you do my dear with a heavy emphasis on the dear he answered slowly  but i neednt ask for i see that you are in perfect health and spirits and he bent forward as though to kiss her  somehow or other she avoided that endearment or seal of possession  i dont quite know how as i turned my head away not wishing to witness what i felt to be unpleasant  when i looked up again however i saw that she had avoided it the scowl on his face the demureness of hers and anscombes evident amusement assured me of this  she was asking about her father he answered that he also seemed quite well  then why did you write to tell me that i ought to come as he was not at all well she inquired with a lifting of her delicate eyebrows  the question was never answered for at that moment marnham himself appeared  oh father she said and rushed into his arms while he kissed her tenderly on both cheeks  so i was not mistaken thought i to myself she does really love this moral wreck and what is more he loves her which shows that there must be good in him  is anyone truly bad i wondered or for the matter of that truly good either  is it not all a question of circumstance and blood  neither then or at any other time have i found an answer to the problem  at any rate to me there seemed something beautiful about the meeting of these two  the influence of miss heda in the house was felt at once  the boys became smarter and put on clean clothes  vases of flowers appeared in the various rooms ours was turned out and cleaned a disagreeable process so far as we were concerned  moreover at dinner both marnham and rodd wore dress clothes with short jackets a circumstance that put anscombe and myself to shame since we had none  it was curious to see how with those dress clothes which doubtless awoke old associations within him marnham changed his colour like a chameleon  really he might have been the colonel of a cavalry regiment rising to toast the queen after he had sent round the wine so polite and polished was his talk  who could have identified the man with the dry old ruffian of twentyfour hours before he who was drinking claret and very good claret too mixed with water and listening with a polite interest to all the details of his daughters journey even the doctor looked a gentleman which doubtless he was once upon a time in evening dress  moreover some kind of truce had been arranged  he no longer called miss heda my dear or attempted any familiarities while she on more than one occasion very distinctly called him dr rodd  so much for that night and for several others that followed  as for the days they went by pleasantly and idly  heda walked about on her fathers arm conversed in friendly fashion with the doctor always watching him i noticed as a cat watches a dog that she knows is waiting an opportunity to spring and for the rest associated with us as much as she could  particularly did she seem to take refuge behind my own insignificance having i suppose come to the conclusion that i was a harmless person who might possibly prove useful  but all the while i felt that the storm was banking up  indeed marnham himself at any rate to a great extent played the part of the cloudcompelling jove for soon it became evident to me and without doubt to dr rodd also that he was encouraging the intimacy between his daughter and anscombe by every means in his power  in one way and another he had fully informed himself as to anscombes prospects in life which were brilliant enough moreover he liked the man who as the remnant of the better perceptions of his youth told him was one of the best class of englishmen and what is more he saw that heda liked him also as much indeed as she disliked rodd  he even spoke to me of the matter in a roundabout kind of fashion saying that the young woman who married anscombe would be lucky and that the father who had him for a soninlaw might go to his grave confident of his childs happiness  i answered that i agreed with him unless the ladys affections had already caused her to form other ties  affections he exclaimed dropping all pretence there are none involved in this accursed business as you are quite sharp enough to have seen for yourself  i understood that an engagement was involved i remarked  on my part perhaps not on hers he answered  oh cant you understand quatermain that sometimes men find themselves forced into strange situations against their will  remembering the very ugly name that i had heard rodd call marnham on the night of the card party i reflected that i could understand well enough but i only said  after all marriage is a matter that concerns a woman even more than it does her father one in short of which she must be the judge  quite so quatermain but there are some daughters who are prepared to make great sacrifices for their fathers  well she will be of age ere long if only i can stave it off till then but how how and with a groan he turned and left me  that old gentlemans neck is in some kind of a noose thought i to myself and his difficulty is to prevent the rope from being drawn tight  meanwhile this poor girls happiness and future are at stake  allan said anscombe to me a little later for by now he called me by my christian name i suppose you havent heard anything about those oxen have you  no i could scarcely expect to yet but why do you ask  he smiled in his droll fashion and replied because interesting as this household is in sundry ways i think it is about time that we or at any rate that i got out of it  your leg isnt fit to travel yet anscombe although rodd says that all the symptoms are very satisfactory  yes but to tell you the truth i am experiencing other symptoms quite unknown to that beloved physician and so unfamiliar to myself that i attribute them to the influences of the locality altitude affects the heart does it not and this house stands high  dont play off your jokes on me i said sternly  what do you mean  i wonder if you find miss heda attractive allan or if you are too old  i believe there comes an age when the only beauties that can move a man are those of architecture or scenery or properly cooked food  hang it all i am not methusaleh i replied but if you mean that you are falling in love with heda why the deuce dont you say so instead of wasting my time and your own  because time was given to us to waste  properly considered it is the best use to which it can be put or at any rate the one that does least mischief  also because i wished to make you say it for me that i might judge from the effect of your words whether it is or is not true  i may add that i fear the former to be the case  well if you are in love with the girl you cant expect one so ancient as myself who is quite out of touch with such follies to teach you how to act  no allan  unfortunately there are occasions when one must rely upon ones own wisdom and mine what there is of it tells me i had better get out of this  but i cant ride even if i took the horse and you ran behind and the oxen havent come  perhaps you could borrow miss marnhams cart in which to run away from her i suggested sarcastically  perhaps though i believe it would be fatal to my foot to sit up in a cart for the next few days and the horses seem to have been sent off somewhere  look here old fellow he went on dropping his bantering tone its rather awkward to make a fool of oneself over a lady who is engaged to some one else especially if one suspects that with a little encouragement she might begin to walk the same road  the truth is i have taken the fever pretty bad worse than ever i did before and if it isnt stopped soon it will become chronic  oh no anscombe only intermittent at the worst and african malaria nearly always yields to a change of climate  how can i expect a cynic and a misogynist to understand the simple fervour of an inexperienced souloh drat it all quatermain stop your acid chaff and tell me what is to be done really i am in a tight place  very so tight that i rejoice to think as you were kind enough to point out that my years protect me from anything of the sort i have no advice to give i think you had better ask it of the lady  well we did have a little conversation hypothetical of course about some friends of ours who found themselves similarly situated and i regret to say without result  indeed  i did not know you had any mutual acquaintances  what did she say and do  she said nothing only sighed and looked as though she were going to burst into tears and all she did was to walk away  id have followed her if i could but as my crutch wasnt there it was impossible  it seemed to me that suddenly i had come up against a brick wall that there was something on her mind which she could not or would not let out  yes and if you want to know i will tell you what it is  rodd has got a hold over marnham of a sort that would bring him somewhere near the gallows  as the price of his silence marnham has promised him his daughter  the daughter knows that her father is in this mans power though i think she does not know in what way and being a good girl  an angel you meando call her by her right name especially in a place where angels are so much wanted  well an angel if you likeshe has promised on her part to marry a man she loathes in order to save her parents bacon  just what i concluded from what we heard in the row  i wonder which of that pair is the bigger blackguard  well allan that settles it  you and i are on the side of the angel  you will have to get her out of this scrape andif shell have me ill marry her and if she wont why it cant be helped  now thats a fair division of labour  how are you going to do it i havent an idea and if i had i should not presume to interfere with one so much older and wiser than myself  i suppose that by the time you appeared in it the game of heads i win and tails you lose had died out of the world i replied with an indignant snort  i think the best thing i can do will be to take the horse and look for those oxen  meanwhile you can settle your business by the light of your native genius and i only hope youll finish it without murder and sudden death  i say old fellow said anscombe earnestly you dont really mean to go off and leave me in this hideousness i havent bothered much up to the present because i was sure that you would find a way out which would be nothing to a man of your intellect and experience  i mean it honestly i do indeed  do you  well i can only say that my mind is a perfect blank but if you will stop talking i will try to think the matter over theres miss heda in the garden cutting flowers  i will go to help her which will be a very pleasant change  and i went leaving him to stare after me jealously    chapter vii     the stoep      when i reached miss heda she was collecting halfopened monthly roses from the hedge and not quite knowing what to say i made the appropriate quotation  at least it was appropriate to my thought and from her answer to hers also  yes she said i am gathering them while i may and she sighed and as i thought glanced towards the verandah though of this i could not be sure because of the wide brim of the hat she was wearing  then we talked a little on indifferent matters while i pricked my fingers helping to pluck the roses  she asked me if i thought that anscombe was getting on well and how long it would be before he could travel  i replied that dr rodd could tell her better than myself but that i hoped in about a week  in a week she said and although she tried to speak lightly there was dismay in her voice  i hope you dont think it too long i answered but even if he is fit to go the oxen have not come yet and i dont quite know when they will  too long she exclaimed  too long  oh if you only knew what it is to me to have such guests as you are in this place and her dark eyes filled with tears  by now we had passed to the side of the house in search of some other flower that grew in the shade i think it was mignonette and were out of sight of the verandah and quite alone  mr quatermain  she said hurriedly i am wondering whether to ask your advice about something if you would give it  i have no one to consult here she added rather piteously  that is for you to decide  if you wish to do so i am old enough to be your father and will do my best to help  we walked on to an orange grove that stood about forty yards away ostensibly to pick some fruit but really because we knew that there we should be out of hearing and could see any one who approached  mr quatermain she said presently in a low voice i am in great trouble almost the greatest a woman can have  i am engaged to be married to a man whom i do not care for  then why not break it off  it may be unpleasant but it is generally best to face unpleasant things and nothing can be so bad as marrying a man whom you do notcare for  because i cannoti dare not  i have to obey  how old are you miss marnham  i shall be of age in three months time  you may guess that i did not intend to return here until they were over but i was welltrapped  he wrote to me that my father was ill and i came  at any rate when they are over you will not have to obey any one  it is not long to wait  it is an eternity  besides this is not so much a question of obedience as of duty and of love  i love my father who whatever his faults has always been very kind to me  and i am sure he loves you  why not go to him and tell him your trouble  he knows it already mr quatermain and hates this marriage even more than i do if that is possible  but he is driven to it as i am  oh i must tell the truth  the doctor has some hold over him  my father has done something dreadful i dont know what and i dont want to know but if it came out it would ruin my father or worse worse  i am the price of his silence on the day of our marriage he will destroy the proofs  if i refuse to marry him they will be produced and then  it is difficult i said  it is more than difficult it is terrible  if you could see all there is in my heart you would know how terrible  i think i can see miss heda  dont say any more now  give me time to consider  in case of necessity come to me again and be sure that i will protect you  but you are going in a week  many things happen in a week  sufficient to the day is its evil  at the end of the week we will come to some decision unless everything is already decided  for the next twentyfour hours i reflected on this pretty problem as hard as ever i did on anything in all my life  here was a young woman who must somehow be protected from a scoundrel but who could not be protected because she herself had to protect another scoundrelto wit her own father  could the thing be faced out impossible for i was sure that marnham had committed a murder or murders of which rodd possessed evidence that would hang him could heda be married to anscombe at once  yes if both were willing but then marnham would still be hung  could they elope possibly but with the same result  could i take her away and put her under the protection of the court at pretoria  yes but with the same result  i wondered what my hottentot retainer hans would have advised he who was named lightindarkness and in his own savage way was the cleverest and most cunning man that i have met  alas i could not raise him from the grave to tell me and yet i knew well what he would have answered  baas he would have said this is a rope which only the pale old man ie death can cut  let this doctor die or let the father die and the maiden will be free  surely heaven is longing for one or both of them and if necessary baas i believe that i can point out a path to heaven  i laughed to myself at the thought which was one that a white man could not entertain even as a thought  and i felt that the hypothetical hans was right death alone could cut this knot and the reflection made me shiver  that night i slept uneasily and dreamed  i dreamed that once more i was in the black kloof in zululand seated in front of the huts at the end of the kloof  before me squatted the old wizard zikali wrapped up in his karosszikali the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn whom i had not seen for years  near him were the ashes of a fire by the help of which i knew he had been practising divination  he looked up and laughed one of his terrible laughs  so you are here again macumazahn he said grown older but still the same here at the appointed hour  what do you come to seek from the opener of roads  not mameena as i think this time no no it is she who seeks you this time macumazahn  she found you once did she not  far away to the north among a strange people who worshipped an ivory child a people of whom i knew in my youth and afterwards for was not their prophet harut a friend of mine and one of our brotherhood  she found you beneath the tusks of the elephant jana whom macumazahn the skilful could not hit  oh do not look astonished  how do you know i asked in my dream  very simply macumazahn  a little yellow man named hans has been with me and told me all the story not an hour ago after which i sent for mameena to learn if it were true  she will be glad to meet you macumazahn she who has a hungry heart that does not forget  oh dont be afraid  i mean here beneath the sun in the land beyond there will be no need for her to meet you since she will dwell ever at your side  why do you lie to me zikali i seemed to ask  how can a dead man speak to you and how can i meet a woman who is dead  seek the answer to that question in the hour of the battle when the white men your brothers fall beneath assegai as weeds fall before the hoeor perhaps before it  but have done with mameena since she who never grows more old can well afford to wait  it is not of mameena that you came to speak to me it is of a fair white woman named heddana you would speak and of the man she loves you who will ever be mixing yourself up in affairs of others and therefore must bear their burdens with no pay save that of honour  hearken for the time is short  when the storm bursts upon them bring hither the fair maiden heddana and the white lord mauriti and i will shelter them for your sake  take them nowhere else  bring them hither if they would escape trouble  i shall be glad to see you macumazahn for at last i am about to smite the zulu house of senzangacona my foes with a bladder full of blood and oh it stains their doorposts red  then i woke up feeling afraid as one does after a nightmare and was comforted to hear anscombe sleeping quietly on the other side of the room  mauriti  why did zikali call him mauriti i wondered drowsily to myself  oh of course his name is maurice and it was a zulu corruption of a common sort as was heddana of heda  then i dozed off again and by the morning had forgotten all about my dream until it was brought back to me by subsequent events still it was this and nothing else that put it into my head to fly to zululand on an emergency that was to arise ere long  for the history of zikali and mameena see the book called child of storm by h rider haggard  that evening rodd was absent from dinner and on inquiring where he might be i was informed that he had ridden to visit a kaffir headman a patient of his who lived at a distance and would very probably sleep at the kraal returning early next day  one of the topics of conversation during dinner was as to where the exact boundary line used to run between the transvaal and the country over which the basuto chief sekukuni claimed ownership and jurisdiction  marnham said that it passed within a couple of miles of his house and when we rose the moon being very bright offered to show me where the beacons had been placed years before by a boer commission  i accepted as the night was lovely for a stroll after the hot day  also i was half conscious of another undefined purpose in my mind which perhaps may have spread to that of marnham  those two young people looked very happy together there on the stoep and as they must part so soon it would i thought be kind to give them the opportunity of a quiet chat  so off we went to the brow of the hill on which the temple stood whence old marnham pointed out to me a beacon which i could not see in the dim silvery bushveld below and how the line ran from it to another beacon somewhere else  you know the yellowwood swamp he said  it passes straight through that  that is why those basutos who were following you pulled up upon the edge of the swamp though as a matter of fact according to their ideas they had a perfect right to kill you on their side of the line which cuts through the middle  i made some remark to the effect that i presumed that the line had in fact ceased to exist at all as the basuto territory had practically become british after which we strolled back to the house  walking quietly between the tall rose hedges and without speaking for each of us was preoccupied with his own thoughts suddenly we came upon a very pretty scene  we had left anscombe and heda seated side by side on the stoep they were still there but much closer together  in fact his arms were round her and they were kissing each other in a remarkably wholehearted way  about this there could be no mistake since the rimpistrung couch on which they sat was immediately under the hanging lampa somewhat unfortunate situation for such endearments  but what did they think of hanging lamps or any other lights save those of their own eyes they who were content to kiss and murmur words of passion as though they were as much alone as adam and eve in eden  what did they think either of the serpent coiled about the bole of this tree of knowledge whereof they had just plucked the ripe and maddening fruit  by a mutual instinct marnham and i withdrew ourselves very gently indeed purposing to skirt round the house and enter it from behind or to be seized with a fit of coughing at the gate or to do something to announce our presence at a convenient distance  when we had gone a little way we heard a crash in the bushes  another of those cursed baboons robbing the garden remarked marnham reflectively  i think he is going to rob the house also i replied turning to point to something dark that seemed to be leaping up on to the verandah  next moment we heard heda utter a little cry of alarm and a man say in a low fierce voice  so i have caught you at last have i  the doctor has returned from his business rounds sooner than was expected and i think that we had better join the party i remarked and made a bee line for the stoep marnham following me  i think that i arrived just in time to prevent mischief  there with a revolver in his hand stood rodd tall and formidable his dark face looking like that of satan himself a very monument of rage and jealousy  there in front of him on the couch sat heda grasping its edge with her fingers her cheeks as pale as a sheet and her eyes shining  by her side was anscombe cool and collected as usual i noticed but evidently perplexed  if there is any shooting to be done he was saying i think you had better begin with me  his calmness seemed to exasperate rodd who lifted the revolver but i too was prepared for in that house i always went armed there was no time to get at the man who was perhaps fifteen feet away and i did not want to hurt him  so i did the best i could that is i fired at the pistol in his hand and the light being good struck it near the hilt and knocked it off the barrel before the he could press the trigger if he really meant to shoot  thats a good shot remarked anscombe who had seen me while rodd stared at the hilt which he still held  a lucky one i answered walking forward  and now dr rodd will you be so good as to tell me what you mean by flourishing a revolver presumably loaded in the faces of a lady and an unarmed man  what the devil is that to you he asked furiously and what do you mean by firing at me  a great deal i answered seeing that a young woman and my friend are concerned  as for firing at you had i done so you would not be asking questions now  i fired at the pistol in your hand but if there is more trouble next time it shall be at the holder and i glanced at my revolver  seeing that i meant business he made no reply but turned upon marnham who had followed me  this is your work you old villain he said in a low voice that was heavy with hate  you promised your daughter to me  she is engaged to me and now i find her in this wanderers arms  what have i to do with it said marnham  perhaps she has changed her mind  you had better ask her  there is no need to ask me interrupted heda who now seemed to have got her nerve again  i have changed my mind  i never loved you dr rodd and i will not marry you  i love mr anscombe here and as he has asked me to be his wife i mean to marry him  i see he sneered you want to be a peeress one day no doubt well you never shall if i can help it  perhaps too this fine gentleman of yours will not be so particularly anxious to marry you when he learns that you are the daughter of a murderer  that word was like a bombshell bursting among us  we looked at each other as people yet dazed with the shock might on a battlefield when the noise of the explosion has died and the smoke cleared away to see who is still alive  anscombe spoke the first  i dont know what you mean or to what you refer he said quietly  but at any rate this lady who has promised to marry me is innocent and therefore if all her ancestors had been murderers it would not in the slightest turn me from my purpose of marrying her  she looked at him and all the gratitude in the world shone in her frightened eyes  marnham stepped or rather staggered forward the blue vein throbbing on forehead  he lies he said hoarsely tugging at his long beard  listen now and i will tell you the truth  once more than a year ago i was drunk and in a rage  in this state i fired at a kaffir to frighten him and by some devils chance shot him dead  thats what he calls being a murderer  i have another tale said rodd with which i will not trouble this company just now  look here heda either you fulfil your promise and marry me or your father swings  she gasped and sank together on the seat as though she had been shot  then i took up my parable  are you the man i asked to accuse others of crime  let us see  you have spent several months in an english prison i gave the name for a crime i wont mention  how do you know he began  never mind i do know and the prison books will show it further your business is that of selling guns and ammunition to the basutos of sekukunis tribe who although the expedition against them has been temporarily recalled are still the queens enemies  dont deny it for i have the proofs  further it was you who advised sekukuni to kill us when we went down to his country to shoot the other day because you were afraid that we should discover whence he got his guns  this was a bow drawn at a venture but the arrow went home for i saw his jaw drop further i believe you to be an illicit diamond buyer and i believe also that you have again been arranging with the basutos to make an end of us though of these last two items at present i lack positive proof  now dr rodd i ask you for the second time whether you are a person to accuse others of crimes and whether should you do so you will be considered a credible witness when your own are brought to light  if i had been guilty of any of these things which i am not it is obvious that my partner must have shared in all of them except the first  so if you inform against me you inform against him and the father of heda whom your friend wishes to marry will according to your showing be proved a gunrunner a thief and a wouldbe murderer of his guests  i should advise you to leave that business alone mr quatermain  the reply was bold and clever so much so that i regarded this blackguard with a certain amount of admiration as i answered  i shall take your advice if you take mine to leave another business alone that of this young lady and her father but not otherwise  then spare your breath and do your worst only careful sharp as you think yourself that your meddling does not recoil on your own head  listen heda either you make up your mind to marry me at once and arrange that this young gentleman who as a doctor i assure you is now quite fit to travel without injury to his health leaves this house tomorrow with the spy quatermainyou might lend him the cape cart to go inor i start with the proofs to lay a charge of murder against your father  i give you till tomorrow morning to have a family council to think it over goodnight  goodnight i answered as he passed me and please be careful that none of us see your face again before tomorrow morning  as you may happen to have heard my native name means watcherbynight and i looked at the revolver in my hand  when he had vanished i remarked in as cheerful voice as i could command that i thought it was bedtime and as nobody stirred added dont be afraid young lady  if you feel lonely you must tell that stout maid of yours to sleep in your room  also as the night is so hot i shall take my nap on the stoep there just opposite your window  no dont let us talk any more now there will be plenty of time for that tomorrow  she rose looked at anscombe looked at me looked at her father very pitifully then with a little exclamation of despair passed into her room by the french window where presently i heard her call the native maid and tell her that she was to sleep with her  marnham watched her depart  then he too went with his head bowed and staggering a little in his walk  next anscombe rose and limped off into his room i following him  well young man i said you have put us all in the soup now and no mistake  yes allan i am afraid i have  but on the whole dont you think it rather interesting soupso many unexpected ingredients you see  interesting soup  unexpected ingredients i repeated after him adding why not call it hells broth at once  then he became serious dreadfully serious  look here he said i love heda and whatever her family history may be i mean to marry her and face the row at home  you could scarcely do less in all the circumstances and as for rows that young lady would soon fit herself into any place that you can give her  but the question is how can you marry her  oh something will happen he replied optimistically  you are quite right there  something will certainly happen but the point iswhat something was very near happening when i turned up on that stoep so near that i think it was lucky for you or for miss heda or both that i have learned how to handle a pistol  now let me see your foot and dont speak another word to me about all this business tonight  id rather tackle it when i am clearheaded in the morning  well i examined his instep and leg very carefully and found that rodd was right  although it still hurt him to walk the wound was quite healed and all inflammation had gone from the limb  now it was only a question of time for the sinews to right themselves  while i was thus engaged he held forth on the virtues and charms of heda i making no comment  lie down and get to sleep if you can i said when i had finished  the door is locked and i am going on to the stoep so you neednt be afraid of the windows  goodnight  i went out and sat myself down in such a position that by the light of the hanging lamp which still burned i could make sure that no one could approach either hedas or my room without my seeing him  for the rest all my life i have been accustomed to night vigils and the loaded revolver hung from my wrist by a loop of hide  moreover never had i felt less sleepy  there i sat hour after hour thinking  the substance of my thoughts does not matter since the events that followed make them superfluous to the story  i will merely record therefore that towards dawn a great horror took hold of me  i did not know of what i was afraid but i was much afraid of something  nothing was passing in either hedas or our room of that i made sure by personal examination  therefore it would seem that my terrors were unnecessary and yet they grew and grew  i felt sure that something was happening somewhere a dread occurrence which it was beyond my power to prevent though whether it were in this house or at the other end of africa i did not know  the mental depression increased and culminated  then of a sudden it passed completely away and as i mopped the sweat from off my brow i noticed that dawn was breaking  it was a tender and beautiful dawn and in a dim way i took it as a good omen  of course it was nothing but the daily resurrection of the sun and yet it brought to me comfort and hope  the night was past with all its fears the light had come with all its joys  from that moment i was certain that we should triumph over these difficulties and that the end of them would be peace  so sure was i that i ventured to take a nap knowing that the slightest movement or sound would wake me  i suppose i slept until six oclock when i was aroused by a footfall  i sprang up and saw before me one of our native servants  he was trembling and his face was ashen beneath the black  moreover he could not speak  all he did was to put his head on one side like a dead man and keep on pointing downwards  then with his mouth open and starting eyes he beckoned to me to follow him  i followed    chapter viii     rodds last card      the man led me to marnhams room which i had never entered before  all i could see at first for the shutters were closed was that the place seemed large as bedchambers go in south africa  when my eyes grew accustomed to the light i made out the figure of a man seated in a chair with his head bent forward over a table that was placed at the foot of the bed almost in the centre of the room  i threw open the shutters and the morning light poured in  the man was marnham  on the table were writing materials also a brandy bottle with only a dreg of spirit in it i looked for the glass and found it by his side on the floor shattered not merely broken  drunk i said aloud whereon the servant who understood me spoke for the first time saying in a frightened voice in dutch  no baas dead half cold  i found him so just now  i bent down and examined marnham also felt his face  sure enough he was dead for his jaw had fallen also his flesh was chill and from him came a horrible smell of brandy  i thought for a moment then bade the boy fetch dr rodd and say nothing to any one else he went and now for the first time i noticed a large envelope addressed allan quatermain esq in a somewhat shaky hand  this i picked up and slipped into my pocket  rodd arrived half dressed  whats the matter now he growled  i pointed to marnham saying  that is a question for you to answer  oh drunk again i suppose he said  then he did as i had done bent down and examined him  a few seconds later he stepped or reeled back looking as frightened as a man could be and exclaiming  dead as a stone by god dead these three hours or more  quite so i answered but what killed him  how should i know he asked savagely  do you suspect me of poisoning him  my mind is open i replied but as you quarrelled so bitterly last night others might  the bolt went home he saw his danger  probably the old sot died in a fit or of too much brandy  how can one know without a postmortem  but that mustnt be made by me  im off to inform the magistrate and get hold of another doctor  let the body remain as it is until i return  i reflected quickly  ought i to let him go or not  if he had any hand in this business doubtless he intended to escape well supposing this were so and he did escapee that would be a good thing for heda and really it was no affair of mine to bring the fellow to justice  moreover there was nothing to show that he was guilty his whole manner seemed to point another way though of course he might be acting  very well i replied but return as quickly as possible  he stood for a few seconds like a man who is dazed  it occurred to me that it might have come into his mind with marnhams death that he had lost his hold over heda  but if so he said nothing of it but only asked  will you go instead of me  on the whole i think not i replied and if i did the story i should have to tell might not tend to your advantage  thats true damn you he exclaimed and left the room  ten minutes later he was galloping towards pilgrims rest before i departed from the death chamber i examined the place carefully to see if i could find any poison or other deadly thing but without success  one thing i did discover however turning the leaf of a blottingbook that was by marnhams elbow i came upon a sheet of paper on which were written these words in his hand greater love hath no man than this that was all  either he had forgotten the end of the quotation or changed his mind or was unable through weakness to finish the sentence this paper also i put in my pocket  bolting the shutters and locking the door i returned to the stoep where i was alone for as yet no one else was stirring  then i remembered the letter in my pocket and opened it  it ran   dear mr quatermain  i have remembered that those who quarrel with dr rodd are apt to die soon and suddenly at any rate life at my age is always uncertain  therefore as i know you to be an honest man i am enclosing my will that it may be in safe keeping and purpose to send it to your room tomorrow morning  perhaps when you return to pretoria you will deposit it in the standard bank there and if i am still alive forward me the receipt  you will see that i leave everything to my daughter whom i dearly love and that there is enough to keep the wolf from her door besides my share in this property if it is ever realized  after all that has passed tonight i do not feel up to writing a long letter so  remain sincerely yours  h a marnham   psi should like to state clearly upon paper that my earnest hope and wish are that heda may get clear of that blackhearted murderous scoundrel rodd and marry mr anscombe whom i like and who i am sure would make her a good husband   thinking to myself this did not look very like the letter of a suicide i glanced through the will as the testator seemed to have wished that i should do so  it was short but properly drawn signed and witnessed and bequeathed a sum of 9000 which was on deposit at the standard bank together with all his other property real and personal to heda for her own sole use free from the debts and engagements of her husband should she marry  also she was forbidden to spend more than 1000 of the capital  in short the money was strictly tied up  with the will were some other papers that apparently referred to certain property in hungary to which heda might become entitled but about these i did not trouble  replacing these documents in a safe inner pocket in the lining of my waistcoat i went into our room and woke up anscombe who was sleeping soundly a fact that caused an unreasonable irritation in my mind  when at length he was thoroughly aroused i said to him  you are in lucks way my friend  marnham is dead  oh poor heda he exclaimed she loved him  it will half break her heart  if it breaks half of her heart i replied it will mend the other half for now her filial affection cant force her to marry rodd and that is where you are in lucks way  then i told him all the story  was he murdered or did he commit suicide he asked when i had finished  i dont know and to tell you the truth i dont want to know nor will you if you are wise unless knowledge is forced upon you  it is enough that he is dead and for his daughters sake the less the circumstances of his end are examined into the better  poor heda he said again who will tell her  i cant  you found him allan  i expected that job would be my share of the business anscombe well the sooner it is over the better  now dress yourself and come on to the stoep  then i left him and next minute met hedas fat halfbreed maid a stupid but good sort of a woman who was called kaatje emerging from her mistresss room with a jug to fetch hot water i suppose  kaatje i said go back and tell the missie heda that i want to speak to her as soon as i can  never mind the hot water but stop and help her to dress  she began to grumble a little in a goodnatured way but something in my eye stopped her and she went back into the room ten minutes later heda was by my side  what is it mr quatermain she asked  i feel sure that something dreadful has happened  it has my dear i answered that is if death is dreadful your father died last night  oh she said oh and sank back on to the seat  bear up i went on we must all die one day and he had reached the full age of man  but i loved him she moaned  he had many faults i know still i loved him  it is the lot of life heda that we should lose what we love be thankful therefore that you have some one left to love  yes thank god thats true  if it had been himno its wicked to say that  then i told her the story and while i was doing so anscombe joined us walking by aid of his stick  also i showed them both marnhams letter to me and the will but the other bit of paper i did not speak of or show  she sat very pale and quiet and listened till i had done  then she said  i should like to see him  perhaps it is as well i answered  if you can bear it come at once and do you come also anscombe  we went to the room anscombe and heda holding each other by the hand  i unlocked the door and entering threw open a shutter there sat the dead man as i had left him only his head had fallen over a little  she gazed at him trembling then advanced and kissed his cold forehead muttering  goodbye father  oh goodbye father  a thought struck me and i asked  is there any place here where your father locked up things as i have shown you you are his heiress and if so it might be as well in this house that you should possess yourself of his property  there is a safe in the corner she answered of which he always kept the key in his trouser pocket  then with your leave i will open it in your presence  going to the dead man i searched his pocket and found in it a bunch of keys  these i withdrew and went to the safe over which a skin rug was thrown  i unlocked it easily enough  within were two bags of gold each marked 100 also another larger bag marked my wifes jewelry  for heda also some papers and a miniature of the lady whose portrait hung in the sittingroom also some loose gold  now who will take charge of these i asked  i do not think it safe to leave them here  you of course said anscombe while heda nodded  so with a groan i consigned all these valuables to my capacious pockets  then i locked up the empty safe replaced the keys where i had found them on marnham fastened the shutter and left the room with anscombe waiting for a while outside till heda joined us sobbing a little  after this we got something to eat insisting on heda doing the same  on leaving the table i saw a curious sight namely the patients whom rodd was attending in the little hospital of which i have spoken departing towards the bushveld those of them who could walk well and the attendants assisting the others  they were already some distance away too far indeed for me to follow as i did not wish to leave the house  the incident filled me with suspicion and i went round to the back to make inquiries but could find no one  as i passed the hospital door however i heard a voice calling in sisutu  do not leave me behind my brothers  i entered and saw the man on whom rodd had operated the day of our arrival lying in bed and quite alone  i asked him where the others had gone  at first he would not answer but when i pretended to leave him called out that it was back to their own country  finally to cut the story short i extracted from him that they had left because they had news that the temple was going to be attacked by sekukuni and did not wish to be here when i and anscombe were killed  how the news reached him he refused or could not say nor did he seem to know anything of the death of marnham  when i pressed him on the former point he only groaned and cried for water for he was in pain and thirsty  i asked him who had told sekukunis people to kill us but he refused to speak  very well i said then you shall lie here alone and die of thirst and again i turned towards the door  at this he cried out  i will tell you  it was the white medicineman who lives here he who cut me open  he arranged it all a few days ago because he hates you  last night he rode to tell the impi when to come  when is it to come i asked holding the jug of water towards him  tonight at the rising of the moon so that it may get far away before the dawn  my people are thirsty for your blood and for that of the other white chief because you killed so many of them by the river  the others they will not harm  how did you learn all this i asked him again but without result for he became incoherent and only muttered something about being left alone because the others could not carry him so i gave him some water after which he fell asleep or pretended to do so and i left him wondering whether he was delirious or spoke truth  as i passed the stables i saw that my own horse was there for in this district horses are always shut up at night to keep them from catching sickness but that the four beasts that had brought heda from natal in the cape cart were gone though it was evident that they had been kraaled here till within an hour or two  i threw my horse a bundle of forage and returned to the house by the back entrance  the kitchen was empty but crouched by the door of marnhams room sat the boy who had found him dead  he had been attached to his master and seemed half dazed  i asked him where the other servants were to which he replied that they had all run away  then i asked him where the horses were  he answered that the baas rodd had ordered them to be turned out before he rode off that morning  i bade him accompany me to the stoep as i dared not let him out of my sight which he did unwillingly enough  there i found anscombe and heda  they were seated side by side upon the couch  tears were running down her face and he looking very troubled held her by the hand  somehow that picture of heda has always remained fixed in my mind  sorrow becomes some women and she was one of them  her beautiful dark grey eyes did not grow red with weeping the tears just welled up in them and fell like dewdrops from the heart of a flower  she sat very upright and very still as he did looking straight in front of her while a ray of sunshine falling on her head showed the chestnuthued lights in her waving hair of which she had a great abundance  indeed the pair of them thus seated side by side reminded me of an engraving i had seen somewhere of the statues of a husband and wife in an old egyptian tomb  with just such a look did the woman of thousands of years ago sit gazing in patient hope into the darkness of the future  death had made her sad but it was gone by and the little wistful smile about her lips seemed to suggest that in this darkness her sorrowful eyes already saw the stirring of the new life to be  moreover was not the man she loved the companion of her hopes as he had been of her woes such was the fanciful thought that sprang up in my mind even in the midst of those great anxieties like a single flower in a stony wilderness of thorns or one star on the blackness of the night  in a moment it had gone and i was telling them of what i had learned  they listened till i had finished  then anscombe said slowly  two of us cant hold this house against an impi  we must get out of it  both your conclusions seem quite sound i remarked that is if yonder old kaffir is telling the truth  but the question ishow  we cant all three of us ride on one nag as you are still a cripple  there is the cape cart suggested heda  yes but the horses have been turned out and i dont know where to look for them  nor dare i send that boy alone for probably he would bolt like the others  i think that you had better get on my horse and ride for it leaving us to take our chance  i daresay the whole thing is a lie and that we shall be in no danger i added by way of softening the suggestion  that i will never do she replied with so much quiet conviction that i saw it was useless to pursue the argument  i thought for a moment as the position was very difficult  the boy was not to be trusted and if i went with him i should be leaving these two alone and in anscombes state almost defenceless  still it seemed as though i must  just then i looked up and there at the garden gate saw anscombes driver footsack the man whom i had despatched to pretoria to fetch his oxen  i noted that he looked frightened and was breathless for his eyes started out of his head  also his hat was gone and he bled a little from his face  seeing us he ran up the path and sat down as though he were tired  where are the oxen i asked  oh baas he answered the basutos have got them  we heard from an old black woman that sekukuni had an impi out so we waited on the top of that hill about an hours ride away to see if it was true  then suddenly the doctor baas appeared riding and i ran out and asked him if it were safe to go on  he knew me again and answered  yes quite safe for have i not just ridden this road without meeting so much as a black child  go on man your masters will be glad to have their oxen as they wish to trek or will by nightfall  then he laughed and rode away  so we went on driving the oxen  but when we came to the belt of thorns at the bottom of the hill we found that the doctor baas had either lied to us or he had not seen  for there suddenly the tall grass on either side of the path grew spears yes everywhere were spears  in a minute the two voorloopers were assegaied  as for me i ran forward not back since the kaffirs were behind me across the path baas driving off the oxen  they sprang at me but i jumped this way and that way and avoided them  then they threw assegaissee one of them cut my cheek but the rest missed  they had guns in their hands also but none shot  i think they did not wish to make a noise  only one of them shouted after me  tell macumazahn that we are going to call on him tonight when he cannot see to shoot  we have a message for him from our brothers whom he killed at the drift of the oliphants river  then i ran on here without stopping but i saw no more kaffirs that is all baas  now i did not delay to crossexamine the man or to sift the true from the false in his story since it was clear to me that he had run into a company of basutos or rather been beguiled thereto by rodd and lost our cattle also his companions who were either killed as he said or had escaped some other way  listen man i said  i am going to fetch some horses  do you stay here and help the missie to pack the cart and make the harness ready  if you disobey me or run away then i will find you and you will never run again  do you understand  he vowed that he did and went to get some water while i explained everything to anscombe and heda pointing out that all the information we could gather seemed to show that no attack was to be made upon the house before nightfall and that therefore we had the day before us  as this was so i proposed to go to look for the horses myself since otherwise i was sure we should never find them  meanwhile heda must pack and make ready the cart with the help of footsack anscombe superintending everything as he could very well do since he was now able to walk leaning on a stick  of course neither of them liked my leaving them but in view of our necessities they raised no objection  so off i went taking the boy with me  he did not want to go being as i have said half dazed with grief or fear or both but when i had pointed out to him clearly that i was quite prepared to shoot him if he played tricks he changed his mind  having saddled my mare that was now fresh and fat we started the boy guiding me to a certain kloof at the foot of which there was a small plain of good grass where he said the horses were accustomed to graze  here sure enough we found two of them and as they had been turned out with their headstalls on were able to tie them to trees with the riems which were attached to the headstalls  but the others were not there and as two horses could not drag a heavy cape cart i was obliged to continue the search  oh what a hunt those beasts gave me  finding themselves free for as rodds object was that they should stray he had ordered the stableboy not to kneelhalter them after filling themselves with grass they had started off for the farm where they were bred which it seemed was about fifty miles away grazing as they went  of course i did not know this at the time so for several hours i rode up and down the neighbouring kloofs as the ground was too hard for me to hope to follow them by their spoor  it occurred to me to ask the boy where the horses came from a question that he happened to be able to answer as he had brought them home when they were bought the year before  having learned in what direction the place lay i rode for it at an angle or rather for the path that led to it making the boy run alongside holding to my stirrup leather  about three oclock in the afternoon i struck this path or rather track at a point ten or twelve miles away from the temple and there just mounting a rise met the two horses quietly walking towards me  had i been a quarter of an hour later they would have passed and vanished into a sea of thornveld  we caught them without trouble and once more headed homewards leading them by their riems  reaching the glade where the other two were tied up we collected them also and returned to the house where we arrived at five oclock  as everything seemed quiet i put my mare into the stable slipped its bit and gave it some forage  then i went round the house and to my great joy found anscombe and heda waiting anxiously but with nothing to report and with them footsack  very hastily i swallowed some food while footsack inspanned the horses  in a quarter of an hour all was ready then suddenly in an inconsequent female fashion heda developed a dislike to leaving her father unburied  my dear young lady i said it seems that you must choose between that and our all stopping to be buried with him  she saw the point and compromised upon paying him a visit of farewell which i left her to do in anscombes company while i fetched my mare  to tell the truth i felt as though i had seen enough of the unhappy marnham and not for 50 would i have entered that room again  as i passed the door of the hospital leading my horse i heard the old kaffir screaming within and sent the boy who was with me to find out what was the matter with him  that was the last i saw of either of them or ever shall see this side of kingdom come  i wonder what became of them  when i got back to the front of the house i found the cart standing ready at the gate footsack at the head of the horses and heda with anscombe at her side  it had been neatly packed during the day by heda with such of her and our belongings as it would hold including our arms and ammunition  the rest of course we were obliged to abandon  also there were two baskets full of food some bottles of brandy and a good supply of overcoats and wraps  i told footsack to take the reins as i knew him to be a good driver and helped anscombe to a seat at his side while heda and the maid kaatje got in behind in order to balance the vehicle  i determined to ride at any rate for the present  which way baas asked footsack  down to the granite stream where the wagon stands i answered  that will be through the yellowwood swamp  cant we take the other road to pilgrims rest and lydenburg or to barberton asked anscombe in a vague way and as i thought rather nervously  no i answered that is unless you wish to meet those basutos who stole the oxen and dr rodd returning if he means to return  oh let us go through the yellowwood exclaimed heda who i think would rather have met the devil than dr rodd  ah if i had but known that we were heading straight for that person sooner would i have faced the basutos twice over  but i did what seemed wisest thinking that he would be sure to return with another doctor or a magistrate by the shorter and easier path which he had followed in the morning  it just shows once more how useless are all our care and foresight or how strong is fate have it which way you will  so we started down the slope and i riding behind noted poor heda staring at the marble house which grew ever more beautiful as it receded and the roughness of its building disappeared especially at that part of it which hid the body of her old scamp of a father whom still she loved  we came down to the glen and once more saw the bones of the blue wildebeeste that we had shotoh years and years ago or so it seemed  then we struck out for the granite stream  before we reached the patch of yellowwood forest where i knew that the cart must travel very slowly because of the trees and the swampy nature of the ground i pushed on ahead to reconnoitre fearing lest there might be basutos hidden in this cover  riding straight through it i went as far as the deserted wagon at a sharp canter seeing nothing and no one  once indeed towards the end of the wood where it was more dense i thought that i heard a man cough and peered about me through the gloom for here the rays of the sun which was getting low in the heavens scarcely penetrated  as i could perceive no one i came to the conclusion that i must have been deceived by my fancy  or perhaps it was some baboon that coughed though it was strange that a baboon should have come to such a lowlying spot where there was nothing for it to eat  the place was eerie so much so that i bethought me of tales of the ghosts whereby it was supposed to be haunted  also oddly enough of anscombes presentiment which he had fulfilled by killing a basuto  look there lay his grinning skull with some patches of hair still on it dragged away from the rest of the bones by a hyena  i cantered on down the slope beyond the wood and through the scattered thorns to the stream on the banks of which the wagon should be  it had gone and by the freshness of the trail within an hour or two  a moments reflection told me what had happened  having stolen our oxen the basutos drove them to the wagon inspanned them and departed with their loot  on the whole i was glad to see this since it suggested that they had retired towards their own country leaving our road open  turning my horse i rode back again to meet the cart  as i reached the edge of the wood at the top of the slope i heard a whistle blown a very shrill whistle of which the sound would travel for a mile or two on that still air  also i heard the sound of mens voices in altercation and caught words such aslet go or by heaven then a furious laugh and other words which seemed to bein five minutes the kaffirs will be here  in ten you will be dead  can i help it if they kill you after i have warned you to turn back  then a womans scream  rodds voice anscombes voice and kaatjes screamnot hedas but kaatjes  then as i rode furiously round the last patch of intervening trees the sound of a pistol shot  i was out of them now and saw everything  there was the cart on the further side of a swamp the horses were standing still and snorting  holding the rein of one of the leaders was rodd whose horse also stood close by  he was rocking on his feet and as i leapt from my mare and ran up i saw his face  it was horrible full of pain and devilish rage with his disengaged hand he pointed to anscombe sitting in the cart and grasping a pistol that still smoked  youve killed me he said in a hoarse choking voice for he was shot through the lung to get her and he waved his hand towards heda who was peering at him between the heads of the two men  you are a murderer as her father was and as david was before you  well i hope you wont keep her long  i hope youll die as i do and break her false heart you damned thief  all of this he said in a slow voice pausing between the words and speaking ever more thickly as the blood from his wound choked him  then of a sudden it burst in a stream from his lips and still pointing with an accusing finger at anscombe he fell backwards into the slimy pool behind him and there vanished without a struggle  so horrible was the sight that the driver footsack leapt from the cart uttering a kind of low howl ran to rodds horse scrambled into the saddle and galloped off striking it with his fist where to i do not know  anscombe put his hand before his eyes heda sank down on the seat in a heap and the coloured woman kaatje beat her breast and said something in dutch about being accursed or bewitched  luckily i kept my wits and went to the horses heads fearing lest they should start and drag the trap into the pool  wake up i said  that fellow has only got what he deserved and you were quite right to shoot him  i am glad you think so answered anscombe absently  it was so like murder  dont you remember i told you i should kill a man in this place and about a woman  i remember nothing i answered boldly except that if we stop here much longer we shall have those basutos on us  that brute was whistling to them and holding the horses till they came to kill us  pull yourself together take the reins and follow me  he obeyed being a skilful whip enough who as he informed me afterwards had been accustomed to drive a fourinhand at home mounting my horse which stood by i guided the cart out of the wood and down the slope beyond till at length we came to our old outspan where i proposed to turn on to the wagon track which ran to pilgrims rest  i say proposed for when i looked up it i perceived about five hundred yards away a number of armed basutos running towards us the red light of the sunset shining on their spears  evidently the scout or spy to whom rodd whistled had called them out of their ambush which they had set for us on the pilgrims rest road in order that they might catch us if we tried to escape that way  now there was only one thing to be done  at this spot a native track ran across the little stream and up a steepish slope beyond  on the first occasion of our outspanning here i had the curiosity to mount this slope reflecting as i did so that although rough it would be quite practicable for a wagon  at the top of it i found a wide flat plain almost highveld for the bushes were very few across which the track ran on  on subsequent inquiry i discovered that it was one used by the swazis and other natives when they made their raids upon the basutos or when bodies of them went to work in the mines  follow me i shouted and crossed the stream which was shallow between the little pools then led the way up the stony slope the four horses negotiated it very well and the cape cart being splendidly built took no harm  at the top i looked back and saw that the basutos were following us  flog the horses i cried to anscombe and off we went at a hand gallop along the native track the cart swaying and bumping upon the rough veld  the sun was setting now in half an hour it would be quite dark  could we keep ahead of them for that half hour    chapter ix     flight      the sun sank in a blaze of glory  looking back by the light of its last rays i saw a single native silhouetted against the red sky  he was standing on a mound that we had passed a mile or more behind us doubtless waiting for his companions whom he had outrun  so they had not given up the chase  what was to be done  once it was completely dark we could not go on  we should lose our way the horses would get into antbear holes and break their legs  perhaps we might become bogged in some hollow therefore we must wait till the moon rose which would not be for a couple of hours  meanwhile those accursed basutos would be following us even in the dark  this would hamper them no doubt but they would keep the path with which they were probably familiar beneath their feet and what is more the ground being soft with recent rain they could feel the wheel spoor with their fingers  i looked about me  just here another track started off in a norwesterly direction from that which we were following  perhaps it ran to lydenburg i do not know  to our left not more than a hundred yards or so away the higher veld came to an end and sloped in an easterly direction down to bushland below  should i take the westerly road which ran over a great plain no for then we might be seen for miles and cut off  moreover even if we escaped the natives was it desirable we should plunge into civilization just now and tell all our story as in that case we must do  rodds death was quite justified but it had happened on transvaal territory and would require a deal of explanation  fortunately there was no witness of it except ourselves  yes there was thoughthe driver footsack if he had got away which being mounted would seem probable a man who for my part i would not trust for a moment  it would be an ugly thing to see anscombe in the dock charged with murder and possibly myself with footsack giving evidence against us before a boer jury who might be hard on englishmen  also there was the body with a bullet in it  suddenly there came into my mind a recollection of the very vivid dream of zikali which had visited me and i reflected that in zululand there would be little need to trouble about the death of rodd  but zululand was a long way off and if we were to avoid the transvaal there was only one way of going there namely through swaziland  well among the swazis we should be quite safe from the basutos since the two peoples were at fierce enmity  moreover i knew the swazi chiefs and king very well having traded there and could explain that i came to collect debts owing to me  there was another difficulty  i had heard that the trouble between the english government and cetewayo the zulu king was coming to a head and that the high commissioner sir bartle frere talked of presenting him with an ultimatum  it would be awkward if this arrived while we were in the country though even so being on such friendly terms with the zulus of all classes i did not think that i or any with me would run great risks  all these thoughts rushed through my brain while i considered what to do  at the moment it was useless to ask the opinion of the others who were but children in native matters  i and i alone must take the responsibility and act praying that i might do so aright  another moment and i had made up my mind  signing to anscombe to follow me i rode about a hundred yards or more down the norwesterly path  then i turned sharply along a rather stony ridge of ground the cart following me all the time and came back across our own track my object being of course to puzzle any kaffirs who might spoor us  now we were on the edge of the gentle slope that led down to the bushveld  over this i rode towards a deserted cattle kraal built of stones in the rich soil of which grew sundry trees doubtless one of those which had been abandoned when mosilikatze swept all this country on his way north about the year 1838  the way to it was easy since the surrounding stones had been collected to build the kraal generations before  as we passed over the edge of the slope in the gathering gloom heda cried  look and pointed in the direction whence we came  far away a sheet of flame shot upwards  the house is burning she exclaimed  yes i said it can be nothing else adding to myself a good job too for now there will be no postmortem on old marnham  who fired the place i never learnt  it may have been the basutos or marnhams bodyservant or footsack or a spark from the kitchen fire  at any rate it blazed merrily enough notwithstanding the marble walls as a woodlined and thatched building of course would do  on the whole i suspected the boy who may very well have feared lest he should be accused of having had a hand in his masters death  at least it was gone and watching the distant flames i bethought me that with it went all hedas past  twentyfour hours before her father was alive the bondservant of rodd and a criminal  now he was ashes and rodd was dead while she and the man she loved were free with all the world before them  i wished that i could have added that they were safe  afterwards she told me that much the same ideas passed through her own mind  dismounting i led the horses into the old kraal through the gap in the wall which once had been the gateway  it was a large kraal that probably in bygone days had held the cattle of some forgotten head chief whose town would have stood on the brow of the rise so large that notwithstanding the trees i have mentioned there was plenty of room for the cart and horses in its centre  moreover on such soil the grass grew so richly that after we had slipped their bits the horses were able to fill themselves without being unharnessed  also a little stream from a spring on the brow ran within a few yards whence with the help of kaatje a strong woman i watered them with the bucket which hung underneath the cart  next we drank ourselves and ate some food in the darkness that was now complete  then leaving kaatje to stand at the head of the horses in case they should attempt any sudden movement i climbed into the cart and we discussed things in low whispers  it was a curious debate in that intense gloom which close as our faces were together prevented us from seeing anything of each other except once when a sudden flare of summer lightning revealed them white and unnatural as those of ghosts  on our present dangers i did not dwell putting them aside lightly though i knew they were not light  but of the alternative as to whether we should try to escape to lydenburg and civilization or to zululand and savagery i felt it to be my duty to speak  to put it plainly said anscombe in his slow way when i had finished you mean that in the transvaal i might be tried as a murderer and perhaps convicted whereas if we vanish into zululand the probability is that this would not happen  i mean i whispered back that we might both be tried and if footsack should chance to appear and give evidence find ourselves in an awkward position  also there is another witnesskaatje and for the matter of that heda herself  of course her evidence would be in our favour but to make it understood by a jury she would have to explain a great deal of which she might prefer not to speak  further at the best the whole business would get into the english papers which you and your relatives might think disagreeable especially in view of the fact that as i understand you and heda intend to marry  still i think that i would rather face it out he said in his outspoken way even if it should mean that i could never return to england  after all of what have i to be afraid  i shot this scoundrel because i was obliged to do so  yes but it is of this that you may have to convince a jury who might possibly find a motive in rodds past and your present relationship to the same lady  but what has she to say  i have to say whispered heda that for myself i care nothing but that i could never bear to see all these stories about my poor father raked up  also there is maurice to be considered it would be terrible if they put him in prisonor worse  let us go to zululand mr quatermain and afterwards get out of africa dont you agree maurice  what does mr quatermain think himself he answered  he is the oldest and by far the wisest of us and i will be guided by him  now i considered and said  there is such a thing as flying from present troubles to others that may be worse the ills we know not of  zululand is disturbed  if war broke out there we might all be killed  on the other hand we might not and it ought to be possible for you to work up to delagoa bay and there get some ship home that is if you wish to keep clear of british law  i cannot do so as i must stay in africa  nor can i take the responsibility of settling what you are to do since if things went wrong it would be on my head  however if you decide for the transvaal or natal and we escape i must tell you that i shall go to the first magistrate we find and make a full deposition of all that has happened  it is not possible for me to live with the charge of having been concerned in the shooting of a white man hanging over me that might be brought up at any time perhaps when no one was left in the country to give evidence on my behalf for then even if i were acquitted my name would always be tarnished  in zululand on the other hand there are no magistrates before whom i could depose and if this business should come out i can always say that we went there to escape from the basutos  now i am going to get down to see if the horses are all right  do you two talk the thing over and make up your minds  whatever you agree on i shall accept and do my best to carry through  then without waiting for an answer i slipped from the cart  having examined the horses who were cropping all the grass within reach of them i crept to the wall of the kraal so as to be quite out of earshot  the night was now pitch dark dark as it only knows how to be in africa  more a thunderstorm was coming up of which that flash of sheet lightning had been a presage  the air was electric  from the vast bushclad valley beneath us came a wild moaning sound caused i suppose by wind among the trees though here i felt none far away a sudden spear of lightning stabbed the sky  the brooding trouble of nature spread to my own heart  i was afraid and not of our present dangers though these were real enough so real that in a few hours we might all be dead  to dangers i was accustomed for years they had been my daily food by day and by night and as i think i have said elsewhere i am a fatalist one who knows full well that when god wants me he will take me that is if he can want such a poor erring creature  nothing that i did or left undone could postpone or hasten his summons for a moment though of course i knew it to be my duty to fight against death and to avoid it for as long as i might because that i should do so was a portion of his plan for we are all part of a great pattern and the continuance or cessation of our lives reacts upon other lives and therefore life is a trust  no it was of greater things that i felt afraid things terrible and imminent which i could not grasp and much less understand  i understand them now but who would have guessed that on the issue of that whispered colloquy in the cart behind me depended the fate of a people and many thousands of lives  as i was to learn in days to come if anscombe and heda had determined upon heading for the transvaal there would as i believe have been no zulu war which in its turn meant that there would have been no boer rebellion and that the mysterious course of history would have been changed  i shook myself together and returned to the cart  well i whispered but there was no answer  a moment later there came another flash of lightning  there said heda how many do you make it  ninetyeight he answered  i counted ninetynine she said but anyway it was within the hundred  mr quatermain we will go to zululand if you please if you will show us the way there  right  i answered but might i ask what that has to do with your both counting a hundred  only this she said we could not make up our minds  maurice was for the transvaal i was for zululand  so you see we agreed that if another flash came before we counted a hundred we would go to zululand and if it didnt to pretoria  a very good way of settling wasnt it  excellent i replied quite excellent for those who could think of such a thing  as a matter of fact i dont know which of them thought of it because i never inquired  but i did remember afterwards how anscombe had tossed with a lucky penny when it was a question whether we should or should not run for the wagon during our difficulty by the oliphants river also when i asked him the reason for this strange proceeding he answered that providence might inhabit a penny as well as anything else and that he wished to give iti mean providencea chance  how much more then he may have argued could it inhabit a flash of lightning which has always been considered a divine manifestation from the time of the roman jove and no doubt far before him  forty or fifty generations ago which is not long our ancestors set great store by the behaviour of lightning and thunder and doubtless the instinct is still in our blood in the same way that all our existing superstitions about the moon come down to us from the time when our forefathers worshipped her  they did this for tens of hundreds or thousands of years and can we expect a few coatings of the veneer that we politely call civilization which after all is only one of our conventions that vanish in any human stress such as war to kill out the human impulse it seems to hide  i do not know though i have my own opinion and probably these young people never reasoned the matter out  they just acted on an intuition as ancient as that which had attracted them to each other namely a desire to consult the ruling fates by omens or symbols  or perhaps anscombe thought that as his experience with the penny had proved so successful he would give providence another chance  if so it took it and no mistake  confound it i dont know what he thought i only dwell on the matter because of the great results which followed this consultation of the sybilline books of heaven  as it happened my speculations if i really indulged in any at that time were suddenly extinguished by the bursting of the storm  it was of the usual character short but very violent of a sudden the sky became alive with lightnings and the atmosphere with the roar of winds  one flash struck a tree quite near the kraal and i saw that tree seem to melt in its fiery embrace while about where it had been rose a column of dust from the ground beneath  the horses were so frightened that luckily they stood quite quiet as i have often known animals to do in such circumstances  then came the rain a torrential rain as i who was out in it holding the horses became painfully aware  it thinned after a while however as the storm rolled away  suddenly in a silence between the tremendous echoes of the passing thunder i thought that i heard voices somewhere on the brow of the slope and as the horses were now quite calm i crept through the trees to that part of the enclosure which i judged to be nearest to them  voices they were sure enough and of the basutos who were pursuing us  what was more they were coming down the slope the top of the old wall reached almost to my chin  taking off my hat i thrust my head forward between two loose stones that i might hear the better  the men were talking together in sisutu  one whom i took to be their captain said to the others  that whiteheaded old jackal macumazahn has given us the slip again  he doubled on his tracks and drove the horses down the hillside to the lower path in the valley  i could feel where the wheels went over the edge  it is so father answered another voice but we shall catch him and the others at the bottom if we get there before the moon rises since they cannot have moved far in this rain and darkness  let me go first and guide you who know every tree and stone upon this slope where i used to herd cattle when i was a child  do so said the captain  i can see nothing now the lightning has gone and were it not that i have sworn to dip my spear in the blood of macumazahn who has fooled us again i would give up the hunt  i think it would be better to give it up in any case said a third voice since it is known throughout the land that no luck has ever come to those who tried to trap the watcherbynight oh he is a leopard who springs and is gone again  how many are the throats in which his fangs have met  leave him alone i say lest our fate should be that of the white doctor in the yellowwood swamp he who set us on this hunt  we have his wagon and his cattle let us be satisfied  i will leave him alone when he sleeps for the last time and not before answered the captain he who shot my brother in the drift the other day  what would sekukuni say if we let him escape to bring the swazis on us  moreover we want that white maiden for a hostage in case the english should attack us again come you who know the road and lead us  there was some disturbance as this man passed to the front  then i heard the line move forward  presently they were going by the wall within a foot or two of me  indeed by illluck just as we were opposite to each other the captain stumbled and fell against the wall  there is an old cattle kraal here he said  what if those white rats have hidden in it  i trembled as i heard the words  if a horse should neigh or make any noise that could be heard above the hiss of the rain i did not dare to move for fear lest i should betray myself  there i stood so close to the kaffirs that i could smell them and hear the rain pattering on their bodies  only very stealthily i drew my hunting knife with my right hand  at that moment the lightning which i thought had quite gone by flashed again for the last time revealing the fat face of the basuto captain within a foot of my own for he was turned towards the wall on which one of his hands rested  moreover the blue and ghastly light revealed mine to him thrust forward between the two stones my eyes glaring at him  the head of a dead man is set upon the wall he cried in terror  it is the ghost of  he got no further for as the last word passed his lips i drove the knife at him with all my strength deep into his throat  he fell back into the arms of his followers and next instant i heard the sound of many feet rushing in terror down the hill what became of him i do not know but if he still lives probably he agrees with his tribesman that macumazahnwatcherbynight or his ghost is a leopard who springs and kills and is gone again also that those who try to trap him meet with no luck i say or his ghostbecause i am sure he thought that i was a spirit of the dead doubtless i must have looked like one with my white raindrowned face appearing there between the stones and made ghastly and livid by the lightning  well they had gone the whole band of them not less than thirty or forty men so i went also back to the cart where i found the others very comfortable indeed beneath the rainproof tilt saying nothing of what had happened of which they were as innocent as babes i took a stiff tot of brandy for i was chilled through by the wet and while waiting for the moon to rise busied myself with getting the bits back into the horses mouthsan awkward job in the dark  at length it appeared in a clear sky for the storm had quite departed and the rain ceased as soon as there was light enough i took the near leader by the bridle and led the cart to the brow of the hill which was not easy under the conditions making kaatje follow with my horse  then as there were no signs of any basutos we started on again i riding about a hundred yards ahead keeping a sharp lookout for a possible ambush  fortunately however the veld was bare and open consisting of long waves of ground  one start i did get thinking that i saw mens heads just on the crest of a wave which turned out to be only a herd of springbuck feeding among the tussocks of grass  i was very glad to see them since their presence assured me that no human being had recently passed that way  all night long we trekked following the kaffir path for as long as i could see it and after that going by my compass  i knew whereabouts the drift of the crocodile river should be as i had crossed it twice before in my life and kept my eyes open for a certain tall koppie which stood within half a mile it on the swazi side of the river  ultimately to my joy i caught sight of this hill faintly outlined against the sky and headed for it  half a mile further on i struck a wagontrack made by boers trekking into swaziland to trade or shoot  then i knew that the drift was straight ahead of us and called to anscombe to flog up the weary horses  we reached the river just before the dawn  to my horror it was very full so full that the drift looked dangerous for it had been swollen by the thunderrain of the previous night  indeed some wandering swazis on the further bank shouted to us that we should be drowned if we tried to cross  which means that the only thing to do is to stay until the water runs down i said to anscombe for the two women tired out were asleep  i suppose so he answered unless those basutos  i looked back up the long slope down which we had come and saw no one  then i raised myself in my stirrups and looked along another track that joined the road just here leading from the bushveld as ours led from the highveld  the sun was rising now dispersing the mist that hung about the trees after the wet searching among these with my eyes presently i perceived the light gleaming upon what i knew must be the points of spears projecting above the level of the ground vapour  those devils are after us by the lower road i said to anscombe adding i heard them pass the old cattle kraal last night  they followed our spoor over the edge of the hill but in the dark lost it among the stones  he whistled and asked what was to be done  that is for you to decide i answered  for my part id rather risk the river than the basutos and i looked at the slumbering heda  can we bolt back the way we came allan  the horses are very spent and we might meet more basutos and again i looked at heda  a hard choice allan  it is wonderful how women complicate everything in life because they are life i suppose  he thought a moment and went on lets try the river  if we fail it will be soon over and it is better to drown than be speared  or be kept alive by savages who hate us i exclaimed with my eyes still fixed upon heda  then i got to business  there were hide riems on the bridles of the leaders  i undid these and knotted their loose ends firmly together  to them i made fast the riem of my own mare slipping a loop i tied in it over my right hand and saying  now i will go first leading the horses  do you drive after me for all you are worth even if they are swept off their feet  i can trust my beast to swim straight and being a mare i hope that the horses will follow her as they have done all night wake up heda and kaatje  he nodded and looking very pale said  heda my dear i am sorry to disturb you but we have to get over a river with a rough bottom so you and kaatje must hang on and sit tight  dont be frightened you are as safe as a church  god forgive him for that lie thought i to myself as having tightened the girths i mounted my mare  then gripping the riem i kicked the beast to a canter anscombe flogging up the team as we swung down the bank to the edge of the foaming torrent on the further side of which the swazis shouted and gesticulated to us to go back  we were in it now for as i had hoped the horses followed the mare without hesitation  for the first twenty yards or so all went well i heading up the stream  then suddenly i felt that the mare was swimming  flog the horses and dont let them turn i shouted to anscombe  ten more yards and i glanced over my shoulder  the team was swimming also and behind them the cart rocked and bobbed like a boat swinging in a heavy sea  there came a strain on the riem the leaders were trying to turn i pulled hard and encouraged them with my voice while anscombe who drove splendidly kept their heads as straight as he could  mercifully they came round again and struck out for the further shore the waterlogged cart floating after them  would it turn over that was the question in my mind  five seconds ten seconds and it was still upright oh it was going  no a fierce back eddy caught it and set it straight again  my mare touched bottom and there was hope  it struggled forward being swept down the stream all the time  now the horses in the cart also found their footing and we were saved  no the wet had caused the knot of one of the riems to slip beneath the strain or perhaps it brokei dont know  feeling the pull slacken the leaders whipped round on to the wheelers there they all stood in a heap their heads and part of their necks above water while the cart floated behind them on its side  kaatje screamed and anscombe flogged  i leapt from my mare and struggled to the leaders the water up to my chin grasping their bits i managed to keep them from turning further but i could do no more and death came very near to us  had it not been for some of those brave swazis on the bank it would have found us every one  but they plunged in eight of them holding each others hands and halfswimming halfwading reached us they got the horses by the head and straightened them out while anscombe plied his whip  a dash forward and the wheels were on the bottom again  three minutes later we were safe on the further bank which my mare had already reached where i lay gasping on my face ejaculating prayers of thankfulness and spitting out muddy water    chapter x     nombe      the swazis shivering for all these people hate cold and shaking themselves like a dog when he comes to shore gathered round examining me  why said one of them an elderly man who seemed to be their leader this is none other than macumazahn watcherbynight the old friend of all us black people  surely the spirits of our fathers have been with us who might have risked our lives to save a boer or a halfbreed the swazis i may explain did not like the boers for reasons they considered sound  yes i said sitting up it is i macumazahn  then why asked the man did you whom all know to be wise show yourself to have suddenly become a fool and he pointed to the raging river  and why i asked do you show yourself a fool by supposing that i whom you know to be none am a fool  look across the water for your answer  he looked and saw the basutos fifty or more of them arriving just too late  who are these he asked  they are the people of sekukuni whom you should know well enough  they have hunted us all night yes and before seeking to murder us also they have stolen our oxen thirtytwo fine oxen which i give to your king if he can take them back  now perhaps you understand why we dared the crocodile river in its rage  at the name of sekukuni the man who it seemed was the captain of some border guards stiffened all over like a terrier which perceives a rat  what he exclaimed do these dirty basuto dogs dare to carry spears so near our country  have they not yet learned their lesson  then he rushed into the water shaking an assegai he had snatched up and shouted  bide a while you fleas from the kaross of sekukuni till i can come across and crack you between my thumb and finger  or at the least wait until macumazahn has time to get his rifle  no put down those guns of yours for every shot you fire i swear that i will cut ten basuto throats when we come to storm your koppies as we shall do ere long  be silent i said and let me speak  then i too called across the river asking where was that fat captain of theirs as i would talk with him  one of the men shouted back that he had stopped behind very sick because of a ghost that he had seen  ah i answered a ghost who pricked him in the throat  well i was that ghost and such are the things that happen to those who would harm macumazahn and his friends  did you not say last night that he is a leopard who leaps out in the dark bites and is gone again  yes the man shouted back and it is true though had we known o macumazahn that you were the ghost hiding in those stones you should never have leapt again  oh that white medicineman who is dead has sent us on a mad errand  so you will think when i come to visit you among your koppies go home and take a message from macumazahn to sekukuni who believes that the english have run away from him  tell him that they will return again and these swazis with them and that then he will cease to live and his town will be burnt and his tribe will no more be a tribe  away now more swiftly than you came since the water by which you thought to trap us is falling and a swazi impi gathers to make an end of every one of you  the man attempted no answer nor did his people so much as fire on us  they turned tail and crept off like a pack of frightened jackalspursued by the mocking of the swazis  still in a way they had the laugh of us seeing that they gave us a terrible fright and stole our wagon and thirtytwo oxen  well a year or two later i helped to pay them back for that fright and even recovered some of the oxen  when they had gone the swazis led us to a kraal about two miles from the river sending on a runner with orders to make huts and food ready for us  it was just as much as we could do to reach it for we were all utterly worn out as were the horses  still we did get there at last the hot sun warming us as we went arrived at the kraal i helped heda and kaatje from the cartthe former could scarcely walk poor dearand into the guest hut which seemed clean where food of a sort and fur karosses were brought to them in which to wrap themselves while their clothes dried  leaving them in charge of two old women i went to see to anscombe who as yet could not do much for himself also to the outspanning of the horses which were put into a cattle kraal where they lay down at once without attempting to eat the green forage which was given to them  after this i gave our goods into the charge of the kraalhead a nice old fellow whom i had never met before and he led anscombe to another hut close to that where the women were  here we drank some maas that is curdled milk ate a little mutton though we were too fatigued to be very hungry and stripping off our wet clothes threw them out into the sun to dry  that was a close shave said anscombe as he wrapped up in the kaross  very i answered  so close that i think you must have been started in life with an extra strong guardian angel well accustomed to native ways  yes he replied and old fellow i believe that on earth he goes by the name of allan quatermain  after this i remember no more for i went to sleep and so remained for about twentyfour hours  this was not wonderful seeing that for two days and nights practically i had not rested during which time i went through much fatigue and many emotions  when at length i did wake up the first thing i saw was anscombe already dressed engaged in cleaning my clothes with a brush from his toilet case  i remember thinking how smart and incongruous that dressingbag made appropriately enough of crocodile hide looked in this kaffir hut with its silvertopped bottles and its ivoryhandled razors  time to get up sir  bath ready sir he said in his jolly drawling voice pointing to a calabash full of hot water  hope you slept as well as i did sir  you appear to have recovered your spirits i remarked as i rose and began to wash myself  yes sir and why not  heda is quite well for i have seen her these swazis are very good people and as kaatje understands their language bring us all we want  our troubles seem to be done with  old marnham is dead and doubtless cremated rodd is dead and let us hope in heaven the basutos have melted away the morning is fine and warm and a whole kid is cooking for breakfast  i wish there were two for i am ravenous i remarked  the horses are getting rested and feeding well though some of their legs have filled and the trap is little the worse for i have walked to look at them or rather hopped leaning on the shoulder of a very sniffy swazi boy  do you know old fellow i believe there never were any basutos also that the venerable marnham and the lurid rodd had no real existence that they were but illusions a prolonged nightmareno more  here is your shirt  i am sorry that i have not had time to wash it but it has cooked well in the sun which being flannel is almost as good  at any rate heda remains i remarked cutting his nonsense short and i suppose she is not a nightmare or a delusion  yes thank god she remains he replied with earnestness  oh allan i thought she must drown in that river and if i had lost her i think i should have gone mad  indeed at the moment i felt myself going mad while i dragged and flogged at those horses  well you didnt lose her and if she had drowned you would have drowned also  so dont talk any more about it  she is safe and now we have got to keep her so for you are not married yet my boy and there are generally more trees in a wood than one can see  still we are alive and well which is more than we had any right to expect and as you say let us thank god for that  then i put on my coat and my boots which anscombe had greased as he had no blacking and crept from the hut  there only a few yards away engaged in setting the breakfast in the shadow of another hut on a tanned hide that served for a tablecloth while kaatje saw to the cooking close by i found heda still a little pale and sorrowful but otherwise quite well and rested  moreover she had managed to dress herself very nicely i suppose by help of spare clothes in the cart and therefore looked as charming as she always did  i think that her perfect manners were one of her greatest attractions  thus on this morning her first thought was to thank me very sweetly for all she was good enough to say i had done for her and anscombe thereby as she put it saving their lives several times over  my dear young lady i answered as roughly as i could dont flatter yourself on that point it was my own life of which i was thinking  but she only smiled and shaking her head in a fascinating way that was peculiar to her remarked that i could not deceive her as i did the kaffirs  after this the solid kaatje brought the food and we breakfasted very heartily or at least i did  now i am not going to set out all the details of our journey through swaziland for though in some ways it was interesting enough also as comfortable as a stay among savages can be for everywhere we were kindly received to do so would be too long and i must get on with my story  at the kings kraal which we did not reach for some days as the absence of roads and the flooded state of the rivers also the need of sparing our horses caused us to travel very slowly i met a boer who i think was concession hunting  he told me that things were really serious in zululand so serious that he thought there was a probability of immediate war between the english and the zulus  he said also that cetewayo the zulu king had sent messengers to stir up the basutos and other tribes against the white men with the result that sekukuni had already made a raid towards pilgrims rest and lydenburg  i expressed surprise and asked innocently if he had done any harm  the boer replied he understood that they had stolen some cattle killed two white men if not more and burnt their house he added however that he was not sure whether the white men had been killed by the kaffirs or by other white men with whom they had quarrelled  there was a rumour to this effect and he understood that the magistrate of barberton had gone with some mounted police and armed natives to investigate the matter  then we parted as having got his concession to which the king umbandine had put his mark when he was drunk on brandy that the boer himself had brought with him as a present he was anxious to be gone before he grew sober and revoked it  indeed he was in so great a hurry that he never stopped to inquire what i was doing in swaziland nor do i think he realized that i was not alone  certainly he was quite unaware that i had been mixed up in these basuto troubles  still his story as to the investigation concerning the deaths of marnham and rodd made me uneasy since i feared lest he should hear something on his journey and put two and two together though as a matter of fact i dont think he ever did either of these things  the swazis told me much the same story as to the brewing zulu storm  in fact an old induna or councillor whom i knew informed me that cetewayo had sent messengers to them asking for their help if it should come to fighting with the white men but that the king and councillors answered that they had always been the queens children which was not strictly true as they were never under english rule and did not wish to bite her feet if she should have to fight with her hands  i replied that i hoped they would always act up to these fine words and changed the subject  now once more the question arose as to whether we should make for natal or press on to zululand  the rumour of coming war suggested that the first would be our better course while the boers story as to the investigation of rodds death pointed the other way  really i did not know which to do and as usual anscombe and heda seemed inclined to leave the decision to me  i think that after all natal would have gained the day had it not been for a singular circumstance not a flash of lightning this time  indeed i had almost made up my mind to risk trouble and inquiry as to rodds death remembering that in natal these two young people could get married which being in loco parentis i thought it desirable they should do as soon as possible if only to ease me of my responsibilities  also thence i could attend to the matter of hedas inheritance and rid myself of her fathers will that already had been somewhat damaged in the crocodile river though not as much as it might have been since i had taken the precaution to enclose it in anscombes sponge bag before we left the house  the circumstance was this on emerging from the cart one morning where i slept to keep an eye upon the valuables for it will be remembered that we had a considerable sum in gold with us also hedas jewels a swazi informed me that a messenger wished to see me  i asked what messenger and whence did he come  he replied that the messenger was a witchdoctoress named nombe and that she came from zululand and said that i knew her father  i bade the man bring her to me wondering who on earth she could be for it is not usual for the zulus to send women as messengers and from whom she came  however i knew exactly what she would be like some hideous old hag smelling horribly of grease and other abominations with a worn snake skin and some human bones tied about her  presently she came escorted by the swazi who was grinning for i think he guessed what i expected to see  i stared and rubbed my eyes thinking that i must still be asleep for instead of a fat old isanusi there appeared a tall and graceful young woman rather lightcoloured with deep and quiet eyes and a by no means illfavoured face remarkable for a fixed and somewhat mysterious smile  she was a witchdoctoress sure enough for she wore in her hair the regulation bladders and about her neck the circlet of baboons teeth also round her middle a girdle from which hung little bags of medicines  she contemplated me gravely and i contemplated her waiting till she should choose to speak  at length having examined me inch by inch she saluted by raising her rounded arm and tapering hand and remarked in a soft full voice  all is as the picture told  i perceive before me the lord macumazahn  i thought this a strange saying seeing that i could not recollect having given my photograph to any one in zululand  you need no magic to tell you that doctoress i remarked but where did you see my picture  in the dust far away she replied  and who showed it to you  one who knew you o macumazahn in the years before i came out of the darkness one named opener of roads and with him another who also knew you in those years one who has gone down to the darkness  now for some occult reason i shrank from asking the name of this one who had gone down to the darkness although i was sure that she was waiting for the question  so i merely remarked without showing surprise  so zikali still lives does he  he should have been dead long ago  you know well that he lives macumazahn for how could he die till his work was accomplished  moreover you will remember that he spoke to you when last moon was but just past her fullin a dream macumazahn  i brought that dream although you did not see me  pish i exclaimed  have done with your talk of dreams  who thinks anything of dreams  you do she replied even more placidly than before you whom that dream has brought hitherwith others  you lie i said rudely  the basutos brought me here  the watcherbynight is pleased to say that i lie so doubtless i do lie she answered her fixed smile deepening a little then she folded her arms across her breast and remained silent  you are a messenger o seer of pictures in the dust and bearer of the cup of dreams i said with sarcasm  who sends a message by your lips for me and what are the words of the message  my lords the spirits spoke the message by the mouth of the master zikali  he sends it on to you by the lips of your servant the doctoress nombe  are you indeed a doctoress being so young i asked for somehow i wished to postpone the hearing of that message  o macumazahn i have heard the call i have felt the pain in my back i have drunk of the black medicine and of the white medicine yes for a whole year i have been visited by the multitude of spirits and seen the shades of those who live and of those who are dead  i have dived into the river and drawn my snake from its mud see its skin is about me now and opening the mantle she wore she showed what looked like the skin of a black mamba fastened round her slender body  i have dwelt in the wilderness alone and listened to its voices  i have sat at the feet of my master the opener of roads and looked down the road and drunk of his wisdom  yes i am in truth a doctoress  well after all this you should be as wise as you are pretty  once before macumazahn you told a maid of my people that she was pretty and she came to no good end though to one that was great  therefore do not say to me that i am pretty though i am glad that you should think so who can compare me with so many whom you have known and she dropped her eyes looking a little shy  it was the first human touch i had seen about her and i was glad to have found a weak spot in her armour  moreover from that moment she was always my friend  as you will nombe  now for your message  my lords the spirits speaking through zikali as one who makes music speak through a pipe of reeds say  never mind what the spirits say  tell me what zikali says i interrupted  so be it macumazahn  these are the words of zikali o watcherbynight the time draws on when the thingwhoshouldneverhavebeenborn will be as though he never had been born whereat he rejoices  but first there is much for him to do and as he told you nearly three hundred moons ago in what must be done you will have your part  of that he will speak to you afterwards  macumazahn you dreamed a dream did you not lying asleep in the house that was built of white stone which now is black with fire  i zikali sent you that dream through the arts of a child of mine who is named nombe she to whom i have given a spirit to guide her feet  you did well to follow it macumazahn for had you tried the other path which would have led you back to the towns of the white men you and those with you must have been killed how it does not matter  now by the mouth of nombe i say to you do not follow the thought that is in your mind as she speaks to you and go to natal since if you do so you and those with you will come to much shame and trouble that to you would be worse than death over the matter of the killing of a certain white doctor in a swamp where grow yellowwood trees  for there in natal you will be taken all of you and sent back to the transvaal to be tried before a man who wears upon his head horses hair stained white  but if you come to zululand this shadow shall pass away from you since great things are about to happen which will cause so small a matter to be forgot  moreover i zikali who do not lie promise this that however great may be their dangers here in zululand those halffledged ones whom you the old nighthawk cover with your wings shall in the end suffer no harm those of whom i spoke to you in your dream the white lord mauriti and the white lady heddana who stretch out their arms one to another  i wait to welcome you here at the black kloof whither my daughter nombe will guide you  cetewayo the king also will welcome you and so will another whose name i do not utter  now choose  i have spoken  having delivered her message nombe stood quite still smiling as before and apparently indifferent as to its effect  how do i know that you come from zikali i asked  you may be but the bait set upon a trap  from somewhere within her robe she produced a knife and handed it to me remarking  the master says you will remember this and by it know that the message comes from him  he bade me add that with it was carved a certain image that once he gave to you at pandas kraal wrapped round with a womans hair which image you still have  i looked at the knife and did remember it for it was one of those of swedish make with a wooden handle the first that i had ever seen in africa  i had made a present of it to zikali when i returned to zululand before the war between the princes  the image too i still possessed  it was that of the woman called mameena who brought about the war and the wrapping which covered it was of the hair that once grew upon her head  the words are zikalis i said returning her the knife but why do you call yourself the child of one who is too old to be a father  the master says that my greatgrandmother was his daughter and that therefore i am his child  now macumazahn i go to eat with my people for i have servants with me  then i must speak with the swazi king for whom i also have a message which i cannot do at present because he is still drunk with the white mans liquor after that i shall be ready to return with you to zululand  i never said that i was going to zululand nombe  yet your heart has gone there already macumazahn and you must follow your heart  does not the image which was carved with the knife you gave hold a white heart in its hand and although it seems to be but a bit of umzimbeete wood is it not alive and bewitched which perhaps is why you could never make up your mind to burn it macumazahn  i wish i had i replied angrily but having thrown this last spear with a flash of her unholy eyes nombe had turned and gone  a clever woman and thoroughly coached thought i  well zikali was never one to suffer fools and doubtless she is another of the pawns whom he uses on his board of policy  oh she or rather he was right my heart was in zululand though not in the way he thought and i longed to see the end of that great game played by a wizard against a despot and his hosts  so we went to zululand because after talking it over we all came to the conclusion that this was the best thing to do especially as there we seemed to be sure of a welcome  for later in the day nombe repeated to anscombe and heda the invitation which she had delivered to me assuring them also that in zululand they would come to no harm  it was curious to watch the meeting between heda and nombe  the doctoress appeared just as we had risen from breakfast and heda turning round came face to face with her  is this your witch mr quatermain she asked me in her vivacious way  why she is different from what i expected quite goodlooking and yes impressive  i am not sure that she does not frighten me a little  what does the inkosikaasi ie the chieftainess say concerning me macumazahn asked nombe  only what i said that you are young who she thought would be old and pretty who she thought would be ugly  to grow old we must first be young macumazahn and in due season all of us will become ugly even the inkosikaasi  but i thought she said also that she feared me  do you know english nombe  nay but i know how to read eyes and the inkosikaasi has eyes that talk  tell her that she has no reason to fear me who would be her friend though i think that she will bring me little luck  it was scarcely necessary so far as heda was concerned but i translated leaving out the last sentence  say to her that i am grateful who have few friends and that i will fear her no more said heda  again i translated whereon nombe stretched out her hand saying  let her not scorn to take it it is clean  it has brought no man to his death here she looked at heda meaningly moreover though she is white and i am black i like herself am of high blood and come of a race of warriors who did nothing small and lastly we are of an age and if she is beautiful i am wise and have gifts great as her own  once more i interpreted for the benefit of anscombe for heda understood zulu well enough although she had pretended not to do so after which the two shook hands to anscombes amusement and my wonder  for i felt this scene to be strained and one that hid or presaged something i did not comprehend  this is the chief she loves said nombe to me studying anscombe with her steady eyes after heda had gone  well he is no common man and brave if idle one too who may grow tall in the world should he live when he has learned to think  but macumazahn if she met you both at the same time why did she not choose you  just now you said you were wise nombe i replied laughing but now i see that like most of your trade you are but a vain boaster  is there a hat upon my head that you cannot see the colour of my hair and is it natural that youth should turn to age  sometimes if the mind is old macumazahn which is why i love the spirits only who are more ancient than the mountains and with them zikali their servant who was young before the zulus were a people or so he says and still year by year gathers wisdom as the bee gathers honey  inspan your horses macumazahn for i have done my business and am ready to start    chapter xi     zikali      ten days had gone by when once more i found myself drawing near to the mouth of the black kloof where dwelt zikali the wizard our journey in zululand had been tedious and uneventful  it seemed to me that we met extraordinarily few people it was as though the place had suddenly become depopulated and i even passed great kraals where there was no one to be seen  i asked nombe what was the meaning of this for she and three silent men she had with her were acting as our guides  once she answered that the people had moved because of lack of food as the season had been one of great scarcity owing to drought and once that they had been summoned to a gathering at the kings kraal near ulundi  at any rate they were not there and the few who did appear stared at us strangely  moreover i noticed that they were not allowed to speak to us also heda was kept in the cart and nombe insisted that the rear canvas curtain should be closed and a blanket fastened behind anscombe who drove evidently with the object that she should not be seen  further on the plea of weariness from the time that we entered zulu territory nombe asked to be allowed to ride in the cart with kaatje and heda her real reason as i was sure being that she might keep a watch on them  lastly we travelled by littlefrequented tracks halting at night in outoftheway places where however we always found food awaiting us doubtless by arrangement  with one man whom i had known in past days and who recognized me i did manage to have a short talk  he asked me what i was doing in zululand at that time  i replied that i was on a visit to zikali whereon he said i should be safer with him than with any one else  our conversation went no further for just then one of nombes servants appeared and made some remark to the man of which i could not catch the meaning whereon he promptly turned and deported leaving me wondering and uneasy  evidently we were being isolated but when i remonstrated with nombe she only answered with her most unfathomable smile  o macumazahn you must ask zikali of all these things  i am no one and know nothing who only do what the master tells me is for your good  i am minded to turn and depart from zululand i said angrily for in this low veld whither you have led us there is fever and the horses will catch sickness or be bitten by the tsetse fly and perish  i cannot say macumazahn who only travel by the road the master pointed out  yet if you will be guided by me you will not try to leave zululand  you mean that i am in a trap nombe  i mean that the country is full of soldiers and that all white men have fled from it  therefore even if you were allowed to pass because the zulus love you macumazahn it might well happen that those with you would stay behind sound asleep macumazahn for which like you i should be sorry  after this i said no more for i knew that she meant to warn me we had entered on this business and must see it through to its end sweet or bitter  as for anscombe and heda their happiness seemed to be complete the novelty of the life charmed them and of its dangers they took no thought being content to leave me in whom they had a blind faith to manage everything  moreover heda who in the joy of her love was beginning to forget the sorrow of her fathers death and the other tragic events through which she had just passed took a great fancy to the young witchdoctoress who conversed with her in zulu a language of which having lived so long in natal heda knew much already  indeed when i suggested to her that to be overtrusting was not wise she fired up and replied that she had been accustomed to natives all her life and could judge them adding that she had every confidence in nombe  after this i held my tongue and said no more of my doubts  what was the use since heda would not listen to them and at that time anscombe was nothing but her echo  so this for me very dull journey continued till at length after being held up for a couple of days by a flooded river where there was nothing to do but sit and smoke as nombe requested me not to make a noise by shooting at the big game that abounded we began to emerge from the bushveld on to the lovely uplands in the neighbourhood of nongoma  leaving these on our right we headed for a place called ceza a natural stronghold consisting of a flat plain on the top of a mountain which plain is surrounded by bush  it is at the foot of this stronghold that the black kloof lies being one of the ravines that run up into the mountain  so thither we came at last  it was drawing towards sunset a tremendous and stormy sunset as we approached the place and lo it looked exactly as it had done when first i saw it more than a score of years before forbidding as the mouth of hell vast and lonesome  there stood the columns of boulders fantastically piled one upon another there grew the sparse trees upon its steep sides mingled with aloes that looked like the shapes of men there was the granite bottom swept almost clean by floods in some dim age and the little stream that flowed along it  there too was the spot where once i had outspanned my wagons on the night when my servants swore that they saw the imikovu or wizardraised spectres floating past them on the air in the shapes of the princes and others who were soon to fall at the battle of the tugela  up it we went i riding and nombe who had descended from the cart that followed walking by my side and watching me  you seem sad macumazahn she said at length  yes nombe i am sad  this place makes me so  is it the place macumazahn or is it the thought of one whom once you met in the place one who is dead  i looked at her pretending not to understand and she went on  i have the gift of vision macumazahn which comes at times to those of my trade and now and again amongst others i have seemed to see the spirit of a certain woman haunting this kloof as though she were waiting for some one  indeed and what may that woman be like i inquired carelessly  as it chances i can see her now gliding backwards in front of you just there and therefore am able to answer your question macumazahn  she is tall and slender beautifully made and lightcoloured for one of us black people  she has large eyes like a buck and those eyes are full of fire that does not come from the sun but from within  her face is tender yet proud oh so proud that she makes me afraid  she wears a cloak of grey fur and about her neck there is a circlet of big blue beads with which her fingers play  a thought comes from her to me  these are the words of the thought i have waited long in this dark place watching by day and night till you the watcherbynight return to meet me here  at length you have come and in this enchanted place my hungry spirit can feed upon your spirit for a while  i thank you for coming who now am no more lonely  fear nothing macumazahn for by a certain kiss i swear to you that till the appointed hour when you become as i am i will be a shield upon your arm and a spear in your hand  such are the words of her thought macumazahn but she has gone away and i hear no more  it was as though your horse rode over her and she passed through you  then like one who wished to answer no questions nombe turned and went back to the cart where she began to talk indifferently with heda for as soon as we entered the kloof her servants had drawn back the curtains and let fall the blanket  as for me i groaned for of course i knew that zikali who was well acquainted with the appearance of mameena had instructed nombe to say all this to me in order to impress my mind for some reason of his own  yet he had done it cleverly for such words as those mameena might well have uttered could her great spirit have need to walk the earth again  was such a thing possible i wondered no it was not possible yet it was true that her atmosphere seemed to cling about this place and that my imagination excited by memory and nombes suggestions seemed to apprehend her presence  as i reflected the horse advanced round the little bend in the evernarrowing cliffs and there in front of me under the gigantic mass of overhanging rock appeared the kraal of zikali surrounded by its reed fence  the gate of the fence was open and beyond it on his stool in front of the large hut sat zikali even at that distance it was impossible to mistake his figure which was like no other that i had known in the world  a broadshouldered dwarf with a huge head deep sunken eyes and snowy hair that hung upon his shoulders the whole frame and face pervaded with an air of great antiquity and yet owing to the plumpness of the flesh and that freshness of skin which is sometimes seen in the aged comparatively younglooking  such was the great wizard zikali known throughout the land for longer than any living man could remember as opener of roads a title that referred to his powers of spiritual vision also as the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn a name given to him by chaka the first and greatest of the zulu kings because of his deformity  there he sat silent impassive staring openeyed at the red ball of the setting sun looking more like some unshapely statue than a man  his silent fiercefaced servants appeared  to me they looked like the same men whom i had seen here three and twenty years before only grown older  indeed i think they were for they greeted me by name and saluted by raising their broad spears  i dismounted and waited while anscombe whose foot was now quite well again helped heda from the cart which was led away by the servants  anscombe who seemed a little oppressed remarked that this was a strange place  yes said heda but it is magnificent  i like it  then her eye fell upon zikali seated before the hut and she turned pale  oh what a terriblelooking man she murmured if he is a man  the maid kaatje saw him also and uttered a little cry  dont be frightened dear said anscombe he is only an old dwarf  i suppose so she exclaimed doubtfully but to me he is like the devil  nombe slid past us  she threw off the kaross she wore and for the first time appeared naked except for the mucha about her middle and her ornaments  down she went on her hands and knees and in this humble posture crept towards zikali  arriving in front of him she touched the ground with her forehead then lifting her right arm gave the salute of makosi to which as a great wizard he was entitled being supposed to be the home of many spirits  so far as i could see he took no notice of her presently she moved and squatted herself down on his right hand while two of his attendants appeared from behind the hut and took their stand between him and its doorway holding their spears raised  about a minute later nombe beckoned to us to approach and we went forward across the courtyard i a little ahead of the others  as we drew near zikali opened his mouth and uttered a loud and terrifying laugh  how well i remembered that laugh which i had first heard at dingaans kraal as a boy after the murder of retief and the boers  see the book called marie by h rider haggard  i begin to think that you are right and that this old gentleman must be the devil said anscombe to heda then lapsed into silence  as i was determined not to speak first i took the opportunity to fill my pipe  zikali who was watching me although all the while he seemed to be staring at the setting sun made a sign one of the servants dashed away and immediately returned bearing a flaming brand which he proffered to me as a pipelighter  then he departed again to bring three carved stools of red wood which he placed for us  i looked at mine and knew it again by the carvings  it was the same on which i had sat when first i met zikali  at length he spoke in his deep slow voice  many years have gone by macumazahn since you made use of that stool  they are cut in notches upon the leg you hold and you may count them if you will  i examined the leg  there were the notches twentytwo or three of them  on the other legs were more notches too numerous to reckon  do not look at those macumazahn for they have nothing to do with you  they tell the years since the first of the house of senzangacona sat upon that stool since chaka sat upon it since dingaan and others sat upon it one mameena among them  well much has happened since it served you for a rest  you have wandered far and seen strange things and lived where others would have died because it was your lot to live of all of which we will talk afterwards  and now when you are grey you have come back here as the opener of roads told you you would do bringing with you new companions you who have the art of making friends even when you are old which is one given to few men  where are those with whom you used to company macumazahn  where are saduko and mameena and the rest  all gone except the thingwhoshouldneverhavebeenborn and again he laughed loudly  and who it seems has never learned when to die i remarked speaking for the first time  just so macumazahn because i cannot die until my work is finished  but thanks be to the spirits of my fathers and to my own that i live on to glut with vengeance the end draws near at last and as i promised you in the dead days you shall have your share in it macumazahn  he paused then continued still staring at the sinking sun which made his remarks about us whom he did not seem to see uncanny  that white man with you is brave and wellborn one who loves fighting i think and the maiden is fair and sweet with a high spirit  she is thinking to herself that i am an old wizard whom if she were not afraid of me she would ask to tell her her fortune  see she understands and starts  well perhaps i will one day  meanwhile here is a little bit of it  she will have five children of whom two will die and one will give her so much trouble that she will wish it had died also  but who their father will be i do not say  nombe my child lead away this white one and her woman to the hut that has been made ready for her for she is weary and would rest  see too that she lacks for nothing which we can give her who is our guest  let the white lord mauriti accompany her to the hut and be shown that next to it in which he and macumazahn will sleep so that he may be sure that she is safe and attend to the horses if he wills there is a place to tether them behind the huts and the men who travelled with you will help him  afterwards when i have spoken with him macumazahn can join them that they may eat before they sleep  these directions i translated to anscombe who went gladly enough with heda for i think they were both afraid of the terrible old dwarf and did not desire his company in the gathering gloom  the sun sinks once more macumazahn he said when they were gone and the air grows chill  come with me now into my hut where the fire burns for i am aged and the cold strikes through me  also there we can be alone  so speaking he turned and crawled into the hut looking like a gigantic whiteheaded beetle as he did so a creature i remembered to which i had once compared him in the past  i followed carrying the historic stool and when he had seated himself on his kaross on the further side of the fire took up my position opposite to him  this fire was fed with some kind of root or wood that gave a thin clear flame with little or no smoke  over it he crouched so closely that his great head seemed to be almost in the flame at which he stared with unblinking eyes as he had done at the sun circumstances which added to his terrifying appearance and made me think of a certain region and its inhabitants  why do you come here macumazahn he asked after studying me for a while through that window of fire  because you brought me zikali partly through your messenger nombe and partly by means of a dream which she says you sent  did i macumazahn  if so i have forgotten it  dreams are as many as gnats by the water they bite us while we sleep but when we wake up we forget them  also it is foolishness to say that one man can send a dream to another  then your messenger lied zikali especially as she added that she brought it  of course she lied macumazahn  is she not my pupil whom i have trained from a child  moreover she lied well it would seem who guessed what sort of a dream you would have when you thought of turning your steps to zululand  why do you play at sticks ie fence with me zikali seeing that neither of us are children  o macumazahn that is where you are mistaken seeing that both of us old though we be and cunning though we think ourselves are nothing but babes in the arms of fate  well well i will tell you the truth since it would be foolish to try to throw dust into such eyes as yours  i knew that you were down in sekukunis country and i was watching youthrough my spies  you have been nowhere during all these years that i was not watching youthrough my spies  for instance that arablooking man named harut whom first you met at a big kraal in a far country was a spy of mine  he has visited me lately and told me much of your doings  no dont ask me of him now who would talk to you of other matters  does harut still live then and has he found a new god in place of the ivory child i interrupted  macumazahn if he did not live how could he visit and speak with me  well i watched you there by the oliphants river where you fought sekukunis people and afterwards in the marble hut where you found the old white man dead in his chair and got the writings that you have in your pocket which concern the maiden heddana also afterwards when the white man your friend killed the doctor who fell into a mud hole and the basutos stole his cattle and wagon  how do you know all these things zikali  have i not told youthrough my spies  was there not a halfbreed driver called footsack and do not the basutos come and go between the black kloof and sekukunis town bearing me tidings  yes zikali and so does the wind and so do the birds  true  o macumazahn i see that you are one who has watched nature and its ways as closely as my spies watch you  so i learned these matters and knew that you were in trouble over the death of these white men and your friends likewise and as you were always dear to me i sent that child nombe to bring you to me thinking from what i knew of you that you would be more likely to follow a woman who is both wise and good to look at than a man who might be neither  i told her to say to you that you and the others would be safer here than in natal at present it seems that you hearkened and came  that is all  yes i hearkened and came  but zikali that is not all for you know well that you sent for me for your own sake not for mine  o macumazahn who can prevent a needle from piercing cloth when it is pushed by a finger like yours  your wits are too sharp for me macumazahn your eyes read through the blanket of cunning with which i would hide my thought  you speak truly  i did send for you for my own sake as well as for yours  i sent for you because i wanted your counsel macumazahn and because cetewayo the king also wants your counsel and i wished to see you before you saw cetewayo  now you have the whole truth  what do you want my counsel about zikali  he leaned forward till his white locks almost seemed to mingle with the thin flame through which he glared at me with eyes that were fiercer than the fire  macumazahn you remember the story that i told you long ago do you not  very well zikali  it was that you hate the house of senzangacona which has given all its kings to zululand  first because you are one of the dwandwe tribe whom the zulus crushed and mocked at  secondly because chaka the lion named you the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn and killed your wives for which crime you brought about the death of chaka  thirdly because you have matched your single wit for many years against all the power of the royal house and yet kept your life in you notably when panda threatened you in my presence at the trial of one who has gone down and you told him to kill you if he dared  now you would prove that you were right by causing your cunning to triumph over the royal house  true quite true o macumazahn  you have a good memory macumazahn especially for anything that has to do with that woman who has gone down  i sent her down but how was she named macumazahn  i forget i forget whose mind being old falls suddenly into black pits of darknesslike her who went down  he paused and we stared at each other through the veil of fire then as i made no answer he went on  oh i remember now she was called mameena was she not a name taken from the wailing of the wind  hark  it is wailing now  i listened it was and i shivered to hear it since but a minute before the night had been quite still  yes the wind moaned and wailed about the rocks of the black kloof  well enough of her  why trouble about the dead when there are so many to be sent to join them  macumazahn the hour is at hand  the fool cetewayo has quarrelled with your people the english and on my counsel  he has sent and killed women or allowed others to do so across the river in natal  his messengers came to me asking what he should do  i answered shall a king of the blood of chaka fear to allow his own wicked ones to be slain because they have stepped across a strip of water and still call himself king of the zulus  so those women were dragged back across the water and killed and now the queens man from the cape asks many things great fines of cattle the giving up of the slayers and that an end should be made of the zulu army which is to lay down its spears and set to hoeing like the old women in the kraals  and if the king refuses what then zikali  then macumazahn the queens man will declare war on the zulus already he gathers his soldiers for the war  will cetewayo refuse zikali  i do not know  his mind swings this way and that like a pole balanced on a rock  the ends of the pole are weighted with much counsel and it hangs so even that if a grasshopper lit on one end or the other it would turn the scale  and do you wish me to be that grasshopper zikali  who else  that is why i brought you to zululand  so you wish me to counsel cetewayo to lie down in the bed that the english have made for him  if he seeks my advice i will do so gladly for so i am sure he will sleep well  why do you mock me macumazahn  i wish you to counsel cetewayo to throw back his word into the teeth of the queens man and to fight the english  and thus bring destruction on the zulus and death to thousands of them and of my own people and in return gain nothing but remorse  do you think me mad or wicked or both that i should do this thing  nay macumazahn you would gain much  i could show you where the kings cattle are hidden  the english will never find them and after the war you might take as many as you chose  but it would be useless for knowing you well i am sure that you would only hand them over to the british government as once you handed over the cattle of bangu being fashioned that way by the greatgreat macumazahn  perhaps i might but then what should i gain zikali  this you would so bring things about that being broken by war the zulu power could never again menace the white men which would be a great and good deed macumazahn  mayhapi am not sure  but of this i am sure that i will not thrust my face into your nest of wasps that the english hornets may steal the honey when they are disturbed  i leave such matters to the queen and those who rule under her  so have done with such talk for you do but waste your breath zikali  it is as i guessed it would be he answered shaking his great head  you are too honest to prosper in the world macumazahn well i must find other means to bring the house of cetewayo to the end that he deserves who has been an evil and a cruel king  all this he said showing neither surprise nor resentment which convinced me of what i had suspected throughout that never for an instant did he believe that i should fall in with his suggestions and try to influence the zulus to declare war  no this talk of his was but a blind there was some deeper scheme at work in his cunning old brain which he was hiding from me  why exactly had he beguiled me to zululand  i could not divine and to ask him would be worse than useless but then and there i made up my mind that i would get away from the black kloof early on the following morning if that were possible  he began to speak of other matters in a low droning voice like a man who converses with himself  sad all of them such as the haunted death of saduko who had betrayed his lord the prince umbelazi because of a woman every circumstance of which seemed to be familiar to him  i made no answer who was waiting for an opportunity to leave the hut and did not care to dwell on these events  he ceased and brooded for a while then said suddenly  you are hungry and would eat macumazahn and i who eat little would sleep for in sleep the multitudes of spirits visit me bringing tidings from afar  well we have spoken together and of that i am glad for who knows when the chance will come again though i think that soon we shall meet at ulundi ulundi where fate spreads its net  what was it i had to say to you  ah i remember  there is one who is always in your thoughts and whom you wish to see one too who wishes to see you  you shall you shall in payment for the trouble you have taken in coming so far to visit a poor old zulu doctor whom as you told me long ago you know to be nothing but a cheat  he paused and why i could not tell i grew weak with fear of i knew not what and bethought me of flight  it is cold in this hut is it not he went on  burn up fire burn up and plunging his hand into a catskin bag of medicines which he wore he drew out some powder which he threw upon the embers that instantly burst into bright flame  look now macumazahn he said look to your right  i looked and oh heaven there before me with outstretched arms and infinite yearning on her face stood mameena mameena as i had last seen her after i gave her the promised kiss that she used to cover her taking of the poison  for five seconds mayhap she stood thus living wonderful but still as death the fierce light showing all  then the flame died down again and she was gone  i turned and next instant was out of the hut pursued by the terrible laughter of zikali    chapter xii     trapped      outside in the cool night air i recovered myself sufficiently at any rate to be able to think and saw at once that the thing was an illusion for which zikali had prepared my mind very carefully by means of the young witchdoctoress nombe  he knew well enough that this remarkable woman mameena had made a deep impression on me nearly a quarter of a century before as she had done upon other men with whom she had been associated  therefore it was probable that she would always be present to my thought since whatever a man forgets he remembers the women who have shown him favour true or false for nature has decreed it thus  moreover this was one to be remembered for herself since she was beautiful and most attractive in her wild way  also she had brought about a great war causing the death of thousands and lastly her end might fairly be called majestic  all these impressions zikali had instructed nombe to revivify by her continual allusions to mameena and lastly by her pretence that she saw her walking in front of me  then when i was tired and hungry in that place which for me was so closely connected with this woman and in his own uncanny company either by mesmerism or through the action of the drug he threw upon the fire he had succeeded in calling up the illusion of her presence to my charmed sight  all this was clear enough what remained obscure was his object  possibly he had none beyond an impish desire to frighten me which is common enough among practitioners of magic in all lands well for a little while he had succeeded although to speak truth i remained uncertain whether in a sense i was not more thrilled and rejoiced than frightened  mameena had never been so ill to look upon and i knew that dead or living i had nothing to fear from her who would have walked through hell fire for my sake would have done anything except perhaps sacrifice her ambition  no even if this were her ghost i should have been glad to see her again  but it was not a ghost it was only a fancy reproduced exactly as my mind had photographed her almost as my eyes last saw her when her kiss was still warm upon my lips  such were my thoughts as i stood outside that hut with the cold perspiration running down my face for to tell the truth my nerves were upset although without reason  so upset were they that when suddenly a silentfooted man appeared out of the darkness i jumped as high as though i had set my foot on a puffadder and until i recognized him by his voice as one of nombes servants who had accompanied us from swaziland felt quite alarmed  as a matter of fact he had only come to tell me that our meal was ready and that the other high white ones were waiting for me  he led me round the fence that encircled zikalis dwellingplace to two huts that stood nearly behind it almost against the face of the rock which overhanging in a curve formed a kind of natural roof above them  i thought they must have been built since i visited the place as i who have a good memory for such things did not remember them  indeed on subsequent examination i found that they were quite new for the poles that formed their uprights were still green and the grass of the thatch was scarcely dry  it looked to me as if they had been specially constructed for our accommodation  in one of these huts that to the right which was allotted to anscombe and myself i found the others waiting for me also the food  it was good of its sort and well cooked and we ate it by the light of some candles that we had with us kaatje serving us yet although a little while before i had been desperately hungry now my appetite seemed to have left me and i made but a poor meal  heda and anscombe also seemed oppressed and ate sparingly  we did not talk much until kaatje had taken away the tin plates and gone to eat her own supper by a fire that burned outside the hut  then heda broke out saying that she was terrified of this place and especially of its master the old dwarf and felt sure that something terrible was going to happen to her  anscombe did his best to calm her and i also told her she had nothing to fear  if there is nothing to fear mr quatermain she answered turning on me why do you look so frightened yourself  by your face you might have seen a ghost  this sudden and singularly accurate thrust for after all i had seen something that looked very like a ghost startled me and before i could invent any soothing and appropriate fib nombe appeared saying that she had come to lead heda to her sleepingplace  after this further conversation was impossible since although nombe knew but few words of english she was a great thoughtreader and i feared to speak of anything secret in her presence  so we all went out of the hut nombe and i drawing back a little to the fire while the lovers said goodnight to each other  nombe i said the inkosikazi heddana is afraid  the rocks of this kloof lie heavy on her heart the face of the opener of roads is fearful to her and his laughter grates upon her ears do you understand  i understand macumazahn and it is as i expected  when you yourself are frightened it is natural that she an untried maiden should be frightened also in this home of spirits  it is men we fear not spirits now when all zululand is boiling like a pot i replied angrily  have it as you will macumazahn she said and at that moment her quiet searching eyes and fixed smile were hateful to me at least you admit that you do fear  well for the lady heddana fear nothing  i sleep across the door of her hut and while i who have learned to love her live i sayfor her fear nothing whatever may chance or whatever you may see or hear  i believe you but nombe you might die  yes i may die but be sure of this that when i die she will be safe and he who loves her also  sleep well macumazahn and do not dream too much of what you heard and saw in zikalis house  then before i could speak she turned and left me  i did not sleep well i slept very badly  to begin with maurice anscombe generally the most cheerful and nonchalant of mortals with a jest for every woe was in a most depressed condition and informed me of it several times while i was getting ready to turn in  he said he thought the place hateful and felt as if people he could not see were looking at him i had the same sensation but did not mention the fact to him  when i told him he was talking stuff he only replied that he could not help it and pointed out that it was not his general habit to be downcast in any danger which was quite true  now he added he was enjoying much the same sensations as he did when first he saw the yellowwood swamp and got the idea into his head that he would kill some one there which happened in due course  do you mean that you think you are going to kill somebody else i asked anxiously  no he answered i think i am going to be killed or something like it probably by that accursed old villain of a witchdoctor who i dont believe is altogether human  others have thought that before now anscombe and to be plain i dont know that he is  he lives too much with the dead to be like other people  and with satan to whom i expect he makes sacrifices  the truth is im afraid of his playing some of his tricks with heda  it is for her i fear not for myself allan  oh why on earth did you come here  because you wished it and it seemed the safest thing to do look here my boy as usual the trouble comes through a woman when a mans singleyou know the rest  you used to be able to laugh at anything but now that you are practically double you cant laugh any more  well thats the common lot of man and youve got to put up with it  adam was pretty jolly in his garden until eve was started but you know what happened afterwards  the rest of his life was a compound of temptation anxiety family troubles remorse hard labour with primitive instruments and a flaming sword behind him  if you had left your eve alone you would have escaped all this  but you see you didnt and as a matter of fact nobody ever does who is worth his salt for nature has arranged it so  you appear to talk with experience allan he retorted blandly by the way that girl nombe when she isnt stargazing or muttering incantations is always trying to explain to heda some tale about you and a lady called mameena  i gather that you were introduced to her in this neighbourhood where nombe says you were in the habit of kissing her in public which sounds an odd kind of a thing to do all of which happened before she nombe was born  she adds according to kaatjes interpretation that you met her again this afternoon which as i understand the young woman has been long dead seems so incomprehensible that i wish you would explain  with reference to heda i said ignoring the rest as unworthy of notice i think you may make your mind easy  zikali knows that she is in my charge and i dont believe that he wants to quarrel with me  still as you are uncomfortable here the best thing to do will be to get away as early as possible tomorrow morning where to we can decide afterwards  and now i am going to sleep so please stop arguing  as i have already hinted my attempts in the sleep line proved a failure for whenever i did drop off i was pursued by bad dreams which resulted from lying down so soon after supper  i heard the cries of desperate men in their mortal agony  i saw a rainswollen river its waters were red with blood  i beheld a vision of one who i knew by his dress to be a zulu king although i could not see his face  he was flying and staggering with weariness as he fled  a great hound followed him  it lifted its head from the spoor it was that of zikali set upon the hounds body zikali who laughed instead of baying  then one whose copper ornaments tinkled as she walked entered beside me whispering into my ear  a quarter of a hundred years have gone by since we talked together in this haunted kloof she seemed to whisper and before we talk again face to face there remain to pass of years  here she ceased though naturally i should have liked to hear the number  but that is just where dreams break down  they tell us only of what we know or can evolve therefrom  of what it is impossible for us to know they tell us nothingat least as a general rule  i woke up with a start and feeling stifled in that hot place and aggravated by the sound of anscombes peaceful breathing threw a coat about me and removing the doorboard crept into the air the night was still the stars shone and at a little distance the embers of the fire still glowed  by it was seated a figure wrapped in a kaross  the end of a piece of wood that the fire had eaten through fell on to the red ashes and flamed up brightly  by its light i saw that the figure was nombes  the eternal smile was still upon her face the smile which suggested a knowledge of hidden things that from moment to moment amused her soul  her lips moved as though she were talking to an invisible companion and from time to time like one who acts upon directions she took a pinch of ashes and blew them either towards hedas hut or ours  yes she did this when all decent young women should have been asleep like one who keeps some unholy midnight assignation  talking with her master zikali or trying to cast spells upon us confound her thought i to myself and very silently crept back into the hut  afterwards it occurred to me that she might have had another motive namely of watching to see that none of us left the huts  the rest of the night went by somehow  once listening with all my ears i thought that i caught the sound of a number of men tramping and of some low word of command but as i heard no more concluded that fancy had deceived me  there i lay puzzling over the situation till my head ached and wondering how we were to get clear of the black kloof and zikali and out of zululand which i gathered was no place for white people at the moment  it seemed to me that the only thing was to make start for dundee on the natal border and for the rest to trust to fortune  if we got into trouble over the death of rodd unpleasant as this would be the matter must be faced out that was all  for even if any witness appeared against us the man had been killed in selfdefence whilst trying to bring about our deaths at the hands of basutos  i could see now that i was foolish not to have taken this line from the first but as i think i have already explained what weighed with me was the terror of involving these young people in a scandal which might shadow all their future lives  also some fate inch by inch had dragged me into zululand fortunately in life there are few mistakes and even worse than mistakes that cannot be repaired if the wish towards reparation is real and earnest  were it otherwise not many of us would escape destruction in one form or another  thus i reflected until at length light flowing faintly through the smokehole of the hut told me that dawn was at hand  seeing it i rose quietly for i did not wish to wake anscombe dressed and left the hut  my object was to find nombe who i hoped would be still sitting by the fire and send her to zikali with a message that i wished to speak with him at once  glancing round me in the grey dawn i saw that she was gone and that as yet no one seemed to be stirring  hearing a horse snort at a little distance i made my way towards the sound and in a little bay of the overhanging cliff discovered the cart and near by our beasts tied up with a plentiful supply of forage  since so far as i could judge in that uncertain light nothing seemed to be wrong with them except weariness for three of them were still lying down i walked on to the gate of the fence which surrounded zikalis big hut proposing to wait there until some one appeared by whom i could send my message  i reached the gate which i tried and found to be fastened on its inner side  then i sat down lit my pipe and waited  it was extraordinarily lonesome in that place at least this was the feeling that came over me  no doubt the sun was up behind the ceza stronghold that i have mentioned which towered high behind me for the sky above grew light with the red rays of its rising but all the vast black kloof with its huge fantastic rocks was still plunged in gloom whereof the shadows seemed to oppress my heart weary as i was with my wakeful night and many anxieties i was horribly nervous also and as it proved not without reason  presently i heard rustlings on the further side of the fence as of people creeping about cautiously and the sound of whispering  then of a sudden the gate was thrown open and through it emerged about a dozen zulu warriors all of them ringed men who instantly surrounded me seated there upon the ground  i looked at them and they looked at me for quite a long while since following my usual rule i determined not to be the first to speak  moreover if they meant to kill me there was no use in speaking  at length their leader an elderly man with thin legs a large stomach and a rather pleasant countenance saluted politely saying  good morning o macumazahn  good morning o captain whose name and business i do not know i answered  the winds know the mountain on which they blow but the mountain does not know the winds which it cannot see he remarked with poetical courtesy a zulu way of saying that more people are acquainted with tom fool than tom fool is aware of  perhaps captain yet the mountain can feel the winds and i might have added smell them for the kloof was close and these kaffirs had not recently bathed  i am named goza and come on an errand from the king o macumazahn  indeed goza and is your errand to cut my throat  not at present macumazahn that is unless you refuse to do what the king wishes  and what does the king wish goza  he wishes macumazahn that you his friend should visit him  which is just what i was on my way to do goza  this was not true but it didnt matter for if a lie in the words of the schoolgirls definition is an abomination to the lord it is a very present help in time of trouble  after we have eaten i and my friends will accompany you to the kings kraal at ulundi  not so macumazahn  the king said nothing about your friends of whom i do not think he has ever heard any more than we have moreover if your friends are white you will do well not to mention them since the order is that all white people in zululand who have not come here by the kings desire are to be killed at once except yourself macumazahn  is it so goza  well as you will have understood i am quite alone here and have no friends  only i did not wish to travel so early  of course we understand that you are quite alone and have no friends is it not so my brothers  yes yes we understand they exclaimed in chorus one of them adding and shall so report to the king  what kind of blankets do you like the plain grey ones or the white ones with the blue stripes i asked desiring to confirm them in this determination  the grey ones are warmer macumazahn and do not show dirt so much answered goza thoughtfully  good i will remember when i have the chance  the promise of macumazahn is known from of old to be as a tree that elephants cannot pull down and white ants will not eat said the sententious goza thereby intimating his belief that some time or other they would receive those blankets  as a matter of fact the survivors of the party and the families of the others did receive them after the war for in dealing with natives i have always made a point of trying to fulfil any promise or engagement made for value received  and now went on goza will the inkosi be pleased to start as we have to travel far today  impossible i replied  before i leave i must eat for who can journey upon yesterdays food  also i must saddle my horse collect what belongs to me and bid farewell to my host zikali  of meat we have plenty with us macumazahn and therefore you will not hunger on the way  your horse and everything that is yours shall be brought after you since were you mounted on that swift beast and minded to escape how could we catch you with our feet and did you please to shoot us with your rifle how could we who have only spears save ourselves from dying  as for the opener of roads his servants have told us that he means to sleep all today that he may talk with spirits in his dreams and therefore it is useless for you to wait to bid him farewell moreover the orders of the king are that we should bring you to him at once  after this for a time there was silence while i sat immovable revolving the situation and the zulus regarded me with a benignant interest  goza took his snuffbox from his ear shook out some into the palm of his hand and after offering it to me in vain inhaled it himself  the orders of the king are sneeze that we should bring you to him alive if possible and if not sneeze dead  choose which you will macumazahn  perhaps you may prefer to go to ulundi dead which wouldah how strong is this snuff it makes me weep like a womansave you the trouble of walking  but if you prefer that we should carry you be so good macumazahn first to write the words which will cause the grey blankets to be delivered to us for we know well that even your bones would desire to keep your promise  is it not a proverb in the land from the time of the slaying of bangu when you gave the cattle you had earned to sadukos wanderers  i listened and an idea occurred to me as perhaps it had to goza  i hear you goza i said and i will start for ulundi on my feetto save you the trouble of carrying me  but as the times are rough and accidents may always happen as too i wish to make sure that you should get those blankets and it may chance that i shall arrive there on my back first i will write words which if they are delivered to the witchdoctoress nombe will sooner or later turn into blankets  write the words quickly macumazahn and they will be delivered said goza  so i drew out my pocketbook and wrote   dear anscombe  there is treachery afoot and i think that zikali is at the bottom of it  i am being carried off to cetewayo at ulundi by a party of armed zulus who will not allow me to communicate with you probably by zikalis orders  you must do the best you can for heda and yourself  escape to natal if you are able  of course i will help if i get the chance but if war is about to break out cetewayo may kill me  i think that you can trust nombe also that zikali does not wish to work you any ill unless he is obliged though i have no doubt that he has trapped us here for some dark purpose of his own  tell him through nombe that if harm comes to you i will kill him if i live and that if i die i will settle the score with him afterwards  god save and bless you both  keep up your courage and use your wits  your friend  a q   i tore out the sheet folded addressed it and presented it to goza remarking that although it seemed to be but paper it really was fourteen blanketsif given at once to nombe  he nodded and handed it to one of his men who departed in the direction of our huts  so thought i to myself nombe knows all about this business which means that it is being worked by zikali  that is why she spoke to me as she did last night  it is time to start macumazahn and i think you told us that you would prefer to do so on your feet said goza looking suggestively at his spear  i am ready i said rising because i must  for a moment i contemplated the door in the kraal fence wondering whether it would be safe to bolt through it and take refuge with zikali no it was not safe since zikali sat there in his hut pulling the strings and probably might refuse to see me  moreover it was likely enough that before i could find him one of those broad spears would find my heart  there was nothing to be done except submit  still i did call out in a loud voice  farewell zikali  i leave you without a present against my will who am being taken by soldiers to visit the king at ulundi  when we meet again i will talk all this matter over with you  there was no answer and as goza took the opportunity to say that he disliked the noise of shouting extremely which sometimes made him do things that he afterwards regretted i became silent then we departed i in the exact centre of that guard of zulus heavyhearted and filled with fears both for myself and those i left behind me  down the black kloof we tramped emerging on the sunlit plain beyond without meeting any one  a couple of miles further on we came to a small stream where goza announced we would halt to eat so we ate of cold toasted meat which one of the men produced from a basket he carried unpalatable food but better than nothing just as we had finished i looked up and saw the soldier to whom my note had been given  he was leading my mare that had been saddled  on it were my large saddlebags packed with my belongings also my thick overcoat mackintosh waterbottle and other articles down to a bag of tobacco a spare pipe and a box of wax matches  moreover the man carried my doublebarrelled express rifle and a shotgun that could be used for ball together with two bags of cartridges  practically nothing belonging to me had been forgotten  i asked him who had collected the things  he replied the doctress nombe had done so and had brought him the horse saddled to carry them  he did not know who saddled the horse as he had seen no one but nombe to whom he had given the writing which she hid away  in answer to further questions he said that nombe had sent me a message  it was  i bid farewell to macumazahn for a little while and wish him good fortune till we meet again  let him not be afraid in the battle for even if he is hurt it will not be to death since those go with him whom he cannot see and protect him with their shields  say to macumazahn that i nombe remember in the morning what i said in the night and that what seems to be quite lost is ofttimes found again  wish him good fortune and tell him i am sorry that i had not time to cause his spare garments to be cleansed with water but that i have been careful to find his little box with the white mans medicines  i could extract nothing more from this soldier who was either very stupid or chose to appear so nor indeed did i dare to put direct questions about the cart and those who travelled in it  soon we marched again for goza would not allow me to ride the horse fearing that i should escape on it  nor would he let me carry either of the guns lest i should make use of them  all day we travelled reaching the nongoma heights in the late afternoon on this beautiful spot we found a kraal situated where afterwards a magistracy was built when we conquered the country whence there is one of the finest views in zululand  there was no one in the kraal except two old women who appeared to be deaf and dumb for all i could get out of them  these aged dames however or others who were hidden had made ready for our arrival since a calf lay skinned and prepared for cooking and by it big gourds filled with kaffir beer and maas or curdled milk  in due course we ate of these provisions and after we had finished i gave goza a stiff tot of brandy of which nombe or perhaps anscombe had thoughtfully sent a bottle with my other baggage  the strong liquor made the old fellow talkative and enabled me to get a good deal of information out of him  thus i learned that certain demands as to which he was rather vague had been made upon cetewayo by the english government and that the king was now considering whether he should accede to them or fight  the great council of the nation was summoned to attend at ulundi within a few days when the matter would be decided meanwhile all the regiments were being gathered or as we should say mobilized an army said goza greater than any that chaka had ever led  i asked him what i had to do with this business that i a peaceful traveller and an old friend of the zulus should be made prisoner and dragged off to ulundi  he replied he did not know who was not in the council of the high ones but he thought that cetewayo the king wished to see me because i was their friend perhaps that he might send me as a messenger to the white people i asked him how the king knew that i was in the country to which he replied that zikali had told him i was coming he did not know how whereon he goza was sent at once to fetch me  i could get no more out of him  i wondered if it would be worth while to make him quite drunk and then attempt to escape on the horse but gave up the idea  to begin with his men were at hand and there was not enough brandy to make them all drunk  also even if i succeeded in winning away here in the heart of zululand it would not help anscombe or heda and i should probably be cut off and killed before i could get out of the country  so i abandoned the plan and went to sleep instead  next morning we left nongoma early in the hope of reaching ulundi that evening if the ivuna and black umfolozi rivers proved fordable  as it chanced although they were high we were able to cross them i seated on the horse which two of the zulus led next we tramped for miles through the terrible bekameezi valley a hot and desolate place which the zulus swear is haunted  so unhealthy is this valley which is the home of large game that whole kraals full of people who have tried to cultivate the rich land have died in it of fever or fled away leaving their crops unreaped  now no man dwells there  after this we climbed a terrible mount to the high land of mahlabatini and having eaten pushed on once more  at length we sighted the great hillencircled plain of ulundi which may be called the cradle of the zulu race as politically speaking it was destined to be its coffin  on the ridge to the west once stood the nobamba kraal where dwelt senzangacona the father of chaka the lion  nearer to the white umfolozi was pandas dwellingplace nodwengu which once i knew so well while on the slope of the hills of the northeast stood the town of ulundi in which cetewayo dwelt bathed in the lights of sunset  indeed it and all the vast plain were red as though with blood red as they were destined to be on the coming day of the last battle of the zulus    chapter xiii     cetewayo      it was dark when at last we reached the ulundi kraal for the growing moon was obscured by clouds  therefore i could see nothing and was only aware by the sound of voices and the continual challenging that we were passing through great numbers of men  at length we were admitted at the eastern gate and i was taken to a hut where i at once flung myself down to sleep being so weary that i could not attempt to eat  next morning as i was finishing my breakfast in the little fenced courtyard of this guesthut goza appeared and said that the king commanded me to be brought to him at once adding that i must speak softly to him as he was very angry  so off we went across the great cattle kraal where a regiment of young men two thousand strong or so were drilling with a fierce intensity which showed they knew that they were out for more than exercise  about the sides of the kraal also stood hundreds of soldiers all of them talking and it seemed to me excited for they stamped upon the ground and even jumped into the air to give point to their arguments  suddenly some of them caught sight of me whereon a tall truculent fellow called out  what does a white man at ulundi at such a time when even john dunn dare not come  let us kill him and send his head as a present to the english general across the tugela  that will settle this long talk about peace or war  others of a like mind echoed this kind proposal with the result that presently a score or so of them made a rush at me brandishing their sticks since they might not carry arms in the royal kraal  goza did his best to keep them off but was swept aside like a feather or rather knocked over for i saw him on his back with his thin legs in the air  you must climb out of this pit by yourself he began addressing me in his pompous and figurative way  then somebody stamped on his face and fixing his teeth in his assailants heel he grew silent for a while  the truculent blackguard who was about six feet three high and had a mouth like a wolfs throat arrived in front of me and bending down roared out  we are going to kill you white man  i had a pistol in my pocket and could perfectly well have killed him as i was much tempted to do  a seconds reflection showed me however that this would be useless and in a sense put me in the wrong though when the matter came on for argument it would interest me no more  so i just folded my arms and looking up at him said  why black man  because your face is white he roared  no i answered because your heart is black and your eyes are so full of blood that you do not know macumazahn when you see him  wow said one it is watcherbynight whom our fathers knew before us  leave him alone  no shouted the great fellow i will send him to watch where it is always night i who keep a club for white rats and he brandished his stick over me  now my temper rose  watching my opportunity i stretched out my right foot and hooked him round the ankle at the same time striking up with all my force  my fist caught him beneath the chin and over he went backwards sprawling on the ground  son of a dog  i said if a single stick touches me at least you shall go first and whipping out my revolver i pointed it at him  he lay quiet enough but how the matter would have ended i do not know for passion was running high had not goza at this moment risen with a bleeding nose and called out  o fools would you kill the kings guest to whom the king himself has given safeconduct  surely you are pots full of beer not men  why not answered one  this is the place of soldiers  the kings house is yonder  give the old jackal a start of a length of ten assegais  if he reaches it first he can shake hands with his friend the king  if not we will make him into medicine  yes yes run for it jackal clamoured the others knocking their shields with their sticks as men do who would frighten a buck and opening out to make a road for me  now while all this was going on with some kind of sixth sense i had noted a big man whose face was shrouded by a blanket thrown over his head who very quietly had joined these drunken rioters and vaguely wondered who he might be  i will not run i said slowly that i may be saved by the king  nay i will die here though some of you shall die first go to the king goza and tell him how his servants have served his guest and i lifted my pistol waiting till the first stick touched me to put a bullet through the bully on the ground  there is no need said a deep voice that proceeded from the draped man of whom i have spoken for the king has come to see for himself  then the blanket was thrown back revealing cetewayo grown fat and much aged since last i saw him but undoubtedly cetewayo  bayete roared the mob in salute while some of those who had been most active in the tumult tried to slip away  let no man stir said cetewayo and they stood as though they were rooted to the ground while i slipped my pistol back into my pocket  who are you white man he asked looking at me and what do you here  the king should know macumazahn i answered lifting my hat whom dingaan knew whom panda knew well and whom the king knew before he was a king  yes i know you he answered although since we spoke together you have shrunk like an oxhide in the sun and time has stained your beard white  and the king has grown fat like the ox on summer grass  as for what i do here did not the king send for me by goza and was i not brought like a baby in a blanket  the last time we met he went on taking no heed of my words was yonder at nodwengu when the witch mameena was tried for sorcery she who made my brother mad and brought about the great battle in which you fought for him with the amawombe regiment do you not remember how she kissed you macumazahn and took poison between the kisses and how before she grew silent she spoke evil words to me saying that i was doomed to pull down my own house and to die as she died words that have haunted me ever since and now haunt me most of all  i wish to speak to you concerning them macumazahn for it is said in the land that this beautiful witch loved you alone and that you only knew her mind  i made no reply who was heartily tired of this subject of mameena whom no one seemed able to forget  well he went on we will talk of that matter alone since it is not natural that you should wish to speak of your dead darlings before the world and with a wave of the hand he put the matter aside  then suddenly his attitude changed  his face that had been thoughtful and almost soft became fierce his form seemed to swell and he grew terrible  what was that dog doing he asked of goza pointing to the brute whom i had knocked down and who still lay prostrate on his back afraid to stir  o king answered goza he was trying to kill macumazahn because he is a white man although i told him that he was your guest being brought to you by the royal command  he was trying to kill him by giving him a start of ten spears length and making him run to the isigodhlo the kings house and beating him to death with the sticks of these men if they caught him which as he is old and they are young they must have done only the watcherbynight would not run no although he is so small he knocked him to the earth with his fist and there he lies  that is all o king  rise dog said cetewayo and the man rose trembling with fear and being bidden gave his name which i forget  listen dog went on the king in the same cold voice  what goza says is true for i saw and heard it all with my eyes and ears  you would have made yourself as the king  you dared to try to kill the kings guest to whom he had given safeconduct and to stain the kings doorposts with his blood thereby defiling his house and showing him to the white people as a murderer of one of them whom he had promised to protect macumazahn do you say how he shall die and i will have it done  i do not wish him to die i answered i think that he and those with him were drunk  let him go o king  aye macumazahn i will let him go  see now we are in the centre of the cattlekraal and to the eastern gate is as far as to the isigodhlo  let this man have a start of ten spears length and run to the eastern gate as he would have made macumazahn run to the kings house and let his companions those who would have hunted macumazahn hunt him  if he wins through to the gate he can go on to the government in natal and tell them of the cruelty of the zulus  only then let those who hunted him be brought before me for trial and perhaps we shall see how they can run  now the poor wretch caught hold of my hand begging me to intercede for him but soldiers who had come up dragged him away and having measured the distance allowed him set him on a mark made upon the ground  presently at a word off he sped like an arrow and after him went his friends ten or more of them  i think they caught him just by the gate doubling like a hare or so the shouts of laughter from the watching regiment told me for myself i would not look  that dog ate his own stomach said cetewayo grimly thereby indicating in native fashion that the biter had been bit or the engineer hoist with his petard  it is long since there has been a war in the land and some of these young soldiers who have never used an assegai save to skin an ox or cut the head from a chicken shout too loud and leap too high  now they will be quieter and while you stay here you may walk where you will in safety macumazahn he added thoughtfully  then dismissing the matter from his mind as we white people dismiss any trivial incident in a morning stroll he talked for a few minutes to the commanding officer of the regiment that was drilling who ran up to make some report to him and walked back towards the isigodhlo beckoning me to follow with goza  after waiting for a little while outside the gate in the surrounding fence a bodyservant ordered us to enter which we did to find the king seated on the shady side of his big hut quite alone  at a sign i also sat myself down upon a stool that had been set for me while goza whose nose was still bleeding squatted at my side  your manners are not so good as they were once macumazahn said cetewayo presently or perhaps you have been so long away from the royal kraal that you have forgotten its customs  i stared at him wondering what he could mean whereon he added with a laugh  what is that in your pocket  is it not a loaded pistol and do you not remember that it is death to appear before the king armed  now i might kill you and have no blame although you are my guest for who knows that you are not sent by the english queen to shoot me  i ask the kings pardon i said humbly enough  i did not think about the pistol  let your servants take it away  perhaps it is safer in your pocket where i saw you place it in the cattlekraal macumazahn than in their hands which do not know how to hold such things  moreover i know that you are not one who stabs in the dark even when our peoples growl round each other like two dogs about to fight and if you were in this place your life would have to pay for mine  there is beer by your side drink and fear nothing  did you see the opener of roads goza and if so what is his answer to my message  o king i saw him answered goza  the father of the doctors the friend and master of the spirits says he has heard the kings word yes that he heard it as it passed the kings lips and that although he is very old he will travel to ulundi and be present at the great council of the nation which is to be summoned on the eighth day from this that of the full moon  yet he makes a prayer of the king  it is that a place may be prepared for him for his people and for his servants who carry him away from this town of ulundi where he may sojourn quite alone a decree of death being pronounced against any who attempt to break in upon his privacy either where he dwells or upon his journey  these are his very words o king  i who am the most ancient man in zululand dwell with the spirits of my fathers who will not suffer strangers to come nigh them and who if they are offended will bring great woes upon the land  moreover i have sworn that while there is a king in zululand and i draw the breath of life never again will i set foot in a royal kraal because when last i did so at the slaying of the witch mameena the king who is dead thought it well to utter threats against me and never more will i the opener of roads be threatened by a mortal  therefore if the king and his council seek to drink of the water of my wisdom it must be in the place and hour of my own choosing  if this cannot be let me abide here in my house and let the king seek light from other doctors since mine shall remain as a lamp to my own heart  now i saw that these words greatly disturbed cetewayo who feared zikali as indeed did all the land  what does the old wizard mean he asked angrily  he lives alone like a bat in a cave and for years has been seen of none yet as a bat flies forth at night ranging far and wide in search of prey so does his spirit seem to fly through zululand everywhere i hear the same word  it iswhat says the opener of roads  it ishow can aught be done unless the opener of roads has declared that it shall be done he who was here before the black one chaka was born he who it is said was the friend of inkosi umkulu the father of the zulus who died before our greatgrandfathers could remember he who has all knowledge and is almost a spirit if indeed he be not a spirit  i ask you macumazahn who are his friend what does he mean and why should i not kill him and be done  o king i answered in the days of your uncle dingaan when dingaan slew the boers who were his guests and thus began the war between the white and the black i who was a lad heard the laughter of zikali for the first time yonder at the kraal ungungundhlovu i who rode with retief and escaped the slaughter but his face i did not see  many years later in the days of panda your father i saw his face and therefore you name me his friend  yet this friend who drew me to visit him perhaps by your will o king has now caused me to be brought here to ulundi doubtless by your will o king but against my own for who wishes to come to a town where he is wellnigh slain by the first brawler he meets in the cattle kraal  yet you were not slain macumazahn and perhaps you do not know all the story of that brawler replied cetewayo almost humbly like one who begs pardon though the rest of what i had said he ignored  but still you are zikalis friend for between you and him there is a rope which enabled him to draw you to zululand which rope i have heard called by a womans name  therefore by the spirit of that woman which still can draw you like a rope i charge you tell mewhat does this old wizard mean and why should i not kill him and be rid of one who haunts my heart like an evil vision of the night and as i sometimes think is an umtakati an evildoer who would work ill to me and all my house yes and to all my people  how should i know what he means o king i answered with indignation though in fact i could guess well enough  as for killing him cannot the king kill whom he will  yet i remember that once i heard you father ask much the same question and of zikali himself saying that he was minded to find out whether or no he were mortal like other men  i remember also zikali answered that there was a saying that when the opener of roads came to the end of his road there would be no more a king of zululand as there was none when first he set foot upon his road now i have spoken who am a white man and do not understand your sayings  i remember it also macumazahn who was present at the time he replied heavily  my father feared this zikali and his father feared him and i have heard that the black one himself who feared nothing feared him also  and i too fear him so much that i dare not make up my mind upon a great matter without his counsel lest he should bewitch me and the nation and bring us to nothing  he paused then turning to goza asked did the opener of roads tell you where he wished to dwell when he comes to visit me here at ulundi  o king answered goza yonder in the hills not further away than an aged man can walk in the half of an hour is a place called the valley of bones because there in the days of those who went before the king and even in the kings day many evildoers have been led to die  zikali would dwell in this valley of bones and there and nowhere else would meet the king and the great council not in the daylight but after sunset when the moon has risen  why said cetewayo starting the place is illomened and they say haunted one that no man dares to approach after the fall of darkness for fear lest the ghosts of the dead should leap upon him gibbering  such were the words of the opener of roads o king replied goza  there and nowhere else will he meet the king and there he demands that three huts should be built to shelter him and his folk and stored with all things needful  if this be not granted to him then he refuses to visit the king or to give counsel to the nation  so be it then said cetewayo  send messengers to the opener of roads goza saying that what he desires shall be done  let my command go out that under pain of death none spy upon him while he journeys hither or returns  let the huts be built forthwith and when it is known that he is coming let food in plenty be placed in them and afterwards morning by morning taken to the mouth of the valley  bid him announce his arrival and the hour he chooses for our meeting by messenger  begone  goza leapt up gave the royal salute and retreated backwards from the presence of the king leaving us alone  i also rose to depart but cetewayo motioned to me to be seated  macumazahn he said the great queens man who has come to natal sir bartle frere threatens me with war because two evildoing women were taken on the natal side of the tugela and brought back to zululand and killed by mehlokazulu being the wives of his father sirayo which was done without my knowledge also two white men were driven away from an island in the tugela river by some of my soldiers  is that all o king i asked  no  the queens man says i kill my people without trial which is a lie told him by the missionaries and that girls have been killed also who refused to marry those to whom they were given and ran away with other men  also that wizards are smelt out and slain which happens but rarely now all of this contrary to the promises i made to sompseu when he came to recognize me as king upon my fathers death and some other such small matters  what is demanded if you would avoid war o king  nothing less than this macumazahn that the zulu army should be abolished and the soldiers allowed to marry whom and when they please because says the queens man he fears lest it should be used to attack the english as though i who love the english as those have done who went before me desire to lay a finger on them  also that another queens man should be sent to dwell here in my country to be the eyes and ears of the english government and have power with me in the land yes and more demands which would destroy the zulus as a people and make me their king but a petty kraalhead  and what will the king answer i asked  i know not what to answer  the fine of two thousand cattle i will pay for the killing of the women  if it may be i wish no quarrel with the english though gladly i would have fought the dutch had not sompseu stretched out his arm over their land  but how can i disband the army and make an end of the regiments that have conquered in so many wars  macumazahn i tell you that if i did this in a moon i should be dead  oh you white people think there is but one will in zululand that of the king  but it is not so for he is but a single man among ten thousand thousand who lives to work the peoples wish  if he beats them with too thick a stick or if he brings them to shame or does what the most of them do not wish then where is the king  then i say he goes a road that was trodden by chaka and dingaan who were before me yes the red road of the assegai  therefore today i stand like a man between two falling cliffs  if i run towards the english the zulu cliff falls upon me  if i run towards my own people the english cliff falls upon me and in either case i am crushed and no more seen  tell me then macumazahn you whose heart is honest what must i do  so he spoke wringing his hands with tears starting to his eyes and upon my word although i never liked cetewayo as i had liked his father panda perhaps because i loved his brother umbelazi whom he killed and had known him do many cruel deeds my heart bled for him  i cannot tell you king i answered thinking that i must say something but i pray you do not make war against the queen for she is the most mighty one in the whole earth and though her foot of which you see but the little toe here in africa seems small to you yet if she is angered it will stamp the zulus flat so that they cease to be  many have told me this macumazahn  yes even uhamu the son of my uncle unzibe or as some say the son of his spirit to which his mother was married after unzibe was dead and others throughout the land and in truth i think it myself  but who can hold the army which shouts for war  ow the council must decide which means perhaps that zikali will decide for now all hang upon his lips  then i am sorry i exclaimed  he looked at me shrewdly  are you  so am i  yet his counsel must be asked and better that it should be here in my presence than yonder secretly at the black kloof  i would kill him if i dared but i dare not who am surewhy i may not saythat the same sun will see his death and mine  he waved his hand to show that the talk on this matter was ended then added  macumazahn you are my prisoner for a while but give me your word that you will not try to escape and you may go where you will within an hours ride of ulundi  i would pay you well to stop here with me but this i know you would never do should there be trouble between us and your people  therefore i promise you that if war breaks out i will send you safely to natal or perhaps sooner as my messenger whence doubtless you will return to fight against me  know that i have given orders that every other white man or woman who is found in zululand shall be killed as a spy  even john dunn has fled or is flying or so i hear john dunn who has fed out of my hand and grown rich on my gifts you yourself would have been killed as you came from swaziland in your cart had not command been sent to those chiefs through whose lands you passed that neither they nor their people were so much as to look at you  now for one intense moment i thought as hard as ever i had done in my life  it was evidentunless he dealing very cunningly with me which i did not believethat cetewayo knew nothing of anscombe and heda but thought that i had come into zululand alone  should i or should i not tell him and beg his protection for them if i did so he might refuse or be unable to give it to them far away in the midst of a savage population aflame with the lust of war  as the incident of the morning showed it was as much as he could do to protect myself although the zulus knew me for their friend  on the other hand no one who dwelt under zikalis blanket to use the kaffir idiom would be touched because he was looked on as half divine and therefore everything under it down to the rat in his thatch was sacred  now zikali by implication and nombe with emphasis had promised to safeguard these two  surely therefore they would run less risk in the black kloof than here at ulundi if ever they got so far  all this went through my brain in an instant with the result that i made up my mind to say nothing  as the issue proved this was a terrible mistake but who can always judge rightly  had i spoken out it seems to me probable that cetewayo would have granted my prayer and ordered that these two should be escorted out of zululand before hostilities began although of course they might have been murdered on the way  also for a reason that will become evident later it is possible that there would never have been any hostilities  all i can plead is that i acted for the best and fate would have it so  another moment and the chance was gone  the gate opened and a bodyservant appeared announcing that one of the great captains with some of his officers waited to see the king  cetewayo made a sign whereon the servant called out something and they entered three or four of them saluting loudly  seeing me they stopped and stared whereon cetewayo shortly but with much clearness repeated to them and to an induna who accompanied them what he had already said to me namely that i was his guest sent for by him that he might use me as a messenger if he thought fit  he added that the man who dared to speak a word against me or even to look at me askance should pay the price with his life however high his station and he commanded that the heralds should proclaim this his decree throughout ulundi and the neighbouring kraals  then he held out his hand to me in token of friendship bidding me to go softly and come to see him whenever i wished and dismissed me in charge of the induna one of the captains and some soldiers  within five minutes of reaching my hut i heard a loudvoiced crier proclaiming the order of the king and knew that i had no more to fear    chapter xiv     the valley of bones      the week that followed my interview with cetewayo was indeed a miserable time for me  for myself as i have said i had no fear for the kings orders were strictly obeyed  moreover the tale of what had happened to the brute who wished to hunt me down in the cattlekraal had travelled far and wide and none sought to share his fate  my hut was inviolate and well supplied with necessary food as was my mare and i could wander where i liked and talk with whom i would  i could even ride to exercise the horse though this i did very sparingly and only in the immediate neighbourhood of the town for fear of exciting suspicion or meeting zulus whom the kings word had not reached  indeed on these occasions i was always accompanied by a guard of swiftfooted and armed soldiers sent to protect me or more probably to kill me if i did anything that seemed suspicious  in the course of my rambles i met sundry natives whom i had known in the old days some of them a long while ago  they all seemed glad to see me and were quite ready to talk of past times but of the present they would say little or nothing except that they were certain there would be war  of anscombe and heda i could hear nothing and indeed did not dare to make any direct inquiries concerning them but several reliable men assured me that the last missionaries and traders having departed there was not a white man woman or child left in zululand except myself it was all black they said referring to the colour of their people as it had been before the time of chaka  so i was forced to eat out my heart with anxiety in silence hoping and praying that zikali had played an honest part and sent them away safely  why should he not have done so seeing that it was my presence he had desired not theirs  they were only taken or rather snared because they were with me and could not be separated or so i believed at the time  one ray of comfort i did get  about the fifth day after my interview i saw goza who told me that the kings messengers were back from the black kloof and had brought a word for me from zikali himself  the word was  bid goza say to macumazahn that i was sorry not to see him to say goodbye because that morning i slept heavily  bid him say that i am glad he has seen the king since for this purpose i sought his presence in zululand  bid him say that he is to fear nothing and that if his heart is heavy about others whom he loves he should make it light again since the spirits have them in their keeping as they have him and never were they or he more safe than they are today  now i looked at goza and asked if i could see this messenger  he replied no as he had already been despatched upon another errand  then i asked him if the messenger had said anything else  he answered yes one thing that he had forgotten namely that the writing about blankets should now be in natal  then suddenly he changed the subject and asked me if i would like to accompany him to the valley of bones where he was ordered to inspect the huts which were being built for zikali and his people  of course i said i should hoping quite without result that i might get something more out of him on the road  now this town of cetewayos stands or rather stood for it has long been burnt on the slope of the hills to the northeast of the plains of ulundi  above it these hills grow steeper and deep in the recesses of one of them is the valley of bones there is nothing particularly imposing about the place no towering cliffs or pillars of piled granite as at the black kloof  it is just a vale cut out by water bordered by steep slopes on either side and a still steeper slope strown with large rocks at its end  dotted here and there on these slopes grew tall aloes that from a little distance looked like scattered men whereof the lower leaves were shrivelled and blackened by veld fires  also there were a few euphorbias grey nakedlooking things that end in points like fingers on a hand and among them some sparse thorn trees struggling to live in an inhospitable soil  the place has one peculiarity  jutting into it from the hillside is a ridge or spur sixty or seventy yards in length by perhaps twenty broad that ends in a flat point of rock which stands about forty feet above the level of the rest of the little valley  on this ridge also grew tall aloes until near its extremity the soil ceased or had been washed away from the waterworn core of rock  it was and no doubt still is a desolatelooking spot at any rate for most of the day when owing to the shadow of the surrounding hills it receives but little sun  everything about it especially when i was there in a time of rain seemed dank and miserable although the flat floor of the kloof was clothed with a growth of tall coarse grass and weeds that bore an evilsmelling flower  perhaps some sense of appropriateness had caused the zulu kings to choose this lonesome deathlylooking gorge as one of their execution grounds  at any rate many had been slain here for skulls and the larger human bones some of them black with age lay all about among the grass as they had been scattered by hyenas and jackals  they were particularly thick beneath and around the tablelike rock that i have mentioned  goza told me that this was because the kings slayers made a custom of dragging the victim along the projecting tongue to the edge of this rock and hurling him either dead or living to the ground beneath or in the case of witches driving them over after they had been blinded  such was the spot that zikali had selected to abide in during his visit to ulundi  certainly where privacy was an object it was well chosen for as cetewayo had said and as goza emphasized to me it had the repute of being the most thoroughly haunted place in all zululand with the sole exception perhaps of the ridge opposite to dingaans old kraal where once i shot the vultures for my life and those of my companions  even in the daytime people gave it a wide berth and at night nothing would induce them to approach it at any rate alone  see the book called marie by h rider haggard  here to one side of and near the root of the tongue of land of which i have spoken the huts that zikali had demanded for himself and his company were being rapidly built close to a spring of water by a large body of men who laboured as though they wished to be done with their task  also about half way up the donga for really it was nothing more at a distance of perhaps five and twenty paces from its flat point whence the condemned were hurled a circular space of ground had been cleared and levelled which was large enough to accommodate fifty or sixty men  on this space goza told me the king and the council were to sit when they came to seek light from zikali  in my heart i reflected that the light they were likely to get from him would be such as may be supposed to be thrown by hell fire  for be it remembered i knew what these people never seemed to understand that zikali was the most bitter of their enemies to begin with he was of undwandwe blood one of the people whom the great king chaka had destroyed  then this same chaka had robbed him of his wives and murdered his children in revenge for which he had plotted the slaying of chaka as he did that of his brothers umhlangana and dingaan the latter of whom he involved in a quarrel with the boers  subsequently he brought about the war between the princes cetewayo and umbelazi in which i played a part  now i was certain that he intended to bring about another war between the english and the zulus knowing well that in the end the latter would be destroyed and with them the royal house of senzangacona which he had sworn to level with the dust  had he not told me as much years ago and was he one to go back upon his word  had he not used mameena with her beauty and ambitions as his tool and when she was of no further service to him given her to death as he had used scores of others and in due season given them to death  was i not myself perhaps one of those tools destined to be thrown into the pit of doom when my turn came though in what way i could help his plots was more than i could see since he knew well that i should do my best to oppose him oh i had half a mind to go to cetewayo and tell him all i knew about zikali even if it involved the breaking of confidences  but stay  even if i were believed this farseeing wizard held hostages for my good behaviour and if i betrayed him what would happen to those hostages  he sent me messages saying that they were safe suggesting that they had escaped to natal  how was i to know that these were true  i was utterly bewildered i could not guess why i had been beguiled into zululand and i dared not step either this way or that for fear lest i should fall into some pit dug by his cunning hands and what was worse drag down others with me  moreover was this man quite human or perhaps an emissary of satan upon earth who had knowledge denied to other men and a certain mastery over the powers of ill  again i could not say his term of life seemed to be extraordinarily prolonged though none knew how old exactly he might be  also he had a wonderful knowledge of what was passing in the minds of others and by his arts as i had experienced only the other day could summon up apparitions or illusions before their eyes  further he was aware of events which had happened at a distance and could send or read dreams since otherwise how did nombe know what i had dreamt at marnhams house  lastly he could foretell the future as once he had done in my own case prophecying that i should be injured by a buffalo with a split horn  yet all of this might be nothing more than a mixture of keen observation clever spying trickery and mesmerism  i could not say which it was nor can i with certainty to this hour  such were the thoughts that passed through my mind as i walked back from the vale of bones by the side of the bigpaunched goza whom i caught eyeing me from time to time as a curious crow eyes any object that has attracted his attention  goza i said at last do the zulus really mean to fight the english  he turned and pointed to a spot where the hills ran down into the great plain  here two regiments were manoeuvring  one of these held the slopes of the hill and the other was attacking them from the plain so fiercely that at a distance their onslaught looked like that of actual warfare  that looks like fighting does it not macumazahn he replied  yes goza yet it may be but play  quite so macumazahn  it may be fighting or it may be but play am i a prophet that i should be able to say which it is  of that there is but one man in zululand who knows the truth  it is he for whom the new huts are being built up yonder  you think he really knows goza  no macumazahn i do not think i am sure  he is the greatest of all wizards as he was when my father held on to his mothers apron  he pulls the strings and the greatones of the country dance  if he wishes war there will be war  if he wishes peace there will be peace  and which does he wish goza  i thought perhaps you could tell me that macumazahn who he says are such an old friend of his also why he chooses to sojourn in a dark hole among the dead instead of in the sunshine among the living here at ulundi  well i cannot goza since the opener of roads does not open his heart to me but keeps his secrets to himself  for the rest those who talk with the dead may prefer to dwell among the dead  now as always you speak truth macumazahn said goza looking at me in a way which suggested to me that he believed i spoke anything but the truth  indeed i am convinced he thought that i was in the council of zikali and acquainted with his plans  also i am sure he knew that i had not come to zululand alone the incident of the blankets which i had promised to him a bribe to keep silence showed it and suspected that my companions were parties to some plot together with myself  and yet at the time i could not be quite sure and therefore dared not ask anything concerning them lest thus i should reveal their existence and bring them to death  as a matter of fact i need not have been anxious on this point since if goza who i may state was a kind of secret service officer as well as a head messenger knew as i think probable he had been commanded by zikali to hold his tongue under penalty of a curse  perhaps the same was true of the soldiers who had come with him to take me to ulundi  the hint of zikali was as powerful as the word of the king since they like thousands of others believed that whereas cetewayo could kill them zikali like satan could blast their spirits as well as their bodies but how was i to guess all these things at that time   during the next two days nothing happened though i heard that there had been one if not two meetings of the council at the kings house during which the position of affairs was discussed cetewayo i did not see although twice he sent messengers to me bringing gifts of food who were charged to inquire whether i was well and happy and if any had offered me hurt or insult  to these i answered that i was well and unmolested but not happy who grew lonesome being but a solitary white man among so many thousands of the zulus  on the third morning that of the day of the full moon goza came and informed me that zikali had arrived at the valley of bones before dawn  i asked him how he who was so old and feeble had walked so far  he answered that he had not walked or so he understood but had been carried in a litter or rather in two litters one for himself and one for his spirit this staggered me even where zikali was concerned and i inquired what on earth goza meant  macumazahn how can i tell you who only know what i myself am told he exclaimed  such is the report that the opener of roads has made himself by messengers to the king  none have seen him for he journeys only in the night  moreover when zikali passes all men are blind and even womens tongues grow dumb perchance by his spirit he means his medicine or the witchdoctoress nombe whom folks say he created since none have seen her father or her mother or heard who begat her or perchance his snake is hid behind the mats of the second litter if in truth there was one  it may be so i said feeling that it was useless to pursue the matter  now goza i would see zikali and at once  that cannot be macumazahn since he has given out that he will see no one who rests after his journey and the king has issued orders that any who attempt to approach the valley of bones shall die even if they be of the royal blood  yes if so much as a dog dares to draw near that place it must die  the soldiers who ring it round have killed one already so strict are the orders also a boy who went towards it searching for a calf which i think a bad omen  then i will send a message to him i persisted  do so mocked goza  look yonder sails a vulture  ask it to take your message for nothing else will  be not foolish macumazahn but have patience for tonight you shall see the opener of roads when he attends the council of the king in the valley of bones  this is the order of the kingthat at the rising of the moon i lead you thither so that you may be present at the council in case he wishes to ask you any questions about the white people or to give you any message to the government in natal  therefore at sunset i will come for you  till then farewell  i have business that cannot wait  can i see the king i cried  not so macumazahn  all today he makes sacrifice to the spirits of his ancestors and must not be approached goza called back as he departed  availing myself of the permission of the king to go where i would a little later in the day i walked out of the town towards the valley of bones in order to ascertain for myself whether what goza had told me was true  so it proved for about three hundred yards from the mouth of the valley which at that distance looked like a black hole in the hills i found soldiers stationed about ten paces apart in a great circle which ran right up the hillside and vanished over the crest  strolling up to one of these whose face i thought i knew i asked him if he would let me pass to see my friend the opener of roads  the man who was something of a humourist replied  certainly if you wish macumazahn  that is to say i will let your spirit pass but to do this if you come one step nearer i must first make a hole in you with my spear out of which it can fly  i thanked him for his information and gave him some snuff which he took gratefully being bored by his long vigil  then i asked him how many people the great witchdoctor had with him  he said he did not know but he had seen a number of tall men come to the mouth of the donga to fetch food that had been placed there again i inquired if he had seen any women whereon he replied none zikali being he understood too old to trouble himself about the other sex  just then an officer making his rounds came up and looked at me so sternly that i thought it well to retreat  evidently there was no chance of getting through that line  on my way back i walked as near the fence of the kings house as i dared and saw witchdoctors passing in and out in their hideous official panoply  this told me that here also goza had spoken the truththe king was performing magical ceremonies which meant that it would be impossible to approach him  in every direction i met with failure  the fates were against me it lay over me like a spell  indeed i grew superstitious and began to think that zikali had bewitched me as he was said to have the power to do  well perhaps he had for the mere fact of finding myself opposed by this persistent wall of difficulties and silence convinced me that there was something behind it to be learned  i went back very dejected to my hut and talked to my mare which whinnied and rubbed its nose against me for although it was well fed and looked after the poor beast seemed as lonely as i was myself  no wonder since like myself it was separated from all its kind and weary of inaction  after this i ate and smoked and finally dozed no more for whenever i tried to go to sleep i thought that i heard zikali laughing at me as mayhap he was doing yonder in his hut  at length that wearisome day drew towards its end  the sun began to sink a huge red ball of fire now and again veiled by clouds for the sky was stormy  its fierce rays striking upon other clouds peopled the enormous heavens with fantastic shapes of light which were thickest over the hills wherein was the valley of bones  to my strained mind these clouds looked like battling armies figures of flame warring against figures of darkness the darkness won no the light broke out again and conquered it and see there above them both squatted a strange black presence crowned with fire  it might have been that of zikali magnified ten thousand times and hark it laughed with the low reverberating voice of distant thunder  suddenly i felt that i was no longer alone and looking round saw goza at my side  what do you see up there macumazahn that you stare so hard he asked pointing at the sky with his stick  impis fighting i answered briefly  then you must be a heavendoctor macumazahn for i only see black and red clouds  well it is time to go to learn whether or no the impis will fight for zikali awaits us and the council has started already  by the way the king says that you will do well to put your pistol in your pocket in case any should seek to harm you in the dark  it is there  but goza i pray you to protect me since in the dark bullets fly wide and if i began to shoot one might hit you goza  he smiled making no answer but i noticed that during the rest of that night he was careful to keep behind me as much as possible  our way led us through the town where everybody seemed to be standing about doing nothing and speaking very little  there was a curious air of expectancy upon their faces  they knew that the crisis was at hand that their nations fate hung upon the scales and they watched my every look and movement as though in them they expected to read an omen  i too watched them out of the corners of my eyes wondering whether i should escape from their savage company alive  if once the blood lust broke out among them it seemed to me that i should have about as much chance as a chopped fox among a pack of hungry hounds  once out of the town we saw no one until we came to the circle of guards which i have already mentioned who stood there like an endless line of black statues  in answer to their challenge goza gave some complicated password in which my name occurred whereon they opened out and let us through  then we marched on to the mouth of the kloof  the place was very dark for now the sun was down in the west and the moon in the east was cut off from us by the hills and would not be visible here for half an hour or more presently i saw a spot of light  it was a small fire burning near the tongue of rock which i have described  at a distance in front of the fire on the patch of prepared ground squatted a number of men between twenty and thirty of them in a semicircle  they were wrapped up in karosses and blankets and in their centre sat a large figure on a chair of wood  the king and the great council whispered goza  one of them looked round and saw us  at some sign from the king he rose and against the fire i saw that he was the prime minister umnyamana  he came to me and with a nod of recognition conducted me some paces to the right where a euphorbia tree grew among the rank herbage  here i found a stool placed ready on which i sat down goza who of course was not of the council squatting at my side in the grass  now i found that i was so situated that i could not well be seen from the fire or even from the rock above it while i by moving my head a little could see both quite clearly  after this as the last reflection from the sunk sun faded the darkness increased until nothing remained visible except the fire and the massive outline of the rock behind  the silence was complete for none of the council spoke  they were so still that they might have been dead so still that a beetle suddenly booming past me made me start as though it had been a bullet  the general impression was almost mesmeric  i felt as though i were going to sleep and yet my mind remained painfully awake so that i was able to think things out  i understood clearly that the body of men to my left had come together to decide whether there should be peace or war that there were divisions of opinion among them that the king was ready to follow the party which should prove itself the strongest but that the real voice of decision would speak from behind that fire  it was the case of the delphic oracle over again with a priest instead of a priestess and what a priest  it was evident to me also that zikali who knew human nature and especially savage human nature had arranged all this with a view to scenic and indeed supernatural effect  moreover he had done it very well since i knew myself that in this place and hour words and occurrences would affect me deeply at which i should have laughed in the sunlight and open plain  already the zulus were affected for i could hear the teeth of some of them chattering and goza began to shiver at my side  he muttered that it was cold and lied for the donga was extremely hot and stuffy  at length the silver radiance of the moon spread itself on the high curtain of the dark  then the edge of her orb appeared above the hill and an arrow of white light fell into the little valley  it struck upon and about the jutting rock revealing a misshapen whiteheaded figure squatted between its base and the fire the figure of zikali    chapter xv     the great council      none had seen or heard him come and though doubtless he had but crept round the rock and taken his place in the darkness there appeared to be something mysterious about this sudden appearance of zikali  so the zulu nobles thought at any rate for they uttered a low ow of fear and wonder  there he sat like a huge ape staring at the sky for the firelight shone on his deep and burning eyes  the moonlight increased but now and again it was broken by little clouds which caused strange shadows to appear about the rock  some of these shadows looked as though veiled figures were approaching the wizard bending over him and departing again after giving him their message or counsel  his spirits visit him whispered goza but i made no answer  this went on for quite a long time until the full round of the moon appeared above the hill indeed and for the while the clouds had cleared away  still zikali sat silent and i who was acquainted with the habits of this people knew that i was witnessing a conflict between two they considered to be respectively a spiritual and an earthly king  it is my belief that unless he were first addressed zikali would have sat all night without opening his lips  possibly cetewayo would have done the same if the impatience of public opinion had allowed him  at any was rate it was he who gave way  makosi master of many spirits on behalf of the council and the people of the zulus i the king greet you here in the place that you have chosen said cetewayo  zikali made no answer  the silence went on as before till at length after a pause and some whispering cetewayo repeated his salutation adding  has age made you deaf o opener of roads that you cannot hear the voice of the king  then at last zikali answered in his low voice that yet seemed to fill all the kloof  nay child of senzangacona age has not made me deaf but my spirit in these latter days floats far from my body  it is like a bladder filled with air that a child holds by a string and before i can speak i must draw it from the heavens to earth again  what did you say about the place that i have chosen well what better place could i choose seeing that it was here in this very vale of bones that i met the first king of the zulus chaka the wild beast who was your uncle  why then should i not choose it to meet the last king of the zulus  now i listening knew at once that this saying might be understood in two ways namely that cetewayo was the reigning king or that he was the last king who would ever reign  but the council interpreted it in the latter and worse sense for i saw a quiver of fear go through them  why should i not choose it went on zikali seeing also that this place is holy to me  here it was o son of panda that chaka brought my children to be killed and forced me sitting where you sit to watch their deaths  there on the rock above me they were killed four of them three sons and a daughter and the slayersthey came to an evil end those slayers as did chakalaughed and cast them down from the rock before me  yes and chaka laughed and i too laughed for had not the king the right to kill my children and to steal their mothers and was i not glad that they should be taken from the world and gathered to that of spirits whence they always talk to me yes even now that is why i did not hear you at first king because they were talking to me  he paused turning one ear upwards then continued in a new and tender voice what is it you say to me noma my dear little noma  oh i hear you i hear you  now he shifted himself along the ground on his haunches some paces to the right and began to search about groping with his long fingers  where where he muttered  oh i understand further under the root a jackal buried it did it  pah  how hard is this soil  ah i have it but look noma a stone has cut my finger  i have it i have it and from beneath the root of some fallen tree he drew out the skull of a child and holding it in his right hand softly rubbed the mould off it with his left  yes noma it might be yours it is of the right size but how can i be sure  what is it you say  the teeth  ah now i remember  only the day before you were taken i pulled out that front tooth did i not and beneath it was another that was strangely split in two  if this skull was yours it will be there  come to the fire noma and let us look the moonlight is faint is it not  back to the fire he shifted himself and bending towards the blaze made an examination  true noma true  here is the split tooth white as when i saw it all those years ago  oh dear child of my body dear child of my spirit for we do not beget with the body alone noma as you know better than i do today i greet you and pressing the skull to his lips he kissed it then set it down in front of him between himself and the fire with the face part pointing to the king and burst into one of his eerie and terrible laughs  a low moan went up from his audience and i felt the skin of goza who had shrunk against me break into a profuse sweat then suddenly zikalis voice changed one more and became hard and businesslike if i may call it so similar to that of other professional doctors  you have sent for me o king as those who went before you have sent when great things were about to happen  what is the matter on which you would speak to me  you know well opener of roads answered cetewayo rather shakily i thought  the matter is one of peace or war  the english threaten me and my people and make great demands on me amongst others that the army should be disbanded  i can set them all out if you will  if i refuse to do as they bid me then within a few days they will invade zululand indeed their soldiers are already gathered at the drifts  it is not needful king answered zikali since i know what all know neither more nor less  the winds whisper the demands of the white men the birds sing them the hyenas howl them at night  let us see how the matter stands  when your father died sompseu sir t shepstone the great white chief came from the english government to name you king  this he could not do according to our law since how can a stranger name the king of the zulus therefore the council of the nation and the doctorsi was not among them kingmoved the spirit of chaka the lion into the body of sompseu and made him as chaka was and gave him power to name you to rule over the zulus  so it came about that to the english queen through the spirit of chaka you swore certain things that slaying for witchcraft should be abolished that no man should die without fair and open trial and other matters  he paused a while then went on these oaths you have broken o king as being of the blood you are and what you are you must do  here there was disturbance among the council and cetewayo half rose from his seat then sat down again  zikali gazing at the sky waited till it had died away then went on  do any question my words  if so then let them ask of the white men whether they be true or no  let them ask also of the spirits of those who have died for witchcraft and of the spirits of the women who have been slain and whose bodies were laid at the crossroads because they married the men they chose and not the soldiers to whom the king gave them  how can i ask the white men who are far away broke out cetewayo ignoring the rest  are the white men so far away king  it is true that i see none and hear none yet i seem to smell one of them close at hand here he took up the skull which he had laid down and whispered to it  ah i thank you my child  it seems king that there is a white man here hidden in this kloof he who is named macumazahn a good man and a truthful known to many of us from of old who can tell you what his people think though he is not one of their indunas  if you question my words ask him  we know what the white men think said cetewayo so there is no need to ask macumazahn to sing us an old song  the question iswhat must the zulus do  must they swallow their spears and ceasing to be a nation become servants or must they strike with them and drive the english into the sea and after them the boers  tell me first king who dwell far away and alone knowing little of what passes in the land of life what the zulus desire to do  before me sits the great council of the nation  let it speak  then one by one the members of the council uttered their opinions in order of rank or seniority  i do not remember the names of all who were present or what each of them said  i recall however that sigananda a very old chiefhe must have been over ninetyspoke the first  he told them that he had been friend of chaka and one of his captains and had fought in most of his battles  that afterwards he had been a general of dingaans until that king killed the boers under retief when he left him and finally sided with panda in the civil war in which dingaan was killed with the help of the boers  that he had been present at the battle of the tugela though he took no actual part in the fighting and afterwards became a councillor of pandas and then of cetewayo his son  it was a long and interesting historical recital covering the whole period of the zulu monarchy which ended suddenly with these words  i have noted o king and councillors that whenever the black vulture of the zulus was content to attack birds of his own feather he has conquered  but when it has met the grey eagles of the white men which come from over the sea he has been conquered and my heart tells me that as it was in the past so it shall be in the future  chaka was a friend of the english so was panda and so has cetewayo been until this hour  i say therefore let not the king tear the hand which fed him because it seems weak lest it should grow strong and clutch him by the throat and choke him  next spoke undabuko dabulamanzi and magwenga brothers of the king who all favoured war though the two last were guarded in their speech  after these came uhamu the kings unclehe who was said to be the son of a spiritwho was strong for peace urging that the king should submit to the demands of the english making the best terms he could that he should bend like a reed before the storm so that after the storm had swept by he might stand up straight again and with him all the other reeds of the people of the zulus  so too said seketwayo chief of the umdhlalosi and more whom i cannot recall six or seven of them  but usibebu and the induna untshingwayo who afterwards commanded at isandhlwana were for fighting as were sirayo the husband of the two women who had been taken on english territory and killed and umbilini the chief of swazi blood whose surrender was demanded by sir bartle frere and who afterwards commanded the zulus in the battle at ihlobane  last of all spoke the prime minister umnyamana who declared fiercely that if the zulu buffalo hid itself in the swamp like a timid calf when the white bull challenged it on the hills the spirits of chaka and all his forefathers would thrust its head into the mud and choke it  when all had finished cetewayo spoke saying  that is a bad council which has two voices for to which of them must the captain listen when the impis of the foe gather in front of him  here i have sat while the moon climbs high and counted and what do i find  that one half of you men of wisdom and renown say yes and that the other half of you men of wisdom and renown say no  which then is it to be yes or no  are we to fight the english or are we to sit still  that is for the king to decide said a voice  see what it is to be a king went on cetewayo with passion if i declare for war and we win shall i be greater than i am if victory gives me more land more subjects more wives and more cattle what is the use of these things to me who already have enough of all of them  and if defeat should take everything from me even my life perhaps then what shall i have gained  i will tell youthe curse of the zulus upon my name from father to son for ever  they will say cetewayo son of panda pulled down a house that once was great  because of some small matter he quarrelled with the english who were always the friends of our people and brought the zulus to the dust  sintwangu my messenger who brought heavy words from the queens induna which we must answer with other words or with spears says that the english soldiers in natal are few so few that we zulus can swallow them like bits of meat and still be hungry  but are these all the soldiers of the english  i am not sure  you are one of that people macumazahn he added turning his massive shape towards me tell us now how many soldiers has your queen  king i answered i do not know for certain  but if the zulus can muster fifty thousand spears the queen if there be need can send against them ten times fifty thousand and if she grows angry another ten times fifty every one armed with a rifle that will fire five bullets a minute and to accompany the soldiers hundreds of cannon whereof a single shot would give ulundi to the flames  out of the sea they will come shipload after shipload white men from where the sun sets and black men from where the sun rises so many that zululand would not hold them  now at these words which i delivered as grandly as i could something like a groan burst from the council though one man cried  do not listen to the white traitor o king who is sent here to turn our hearts to water with his lies  macumazahn may lie to us went on cetewayo though in the past none in the land have ever known him to lie but he was not sent to do so for i brought him here  for my part i do not believe that he lies  i believe that these english are as many as the pebbles in a river bed and that to them natal yes and all the cape is but as a single outlying cattle kraal one cattle kraal out of a hundred  did not sompseu once tell us that they were countless on that day when he came many years ago after the battle of the tugela to name me to succeed my father panda the day when my faction the usutu roared round him for hours like a river in flood and he sat still like a rock in the centre of a river  also i am minded of the words that chaka said when dingaan and umbopa had stabbed him and he lay dying at the kraal duguza that although the dogs of his own house whom his hand fed had eaten him up he heard the sound of the running of the feet of a great white people that should stamp them and the zulus flat  he paused and the silence was so intense that the crackling of zikalis fire which kept on burning brightly although i saw no fuel added to it sounded quite loud  presently it was broken first by a dog near at hand howling horribly at the moon and next by the hooting of a great owl that flitted across the donga the shadow of its wide wings falling for a moment on the king  listen exclaimed cetewayo a dog that howls  methinks that it stands upon the roof of the house of senzangacona  and an owl that hoots  methinks that owl has its nest in the world of spirits  are these good omens councillors  i trow not  i say that i will not decide this matter of peace or war  if there is one of my own blood here who will do so come let him take my place and let me go away to my own lordship of gikazi that i had when i was a prince before the witch mameena who played with all men and loved but onehere everybody turned and stared towards me yes even zikali whom nothing else had seemed to move till i wished that the ground would swallow me upcaused the war between me and my brother umbelazi whose blood earth will not swallow nor suns dry  how can that be o king broke in umnyamana the prime minister how can any of your race sit in your seat while you still live then indeed there would be war war between tribe and tribe and zulu and zulu till none were left and the white hyenas from natal would come and chew our bones and with them the boers that have passed the vaal  see now  why is this nyanga ie witchdoctor here and he pointed to zikali beyond the fire why has the opener of roads been brought from the black kloof which he has not left for years  is it not that he may give us counsel in our need and show us a sign that his counsel is good whether it be for war or peace  then when he has made divination and given the counsel and shown the sign then o king do you speak the word of war or peace and send it to the queen by yonder white man and by that word we the people will abide  at this suggestion which i had no doubt was made by some secret agreement between umnyamana and zikali cetewayo seemed to grasp perhaps this was because it postponed for a little while the dreadful moment of decision or perhaps because he hoped that in the eyes of the nation it would shift the responsibility from his shoulders to those of the spirits speaking through the lips of their prophet  at any rate he nodded and answered  it is so  let the opener of roads open us a road through the forests and the swamps and the rocks of doubt danger and fear let him give us a sign that it is a good road on which we may safely travel and let him tell us whether i shall live to walk that road and what i shall meet thereon  i promise him in return the greatest fee that ever yet was paid to a doctor in zululand  now zikali lifted his big head shook his grey locks and opening his wide mouth as though he expected manna to fall into it from the sky he laughed out loud  ohoho he laughed ohohohoo it is worth while to have lived so long when life has brought me to such an hour as this what is it that my ears hear  that i the indwande dwarf i whom chaka named thethingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn i one of the race conquered and despised by the zulus am here to speak a word which the zulus dare not utter which the king of the zulus dares not utter  ohohoho and what does the king offer to me  a fee a great fee for the word that shall paint the zulus red with blood or white with the slime of shame  nay i take no fee that is the price of blood or shame  before i speak that word unknownfor as yet my heart has not heard it and what the heart has not heard the lips cannot shapei ask but one thing  it is an oath that whatever follows on the word while there is a zulu left living in the world i the voice of the spirits shall be safe from hurt or from reproach i and those of my house and those over whom i throw my blanket be they black or be they white  that is my fee without which i am silent  izwa  we hear you  we swear it on behalf of the people said every councillor in the semicircle in front of him yes and the king said it also stretching out his hand  good said zikali it is an oath it is an oath sworn here upon the bones of the dead  evildoers you call them but i say to you that many of those who sit before me have more evil in their hearts than had those dead  well let it be proclaimed o king and with it thisthat ill shall it go with him who breaks the oath with his family with his kraal and all with whom he has to do  now what is it you ask of me  first of all counsel as to whether you should fight the english queen a matter on which you the great ones are evenly divided in opinion as is the nation behind you  o king indunas and captains who am i that i should judge of such a matter which is beyond my trade a matter of the world above and of mens bodies not of the world below and of mens spirits  yet there was one who made the zulu people out of nothing as a potter fashions a vessel from clay as a smith fashions an assegai out of the ore of the hills yes and tempers it with human blood  chaka the lion the wild beast the king among kings the conqueror  i knew chaka as i knew his father yes and his father  others still living knew him also say you sigananda there for instance and he pointed to the old chief who had spoken first  yes sigananda knew him as a boy knows a great man as a soldier knows a general  but i knew his heart aye i shaped his heart i was its thought  had it not been for me he would never have been great  then he wronged mehere zikali took up the skull which he said was that of his daughter and stroked itand i left him  the old zulu smiths dipped their choicest blades in the blood of mena q  he was not wise he should have killed one whom he had wronged but perhaps he knew that i could not be killed perhaps he had tried and found that he was but throwing spears at the moon which fell back on his own head  i forget  it is so long ago and what does it matter  at least i took away from him the prop of my wisdom and he fellto rise no more  and so it has been with others  so it has been with others  yet while he was great i knew his heart who lived in his heart and therefore i ask myself had he been sitting where the king sits today what would chaka have done  i will tell you  if not only the english but the boers also and with them the pondos the basutos and all the tribes of africa had threatened him he would have fought themyes and set his heel upon their necks  therefore although i give no counsel upon such a matter i say to you that the counsel of chaka isfightand conquer  hearken to it or pass it byi care not which  he paused and a loud ow of wonder and admiration rose from his audience  myself i nearly joined in it for i thought this one of the cleverest bits of statecraft that ever i had heard of or seen  the old wizard had taken no responsibility and given no answer to the demand for advice  all this he had thrust on to the shoulders of a dead man and that man one whose name was magical to every zulu the king whose memory they adored the great general who had gorged them with victory and power speaking as chaka after a long period of peace he urged them once more to lift their spears and know the joys of triumph thereby making themselves the greatest nation in southern africa from the moment i heard this cunning appeal i know what the end would be all the rest was but of minor and semipersonal interest  i knew also for the first time how truly great was zikali and wondered what he might have become had fortune set him in different circumstances among a civilized people  now he was speaking again and quickly before the impression died away  such is the word of chaka spoken by me who was his secret councillor the councillor who was seldom seen and never heard does not sigananda yonder know the voice which amongst all those present echoes in his ears alone  i know it cried the old chief  then with his eyes starting almost from his head sigananda leapt up and raising his hand gave the royal salute the bayete to the spirit of chaka as though the dead king stood before him  i think that most of those there thought that it did stand before him for some of them also gave the bayete and even cetewayo raised his arm  sigananda squatted down again and zikali went on  you have heard  this captain of the lion knows his voice  so that is done with  now you ask of me something elsethat i who am a doctor the oldest of all the doctors and it is thoughti know notthe wisest should be able to answer  you ask of mehow shall this war prosper if it is madeand what shall chance to the king during and after the war and lastly you ask of me a sign  what i tell to you is true is it not so  it is true answered the council  asking is easy continued zikali in a grumbling voice but answering is another matter  how can i answer without preparation without the needful medicines also that i have not with me who did not know what would be sought of me who thought that my opinion was desired and no more  go away now and return on the sixth night and i will tell you what i can do  not so cried the king  we refuse to go for the matter is immediate  speak at once opener of roads lest it should be said in the land that after all you are but an ancient cheat a stick that snaps in two when it is leant on  ancient cheat  i remember that is what macumazahn yonder once told me i am though afterwardsperhaps he was right for who in his heart knows whether or not he be a cheat a cheat who deceives himself and through himself others  a stick that snaps in two when it is leant on  some have thought me so and some have thought otherwise  well you would have answers which i know not how to give being without medicine and in face of those who are quite ignorant and therefore cannot lend me their thoughts as it sometimes happens that men do when workers of evil are sought out in the common fashion  for then as you may have guessed it is the evildoer who himself tells the doctor of his crime though he may not know that he is telling it  yet there is another stone that i alone can throw another plan that i alone can practise and that not always  but of this i would not make use since it is terrible and might frighten you or even send you back to your huts raving so that your wives yes and the very dogs fled from you  he stopped and for the first time did something to his fire for i saw his hands going backwards and forwards as though he warmed them at the flames  at length an awed voice i think it was that of dabulamanzi asked  what is this plan inyanga  let us hear that we may judge  the plan of calling one from the dead and hearkening to the voice of the dead  is it your desire that i should draw water from this fount of wisdom o king and councillors    chapter xvi     war      now men began to whisper together and goza groaned at my side  rather would i look down a live lions throat than see the dead he murmured  but i who was anxious to learn how far zikali would carry his tricks contemptuously told him to be silent  presently the king called me to him and said  macumazahn you white men are reported to know all things  tell me now is it possible for the dead to appear  i am not sure i answered doubtfully some say that it is and some say that it is not possible  well said the king  have you ever seen one you knew in life after death  no i replied that isyes  that isi do not know  when you will tell me king where waking ends and sleep begins then i will answer  macumazahn he exclaimed just now i announced that you were no liar who perceive that after all you are a liar for how can you both have seen and not seen the dead  indeed i remember that you lied long ago when you gave it out that the witch mameena was not your lover and afterwards showed that she was by kissing her before all men for who kisses a woman who is not his lover or his mother  return since you will not tell me the truth  so i went back to my stool feeling very small and yet indignant for how was it possible to be definite about ghosts or to explain the exact facts of the mameena myth which clung to me like a waitabit thorn  then after a little consultation cetewayo said  it is our desire o opener of roads that you should draw wisdom from the fount of death if indeed you can do so  now let any who are afraid depart and wait for us who are not afraid alone and in silence at the mouth of the kloof  at this some of the audience rose but after hesitating a little sat down again  only goza actually took a step forward but on my remarking that he would probably meet the dead coming up that way collapsed muttering something about my pistol for the fool seemed to think i could shoot a spirit  if indeed i can do so repeated zikali in a careless fashion that is to be proved is it not  perhaps too it may be better for every one of you if i fail than if i succeed  of one thing i warn you should the dead appear stir not and above all touch not for he who does either of these things will i think never live to look upon the sun again  but first let me try an easier fashion  then once again he took up the skull that he said had been his daughters and whispered to it only to lay it down presently  it will not serve he said with a sigh and shaking his locks noma tells me that she died a child one who had no knowledge of war or matters of policy and that in all these things of the world she still remains a child  she says that i must seek some one who thought much of them one too who still lives in the heart of a man who is present here if that be possible since from such a heart alone can the strength be drawn to enable the dead to appear and speak  now let there be silencelet there be silence and woe to him that breaks it  silence there was indeed and in it zikali crouched himself down till his head almost rested on his knee and seemed to go to sleep  he awoke again and chanted for half a minute or so in some language i could not understand  then voices began to answer him as it seemed to me from all over the kloof also from the sky or rock above  whether the effect was produced by ventriloquism or whether he had confederates posted at various points i do not know  at any rate this lord of multitudes of spirits seemed to be engaged in conversation with some of them  what is more the thing was extremely well done since each voice differed from the other also i seemed to recognize some of them dingaans for instance and pandas yes and that of umbelazi the handsome the brother of the king whose death i witnessed down by the tugela  you will ask me what they said  i do not know  either the words were confused or the events that followed have blotted them from my brain  all i remember is that each of them seemed to be speaking of the zulus and their fate and to be very anxious to refer further discussion of the matter to some one else  in short they seemed to talk under protest or that was my impression although goza the only person with whom i had any subsequent debate upon the subject appeared to have gathered one that was different though what it was i do not recall  the only words that remained clear to me must i thought have come from the spirit of chaka or rather from zikali or one of his myrmidons assuming that character  they were uttered in a deep full voice spiced with mockery and received by the wizard with sibonga or titles of praise which i who am versed in zulu history and idiom knew had only been given to the great king and indeed since his death had become unlawful not to be used  the words were  what thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn do you think yourself a thingthatshouldneverdie that you still sit beneath the moon and weave witchcrafts as of old often have i hunted for you in the underworld who have an account to settle with you as you have an account to settle with me  so so what does it matter since we must meet at last even if you hide yourself at the back of the furthest star  why do you bring me up to this place where i see some whom i would forget  yes they build bone on bone and taking the red earth mould it into flesh and stand before me as last i saw them newly dead  oh your magic is good spellweaver and your hate is deep and your vengeance is keen  no i have nothing to tell you today who rule a greater people than the zulus in another land  who are these little men who sit before you  one of them has a look of dingaan my brother who slew me yes and wears his armlet  is he the king  answer not for i do not care to know  surely yonder withered thing is sigananda  i know his eye and the iziqu on his breast  yes i gave it to him after the great battle with zweede in which he killed five men  does he remember it i wonder  greeting sigananda old as you are you have still twenty and one years to live and then we will talk of the battle with zweede  let me begone this place burns my spirit and in it there is a stench of mortal blood  farewell o conqueror  these were the words that i thought i heard chaka say though i daresay that i dreamt them  indeed had it been otherwise i mean had they really been spoken by zikali there would surely have been more in them something that might have served his purpose not mere talk which had all the inconsequence of a dream  also no one else seemed to pay any particular attention to them though this may have been because so many voices were sounding from different places at once for as i have said zikali arranged his performance very well as well as any medium could have done on a prepared stage in london  in a moment as though at a signal the voices died away  then other things happened  to begin with i felt very faint as though all the strength were being taken out of me  some queer fancy got a hold of me  i dont quite know what it was but it had to do with the bible story of adam when he fell asleep and a rib was removed from him and made into a woman  i reflected that i felt as adam must have done when he came out of his trance after this terrific operation very weak and empty  also as it chanced presently i saw eveor rather a woman  looking at the fire in a kind of disembodied way i perceived that dense smoke was rising from it which smoke spread itself out like a fan  it thinned by degrees and through the veil of smoke i perceived something else namely a woman very like one whom once i had known  there she stood lightly clad enough her fingers playing with the blue beads of her necklace an inscrutable smile upon her face and her large eyes fixed on nothingness  oh heaven i knew her or rather thought i did at the moment for now i am almost sure that it was nombe dressed or undressed for the part  that knowledge came with reflection but then i could have sworn being deceived by the uncertain light that the long dead mameena stood before us as she had seemed to stand before me in the hut of zikali radiating a kind of supernatural life and beauty  a little wind arose shaking the dry leaves of the aloes in the kloof i thought it whisperedhail mameena  some of the older men too among them a few who had seen her die in trembling voices murmured it is mameena whereon zikali scowled at them and they grew silent  as for the figure it stood there patient and unmoved like one who has all time at its disposal playing with the blue beads  i heard them tinkle against each other which proves that it was human for how could a wraith cause beads to tinkle although it is true that christmasstory ghosts are said to clank their chains  her eyes roved idly and without interest over the semicircle of terrified men before her  then by degrees they fixed themselves upon the tree behind which i was crouching whereon goza sank paralyzed to the ground  she contemplated this tree for a while that seemed to me interminable it reminded me of a setter pointing game it winded but could not see for her whole frame grew intent and alert  she ceased playing with the beads and stretched out her slender hand towards me  her lips moved  she spoke in a sweet slow voice saying  o watcherbynight is it thus you greet her to whom you have given strength to stand once more beneath the moon  come hither and tell me have you no kiss for one from whom you parted with a kiss  i heard  without doubt the voice was the very voice of mameena so well had nombe been instructed  still i determined not to obey it who would not be made a public laughingstock for a second time in my life  also i confess this jesting with the dead seemed to me somewhat unholy and not on any account would i take a part in it  all the company turned and stared at me even goza lifted his head and stared but i sat still and contemplated the beauties of the night  if it is the spirit of mameena he will come whispered cetewayo to umnyamana  yes yes answered the prime minister for the rope of his love will draw him  he who has once kissed mameena must kiss her again when she asks  hearing this i grew furiously indignant and was about to break into explanations when to my horror i found myself rising from that stool  i tried to cling to it but as it only came into the air with me let it go  hold me goza i muttered and he like a good fellow clutched me by the ankle whereon i promptly kicked him in the mouth at least my foot kicked him not my will  now i was walking towards that shapeshadow or womanlike a man in his sleep and as i came she stretched out her arms and smiled oh as sweetly as an angel though i felt quite sure that she was nothing of the sort  now i stood opposite to her alongside the fire of which the smoke smelt like roses at the dawn and she seemed to bend towards me with shame and humiliation i perceived that in another moment those arms would be about me  but somehow they never touched me i lost sight of them in the rosescented smoke only the sweet slow voice which i could have sworn was that of mameena murmured in my earwell words known to her and me alone that i had never breathed to any living being though of course i am aware now that they must also have been known to somebody else  do you doubt me any longer went on the murmuring  say am i nombe now oror am i in truth that mameena whose kiss thrills your lips and soul  hearken macumazahn for the time is short in the rout of the great battle that shall be do not fly with the white men but set your face towards ulundi  one who was your friend will guard you and whoever dies no harm shall come to you now that the fire which burns in my heart has set all zululand aflame  hearken once more  hans the little yellow man who was named lightindarkness he who died among the kendah people sends you salutations and gives you praise  he bids me tell you that now of his own accord he renders to me mameena the royal salute because royal i must ever be because also he and i who are so far apart are yet one in the love that is our life  the smoke blew into my face causing me to reel back  cetewayo caught me by the arm saying  tell us are the lips of the dead witch warm or cold  i do not know i groaned for i never touched her  how he lies  oh how he lies even about what our eyes saw said cetewayo reflectively as i blundered past him back to my seat on which i sank half swooning  when i got my wits again the figure that pretended to be mameena was speaking i suppose in answer to some question of zikalis which i had not heard  it said  o lord of the spirits you have called me from the land of spirits to make reply as to two matters which have not yet happened upon the earth  these replies i will give but no others since the mortal strength that i have borrowed returns whence it came  the first matter is if there be war between the white and black what will happen in that war  i see a plain ringed round with hills and on it a strangeshaped mount  i see a great battle i see the white men go down like corn before a tempest i see the spears of the impis redden i see the white soldiers lie like leaves cut from a tree by frost  they are dead all dead save a handful that have fled away  i hear the ingoma of victory sung here at ulundi  it is finished  the second matter iswhat shall chance to the king  i see him tossed on the black water i see him in a land full of houses talking with a royal woman and her councillors  there too he conquers for they offer him tribute of many gifts  i see him here back here in zululand and hear him greeted with the royal salute  last of all i see him dead as men must die and hear the voice of zikali and the mourning of the women of his house it is finished  farewell king cetewayo i pass to tell panda your father how it fares with you  when last we parted did i not prophesy to you that we should meet again at the bottom of a gulf  was it this gulf think you or another  one day you shall learn  farewell or fare ill as it may happen  once more the smoke spread out like a fan  when it thinned and drew together again the shape was gone  now i thought that the zulus would be so impressed by this very queer exhibition that they would seek no more supernatural guidance but make up their minds for war at once  this however was just what they did not do  as it happened among the assembled chiefs was one who himself had a great repute as a witchdoctor and therefore burned with jealousy of zikali who appeared to be able to do things that he had never even attempted  this man leapt up and declared that all which they had seemed to hear and see was but cunning trickery carried out after long preparation by zikali and his confederates  the voices he said came from persons placed in certain spots or sometimes were produced by zikali himself  as for the vision it was not that of a spirit but of a real woman in proof of which he called attention to certain anatomical details of the figure finally with much sense he pointed out that the council would be mad to come to any decision upon such evidence or to give faith to prophecies whereof the truth or falsity could only be known in the future  now a fierce debate broke out the war party maintaining that the manifestations were genuine the peace party that they were a fraud  in the end as neither side would give way and as zikali when appealed to sat silent as a stone refusing any explanation the king said  must we sit here talking talking till daylight  there is but one man who can know the truth that is macumazahn  let him deny it as he will he was the lover of this mameena while she was alive for with my own eyes i saw him kiss her before she killed herself  it is certain therefore that he knows if the woman we seemed to see was mameena or another since there are things which a man never forgets  i propose therefore that we should question him and form our own judgment of his answer  this advice which seemed to promise a road out of a blind ally met with instant acceptance  let it be so they cried with one voice and in another minute i was once more conducted from behind my tree and set down upon the stool in front of the council with my back to the fire and zikali that his eyes might not charm me  now watcherbynight said cetewayo although you have lied to us in a certain matter of this we do not think much since it is one upon which both men and women always lie as every judge will know  therefore we still believe you to be an honest man as your dealings have proved for many years  as an honest man therefore we beg you to give us a true answer to a plain question  was the shape we saw before us just now a woman or a spirit and if a spirit was it the ghost of mameena the beautiful witch who died near this place nearly the quarter of a hundred years ago she whom you loved or who loved you which is just the same thing since a man always loves a woman who loves him or thinks that he does  now after reflection i replied in these words and as conscientiously as i could  king and councillors i do not know if what we all saw was a ghost or a living person but as i do not believe in ghosts or at any rate that they come back to the world on such errands i conclude that it was a living person  still it may have been neither but only a mere picture produced before us by the arts of zikali  so much for the first question  your second iswas this spirit or woman or shadow that of her whom i remember meeting in zululand many years ago  king and councillors i can only say that it was very like her  still one handsome young woman often greatly resembles another of the same age and colouring  further the moon gives an uncertain light especially when it is tempered by smoke from a fire  lastly memory plays strange tricks with all of us as you will know if you try to think of the face of any one who has been dead for more than twenty years  for the rest the voice seemed similar the beads and ornaments seemed similar and the figure repeated to me certain words which i thought i alone had heard come from the lips of her who is dead  also she gave me a strange message from another who is dead referring to a matter which i believed was known only to me and that other  yet zikali is very clever and may have learned these things in some way unguessed by me and what he has learned others may have learned also  king and councillors i do not think that what we saw was the spirit of mameena  i think it a woman not unlike to her who had been taught her lesson  i have nothing more to say and therefore i pray you not to ask me any further questions about mameena of whose name i grow weary  at this point zikali seemed to wake out of his indifference or his torpor for he looked up and said darkly  it is strange that the cleverest are always those who first fall into the trap  they go along gazing at the stars at night and forget the pit which they themselves have dug in the morning ohoho ohoho  now the wrangling broke out afresh  the peace party pointed triumphantly to the fact that i the white man who ought to know put no faith in this apparition which was therefore without doubt a fraud  the war party on the other hand declared that i was deceiving them for reasons of my own one of which would be that i did not wish to see the zulus eat up my people  so fierce grew the debate that i thought it would end in blows and perhaps in an attack on myself or zikali who all the while sat quite careless and unmoved staring at the moon  at length cetewayo shouted for silence spitting as was his habit when angry  make an end he cried lest i cause some of you to grow quiet for ever whereon the recriminations ceased  opener of roads he went on many of those who are present think like macumazahn here that you are but an old cheat though whether or no i be one of these i will not say  they demand a sign of you that none can dispute and i demand it also before i speak the word of peace or war  give us then that sign or begone to whence you came and show your face no more at ulundi  what sign does the council require son of panda asked zikali quietly  let them agree on one together and tell me now at once for i who am old grow weary and would sleep  then if it can be given i will give it and if i cannot give it i will get me back to my own house and show my face no more at ulundi who do not desire to listen again to fools who babble like contending waters round a stone and yet never stir the stone because they run two ways at once  now the councillors stared at each other for none knew what sign to ask  at length old sigananda said  o king it is well known that the black one who went before you had a certain little assegai handled with the royal red wood which drank the blood of many  it was with this assegai that mopo his servant who vanished from the land after the death of dingaan let out the life of the black one at the kraal duguza but what became of it afterwards none have heard for certain some say that it was buried with the black one some that mopo stole it  others that dingaan and umhlagana burned it  still a saying rose like a wind in the land that when that spear shall fall from heaven at the feet of the king who reigns in the place of the black one then the zulus shall make their last great war and win a victory of which all the world shall hear  now let the opener of roads give us this sign of the falling of the black ones spear and i shall be content  would you know the spear if it fell asked cetewayo  i should know it o king who have often held it in my hand the end of the haft is gnawed for when he was angry the black one used to bite it  also a thumbs length from the blade is a black mark made with hot iron  once the black one made a bet with one of his captains that at a distance of ten paces he would throw the spear deeper into the body of a chief whom he wished to kill than the captain could  the captain threw first for i saw him with my eyes and the spear sank to that place on the shaft where the mark is for the black one burned it there  then the black one threw and the spear went through the body of the chief who as he died called to him that he too should know the feel of it in his heart as indeed he did  i think that cetewayo was about to assent to this suggestion since he who desired peace believed it impossible that zikali should suddenly cause this identical spear to fall from heaven but umnyamana the prime induna interposed hurriedly  it is not enough o king  zikali may have stolen the spear for he was living and at the kraal duguza at that time  also he may have put about the prophecy whereof sigananda speaks or at least so men would say  let him give us a greater sign than this that all may be content so that whether we make war or peace it may be with a single mind  now it is known that we zulus have a guardian spirit who watches over us from the skies she who is called nomkubulwana or by some the inkosazanayzulu the princess of heaven  it is known also that this princess who is white of skin and ruddyhaired appears always before great things happen in our land  thus she appeared before the black one died  also she appeared to a number of children before the battle of the tugela  it is said too that but lately she appeared to a woman near the coast and warned her to cross the tugela because there would be war though this woman cannot now be found  let the opener of roads call down nomkubulwana before our eyes from heaven and we will admit every man of us that this is a sign which cannot be questioned  and if he does this thing which i hold no doctor in the world can do what shall it signify asked cetewayo  o king answered umnyamana if he does so it shall signify war and victory  if he does not do so it shall signify peace and we will bow our heads before the amalungwana basi bodwe ie the little english used as a term of derision  do all agree asked cetewayo  we agree answered every man stretching out his hand  then opener of roads it stands thus if you can call nomkubulwana should there be such a spirit to appear before our eyes the council will take it as a sign that the heavens direct us to fight the english  so spoke cetewayo and i noted a tone of triumph in his voice for his heart shrank from this war and he was certain that zikali could do nothing of the sort  still the opinion of the nation or rather of the army was so strong in favour of it that he feared lest his refusal might bring about his deposition if not his death  from this dilemma the supernatural test suggested by the prime minister and approved by the council that represented the various tribes of people seemed to offer a path of escape  so i read the situation as i think rightly  upon hearing these words for the first time that night zikali seemed to grow disturbed  what do my ears hear he exclaimed excitedly  am i the umkulukulu the greatgreat ie god himself that it should be asked of me to draw the princess of heaven from beyond the stars she who comes and goes like the wind but like the wind cannot be commanded  do they hear that if she will not come to my beckoning then the great zulu people must put a yoke upon their shoulders and be as slaves  surely the king must have been listening to the doctrines of those english teachers who wear a white ribbon tied about their necks and tell us of a god who suffered himself to be nailed to a cross of wood rather than make war upon his foes one whom they call the prince of peace times have changed indeed since the days of the black one  yes generals have become like women the captains of the impis are set to milk the cows  well what have i to do with all this what does it matter to me who am so very old that only my head remains above the level of the earth the rest of me being buried in the grave who am not even a zulu to boot but a dwandwe one of the despised dwandwe whom the zulus mocked and conquered  hearken to me spirits of the house of senzangaconahere he addressed about a dozen of cetewayos ancestors by name going back for many generations  hearken to me o princess of heaven appointed by the greatgreat to be the guardian of the zulu race it is asked that you should appear should it be your wish to signify to these your children that they must stand upon their feet and resist the white men who already gather upon their borders  and should it be your wish that they should lay down their spears and go home to sleep with their wives and hoe the gardens while the white men count the cattle and set each to his work upon the roads then that you should not appear  do what you will o spirits of the house of senzangacona do what you will o princess of heaven  what does it matter to the thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn who soon will be as though he never had been born whether the house of senzangacona and the zulu people stand or fall  i the old doctor was summoned here to give counsel  i gave counsel but it passed over the heads of these wise ones like a shadow of which none took note  i was asked to prophesy of what would chance if war came  i called the dead from their graves they came in voices and one of them put on the flesh again and spoke from the lips of flesh  the white man to whom she spoke denied her who had been his love and the wise ones said that she was a cheat yes a doll that i had dressed up to deceive them this spirit that had put on flesh told of what would chance in the war if war there were and what would chance to the king but they mock at the prophecy and now they demand a sign  come then nomkubulwana and give them the sign if you will and let there be war  or stay away and give them no sign if you will and let there be peace  it is nought to me nought to the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn  thus he rambled on as it occurred to me who watched and listened talking against time  for i observed that while he spoke a cloud was passing over the face of the moon and that when he ceased speaking it was quite obscured by this cloud so that the vale of bones was plunged in a deep twilight that was almost darkness  further in a nervous kind of way he did something more to his wizards fire which again caused it to throw out a fan of smoke that hid him and the execution rock in front of which he sat  the cloud floated by and the moon came out as though from an eclipse the smoke of the fire too thinned by degrees  as it melted and the light grew again i became aware that something was materializing or had appeared on the point of the rock above us  a few seconds later to my wonder and amazement i perceived that this something was the spiritlike form of a white woman which stood quite still upon the very point of the rock  she was clad in some garment of gleaming white cut low upon her breast that may have been of linen but from the way it shone suggested that it was of glittering feathers egrets for instance  her ruddy hair was outspread and in it too something glittered like mica or jewels  her feet and milkhued arms were bare and poised in her right hand was a little spear  nor did i see alone since a moan of fear and worship went up from the councillors  then they grew silent stared and stared  suddenly zikali lifted his head and looked at them through the thin flame of the fire which made his eyes shine like those of a tiger or of a cornered baboon  at what do you gaze so hard king and councillors he asked i see nothing  at what then do you gaze so hard  on the rock above you stands a white spirit in her glory  it is the inkosazana herself muttered cetewayo  has she come then mocked the old wizard  nay surely it is but a dream or another of my tricks some black woman painted white that i have smuggled here in my medicine bag or rolled up in the blanket on my back  how can i prove to you that this is not another cheat like to that of the spirit of mameena whom the white man her lover did not know again  go near to her you must not even if you could seeing that if by chance she should not be a cheat you would die every man of you for woe to him whom nomkubulwana touches  how then how  ah i have it doubtless in his pocket macumazahn yonder hides a little gun macumazahn who with such a gun can cut a reed in two at thirty paces or shave the hair from the chin of a man as is well known in the land  let him then take his little gun and shoot at that which you say stands upon the rock  if it be a black woman painted white doubtless she will fall down dead as so many have fallen from that rock  but if it be the princess of heaven then the bullet will pass through her or turn aside and she will take no harm though whether macumazahn will take any harm is more than i can say  now when they heard this many remained silent but some of the peace party began to clamour that i should be ordered to shoot at the apparition  at length cetewayo seemed to give way to this pressure  i say seemed because i think he wished to give way whether or not a spirit stood before him he knew no more than the rest but he did know that unless the vision were proved to be mortal he would be driven into war with the english therefore he took the only chance that remained to him  macumazahn he said i know you have your pistol on you for only the other day you brought it into my presence and through light and darkness you nurse it as a mother does her firstborn now since the opener of roads desires it i command you to fire at that which seems to stand above us  if it be a mortal woman she is a cheat and deserves to die  if it be a spirit from heaven it can take no harm  nor can you take harm who only do that which you must  woman or spirit i will not shoot king i answered  is it so  what do you defy me white man  do so if you will but learn that then your bones shall whiten here in this vale of bones  yes you shall be the first of the english to go below and turning he whispered something to two of the councillors  now i saw that i must either obey or die  for a moment my mind grew confused in face of this awful alternative  i did not believe that i saw a spirit  i believed that what stood above me was nombe cunningly tricked out with some native pigments which at that distance and in that light made her look like a white woman  for oddly enough at that time the truth did not occur to me perhaps because i was too surprised  well if it were nombe she deserved to be shot for playing such a trick and what is more her death by revealing the fraud of zikali would perhaps avert a great war  but then why did he make the suggestion that i should be commanded to fire at this figure  slowly i drew out my pistol and brought it to the full cock for it was loaded  i will obey king i said to save myself from being murdered but on your head be all that may follow from this deed  then it was for the first time that a new idea struck me so clearly that i believe it was conveyed direct from zikalis brain to my own  i might shoot but there was no need for me to hit after that everything grew plain  king i said if yonder be a mortal she is about to die  only a spirit can escape my aim  watch now the centre of her forehead for there the bullet will strike  i lifted the pistol and appeared to cover the figure with much care  as i did so even from that distance i thought i saw a look of terror in its eyes  then i fired with a little jerk of the wrist sending the ball a good yard above her head  she is unharmed cried a voice  macumazahn missed her  macumazahn does not miss i replied loftily  if that at which he aimed is unharmed it is because it cannot be hit  ohoo laughed zikali the white man who does not know the taste of his own loves lips says that he has fired at that which cannot be hit  let him try again  no let him choose another target  the spirit is the spirit but he who summoned her may still be a cheat  there is another bullet in your little gun white man see if it can pierce the heart of zikali that the king and council may learn whether he be a true prophet the greatest of all the prophets that ever was or whether he be but a common cheat  now a sudden rage filled me against this old rascal  i remembered how he had brought mameena to her death when he thought that it would serve him and since then filled the land with stories concerning her and me which met me whatever way i turned  i remembered that for years he had plotted to bring about the destruction of the zulus and to further his dark ends was now engaged in causing a fearful war which would cost the lives of thousands  i remembered that he had trapped me into zululand and then handed me over to cetewayo separating me from my friends who were in my charge and for aught i knew giving them to death  surely the world would be well rid of him  have your will i shouted and covered him with the pistol  then there came into my mind a certain sayingjudge not that ye be not judged  who and what was i that i should dare to arraign and pass sentence upon this man who after all had suffered many wrongs  as i was about to fire i caught sight of some bright object flashing towards the king from above and instantaneously shifted my aim and pressed the trigger  the thing whatever it might be flew in two  one part of it fell upon zikali the other part travelled on and struck cetewayo upon the knee  there followed a great confusion and a cry of the king is stabbed  i ran forward to look and saw the blade of a little assegai lying on the ground and on cetewayos knee a slight cut from which blood trickled  it is nothing i said a scratch no more though had not the spear been stopped in its course it might have been otherwise  yes cried zikali but what was it that caused the cut  take this sigananda and tell me what it may be and he threw towards him a piece of red wood  sigananda looked at it  it is the haft of the black ones spear he exclaimed which the bullet of macumazahn has severed from the blade  aye said zikali and the blade has drawn the blood of the black ones child  read me this omen sigananda or ask it of her who stands above you  now all looked to the rock but it was empty  the figure had vanished  your word king said zikali  is it for peace or war  cetewayo looked at the assegai looked at the blood trickling from his knee looked at the faces of the councillors  blood calls for blood he moaned  my word iswar    chapter xvii     kaatje brings news      zikali burst into one of his peals of laughter so unholy that it caused the blood in me to run cold  the kings word is war he cried  let nomkubulwana take that word back to heaven  let macumazahn take it to the white men  let the captains cry it to the regiments and let the world grow red  the king has chosen though mayhap had i been he i should have chosen otherwise yet what am i but a hollow reed stuck in the ground up which the spirits speak to men  it is finished and i too am finished for a while  farewell o king where shall we meet again i wonder  on the earth or under it farewell macumazahn i know where we shall meet though you do not  o king i return to my own place i pray you to command that none come near me or trouble me with words for i am spent  it is commanded said cetewayo  as he spoke the fire went out mysteriously and the wizard rose and hobbled off at a surprising pace round the corner of the projecting rock  stay i called i would speak with you but although i am sure he heard me he did not stop or look round  i sprang up to follow him but at some sign from cetewayo two indunas barred my way  did you not hear the kings command white man one of them asked coldly and the tone of his question told me that war having been declared i was now looked upon as a foe  i was about to answer sharply when cetewayo himself addressed me  macumazahn he said you are now my enemy like all your people and from sunrise tomorrow morning your safeconduct here ends for if you are found at ulundi two hours after that time it will be lawful for any man to kill you  yet as you are still my guest i will give you an escort to the borders of the land moreover you shall take a message from me to the queens officers and captains  it isthat i will send an answer to their demands upon the point of an assegai  yet add this that not i but the english to whom i have always been a friend sought this war  if sompseu had suffered me to fight the boers as i wished to do it would never have come about  but he threw the queens blanket over the transvaal and stood upon it and now he declares that lands which were always the property of the zulus belong to the boers  therefore i take back all the promises which i made to him when he came hither to call me king in the queens name and no more do i call him my father  as for the disbanding of my impis let the english disband them if they can  i have spoken  and i have heard i answered and will deliver your words faithfully though i hold king that they come from the lips of one whom the heavens have made mad  at this bold speech some of the councillors started up with threatening gestures  cetewayo waved them back and answered quietly perhaps it was the queen of heaven who stood on yonder rock who made me mad  or perhaps she made me wise as being the spirit of our people she should surely do  that is a question which the future will decide and if ever we should meet after it is decided we will talk it over  now hamba gachle go in peace  i hear the king and i will go but first i would speak with zikali  then white man you must wait till this war is finished or till you meet him in the land of spirits  goza lead macumazahn back to his hut and set a guard about it  at the dawn a company of soldiers will be waiting with orders to take him to the border you will go with him and answer for his safety with your life let him be well treated on the road as my messenger  then cetewayo rose and stood while all present gave him the royal salute after which he walked away down the kloof  i remained for a moment making pretence to examine the blade of the little assegai that had been thrown by the figure on the rock which i had picked from the ground  this historical piece of iron which i have no doubt is the same that chaka always carried wherewith too he is said to have killed his mother nandie by the way i still possess for i slipped it into my pocket and none tried to take it from me  really however i was wondering whether i could in any way gain access to zikali a problem that was settled for me by a sharp request to move on uttered in a tone which admitted of no further argument  well i trudged back to my hut in the company of goza who was so overcome by all the wonders he had seen that he could scarcely speak  indeed when i asked him what he thought of the figure that had appeared upon the rock he replied petulantly that it was not given to him to know whence spirits came or of what stuff they were made which showed me that he at any rate believed in its supernatural origin and that it had appeared to direct the zulus to make war  this was all i wanted to find out so i said nothing more but gave up my mind to thought of my own position and difficulties  here i was ordered on pain of death to depart from ulundi at the dawn  and yet how could i obey without seeing zikali and learning from him what had happened to anscombe and heda or at any rate without communicating with him  once more only did i break silence offering to give goza a gun if he would take a message from me to the great wizard  but with a shake of his big head he answered that to do so would mean death and guns were of no good to a dead man since as i had shown myself that night they had no power to shoot a spirit  this closed the business on which i need not have troubled to enter since an answer to all my questionings was at hand  we reached the hut where goza gave me over to the guard of soldiers telling their officer that none were to be permitted to enter it save myself and that i was not to be to permitted to come out of it until he goza came to fetch me a little before the dawn  the officer asked if any one else was to be permitted to come out a question that surprised me though vaguely for i was thinking of other things  then goza departed remarking that he hoped i should sleep better than he would who felt spirits in his bones and did not wish to kiss them as i seemed to like to do  i replied facetiously thinking of the bottle of brandy that ere long i meant to feel them in my stomach whereat he shook his head again with the air of one whom nothing connected with me could surprise and vanished  i crawled into the hut and put the board over the beeholelike entrance behind me  then i began to hunt for the matches in my pocket and pricked my finger with the point of chakas historical assegai  while i was sucking it to my amazement i heard the sound of some one breathing on the further side of the hut  at first i thought of calling the guard but on reflection found the matches and lit the candle which stood by the blankets that served me as a bed  as soon as it burned up i looked towards the sound and to my horror perceived the figure of a sleeping woman which frightened me so much that i nearly dropped the candle  to tell the truth so obsessed was i with zikali and his ghosts that for a few moments it occurred to me that this might be the shape with which i had talked an hour or two before  i mean that which had seemed to resemble the longdead lady mameena or rather the person made up to her likeness come here to continue our conversation  at any rate i was sure and rightly that here was more of the handiwork of zikali who wished to put me in some dreadful position for reasons of his own  pulling myself together i advanced upon the lady only to find myself no wiser since she was totally covered by a kaross  now what was to be done  to escape of which of course i had thought at once was impossible since it meant an assegai in my ribs  to call to the guard for help seemed indiscreet for who knew what those fools might say  to kick or shake her would undoubtedly be rude and if it chanced to be the person who had played mameena would certainly provoke remarks that i should not care to face there seemed to be only one resource to sit down and wait till she woke up  this i did for quite a long time till at last the absurdity of the position and i will admit my own curiosity overcame me especially as i was very tired and wanted to go to sleep  so advancing most gingerly i turned down the kaross from over the head of the sleeping woman much wondering whom i should see for what man is there that a veiled woman does not interest  indeed does not half the interest of woman lie in the fact that her nature is veiled from man in short a mystery which he is always seeking to solve at his peril and i might add never succeeds in solving  well i turned down that kaross and next instant stepped back amazed and to tell the truth somewhat disappointed for there with her mouth open lay no wondrous and spiritual mameena but the stout earthly and most prosaickaatje  confound the woman thought i to myself  what is she doing here  then i remembered how wrong it was to give way to a sense of romantic disappointment at such a time though as a matter of fact it is always in a moment of crisis or of strained nerves that we are most open to the insidious advances of romance  also that there was no one on earth or beyond it whom i ought more greatly to have rejoiced to see  i had left kaatje with anscombe and heda therefore kaatje could tell me what had become of them and at this thought my heart sankwhy was she here in this most inappropriate meetingplace alone  feeling that these were questions which must be answered at once i prodded kaatje in the ribs with my toe until after a good deal of prodding she awoke sat up and yawned revealing an excellent set of teeth in her cavernous quartercast mouth  then perceiving a man she opened that mouth even wider as i thought with the idea of screaming for help  but here i was first with her for before a sound could issue i had filled it full with the corner of the kaross exclaiming in dutch as i did so  idiot of a woman do you not know the heer quatermain when you see him  oh baas she answered i thought you were some wicked zulu come to do me a mischief then she burst into tears and sobs which i could not stop for at least three minutes  be quiet you fat fool i cried exasperated and tell me where are your mistress and the heer anscombe  i dont know baas but i hope in heaven kaatje was some kind of a christian she replied between her sobs  in heaven  what do you mean i asked horrified  i mean baas that i hope they are in heaven because when last i saw them they were both dead and dead people must be either in heaven or hell and heaven they say is better than hell  dead  where did you see them dead  in that black kloof baas some days after you left us and went away  the old baboon man who is called zikali gave us leave through the witchgirl nombe to go also  so the baas anscombe set to work to inspan the horses the missie heda helping him while i packed the things  when i had nearly finished nombe came smiling like a cat that has caught two mice and beckoned to me to follow her  i went and saw the cart inspanned with the four horses all looking as though they were asleep for their heads hung down  then after she had stared at me for a long while nombe led me past the horses into the shadow of the overhanging cliff  there i saw my mistress and the baas anscombe lying side by side quite dead  how do you know that they were dead i gasped  what had killed them  i know that they were dead because they were dead baas their mouths and eyes were open and they lay upon their backs with their arms stretched out  the witchgirl nombe said some kaffirs had come and strangled them and then gone away again or so i understood who cannot speak zulu so very well  who the kaffirs were or why they came she did not say  then what did you do i asked  i ran back to the hut baas fearing lest i should be strangled also and wept there till i grew hungry  when i came out of it again they were gone  nombe showed me a place under a tree where the earth was disturbed  she said that they were buried there by order of her master zikali  i dont know what became of the horses or the cart  and what happened to you afterwards  baas i was kept for several days i cannot remember how many and only allowed out within the fence round the huts  nombe came to see me once bringing this and she produced a package sewn up in a skin  she said that i was to give it to you with a message that those whom you loved were quite safe with one who is greater than any in the land and therefore that you must not grieve for them whose troubles were over  i think it was two nights after this that four zulus came two men and two women and led me away as i thought to kill me  but they did not kill me indeed they were very kind to me although when i spoke to them they pretended not to understand  they took me a long journey travelling for the most part in the dark and sleeping in the day  this evening when the sun set they brought me through a kaffir town and thrust me into the hut where i am without speaking to any one  here being very tired i went to sleep and that is all  and quite enough too thought i to myself  then i put her through a crossexamination but kaatje was a stupid woman although a good and faithful servant and all her terrible experiences had not sharpened her intelligence  indeed when i pressed her she grew utterly confused began to cry thereby taking refuge in the last impregnable female fortification and snivelled out that she could not bear to talk of her dear mistress any more  so i gave it up and two minutes later she was literally snoring being very tired poor thing  now i tried to think matters out as well as this disturbance would allow for nothing hinders thought so much as snores  but what was the use of thinking  there was her story to take or to leave and evidently the honest creature believed what she said further how could she be deceived on such a point  she swore that she had seen anscombe and heda dead and afterwards had seen their graves  moreover there was confirmation in nombes message which could not well have been invented that spoke of their being well in the charge of a great one a term by which the zulus designate god with all their troubles finished  the reason and manner of their end were left unrevealed  zikali might have murdered them for his own purposes or the zulus might have killed them in obedience to the kings order that no white people in the land were to be allowed to live  or perhaps the basutos from sekukunis country with whom the zulus had some understanding had followed and done them to death indeed the strangling sounded more basuto than zuluif they were really strangled  almost overcome though i was i bethought me of the package and opened it only to find another apparent proof of their end for it contained hedas jewels as i had found them in the bag in the safe also a spare gold watch belonging to anscombe with his coatofarms engraved upon it  that which he wore was of silver and no doubt was buried with him since for superstitious reasons the natives would not have touched anything on his person after death  this seemed to me to settle the matter presumptively at any rate since to show that robbery was not the cause of their murder their most valuable possessions which were not upon their persons had been sent to me their friend  so this was the end of all my efforts to secure the safety and wellbeing of that most unlucky pair  i wept when i thought of it there in the darkness of the hut for the candle had burned out and going on to my knees put up an earnest prayer for the welfare of their souls also that i might be forgiven my folly in leading them into such danger  and yet i did it for the best trying to judge wisely in the light of such experience of the world as i possessed  now alas when i am old i have come to the conclusion that those things which one tries to do for the best one generally does wrong because nearly always there is some tricky fate at hand to mar them which in this instance was named zikali  the fact is i suppose that man who thinks himself a free agent can scarcely be thus called at any rate so far as immediate results are concerned  but that is a dangerous doctrine about which i will say no more for i daresay that he is engaged in weaving a great lifepattern of which he only sees the tiniest piece  one thing comforted me a little  if these two were dead i could now leave zululand without qualms  of course i was obliged to leave in any case or die but somehow that fact would not have eased my conscience  indeed i think that had i believed they still lived in this way or in that i should have tried not to leave because i should have thought it for the best to stay to help them whereby in all human probability i should have brought about my own death without helping them at all  well it had fallen out otherwise and there was an end  now i could only hope that they had gone to some place where there are no more troubles even if at the worst it were a place of rest too deep for dreams  musing thus at last i dozed off for i was so tired that i think i should have slept although execution awaited me at the dawn instead of another journey  i did not sleep well because of that snoring female on the other side of the hut whose presence outraged my sense of propriety and caused me to be invaded by prophetic dreams of the talk that would ensue among those scandalmongering zulus  yes it was of this i dreamed not of the great dangers that threatened me or of the terrible loss of my friends perhaps because to many men of whom i suppose i am one the fear of scandal or of being the object of public notice is more than the fear of danger or the smart of sorrow  so the night wore away till at length i woke to see the gleam of dawn penetrating the smokehole and dimly illuminating the recumbent form of kaatje which to me looked most unattractive presently i heard a discreet tapping on the doorboard of the hut which i at once removed wriggling swiftly through the hole careless in my misery as to whether i met an assegai the other side of it or not  without a guard of eight soldiers was standing and with them goza who asked me if i were ready to start  quite i answered as soon as i have saddled my horse which by the way had been led up to the hut  very soon this was done for i brought out most of my few belongings with me and the bag of jewels was in my pocket  then it was that the officer of the guard a thin and melancholylooking person said in a hollow voice addressing himself to goza  the orders are that the white mans wife is to go with him where is she  where a mans wife should be in his hut i suppose answered goza sleepily  rage filled me at the words  seldom do i remember being so angry  yes i said if you mean that halfcast whom someone has thrust upon me she is in there  so if she is to come with us perhaps you will get her out  thus adjured the melancholylooking captain who was named indudu perhaps because he or his father had longed to the dudu regiment crawled into the hut whence presently emerged sounds not unlike those which once i heard when a ringhals cobra followed a hare that i had wounded into a hole a muffled sound of struggling and terror  these ended in the sudden and violent appearance of kaatjes fat and dishevelled form followed by that of the snakelike indudu  seeing me standing there before a bevy of armed zulus she promptly fell upon my neck with a cry for help for the silly woman thought she was going to be killed by them  gripping me as an octopus grips its prey she proceeded to faint dragging me to my knees beneath the weight of eleven stone of solid flesh  ah said one of the zulus not unkindly she is much afraid for her husband whom she loves  well i disentangled myself somehow and seizing what i took to be a gourd of water in that dim light poured it over her head only to discover too late that it was not water but clotted milk however the result was the same for presently she sat up made a dreadfullooking object by this liberal application of curds and whey whereon i explained matters to her to the best of my power the end of it was that after indudu and goza had wiped her down with tufts of thatch dragged from the hut and i had collected her gear with the rest of my own we set her on the horse straddlewise and started the objects of much interest among such zulus as were already abroad  at the gate of the town there was a delay which made me nervous since in such a case as mine delay might always mean a deathwarrant  i knew that it was quite possible cetewayo had changed or been persuaded to change his mind and issue a command that i should be killed as one who had seen and knew too much indeed this fear was my constant companion during all the long journey to the drift of the tugela causing me to look askance at every man we met or who overtook us lest he should prove to be a messenger of doom  nor were these doubts groundless for as i learned in the after days the prime minister umnyamana and others had urged cetewayo strongly to kill me and what we were waiting for at the gate were his final orders on the subject  however in this matter as in more that i could mention the king played the part of a man of honour and although he seemed to hesitate for reasons of policy never had any intention of allowing me to be harmed  on the contrary the command brought was that any one who harmed macumazahn the kings guest and messenger should die with all his house  whilst we tarried a number of women gathered round us whose conversation i could not help overhearing  one of them said to another  look at the white man watcherbynight who can knock a fly off an oxs horn with a bullet from further away than we could see it  he it was who loved and was loved by the witch mameena whose beauty is still famous in the land  they say she killed herself for his sake because she declared that she would never live to grow old and ugly so that he turned away from her  my mother told me all about it only last night  then you have a liar for a mother thought i to myself for to contradict such a one openly would have been undignified  is it so asked one of her friends deeply interested  then the lady mameena must have had a strange taste in men for this one is an ugly little fellow with hair like the grey ash of stubble and a wrinkled face of the colour of a flayed skin that has lain unstretched in the sun  however i have been told that witches always love those who look unnatural  yes said number one but you see now that he is old he has to be satisfied with a different sort of wife  she is not beautiful is she although she has dipped her head in milk to make herself look white  so it went on till at length a runner arrived and whispered something to indudu who saluted showing me that it was a royal message and ordered us to move  of this i was glad for had i stopped there much longer i think i should have personally assaulted those gossiping female idiots   of our journey through zululand there is nothing particular to say  we saw but few people since most of the men had been called up to the army and many of the kraals seemed to be deserted by the women and children who perhaps were hidden away with the cattle  once however we met an impi about five thousand strong that seemed to cover the hillside like a herd of game  it consisted of the nodwengu and the nokenke regiments both of which afterwards fought at isandhlwana  some of their captains with a small guard came to see who we were fine fiercelooking men  they stared at me curiously and with one of them whom i knew i had a little talk  he said that i was the last white man in zululand and that i was lucky to be alive for soon these and he pointed to the hordes of warriors who were streaming past would eat up the english to the last bone  i answered that this remained to be seen as the english were also great eaters whereat he laughed replying that it was true that the white men had already taken the first bitea very little one from which i gathered that some small engagement had happened  well farewell macumazahn he said as he turned to go i hope that we shall meet in the battle for i want to see if you can run as well as you can shoot  this roused my temper and i answered him  i hope for your sake that we shall not meet for if we do i promise that before i run i will show you what you never saw before the gateway of the world of spirits  i mention this conversation because by some strange chance it happened at isandhlwana that i killed this man who was named simpofu  during all those days of trudging through hot suns and thunderstorms for i had to give up the mare to kaatje who was too fat to walk or said she was i was literally haunted by thoughts of my murdered friends  heaven knows how bitterly i reproached myself for having brought them into zululand  it seemed so terribly sad that these young people who loved each other and had so bright a future before them should have escaped from a tragic past merely to be overwhelmed by such a fate again and again i questioned that lump kaatje as to the details of their end and of all that went before and followed after the murder  but it was quite useless indeed as time went on she seemed to become more nebulous on the point as though a picture were fading from her mind  but as to one thing she was always quite clear that she had seen them dead and had seen their newmade grave this she swore by god in heaven completing the oath with an outburst of tears in a way that would have carried conviction to any jury as it did to me  and after all what was more likely in the circumstances  zikali had killed them or caused them to be killed or possibly they were killed in spite of him in obedience to the express or general order of the king if the deed was not done by the basutos  and yet an idea occurred to me  how about the woman on the rock that the zulus thought was their princess of the heavens  obviously this must be nonsense since no such deity existed therefore the person must either have been a white woman or one painted up to resemble a white woman seen from a distance in moonlight it was impossible to say which  now if it were a white woman she might from her shape and height and the colour of her hair be heda herself  yet it seemed incredible that heda whom kaatje had seen dead some days before could be masquerading in such a part and make no sign of recognition to me even when i covered her with my pistol whereas that nombe would play it was likely enough  only then nombe must be something of a quickchange artist since but a little while before she was beyond doubt personating the dead mameena  if it were not so i must have been suffering from illusions for certainly i seemed to see some one who looked like mameena and only zikali and through him nombe had sufficient knowledge to enable her to fill that role with such success perhaps the whole business was an illusion though if so zikalis powers must be great indeed  but then how about the assegai that nomkubulwana or rather her effigy had seemed to hold and throw whereof the blade was at present in my saddlebag  that at any rate was tangible and real though of course there was nothing to prove that it had really been chakas famous weapon  another thing that tormented me was my failure to see zikali  i felt as though i had committed a crime in leaving zululand without doing this and hearing from his own lipswell whatever he chose to tell me  i forget if i said that while we were waiting at the gate where those silly women talked so much nonsense about mameena and kaatje that i made another effort through goza to get into touch with the wizard but quite without avail  goza only answered what he said before that if i wished to die at once i had better take ten steps towards the valley of bones whence he added parenthetically the opener of roads had already departed on his homeward journey  this might or might not be true at any rate i could find no possible way of coming face to face with him or even of getting a message to his ear no i was not to blame i had done all i could and yet in my heart i felt guilty  but then as cynics would say failure is guilt  at length we came to the ford of the tugela and as fortunately the water was just low enough bade farewell to our escort before crossing to the natal side  my parting with goza was quite touching for we felt that it partook of the nature of a deathbed adieu which indeed it did  i told him and the others that i hoped their ends be easy and that whether they met them by bullets or by bayonet thrusts the wounds would prove quickly mortal so that they might not linger in discomfort or pain recognizing my kind thought for their true welfare they thanked me for it though with no enthusiasm  indudu however filled with the spirit of repartee or rather of tu quoque said in his melancholy fashion that if he and i came face to face in war he would be sure to remember my words and to cut me up in the best style since he could not bear to think of me languishing on a bed of sickness without my wife kaatje to nurse me they knew i was touchy about kaatje  then we shook hands and parted kaatje hung round with paraphernalia like the white knight in alice through the lookingglass clinging to a cookingpot and weeping tears of terror faced the foaming flood upon the mare while i grasped its tail  when we were as i judged out of assegai shot i turned with the water up to my armpits and shouted some valedictory words  tell your king i said that he is the greatest fool in the world to fight the english since it will bring his country to destruction and himself to disgrace and death as at last in the words of your proverb the swimmer goes down with the stream  here as it happened i slipped off the stone on which i was standing and nearly went down with the stream myself  emerging with my mouth full of muddy water i waited till they had done laughing and continued  tell that old rogue zikali that i know he has murdered my friends and that when we meet again he and all who were in the plot shall pay for it with their lives  now an irritated zulu flung an assegai and as the range proved to be shorter than i thought for it went through kaatjes dress causing her to scream with alarm i ceased from eloquence and we struggled on to the further bank where at length we were safe  thus ended this unlucky trip of mine to zululand    chapter xviii     isandhlwana      we had crossed the tugela by what is known as the middle drift a mile or so on the further side of it i was challenged by a young fellow in charge of some mounted natives and found that i had stumbled into what was known as no 2 column which consisted of a rocket battery three battalions of the native contingent and some troops of mounted natives all under the command of colonel durnford re  after explanations i was taken to this officers headquarter tent  he was a tall nervouslooking man with a fair handsome face and long sidewhiskers  one of his arms i remember was supported by a sling i think it had been injured in some kaffir fighting  when i was introduced to him he was very busy having i understood from some one on his staff just received orders to operate against matshana  learning that i had come from zululand and was acquainted with the zulus he at once began to crossexamine me about matshana a chief of whom he seemed to know very little indeed  i told him what i could which was not much and before i could give him any information of real importance was shown out and most hospitably entertained at luncheon a meal of which i partook with gratitude in some garments that i had borrowed from one of the officers while my own were set in the sun to dry  well can i recall how much i enjoyed the first whisky and soda that i had tasted since i left the temple and the good english food by which it was accompanied  presently i remembered kaatje whom i had left outside with some native women and went to see what had happened to her  i found her finishing a hearty meal and engaged in conversation with a young gentleman who was writing in a notebook  afterwards i discovered that he was a newspaper correspondent  what she told him and what he imagined i do not know but i may as well state the results at once  within a few days there appeared in one of the natal papers and for aught i know all over the earth an announcement that mr allan quatermain a wellknown hunter in zululand after many adventures had escaped from that country together with his favourite native wife the only survivor of his extensive domestic establishment  then followed some wild details as to the murder of my other wives by a zulu wizard called road mender or sick ass ie opener of roads or zikali and so on  i was furious and interviewed the editor a mild and apologetic little man who assured me that the despatch was printed exactly as it had been received as though that bettered the case  after this i commenced an action for libel but as i was absent through circumstances over which i had no control when it came on for trial the case was dismissed  i suppose the truth was that they mixed me up with a certain wellknown white man in zululand who had a large domestic establishment but however this may be it was a long while before i heard the last of that favourite native wife  later in the day i and kaatje who stuck to me like a burr departed from the camp  the rest of our journey was uneventful except for more misunderstandings about kaatje one of which wherein a clergyman was concerned was too painful to relate  at last we reached maritzburg where i deposited kaatje in a boardinghouse kept by another halfcast and with a sigh of relief betook myself to the plough hotel which was a long way off her  subsequently she obtained a place as a cook at howick and for a while i saw her no more  at maritzburg as in duty bound i called upon various persons in authority and delivered cetewayos message leaving out all zikalis witchcraft which would have sounded absurd  it did not produce much impression as hostilities having already occurred it was superfluous  also no one was inclined to pay attention to the words of one who was neither an official nor a military officer but a mere hunter supposed to have brought a native wife out of zululand  i did however report the murder of anscombe and heda though in such times this caused no excitement especially as they were not known to the officials concerned with such matters  indeed the occurrence never so much as got into the papers any more than did the deaths of rodd and marnham on the borders of sekukunis country  when people are expecting to be massacred themselves they do not trouble about the past killing of others far away lastly i posted marnhams will to the pretoria bank advising them that they had better keep it safely until some claim arose and deposited hedas jewels and valuables in another branch of the same bank in maritzburg with a sealed statement as to how they came into my possession  these things done i found it necessary to turn myself to the eternal problem of earning my living  i am a very rich man now as i write these reminiscences here in yorkshireking solomons mines made me thatbut up to the time of my journey to kukuana land with my friends curtis and good although plenty of money passed through my hands on one occasion and another little of it ever seemed to stick  in this way or that it was lost or melted also i was not born one to make the best of his opportunities in the way of acquiring wealth  perhaps this was good for me since if i had gained the cash early i should not have met with the experiences and during our few transitory years experience is of more real value than cash  it may prepare us for other things beyond whereas the mere possession of a bank balance can prepare us for nothing in a land where gold ceases to be an object of worship as it is here  yet wealth is our god not knowledge or wisdom a fact which shows that the real essence of christianity has not yet permeated human morals  it just runs over their surface no more and for every eye that is turned towards the divine vision a thousand are fixed night and day upon mammons glittering image  now i owned certain wagons and oxen and just then the demand for these was keen  so i hired them out to the military authorities for service in the war and incidentally myself with them  i drove what i considered a splendid bargain with an officer who wrote as many letters after his name as a governorgeneral but was really something quite humble  at least i thought it splendid until outside his tent i met a certain transport rider of my acquaintance whom i had always looked upon as a perfect fool who told me that not half an hour before he had got twenty per cent more for unsalted oxen and very rickety wagons however it did not matter much in the end as the whole outfit was lost at isandhlwana and owing to the lack of some formality which i had overlooked i never recovered more than a tithe of their value  i think it was that i neglected to claim within a certain specified time  at last my wagons were laden with ammunition and other government goods and i trekked over awful roads to helpmakaar a place on the highlands not far from rorkes drift where no 3 column was stationed  here we were delayed awhile i and my wagons having moved to a ford of the buffalo together with many others  it was during this time that i ventured to make very urgent representations to certain highly placed officers i will not mention which as to the necessity of laagering that is forming fortified camps as soon as zululand was entered since from my intimate knowledge of its people i was sure that they would attack in force  these warnings of mine were received with the most perfect politeness and offers of gin to drink which all transport riders were supposed to love but in effect were treated with the contempt that they were held to deserve  the subject is painful and one on which i will not dwell  why should i complain when i know that cautions from notable persons such as sir melmoth osborn and j j uys a member of one the old dutch fighting families met with a like fate  by the way it was while i was waiting on the banks of the river that i came across an old friend of mine a zulu named magepa with whom i had fought at the battle of the tugela  a few days later this man performed an extraordinary feat in saving his grandchild from death by his great swiftness in running whereof i have preserved a note somewhere or other  ultimately on january 11 we received our marching orders and crossed the river by the drift the general scheme of the campaign being that the various columns were to converge upon ulundi  the roads if so they can be called were in such a fearful state that it took us ten days to cover as many miles at length we trekked over a stony nek about five hundred yards in width  to the right of us was a stony eminence and to our left its sheer brown cliffs of rock rising like the walls of some cyclopean fortress the strange abrupt mount of isandhlwana which reminded me of a huge lion crouching above the hillencircled plain beyond  at the foot of this isolated mount whereof the aspect somehow filled me with alarm we camped on the night of january 21 taking no precautions against attack by way of laagering the wagons  indeed the last thing that seemed to occur to those in command was that there would be serious fighting men marched forward to their deaths as though they were going on a shootingparty or to a picnic  i even saw cricketing bats and wickets occupying some of the scanty space upon the wagons  now i am not going to set out all the military details that preceded the massacre of isandhlwana for these are written in history  it is enough to say that on the night of january 21 major dartnell who was in command of the natal mounted police and had been sent out to reconnoitre the country beyond isandhlwana reported a strong force of zulus in front of us thereon lord chelmsford the generalinchief moved out from the camp at dawn to his support taking with him six companies of the 24th regiment together with four guns and the mounted infantry there were left in the camp two guns and about eight hundred white and nine hundred native troops also some transport riders such as myself and a number of miscellaneous campfollowers  i saw him go from between the curtains of one of my wagons where i had made my bed on the top of a pile of baggage  indeed i had already dressed myself at the time for that night i slept very ill because i knew our danger and my heart was heavy with fear  about ten oclock in the morning colonel durnford whom i have mentioned already rode up with five hundred natal zulus about half of whom were mounted and two rocket tubes which of course were worked by white men  this was after a patrol had reported that they had come into touch with some zulus on the left front who retired before them  as a matter of fact these zulus were foraging in the mealie fields since owing to the drought food was very scarce in zululand that year and the regiments were hungry  i happened to see the meeting between colonel pulleine a short stout man who was then in command of the camp and colonel durnford who as his senior officer took it over from him and heard colonel pulleine say that his orders were to defend the camp but what else passed between them i do not know  presently colonel durnford saw and recognized me  do you think the zulus will attack us mr quatermain he said  i dont think so sir i answered as it is the day of the new moon which they hold unlucky  but tomorrow it may be different  then he gave certain orders dispatching captain george shepstone with a body of mounted natives along the ridge to the left where presently they came in contact with the zulus about three miles away and making other dispositions  a little later he moved out to the front with a strong escort followed by the rocket battery which ultimately advanced to a small conical hill on the left front round which it passed never to return again  just before he started colonel durnford seeing me still standing there asked me if i would like to accompany him adding that as i knew the zulus so well i might be useful  i answered certainly and called to my head driver a man named jan to bring me my mare the same that i had ridden out of zululand while i slipped into the wagon and in addition to the beltful that i wore filled all my available pockets with cartridges for my doublebarrelled express rifle  as i mounted i gave jan certain directions about the wagon and oxen to which he listened and then to my astonishment held out his hand to me saying  goodbye baas  you have been a kind master to me and i thank you  why do you say that i asked  because baas all the kaffirs declare that the great zulu impi will be on to us in an hour or two and eat up every man  i cant tell how they know it but so they swear  nonsense i answered it is the day of new moon when the zulus dont fight  still if anything of the sort should happen you and the other boys had better slip away to natal since the government must pay for the wagons and oxen  this i said half joking but it was a lucky jest for jan and the rest of my servants since they interpreted it in earnest and with the exception of one of them who went back to get a gun got off before the zulu horn closed round the camp and crossed the river in safety  next moment i was cantering away after colonel durnford whom i caught up about a quarter of a mile from the camp  now of course i did not see all of the terrible battle that followed and can only tell of that part of it in which i had a share  colonel durnford rode out about three and a half miles to the left front i really dont quite know why for already we were hearing firing on the top of the nqutu hills almost behind us where captain shepstone was engaging the zulus or so i believe  suddenly we met a trooper of the natal carabineers whose name was whitelaw who had been out scouting  he reported that an enormous impi was just ahead of us seated in an umkumbi or semicircle as is the fashion of the zulus before they charge  at least some of them he said were so seated but others were already advancing  presently these appeared over the crest of the hill ten thousand of them i should say and amongst them i recognized the shields of the nodwengu the dududu the nokenke and the ingobamakosi regiments  now there was nothing to be done except retreat for the impi was attacking in earnest  the general untshingwayo together with undabuko cetewayos brother and the chief usibebu who commanded the scouts had agreed not to fight this day for the reason i have given because it was that of the new moon but circumstances had forced their hand and the regiments could no longer be restrained  so to the number of twenty thousand or more say onethird of the total zulu army they hurled themselves upon the little english force that owing to lack of generalship was scattered here and there over a wide front and had no fortified base upon which to withdraw  we fell back to a donga which we held for a little while and then as we saw that there we should presently be overwhelmed withdrew gradually for another two miles or so keeping off the zulus by our fire  in so doing we came upon the remains of the rocket battery near the foot of the conical hill i have mentioned which had been destroyed by some regiment that passed behind us in its rush on the camp  there lay all the soldiers dead assegaied through and through and i noticed that one young fellow who had been shot through the head still held a rocket in his hands  now somewhat behind and perhaps half a mile to the right of this hill a long shallow donga runs across the isandhlwana plain this we gained and being there reinforced by about fifty of the natal carabineers under captain bradstreet held it for a long while keeping off the zulus by our terrible fire which cut down scores of them every time they attempted to advance  at this spot i alone killed from twelve to fifteen of them for if the big bullet from my express rifle struck a man he did not live messengers were sent back to the camp for more ammunition but none arrived heaven knows why  my own belief is that the reserve cartridges were packed away in boxes and could not be got at  at last our supply began to run short so there was nothing to be done except retreat upon the camp which was perhaps half a mile behind us  taking advantage of a pause in the zulu advance which had lain down while waiting for reserves colonel durnford ordered a retirement that was carried out very well  up to that time we had lost only quite a few men for the zulu fire was wild and high and they had not been able to get at us with the assegai as we rode towards the mount i observed that firing was going on in all directions especially on the nek that connected it with the nqutu range where captain shepstone and his mounted basutos were wiped out while trying to hold back the zulu right horn the guns too were firing heavily and doing great execution  after this all grew confused  colonel durnford gave orders to certain officers who came up to him captain essex was one and lieutenant cochrane another  then his force made for their wagons to get more ammunition  i kept near to the colonel and a while later found myself with him and a large mixed body of men a little to the right of the nek which we had crossed in our advance from the river  not long afterwards there was a cry of the zulus are getting round us and looking to the left i saw them pouring in hundreds across the ridge that joins isandhlwana mountain to the nqutu range  also they were advancing straight on to the camp  then the rout began  already the native auxiliaries were slipping away and now the others followed  of course this battle was but a small affair yet i think that few have been more terrible at any rate in modern times  the aspect of those plumed and shielded zulus as they charged shouting their warcries and waving their spears was awesome  they were mown down in hundreds by the martini fire but still they came on and i knew that the game was up  a maddened horde of fugitives mostly natives began to flow past us over the nek making for what was afterwards called fugitives drift nine miles away and with them went white soldiers some mounted some on foot mingled with all these people following them on either side of them rushed zulus stabbing as they ran  other groups of soldiers formed themselves into rough squares on which the savage warriors broke like water on a rock  by degrees ammunition ran out only the bayonet remained  still the zulus could not break those squares  so they took another counsel  withdrawing a few paces beyond the reach of the bayonets they overwhelmed the soldiers by throwing assegais then rushed in and finished them  this was what happened to us among whom were men of the 24th natal carabineers and mounted police  some had dismounted but i sat on my horse which stood quite still i think from fright and fired away so long as i had any ammunition  with my very last cartridge i killed the captain indudu who had been in charge of the escort that conducted me to the tugela  he had caught sight of me and called out  now macumazahn i will cut you up nicely as i promised  he got no further in his speech for at that moment i sent an express bullet through him and his tall melancholy figure doubled up and collapsed  all this while colonel durnford had been behaving as a british officer should do  scorning to attempt flight whenever i looked round i caught sight of his tall form easy to recognize by the long fair moustaches and his arm in a sling moving to and fro encouraging us to stand firm and die like men  then suddenly i saw a kaffir who carried a big old smoothbore gun aim at him from a distance of about twenty yards and fire  he went down as i believe dead and that was the end of a very gallant officer and gentleman whose military memory has in my opinion been most unjustly attacked  the real blame for that disaster does not rest upon the shoulders of either colonel durnford or colonel pulleine  after this things grew very awful  some fled but the most stood and died where they were  oddly enough during all this time i was never touched  men fell to my right and left and in front of me bullets and assegais whizzed past me yet i remained quite unhurt  it was as though some power protected me which no doubt it did  at length when nearly all had fallen and i had nothing left to defend myself with except my revolver i made up my mind that it was time to go  my first impulse was to ride for the river nine miles away  looking behind me i saw that the rough road was full of zulus hunting down those who tried to escape  still i thought i would try it when suddenly there flashed across my brain the saying of whoever it was that personated mameena in the valley of bones to the effect that in the great rout of the battle i was not to join the flying but to set my face towards ulundi and that if i did so i should be protected and no harm would come to me i knew that all this prophecy was but a vain thing fondly imagined although it was true that the battle and the rout had come  and yet i acted on itwhy heaven knows alone  setting the spurs to my horse i galloped off past isandhlwana mount on the southern slopes of which a body of the 24th were still fighting their last fight and heading for the nqutu range the plain was full of zulus reserves running up also to the right of me the ulundi and gikazi divisions were streaming forward  these or some of them formed the left horn of the impi but owing to the unprepared nature of the zulu battle for it must always be remembered that they did not mean to fight that day their advance had been delayed until it was too late for them entirely to enclose the camp  thus the road if it can so be called to fugitives drift was left open for a while and by it some effected their escape  it was this horn or part of it that afterwards moved on and attacked rorkes drift with results disastrous to itself  for some hundreds of yards i rode on thus recklessly because recklessness seemed my only chance  thrice i met bodies of zulus but on each occasion they scattered before me calling out words that i could not catch  it was as though they were frightened of something they saw about me  perhaps they thought that i was mad to ride thus among them  indeed i must have looked mad or perhaps there was something else  at any rate i believed that i was going to win right through them when an accident happened  a bullet struck my mare somewhere in the back  i dont know where it came from but as i saw no zulu shoot i think it must have been one fired by a soldier who was still fighting on the slopes of the mount  the effect of it was to make the poor beast quite ungovernable  round she wheeled and galloped at headlong speed back towards the peak leaping over dead and dying and breaking through the living as she went  in two minutes we were rushing up its northern flank which seemed to be quite untenanted towards the sheer brown cliff which rose above it for the fighting was in progress on the other side  suddenly at the foot of this cliff the mare stopped shivered and sank down dead probably from internal bleeding  i looked about me desperately  to attempt the plain on foot meant death  what then was i to do  glancing at the cliff i saw that there was a gully in it worn by thousands of years of rainfall in which grew scanty bushes  into this i ran and finding it practicable though difficult began to climb upwards quite unnoticed by the zulus who were all employed upon the further side  the end of it was that i reached the very crest of the mount a patch of bare brown rock except at one spot on its southern front where there was a little hollow in which at this rainy season of the year herbage and ferns grew in the accumulated soil also a few stunted aloelike plants  into this patch i crept having first slaked my thirst from a little pool of rain water that lay in a cuplike depression of the rock which tasted more delicious than any nectar and seemed to give me new life  then covering myself as well as i could with grasses and dried leaves from the aloe plants i lay still  now i was right on the brink of the cliff and had the best view of the isandhlwana plain and the surrounding country that can be imagined  from my lofty eyrie some hundreds of feet in the air i could see everything that happened beneath  thus i witnessed the destruction of the last of the soldiers on the slopes below they made a gallant end so gallant that i was proud to be of the same blood with them  one fine young fellow escaped up the peak and reached a plateau about fifty feet beneath me  he was followed by a number of zulus but took refuge in a little cave whence he shot three or four of them then his cartridges were exhausted and i heard the savages speaking in praise of himdead  i think he was the last to die on the field of isandhlwana  the looting of the camp began it was a terrible scene  the oxen and those of the horses that could be caught were driven away except certain of the former which were harnessed to the guns and some of the wagons and as i afterwards learned taken to ulundi in proof of victory  then the slain were stripped and kaffirs appeared wearing the red coats of the soldiers and carrying their rifles  the stores were broken into and all the spirits drunk even the medical drugs were swallowed by these ignorant men with the result that i saw some of them reeling about in agony and others fall down and go to sleep  an hour or two later an officer who came from the direction in which the general had marched cantered right into the camp where the tents were still standing and even the flag was flying  i longed to be able to warn him but could not  he rode up to the headquarters marquee whence suddenly issued a zulu waving a great spear  i saw the officer pull up his horse remain for a moment as though indecisive then turn and gallop madly away quite unharmed though one or two assegais were thrown and many shots fired at him  after this considerable movements of the zulus went on of which the net result was that they evacuated the place  now i hoped that i might escape but it was not to be since on every side numbers of them crept up isandhlwana mountain and hid behind rocks or among the tall grasses evidently for purposes of observation  moreover some captains arrived on the little plateau where was the cave in which the soldier had been killed and camped there  at least at sundown they unrolled their mats and ate though they lighted no fire  the darkness fell and in it escape for me from that guarded place was impossible since i could not see where to set my feet and one false step on the steep rock would have meant my death  from the direction of rorkes drift i could hear continuous firing evidently some great fight was going on there i wondered vaguelywith what result  a little later also i heard the distant tramp of horses and the roll of gun wheels  the captains below heard it too and said one to another that it was the english soldiers returning who had marched out of the camp at dawn  they debated one with another whether it would be possible to collect a force to fall upon them but abandoned the idea because the regiments who had fought that day were now at a distance and too tired and the others had rushed forward with orders to attack the white men on and beyond the river  so they lay still and listened and i too lay still and listened for on that cloudy moonless night i could see nothing  i heard smothered words of command  i heard the force halt because it could not travel further in the gloom  then they lay down the living among the dead wondering doubtless if they themselves would not soon be dead as of course must have happened had the zulu generalship been better for if even five thousand men had been available to attack at dawn not one of them could have escaped  but providence ordained it otherwise  some were taken and the others left  about an hour before daylight i heard them stirring again and when its first gleams came all of them had vanished over the nek of slaughter with what thoughts in their hearts i wondered and to what fate  the captains on the plateau beneath had gone also and so had the circle of guards upon the slopes of the mount for i saw these depart through the grey mist  as the light gathered however i observed bodies of men collecting on the nek or rather on both neks which made it impossible for me to do what i had hoped and run to overtake the english troops  from these i was utterly cut off  nor could i remain longer without food on my point of rock especially as i was sure that soon some zulus would climb there to use it as an outlook post  so while i was still more or less hidden by the mist and morning shadows i climbed down it by the same road that i had climbed up and thus reached the plain  not a living man white or black was to be seen only the dead only the dead  i was the last englishman to stand upon the plain of isandhlwana for weeks or rather months to come  of all my experiences this was i think the strangest after that night of hell to find myself alone upon this field of death staring everywhere at the distorted faces which on the previous morn i had seen so full of life  yet my physical needs asserted themselves  i was very hungry who for twentyfour hours had eaten nothing faint with hunger indeed  i passed a provision wagon that had been looted by the zulus  tins of bully beef lay about also among a wreck of broken glass some bottles of basss beer which had escaped their notice  i found an assegai cleaned it in the ground which it needed and opening one of the tins lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man or rather between him and some zulus whom he had killed and devoured its contents  also i knocked the tops off a couple of the beer bottles and drank my fill  while i was doing this a large rough dog with a silvermounted collar on its neck i think of the sort that is called an airedale terrier came up to me whining  at first i thought it was an hyena but discovering my mistake threw it some bits of meat which it ate greedily doubtless it had belonged to some dead officer though there was no name on the collar  the poor beast which i named lost at once attached itself to me and here i may say that i kept it till its death which occurred of jaundice at durban not long before i started on my journey to king solomons mines  no man ever had a more faithful friend and companion  when i had eaten and drunk i looked about me wondering what i should do  fifty yards away i saw a stout basuto pony still saddled and bridled although the saddle was twisted out of its proper position which was cropping the grass as well as it could with the bit in its mouth  advancing gently i caught it without trouble and led it back to the plundered wagon  evidently from the marks upon the saddlery it had belonged to captain shepstones force of mounted natives  here i filled the large saddlebags made of buckskin with tins of beef a couple more bottles of beer and a packet of tandstickor matches which i was fortunate enough to find  also i took the martini rifle from a dead soldier together with a score or so of cartridges that remained in his belt for apparently he must have been killed rather early in the fight  thus equipped i mounted the pony and once more bethought me of escaping to natal  a look towards the nek cured me of that idea for coming over it i saw the plumed heads of a whole horde of warriors  doubtless these were returning from the unsuccessful attack on rorkes drift though of that i knew nothing at the time  so whistling to the dog i bore to the left for the nqutu hills riding as fast as the rough ground would allow and in half an hour was out of sight of that accursed plain  one more thing too i did  on its confines i came across a group of dead zulus who appeared to have been killed by a shell dismounting i took the headdress of one of them and put it on for i forgot to say that i had lost my hat  it was made of a band of otterskin from which rose large tufts of the black feathers of the finch which the natives call sakabula  also i tied his kilt of white oxtails about my middle precautions to which i have little doubt i owe my life since from a distance they made me look like a kaffir mounted on a captured pony  then i started on again whither i knew not    chapter xix     allan awakes      now i have no intention of setting down all the details of that dreadful journey through zululand even if i could recall them which for a reason to be stated i cannot do  i remember that at first i thought of proceeding to ulundi with some wild idea of throwing myself on the mercy of cetewayo under pretence that i brought him a message from natal  within a couple of hours however from the top of a hill i saw ahead of me an impi and with it captured wagons which was evidently heading for the kings kraal  so as i knew what kind of a greeting these warriors would give me i bore away in another direction with the hope of reaching the border by a circuitous route  in this too i had no luck since presently i caught sight of outposts stationed upon rocks which doubtless belonged to another impi or regiment indeed one soldier thinking from my dress that i also was a zulu called to me for news from about half a mile away in that peculiar carrying voice which kaffirs can command  i shouted back something about victory and that the white men were wiped out then put an end to the conversation by vanishing into a patch of dense bush  it is a fact that after this i have only the dimmest recollection of what happened  i remember offsaddling at night on several occasions  i remember being very hungry because all the food was eaten and the dog lost catching a bush buck fawn some of which i partially cooked on a fire of dead wood and devoured  next i rememberi suppose this was a day or two laterriding at night in a thunderstorm and a particularly brilliant flash of lightning which revealed scenery that seemed to be familiar to me after which came a shock and total unconsciousness   at length my mind returned to me  it was reborn very slowly and with horrible convulsions out of the womb of death and terror i saw blood flowing round me in rivers i heard the cries of triumph and of agony  i saw myself standing the sole survivor on a grey field of death and the utter loneliness of it ate into my soul so that with all its strength it prayed that it might be numbered in this harvest  but oh it was so strong that soul which could not would not die or fly away  so strong that then for the first time i understood its immortality and that it could never die  this everlasting thing still clung for a while to the body of its humiliation the mass of clay and nerves and appetites which it was doomed to animate and yet knew its own separateness and eternal individuality  striving to be free of earth still it seemed to walk the earth a spirit and a shadow aware of the hatefulness of that to which it was chained as we might imagine some lovely butterfly to be that is fated by nature to suck its strength from carrion and remains unable to soar away into the clean air of heaven  something touched my hand and i reflected dreamily that if i had been still alive for in a way i believed that i was dead i should have thought it was a dogs tongue  with a great effort i lifted my arm opened my eyes and looked at the hand against the light for there was light to see it was so thin that this light shone through between the bones  then i let it fall again and lo it rested on the head of a dog which went on licking it  a dog  what dog  now i remembered one that i had found on the field of isandhlwana  then i must be still alive  the thought made me cry for i could feel the tears run down my cheeks not with joy but with sorrow  i did not wish to go on living  life was too full of struggle and of bloodshed and bereavement and fear and all horrible things  i was prepared to exchange my part in it just for rest for the blessing of deep unending sleep in which no more dreams could come no more cups of joy could be held to thirsting lips only to be snatched away  i heard something shuffling towards me at which the dog growled then seemed to slink away as though it were afraid  i opened my eyes again looked and closed them once more in terror for what i saw suggested that perhaps i was dead after all and had reached that hell which a certain class of earnest christian promises to us as the reward of the failings that nature and those who begat us have handed on to us as a birth doom  it was something unnatural greyheaded terrificdoubtless a devil come to torment me in the inquisition vaults of hades  yet i had known the like when i was alive  how had it been called  i remembered thethingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn  hark it was speaking in that full deep voice which was unlike to any other  greeting macumazahn it said  i see that you have come back from among the dead with whom you have been dwelling for a moon and more  it is not wise of you macumazahn yet i am glad who have matched my skill against death and won for now you will have much to tell me about his kingdom  so it was zikalizikali who had butchered my friends  away from me murderer i said faintly and let me die or kill me as you did the others  he laughed but very softly not in his usual terrific fashion repeating the word murderer two or three times  then with his great hand he lifted my head gently as a woman might saying  look before you macumazahn  i looked and saw that i was in some kind of a cave  outside the sun was setting and against its brightness i perceived two figures a white man and a white woman who were walking hand in hand and gazing into each others eyes  they were anscombe and heda passing the mouth of the cave  behold the murdered o macumazahn dealer of hard words  it is only a trick i murmured  kaatje saw them dead and buried  yes yes i forgot  the fat foolwoman saw them dead and buried  well sometimes the dead come to life again and for good purpose as you should know macumazahn who followed the counsel of a certain mameena and wandered here instead of rushing onto the zulu spears  i tried to think the thing out and could not so only asked  how did i come  what happened to me  i think the sun smote you first who had no covering on your head and the lightning smote you afterwards  yet all the while that reason had left you one led your horse and after the heavens had tried to kill you and failed perhaps because my magic was too strong for them one sent that beast which you found yes sent it here to lead us to where you lay  there you were discovered and brought hither  now sleep lest you should go further than even i can fetch you back again  he held his hands above my head seeming to grow in stature till his white hair touched the roof of the cave and in an instant i fancied that i was falling away deep deep into a gulf of nothingness  there followed another period of dreaming in which dreams i seemed to meet all sorts of people dead and living especially lady ragnall a friend of mine with whom i had been concerned in a very strange adventure among the kendah people and with whom in days to come i was destined to be concerned again although of course i knew nothing of this in a still stranger adventure of what i may call a spiritual order which i may or may not try to reduce to writing  it seemed to me that i was constantly dining with her teteatete and that she told me all sorts of queer things between the courses  doubtless these illusions occurred when i was fed  see the book called the ivory childeditor  at length i woke up again feeling much stronger and saw the dog lost watching me with its great tender eyesoh they talk of the eyes of women but are they ever as beautiful as those of a loving dog  it lay by my low bedstead a rough affair fashioned of poles and strung with rimpis or strings of raw hide and by it stroking its head sat the witchdoctoress nombe  i remember how pleasing she looked a perfect type of the eternal feminine with her graceful rounded shape and her continual mysterious smile which suggested so much more than any mortal woman has to give  goodday to you macumazahn she said in her gentle voice you have gone through much since last we met on the night before goza took you away to ulundi  now remembering all i was filled with indignation against this little humbug  the last time we met nombe i said was when you played the part of a woman who is dead in the vale of bones by the kings kraal  she regarded me with a kindly commiseration and answered shaking her head  you have been very ill macumazahn and your spirit still tricks you  i played the part of no woman in any valley by the kings kraal nor were my eyes rejoiced with the sight of you there or elsewhere till they brought you to this place so changed that i should scarcely have known you  you little liar i said rudely  do the white people always name those liars who tell them true things they cannot understand she inquired with a sweet innocence  then without waiting for an answer she patted my hand as though i were a fretful child and gave me some soup in a gourd saying drink it it is good  the lady heddana made it herself in the white mans fashion  i drank the soup which was very good and as i handed back the gourd answered  kaatje has told me that the lady heddana is dead  can the dead make soup  she considered the point while she threw some bits of meat out of the bottom of the gourd to the dog lost then replied  i do not know macumazahn or indeed whether the dead eat as we do  next time my spirit visits me i will make inquiry and tell you the answer  but i do know that it is very strange that you who always turn your back upon the truth are so ready to accept falsehoods  why should you believe that the lady heddana is dead just because kaatje told you so when i who am still alive had sworn to you that i would protect her with my life  nay speak no more now  tomorrow if you are well enough you shall see and judge for yourself  she drew up the kaross over me again patted my hand in her motherly fashion and departed still smiling after which i went to sleep again so dreamlessly that i think there was some native soporific in that soup  on the following day two of zikalis servants who did the rougher work of my sick room if i may so call it arrived and said that they were going to carry me out of the cave for a while if that were my will  i who longed to breathe the fresh air again said that it was very much my will whereon they grasped the rough bedstead which i have described by either end and very carefully bore me down the cave and through its narrow entrance where they set the bedstead in the shadow of the overhanging rock without when i had recovered a little for even that short journey tired me i looked about me and perceived that as i had expected i was in the black kloof for there in front of me were the very huts which we had occupied on our arrival from swaziland  i lay a while drawing in the sweet air which to me was like a draught of nectar and wondering whether i were not still in a dream  for instance i wondered if i had truly seen the figures of anscombe and heda pass the mouth of the cave on that day when i awoke or if these were but another of zikalis illusions imprinted on my weakened mind by his will power  for of what he and nombe told me i believed nothing  thus marvelling i fell into a doze and in my doze heard whisperings  i opened my eyes and lo there before me stood anscombe and heda  it was she who spoke the first for i was tonguetied i could not open my lips  dear mr quatermain dear mr quatermain she murmured in her sweet voice then paused  now at last words came to me  i thought you were both dead i said  tell me are you really alive  she bent down and kissed my brow while anscombe took my hand  now you know she answered  we are both of us alive and well  thank god i exclaimed  kaatje swore that she saw you dead and buried  one sees strange things in the black kloof replied anscombe speaking for the first time and much has happened to us since we were parted to which you are not strong enough to listen now when you are better then we will tell you all  so grow well as soon as you can  after this i think i fainted for when i came to myself again i was back in the cave  another ten days or so went by before i could even leave my bed for my recovery was very slow  indeed for weeks i could scarcely walk at all and six whole months passed before i really got my strength again and became as i used to be  during those days i often saw anscombe and heda but only for a few minutes at a time  also occasionally zikali would visit me speaking a little generally about past history or something of the sort but never of the war and go away  at length one day he said to me  macumazahn now i am sure you are going to live a matter as to which i was doubtful even after you seemed to recover  for macumazahn you have endured three shocks of which today i am not afraid to talk to you  first there was that of the battle of isandhlwana where you were the last white man left alive  how do you know that zikali i asked  it does not matter  i do know  did you not ride through the zulus who parted this way and that before you shouting what you could not understand one of them you may remember even saluted with his spear  i did zikali  tell me why did they behave thus and what did they shout  i shall not tell you macumazahn  think over it for the rest of your life and conclude what you choose it will not be so wonderful as the truth  at least they did so as a certain doll i dressed up yonder in the vale of bones told you they would she whose advice you followed in riding towards ulundi instead of back to the river where you would have met your death like so many others of the white people  who was that doll zikali  nay ask me not  perhaps it was nombe perhaps another  i have forgotten  i am very old and my memory begins to play me strange tricks  still i recollect that she was a good doll so like a dead woman called mameena that i could scarcely have known them apart  ah that was a great game i played in the vale of bones was it not macumazahn  yes zikali yet i do not understand why it was played  being so young you still have the impatience of youth macumazahn although your hair grows white  wait a while and you will understand all  well you lay that night on the topmost rock of isandhlwana and there you saw and heard strange things you heard the rest of the white soldiers come and lie down to rest among their dead brothers and depart again unharmed  oh what fools are these zulu generals nowadays  they send out an impi to attack men behind walls spears against rifles and are defeated  had they kept that impi to fall on the rest of the english when they walked into the trap not a man of your people would have been left alive  would that have happened in the time of chaka  i think not zikali  still i am glad that it did happen  i think not too macumazahn but small men small wit  also like you i am glad that it did not happen since it is the zulus i hate not the english who have now learned a lesson and will not be caught again  oh many a captain in zululand is today flat as a pricked bladder and even their victory as they call it cost them dear  for mind you macumazahn for every white man they killed two of them died  so so  in the morning you left the hilldo not look astonished macumazahn  perhaps those captains on the rock beneath you let you go for their own purposes or because they were commanded for though weak i can still lift a stone or two macumazahn and afterwards told me all about it  then you found yourself alone among the dead like the last man in the world macumazahn and that dog at your side also a horse came to you  perhaps i sent them perhaps it was a chance  who knows  not i myself for as i have said my memory has grown so bad  that was your first shock macumazahn the shock of standing alone among the dead like the last man in the world  you felt it did you not  as i hope i shall never feel anything again  it nearly drove me mad i answered  very nearly indeed though i have felt worse things and only laughed as i would tell you had i the time  well then the sun struck you for at this season of the year it is very hot in those valleys for a white man with no covering to his head and you went quite mad though fortunately the dog and the horse remained as heaven had made them  that was the second shock then the storm burst and the lightning fell  it ran down the rifle that you still carried macumazahn  i will show it to you and you will see that its stock is shattered  perhaps i turned the flash aside for i am a great thunderherd or perhaps it was one mightier than i  that was the third shock macumazahn  then you were found still livinghow the white man your friend will tell you  but you should cherish that dog of yours macumazahn for many a man might have served you worse  and being strong though small or perhaps because you still have work left to do in the world before you leave it for a while you have lived through all these things and will in time recover though not yet  i hope so zikali though on the whole i am not sure that i wish to recover  yes you do macumazahn because the religion of you white men makes you fear death and what may come after it  you think of what you call your sins and are afraid lest you should be tortured because of them not understanding that the spirit must be judged not by what the flesh has done but by what the spirit desired to do by will not by deed macumazahn  the evil man is he who wishes to do evil not he who wishes to do good and falls now and again into evil  oh i have hearkened to your white teachers and i know i know  then by your own standard you are evil zikali since you wished to bring about war and not in vain  oho macumazahn you think that do you who cannot understand that what seems to be evil is often good  i wished to bring about war and brought it about and maybe what bred the wish was all that i have suffered in the past  but say you who have seen what the zulu power means who have seen men women and children killed by the thousand to feed that power and who have seen too what the english power means is it evil that i should wish to destroy the house of the zulu kings that the english house may take its place and that in a time to come the black people may be free  you are clever zikali but it is of your own wrongs that you think  how about that skull which you kissed in the vale of bones  mayhap macumazahn but my wrongs are the wrongs of a nation therefore i think of the nation and at least i do not fear death like you white men  now hearken  presently your friends will tell you a story  the lady heddana will tell you how i made use of her for a certain purpose for which purpose indeed i drew the three of you into zululand because without her i could not have brought about this war into which cetewayo did not wish to enter when you have heard that story do not judge me too hardly macumazahn who had a great end to gain  yet whatever the story may be i do judge you hardly zikali who tormented me with a false tale causing the woman kaatje to lie to me and swear that she saw these two dead before herhow i know not  she did not lie to you macumazahn  has not such a one as i the power to make a fat fool think that she saw what she did not see as to how  how did i make you think in yonder hut of mine that you saw what you did not seeperhaps  but why did you mock me in this fashion zikali  truly macumazahn you are blind as a bat in sunlight  when your friends have told you the story you will understand why yet i admit to you that things went wrong  you should have heard that tale before cetewayo brought you to the vale of bones but the foolwoman delayed and blundered and when she reached ulundi the gates were shut against her as a spy and not opened till too late so that you only found her when you returned from the council  i knew this and that was why i dared to bid you fire at that which stood upon the rock  had you heard kaatjes tale you might have aimed straight as also you would have certainly shot straight at me out of revenge for the deaths of those you loved macumazahn though whether you could have killed me before all the game is played is another matter  as it was i was sure that you would not pierce the heart of one who might be a certain white woman sure also that you would not pierce my heart whose death might bring about her death and that of another  you are very subtle zikali i said in astonishment  so you hold because i am very simple who understand the spirit of manand some other things  for the rest had you not believed that these two were dead you would never have left zululand  you would have tried to escape to get to them and have been killed  is it not so  yes i think i should have tried zikali  but why did you keep them prisoner  for the same reason that i still keep themand youto hold them back a while from the world of ghosts  had i sent them away after that night of the declaration of war they would have been killed before they had gone an hours journey  oh i am not so bad as you think macumazahn and i never break my word  now i have done  how goes the war i asked as he shuffled to his feet  as it must go very ill for the zulus  they have driven back the white men who gather strength from over the black water and will come on presently and wipe them out  umnyamana would have had cetewayo invade natal and sweep it clean as of course he should have done  but i sent him word that if he did so nomkubulwana yes she and no other had told me that all the spirits would be against him and he hearkened  when next you think me wicked remember that macumazahn  now it is but a matter of time and here you must bide till all is finished that will be good for you who need rest though the other two find it wearisome  still for them it is good also to watch the fruit ripen on their tree of love  it will be the sweeter when they eat it macumazahn and teach them how to live together oho ohoho and he shambled off    chapter xx     hedas tale      that evening when i was lying on my bed outside the cave i heard the tale of anscombe and heda  up to a certain point he told it then she went on with the story  on the morning after our arrival at this place allan said anscombe i woke up to find you gone from the hut  as you did not come back i concluded that you were with zikali and walked about looking for you  then food was brought to us and heda and i breakfasted together after which we went to where we heard the horses neighing and found that yours was gone  returning much frightened we met nombe who gave me your note which explained everything and we inquired of her why this had been done and what was to become of us  she smiled and answered that we had better ask the first question of the king and the second of her master zikali and in the meanwhile be at peace since we were quite safe  i tried to see zikali but could not  then i went to inspan the horses with the idea of following you only to find that they were gone  indeed i have not seen them from that day to this next we thought of starting on foot for we were quite desperate but nombe intervened and told us that if we ventured out of the black kloof we should be killed  in short we were prisoners  this went on for some days during which we were well treated but could not succeed in seeing zikali  at length one morning he sent for us and we were taken to the enclosure in front of his hut kaatje coming with us as interpreter  for a while he sat still looking very grim and terrible  then he said  white chief and lady you think ill of me because macumazahn has gone and you are kept prisoners here and before all is done you will think worse  yet i counsel you to trust me since everything that happens is for your good  at this point heda who as you know talked zulu fairly well though not so well as she does now broke in and said some very angry things to him  yes interrupted heda  i told him that he was a liar and i believed that he had murdered you and meant to murder us  he listened stonily continued anscombe and answered i perceive lady heddana that you understand enough of our tongue to enable me to talk to you therefore i will send away this halfbreed woman since what i have to say is secret  then he called servants by clapping his hands and ordered them to remove kaatje which was done  now lady heddana he said speaking very slowly so that heda might interpret to me and repeating his words whenever she did not understand i have a proposal to make to you  for my own ends it is necessary that you should play a part and appear before the king and the council as the goddess of this land who is called the chieftainess of heaven which goddess is always seen as a white woman  therefore you must travel with me to ulundi and there do those things which i shall tell you  and if i refuse to play this trick said heda what then  then lady heddana this white lord whom you love and who is to be your husband willdieand after he is dead you must still do what i desire of you ordie also  would he come with me to ulundi asked heda  not so lady  he would stay here under guard but quite safe and you will be brought back to him safe  choose now with death on the one hand and safety on the other  i would sleep a little  talk the matter over in your own tongue and when it is settled awaken me again and he shut his eyes and appeared to go to sleep  so we discussed the situation if you can call it discussion when we were both nearly mad  heda wished to go  i begged her to let me be killed rather than trust herself into the hands of this old villain  she pointed out that even if i were killed which she admitted might not happen she would still be in his hands whence she could only escape by her own death whereas if she went there was a chance that we might both continue to live and that after all death was easy to find  so in the end i gave way and we woke up zikali and told him so  he seemed pleased and spoke to us gently saying i was sure that wisdom dwelt behind those bright eyes of yours lady and again i promise you that neither you nor the lord your lover shall come to any harm  also that in payment i and my child nombe will protect you even with our lives and further that i will bring back your friend macumazahn to you though not yet now go and be happy together  nombe will tell the lady heddana when she is to start  of all this say nothing on your peril to the woman kaatje since if you do it will be necessary that she should be made silent  indeed lest she should learn something tomorrow i shall send her on to await you at ulundi therefore be not surprised if you see her go and take no heed of aught she may say in going  nombe my child will fill her place as servant to the lady heddana and sleep with her at night that she may not be lonely or afraid  then he clapped his hands again and servants came and conducted us back to the huts  and now allan heda will go on with the story  well mr quatermain she said nothing more happened that day which we spent with bursting hearts  kaatje did not question us as to what the witchdoctor had said after she was sent away indeed i noticed that she was growing very stupid and drowsy like a person who has been drugged as i daresay she was and would insist upon beginning to pack up the things in a foolish kind of way muttering something about our trekking on the following day  the night passed as usual kaatje sleeping very heavily by my side and snoring so much here i groaned sympathetically that i could get little rest  on the next morning after breakfast as the huts were very hot nombe suggested that we should sit under the shadow of the overhanging rock just where we are now  accordingly we went and being tired out with all our troubles and bad nights i fell into a doze and so i think did maurice nombe sitting near to us and singing all the while a very queer kind of song  presently through my doze as it were i saw kaatje approaching nombe went to meet her still singing and taking her hand led her to the cart where they seemed to talk to the horses which surprised me as there were no horses  then she brought her round the cart and pointed to us still singing  now kaatje began to weep and throw her hands about while nombe patted her on the shoulder  i tried to speak to her but could not  my tongue was tied why i dont know but i suppose because i was really asleep and maurice also was asleep and did not wake at all  yes said anscombe i remember nothing of all this business  after a while kaatje went away still weeping and then i fell asleep in earnest and did not wake until the sun was going down when i roused maurice and we both went back to the hut where i found that nombe had cooked our evening meal  i looked for kaatje but could not find her  also in searching through my things i missed the bag of jewels  i called to nombe and asked where kaatje was whereon she smiled and said that she had gone away taking the bag with her  this pained me for i had always found kaatje quite honest  which she is i remarked for those jewels are now in a bank at maritzburg  heda nodded and went on i am glad to hear it indeed remembering what zikali had said i never really suspected her of being a thief but thought it was all part of some plan  after this things went on as before except that nombe took kaatjes place and was with me day and night  of kaatjes disappearance she would say nothing  zikali we did not see  on the third evening after the vanishing of kaatje nombe came and said that i must make ready for a journey and while she spoke men arrived with a litter that had grass mats hung round it  nombe brought out my long cape and put it over me also a kind of veil of white stuff which she threw over my head so as to hide my face  i think it was made out of one of our travelling mosquito nets  then she said i must say goodbye to maurice for a while  there was a scene as you may imagine  he grew angry and said that he would come with me whereon armed men appeared six of them and pushed him away with the handles of their spears  in another minute i was lifted into the litter which nombe entered with me and so we were parted wondering if we should ever see each other more  at the mouth of the kloof i saw another litter surrounded by a number of zulus which nombe said contained zikali  we travelled all that night and two succeeding nights resting during the day in deserted kraals that appeared to have been made ready for us  it was a strange journey for although the armed men flitted about us neither they nor the bearers ever spoke nor did i see zikali or indeed any one else  only nombe comforted me from time to time telling me there was nothing to fear  towards dawn on the third night we travelled over some hills and i was put into a new hut and told that my journey was done as we had reached a place near ulundi  i slept most of the following day but after i had eaten towards evening zikali crept into the hut just as a great toad might do and squatted down in front of me  lady he said listen  tonight perhaps one hour after sundown perhaps two perhaps three nombe will lead you dressed in a certain fashion from this hut  see now outside of it there is a tongue of rock up which you may climb unnoted by the little path that runs between those big stones  look and he showed me the place through the doorhole  the path ends on a flat boulder at the end of the rock  there you will take your stand holding in your right hand a little assegai which will be given to you  nombe will not accompany you to the rock but she will crouch between the stones at the head of the path and perhaps from time to time whisper to you what to do  thus when she tells you you must throw the little spear into the air so that it falls among a number of men gathered in debate who will be seated about twenty paces from the rock  for the rest you are to stand quite still saying nothing and showing no alarm whatever you may hear or see  among the men before you may be your friend macumazahn but you must not appear to recognize him and if he speaks to you you must make no answer  even if he should seem to shoot at you do not be afraid  do you understand  if so repeat what i have told you  i obeyed him and asked what would happen if i did not do these things or some of them  he answered you will be killed nombe will be killed the lord mauriti your lover will be killed and your friend macumazahn will be killed  perhaps even i shall be killed and we will talk the matter over in the land of ghosts  on hearing this i said i would do my best to carry out his orders and after making me repeat them once more he went away later nombe dressed me up as you saw me mr quatermain put some glittering powder into my hair and touched me beneath the eyes with a dark kind of pigment  also she gave me the little spear and made me practise standing quite still with it raised in my right hand telling me that when i heard her say the word throw i was to cast it into the air  then the moon rose and we heard men talking at a distance  at last some one came to the hut and whispered to nombe who led me out to the little path between the rocks  this must have been nearly two hours after i heard the men begin to talk  excuse me i interrupted but where was nombe all those two hours  with me  she never left my side mr quatermain and while i was on the rock she was crouched within three paces of me between two big stones at the mouth of the path  indeed i replied faintly this is very interesting  please continuebut one word how was nombe dressed  did she wear a necklace of blue beads  just as she always is or rather less so for she had nothing on except her moocha and certainly no blue beads  but why do you ask  from curiosity merely  i mean i will tell you afterwards pray go on  well i stepped forward on to the rock and at first saw nothing because at that moment the moon was hid by a cloud indeed nombe had waited for the cloud to pass over its face before she thrust me forward  also some smoke from a fire below was rising straight in front of me  presently the cloud passed the smoke thinned and i saw the circle of those savage men seated beneath and in their centre a great chief wearing a leopards skin cloak who i guessed was the king  you i did not see mr quatermain because you were behind a tree yet i felt that you were there a friend among all those foes  i stood still as i had been taught to do and heard the murmur of astonishment and caught the gleam of the moonlight from the white feathers that were sewn upon my robe  then i heard also the voice of zikali speaking from beneath  he called on you to come out to shoot at me and the man whom i took to be the king ordered you to obey  you appeared from behind the tree and i was certain from the look upon your face that at that distance you did not know who i was in my strange and glittering raiment  you lifted the pistol and i was terribly afraid for i had seen you shoot with it before on the verandah of the temple and knew well that you do not miss  very nearly i screamed out to you but remembered and was silent thinking that after all it did not much matter if i died except for the sake of maurice here  also by now i guessed that i was being used to deceive those men before me into some terrible act and that if i died at least they would be undeceived  i thought that an age passed between the time you pointed the pistol and i saw the flash for which i was waiting  you need not have waited heda i interposed for if i had really aimed at you you would never have seen that flash at least so it is said  i too guessed enough to shoot above you although at the time i did not know that it was you on the rock indeed i thought it was nombe painted up  yes i heard the bullet sing over me  then i heard the voice of zikali challenging you to shoot him and to tell the truth hoped that you would do so  just before you fired for the second time nombe whispered to methrow and i threw the little redhandled spear into the air  then as the pistol went off nombe whisperedcome  i slipped away down the path and back with her into the hut where she kissed me and said that i had done well indeed after which she took off my strange robe and helped me to put on my own dress  that is all i know except that some hours later i was awakened from sleep and put into the litter where i went to sleep again for what i had gone through tired me very much  i need not trouble you with the rest for we journeyed here in the same way that we had journeyed to ulundiby night  i did not see zikali but in answer to my questions nombe told me that the zulus had declared war against the english  what part in the business i had played she would not tell me and i do not know to this hour but i am sure that it was a great one  so we came back to the black kloof where i found maurice quite well and now he had better go on with the tale for if i begin to tell you of our meeting i shall become foolish  there isnt much more to tell said anscombe except about yourself  while heda was away i was kept a prisoner and watched day and night by zikalis people who would not let me stir a yard but otherwise treated me kindly  then one day at sunrise or shortly after it heda reappeared and told me all this story for the end of which as you may imagine i thanked god  after that we just lived on here happily enough since we were together until one day nombe told us that there had been a great battle in which the zulus had wiped out the english killing hundreds and hundreds of them although for every soldier that they killed they had lost two  of course this made us very sad especially as we were afraid you might be with our troops  we asked nombe if you were present at the battle  she answered that she would inquire of her spirit and went through some very strange performances with ashes and knuckle bones after which she announced that you had been in the battle but were alive and coming this way with a dog that had silver on it  we laughed at her saying that she could not possibly know anything of the sort also that dogs as a rule did not carry silver  whereon she only smiled and saidwait  i think it was three days later that one night towards dawn i was awakened by hearing a dog barking outside my hut as though it wished to call attention to its presence  it barked so persistently and in a way so unlike a kaffir dog that at length about dawn i went out of the hut to see what was the matter there standing a few yards away surrounded by some of zikalis people i saw lost and knew at once that it was an english airedale for i have had several of the breed  it looked very tired and frightened and while i was wondering whence on earth it could have come i noticed that it had a silvermounted collar and remembered nombe and her talk about you and a dog that carried silver on it  from that moment allan i was certain that you were somewhere near especially as the beast ran up to meit would take no notice of the kaffirsand kept looking towards the mouth of the kloof as though it wished me to follow it  just then nombe arrived and on seeing the dog looked at me oddly  i have a message for you from my master mauriti she said to me through heda who by now had arrived upon the scene having also been aroused by losts barking  it is that if you wish to take a walk with a strange dog you can do so and bring back anything you may find  the end of it was that after we had fed lost with milk and meat i and six of zikalis men started down the kloof lost going ahead of us and now and again running back and whining  at the mouth of the kloof it led us over a hill and down into a bushveld valley where the thorns grew very thick  when we had gone along the valley for about two miles one of the kaffirs saw a basuto pony still saddled and caught it  the dog went on past the pony to a tree that had been shattered by lightning and there within a few yards of the tree we found you lying senseless allan or as i thought at first dead and by your side a martini rifle of which the stock also seemed to have been broken by lightning  well we put you on a shield and carried you here meeting no one and that is all the story allan  he stopped and we stared at each other  then i called lost and patted its head and the dear beast licked my hand as though it understood that it was being thanked  a strange tale i said but god almighty has put much wisdom into his creatures of which we know nothing  let us thank him and in our hearts we did  thus was i rescued from death by the intelligence and fidelity of a fourfooted creature  doubtless in my semiconscious state that resulted from shock weariness and sunstroke i had all the while headed subconsciously and without any definite object for the black kloof  when i was within a few miles of it i was stunned by the lightning which ran down the rifle to the ground though not actually struck  then the dog which had escaped played its part wandering about the country to find help for me and so i was saved   now of the long months that followed i have little to tell  they were not unhappy in their way for week by week i felt myself growing stronger though very slowly  there was a path steep difficult and secret which could be gained through one of the caves in the precipice not that in which i slept  this path ran up a watercut kloof through a patch of thorns to a flat tableland that was part of the ceza stronghold  by it when i had gained sufficient strength sometimes we used to climb to the plateau and there take exercise  it was an agreeable change from the stifling atmosphere of the black kloof  the days were very dull for we were as much out of the world as though we had been marooned on a desert island  still from time to time we heard of the progress of the war through nombe for zikali i saw but seldom  she told of disasters to the english of the death of a great young chief who was deserted by his companions and died fighting bravelyafterwards i discovered that this was the prince imperial of franceof the advance of our armies of defeats inflicted upon cetewayos impis and finally of the destruction of the zulus on the battlefield of ulundi where they hurled themselves by thousands upon the british square to be swept away by caseshot and the hail of bullets  this battle by the way the zulus call not ulundi or nodwengu for it was fought in front of pandas old kraal of that name but ocwecweni which meansthe fight of the sheetiron fortress  i suppose they give it this name because the hedge of bayonets flashing in the sunlight reminded them of sheetiron  or it may be because these proved as impenetrable as would have done walls of iron at any rate they dashed their naked bodies against the storm of lead and fell in heaps only about a dozen of our men being killed as the little graveyard in the centre of the square entrenchment about which still lie the empty cartridge cases records today  there then on that plain perished the zulu kingdom which was built up by chaka  now it was after this event that i saw zikali and begged him to let us go  i found him triumphant and yet strangely disturbed and as i thought more apprehensive than i had ever seen him  so zikali i said if what i hear is true you have had your way and destroyed the zulu people  now you should be happy  is man ever happy macumazahn when he has gained that which he sought for years  the two out there sigh and are sad because they cannot be married after their own white fashion though what there is to keep them apart i do not know  well in time they will be married only to find that they are not so happy as they thought they would be  oh a day will come when they will talk to each other and saythose moons which we spent waiting together in the black kloof were the true moons of sweetness for then we had something to gain now we have gained alland what is it  so it is with me macumazahn  since the zulus under chaka killed out my people the ndwandwe year by year i have plotted and waited to see them wedded to the assegai  now it has come about  you white men have stamped them flat upon the plain of ulundi they are no more a nation  and yet i am not happy for after all it was the house of senzangacona and not the people of the zulus that harmed me and mine and cetewayo still lives while the queen bee remains there may be a hive again  while an ember still glows in the dead ashes the forest may yet be fired perhaps when cetewayo is dead then i shall be happy  only his death and mine are set by fate as close together as two sister grains of corn upon the cob  i turned the subject again asking his leave to depart to natal or to join the english army  you cannot go yet he answered sternly so trouble me no more the land is full of wandering bands of zulus who would kill you and your blood would be on my head  moreover if they saw a white woman who had sheltered with me might they not guess something  to dress a doll for the part of the inkosazanayzulu is the greatest crime in the world macumazahn and what would happen to the opener of roads and all his house if it were even breathed that he had dressed that doll and thus brought about the war which ruined them  when cetewayo is killed and the dead are buried and peace falls upon the land the peace of death then you shall go macumazahn and not before  at least zikali send a message to the captains of the english army and tell them that we are here  send a message to the hyenas and tell them where the carcase is send a message to the hunters and tell them where the buck zikali crouches on its form  hearken macumazahn if you do this or even urge me again to do it neither you nor your friends shall ever leave the black kloof  i have spoken  then understanding that the case was hopeless i left him and he glowered after me for fear had made him cruel  he had won the long game and success had turned to ashes in his mouth  or rather he had not wonyetsince his war was against the house of senzangacona from which he and his tribe had suffered cruel wrong  to pull it down he must pull down the zulu nation it was like burning a city to destroy a compromising letter  he had burnt the city but the letter still remained intact and might be produced in evidence against him  in other words cetewayo yet lived  therefore his vengeance remained quite unslaked and his danger was as great or perhaps greater than it had ever been before  for was he not the prophet who by producing the princess of heaven the traditional goddess of the zulus before the eyes of the king and council had caused them to decide for war  and supposing it were so much as breathed that this spirit which they seemed to see had been but a trick and a fraud what then  he would be tortured to death if his dupes had time or torn limb from limb if they had not that is if he could die like other mena matter as to which personally i had no doubts  shortly after i left zikali heda and i ate our evening meal together  anscombe as it chanced had gone by the secret path to the tableland of which i have spoken where he amused himself as of course we were not allowed to fire a gun by catching partridges with the help of an ingenious system of grass nets which he had invented  there were springs on this tableland that formed little pools of water at which the partridges also occasionally guineafowl and bush pheasants came to drink at sunrise and sunset  here it was that he set his nets and retired to work them at those hours by means of strings that he pulled from hidingplaces  so heda and i were alone  i told her of my ill success with zikali at which she was much disappointed  then by an afterthought i suggested that perhaps she might try to do something in the way of getting a message through to the english camp at ulundi or elsewhere by help of the witchdoctoress nombe adding that i would speak to her myself had i not observed that i seemed to be out of favour with her of late  heda shook her head and answered that she thought it would be useless to try also too dangerous  remembering zikalis threat on reflection i agreed with her  tell me mr quatermain she added is it possible for one woman to be in love with another  i stared at her and replied that i did not understand what she meant since women so far as i had observed them were generally in love either with a man or with themselves perhaps more often with the latter than the former  rather a cheap joke i admit with just enough truth in it to make it acceptablein the black kloof  so i thought she answered but really nombe behaves in a most peculiar way  as you know she took a fancy to me from the beginning perhaps because she had never had any other woman with whom to associate having so far as i can make out been brought up here among men from a child  indeed her story is that she was one of twins and therefore as the younger was exposed to die according to the zulu superstition  zikali however or a servant of his who knew what was happening rescued and reared her so practically i am the only female with whom she has ever been intimate  at any rate her affection for me has grown and grown until although it seems ungrateful to say so it has become something of a nuisance  she has told me again and again that she would die to protect me and that if by chance anything happened to me she would kill herself and follow me into another world  she is continually making divinations about my future and as these in which she entirely believes always show me as living without her she is much distressed and at times bursts into tears  hysteria  it is very common among the zulu women and especially those of them who practise magic arts i answered  perhaps but as it results in the most intense jealousy nombes hysteria is awkward  for instance she is horribly jealous of maurice  the instincts of a chaperone developed early i suggested again  that wont quite do mr quatermain answered heda with a laugh since she is even more jealous of you  with reference to maurice she explains frankly that if we marry she might as she puts it continue to sit outside the hut but that in your case you live in my head where she cannot come between you and me  mad i remarked quite mad  still madness has to be dealt with in this world like other things and nombe being an abnormal person may suffer from abnormal ideas  it just amounts to this she has conceived a passionate devotion to you at which i am sure neither maurice nor i can wonder  are those the kind of compliments you used to pay in your youth mr quatermain  i expect so and now that you are old you cannot stop them  well i thank you all the same because perhaps you mean what you say  but what is to be done about nombe  hush here she comes  i will leave you to reason with her if you get the chance and she departed in a hurry  nombe arrived and something in her aspect told me that i was going to get the chance  her eternal smile was almost gone and her dark beautiful eyes flashed ominously  still she began by asking in a mild voice whether the lady heddana had eaten her supper with appetite  it will be observed that she was not interested in my appetite or whether enough was left for anscombe when he returned  i replied that so far as i noted she had consumed about half a partridge with other things  i am glad said nombe since i was not here to attend upon her having been summoned to speak with the master  then she sat down and looked at me like a thunder storm  i nursed you when you were so ill macumazahn she began but now i learn that for the milk with which i fed you you would force me to drink bitter water that will poison me  i replied i was well aware that without her nursing i should long ago have been dead which was what caused me to love her like my own daughter  but would she kindly explain  this she did at once  you have been plotting to take away from me the lady heddana who to me is as mother and sister and child  it is useless to lie to me for the master has told me all moreover i knew it for myself both through my spirit and because i had watched you  i have no intention of lying to you nombe about this or any other matter though i think that sometimes in the past you have lied to me  tell me do you expect the inkosi mauriti the lady heddana and myself to pass the rest of our lives in the black kloof when they wish to get married and go across the black water to where their home will be and i wish to attend to my affairs  i do not know what i expect macumazahn but i do know that never while i live will i be parted from the lady heddana  at last i have found some one to love and you and the other would steal her away from me  i studied her for a while then asked  why do you not marry nombe and have a husband and children to love  marry she replied  i am married to my spirit which does not dwell beneath the sun and my children are not of earth moreover all men are hateful to me and her eyes added especially you  that is a calf with a dogs head i replied in the words of the native proverb meaning that she said what was not natural well nombe if you are so fond of the lady heddana you had better arrange with her and the inkosi mauriti to go away with them  you know well i cannot macumazahn  i am tied to my master by ropes that are stronger than iron and if i attempted to break them my spirit would wither and i should wither with it  dear me what a dreadful business  that is what comes of taking to magic  well nombe i am afraid i have nothing to suggest nor to tell you the truth can i see what i have to do with the matter  then she sprang up in a rage saying  i understand that not only will you give me no help but that you also mock at me macumazahn  moreover as it is with you so it is with mauriti who pretends to love my lady so much though i love her more with my little finger than he does with all his body and what he calls his soul  yes he too mocks at me  now if you were both dead she added with sudden venom my lady would not wish to go away  be careful lest a spell should fall upon you macumazahn and without more words she turned and went  at first i was inclined to laugh the whole thing seemed so absurd  on reflection however i perceived that in reality it was very serious to people situated as we were  this woman was a savage more a mystic savage of considerable powers of minda formidable combination  also there were no restraints upon her since public opinion had as little authority in the black kloof as the queens writ  lastly it was not unknown for women to conceive these violent affections which if thwarted filled them with something like madness  thus i remembered a very terrible occurrence of my youth which resulted in the death of one who was most dear to me  i will not dwell on it but this too was the work of a passionate creature woman i can scarcely call her who thought she was being robbed of one whom she adored  the end of it was that i did not enjoy my pipe that night though luckily anscombe returned after a successful evenings netting about which he was so full of talk that there was no need for me to say much  so i put off any discussion of the problem until the morrow    chapter xxi     the king visits zikali      next morning as a result of my cogitations i went to see zikali  i was admitted after a good deal of trouble and delay for although his retinue was limited and with the exception of nombe entirely male this old prophet kept a kind of semistate and was about as difficult to approach as a european monarch  i found him crouching over a fire in his hut since at this season of the year even in that hot place the air was chilly until midday  what is it macumazahn he asked  as to your going away have patience  i learn that he who was king of the zulus is in full flight with the white men tracking him like a wounded buck when the buck is caught and killed then you can go  it is about nombe i answered and told him all the story which did not seem to surprise him at all  now see macumazahn he said taking some snuff how hard it is to dam up the stream of nature  this child nombe is of my blood one whom i saved from death in a strange way not because she was of my blood but that i might make an experiment with her women as you who are wise and have seen much will know are in truth superior to men though because they are weaker in body men have the upper hand of them and think themselves their masters a state they are forced to accept because they must live and cannot defend themselves  yet their brains are keener as an assegai is keener than a hoe they are more in touch with the hidden things that shape out fate for people and for nations they are more faithful and more patient and by instinct if not by reason more farseeing or at least the best of them are so and by their best like men they should be judged  yet this is the hole in their shield  when they love they become the slaves of love and for loves sake all else is brought to naught and for this reason they cannot be trusted  with men as you know this is otherwise  they too love by natures law but always behind there is something greater than love although often they do not understand what that may be  to be powerful therefore a woman must be one who does not love too much  if she cannot love at all then she is hated and has no power but she must not love too much  once i thought that i had found such a woman she was named mameena whom all men worshipped and who played with all men as i played with her  but what was the end of it  just as things were going very well she learned to love too much some man of strange notions who would have thwarted me and brought everything to nothing and therefore i had to kill her for which i was sorry  here he paused to take some more snuff watching me over the spoon as he drew it up his great nostrils but as i said nothing went on  now after mameena was dead i bethought me that i would rear up a woman who could still love but should never love a man and therefore never become mad or foolish because i believed that it was only man who in taking her heart from woman would take her wits also  this child nombe came to my hand and as i thought so i did  never mind how i did it by medicine perhaps by magic perhaps by watering her pride and making it grow tall perhaps or by all three  at least it was done and this i know of nombe she will never care for any man except as a woman may care for a brother  but now see what happens  she the wise the instructed the mandespiser meets a woman of another race who is sweet and good and learns to love her not as maids and mothers love but as one loves the spirit that she worships  yes yes to her she is a goddess to be worshipped one whom she desires to serve with all her heart and strength to bow down before making offerings and at the end to follow into death  so it comes about that this nombe whose mind i thought to make as the wings of a bird floating on the air while it searches for its prey has become even madder than other women  it is a disappointment to me macumazahn  it may be a disappointment to you zikali and all that you say is very interesting  but to us it is a danger  tell me will you command nombe to cease from her folly  will i forbid the mist to rise or the wind to blow or the lightning to strike  as she is she is  her heart is filled with black jealousy of mauriti and of you as a butchers gourd is filled with blood for she is not one who desires that her goddess should have other worshippers she would keep her for herself alone  then in this way or in that the gourd must be emptied zikali lest we should be forced to drink from it and that black blood should poison us  how unless it be broken macumazahn  if heddana departs and leaves her she will go mad and accompany her she cannot for her spirit dwells here and he tapped his own breast  it would pull her back again and she would become a great trouble to me for then that spirit of hers would not suffer me to sleep with its continual startings in search of what it had lost and its returnings emptyhanded  well have no fear for at the worst the bowl can be broken and the blood poured upon the earth as i have broken finer bowls than this before had i all the bits of them they would make a heap so high macumazahn and he held out his hand on a level with his head a gesture that made my back creep  i will tell her this and it may keep her quiet for a while  of poison you need not be afraid since unlike mine her spirit hates it  poison is not one of its weapons as it is with mine  but of spells beware for her spirit has some which are very powerful  now i jumped up filled with indignation saying  i do not believe in nombes spells and in any case how am i to guard against them  if you do not believe there is no need to guard and if you do believe then it is for you to find out how to guard macumazahn oh i could tell you the story of a white teacher who did not believe and would not guardbut never mind never mind goodbye macumazahn i will speak with nombe  ask her for a lock of her hair to wear upon your heart after she has enchanted it  the charm is good against spells  ohoohoo  what fools we are white and black together  that is what cetewayo is thinking today  after this nombe became much more agreeable  that is to say she was very polite her smile was more fixed and her eyes more unfathomable than ever  evidently zikali had spoken to her and she had listened  yet to tell the truth my distrust of this handsome young woman grew deeper day by day  i recognized that there was a great gulf between her and the normal that she was a creature fashioned by zikali who had trained her as a gardener trains a tree nay who had done more who had grafted some foreign growth of exotic and unnatural spiritualism on to her primitive nature  the nature remained the same but the graft or grafts bore strange flowers and fruit unholy flowers and poisonous fruit  therefore she was not to blamesometimes i wonder whether in this curious world could one see their past and their future anybody is to blame for anythingbut this did not make her the less dangerous  some talks i had with her only increased my apprehensions for i found that in a way she had no conscience  life she told me was but a dream and all its laws as evolved by man were but illusions  the real life was elsewhere  there was the distant lake on which the flower of our true existence floated  without this unseen lake of supernatural water the flower could not float indeed there would be no flower  moreover the flower did not matter sometimes it would have this shape and colour sometimes that  it was but a thing destined to grow and bloom and rot and during its day to be ugly or to be beautiful to smell sweet or ill as it might chance and ultimately to be absorbed back into the general water of life  i pointed out to her that all flowers had roots which grew in soil  looking at an orchidlike plant that crept along the bough of a tree she answered that this was not true as some grew upon air  but however this might be the soil or the moisture in the air was distilled from thousands of other flower lives that had flourished in their day and been forgotten  it did not matter when they died or how many other flowers they choked that they might live  yet each flower had its own spirit which always had been and always would be  i asked her of the end and the object of that spirit  she answered darkly that she did not know and if she did would not say but that these were very dreadful  such were some of her vague and figurative assertions which i only record to indicate their uncomfortable and indeed but half human nature  i forgot to add that she declared that every flower or life had a twin flower or life which in each successive growth it was bound to find and bloom beside or wither to the root and spring again and that ultimately these two would become one and as one flourish eternally  of all of which i understood and understand little except that she had grasped the elements of some truth which she could not express in clear and definite language   one day i was seated in zikalis hut whither by permission i had come to ask the latest news when suddenly nombe appeared and crouched down before him  who gave you leave to enter here and what is your business he asked angrily  home of spirits she replied in a humble voice be not angry with your servant  necessity gave me leave and my business is to tell you that strangers approach  who are they that dare to enter the black kloof unannounced  cetewayo the king is one of them the others i do not know but they are many armed all of them  they approach your gate before a man can count two hundred they will be here  where are the white chief and the lady heddana asked zikali  by good fortune they have gone by the secret path to the tableland and will not be back till sunset  they wished to be alone so i did not accompany them and macumazahn here said that he was too weary to do so  this was true  also like nombe i thought that they wished to be alone  good  go tell the king that i knew of his coming and am awaiting him  bid my servants kill the ox which is in the kraal the fat ox that they thought is sick and therefore fit food for a sick king he added bitterly  she glided away like a startled snake  then zikali turned to me and said swiftly  macumazahn you are in great danger  if you are found here you will be killed and so will the others whom i will send to warn not to return till this king has gone away  go at once to join them  no it is too late i hear the zulus come  take that kaross cover yourself with it and lie among the baskets and beerpots here near the entrance of the hut in the deepest of the shadows so that if any enter perchance you will not be found i too am in danger who shall be held to account for all that has happened  perhaps they will kill me if i can be killed  if so get away with the others as best you can  nombe will tell you where your horses are hidden  in that case let heddana take nombe with her for when i am dead she will go and shake her off in natal if she troubles her  whatever chances remember macumazahn that i have done my best to keep my word to you and to protect you and your friends  now i go to look on this pricked bladder who was once a king  he scrambled from the hut with slow toadlike motions while i with motions that were anything but slow grabbed the grey catskin kaross and ensconced myself among the beerpots and mats in such a position that my head over which i set a threelegged carved stool of zikalis own cutting was but a few inches to the left of the doorhole and therefore in the deepest of the shadows  thence by stretching out my neck a little i could see through the hole also hear all that passed outside  unless a deliberate search of the hut should be made i was fairly safe from observation even if it were entered by strangers  one fear i had however it was lest the dog lost should get into the place and smell me out  i had left him tied to the centre pole in my own hut because he hated zikali and always growled at him but suppose he gnawed through the cord or any one let him loose  scarcely had zikali seated himself in his accustomed place before the hut than the gate of the outer fence opened and approaching through it i saw forty or fifty fierce and wayworn men  in front of them riding on a tired horse that was led by a servant was cetewayo himself  he was assisted to dismount or rather threw his great bulk into the arms that were waiting to receive him  then after some words with his following and with one of zikalis people followed by three or four indunas and leaning on the arm of umnyamana the prime minister he entered the enclosure the rest remaining without  zikali who sat as though asleep suddenly appeared to wake up and perceive him  struggling to his feet he lifted his right arm and gave the royal salute of bayete and with it titles of praise such as black one elephant earthshaker conqueror eaterup of the white men child of the wild beast chaka whose teeth are sharper than the wild beasts ever were and so on until cetewayo growing impatient cried out  be silent wizard  is this a time for fine words  do you not know my case that you offend my ears with them  give us food to eat if you have it after which i would speak with you alone  be swift also here i may not stay for long since the white dogs are at my heels  i knew that you were coming o king to honour my poor house with a visit said zikali slowly and therefore the ox is already killed and the meat will soon be on the fire  meanwhile drink a sup of beer and rest  he clapped his hands whereon nombe and some servants appeared with pots of beer of which after zikali had tasted it to show that it was not poisoned the king and his people drank thirstily  then it was taken to those outside  what is this that my ears hear asked zikali when nombe and the others had gone that the white dogs are on the spoor of the black bull  cetewayo nodded heavily and answered  my impis were broken to pieces on the plain of ulundi the cowards ran from the bullets as children run from bees  my kraals are burnt and i the king with but a faithful remnant fly for my life  the prophecy of the black one has come true  the people of the zulus are stamped flat beneath the feet of the great white people  i remember that prophecy o king  mopo told it to me within an hour of the death of the black one when he gave me the little redhandled assegai that he snatched from the black ones hand to do the deed  it makes me almost young again to think of it although even then i was old replied zikali in a dreamy voice like one who speaks to himself  hearing him from under my kaross i bethought me that he had really grown old at last who for the moment evidently forgot the part which this very assegai had played a few months before in the vale of bones  well even the greatest masters make such slips at times when their minds are full of other things  but if zikali forgot cetewayo and his councillors remembered as i could see by the look of quick intelligence that flashed from face to face  so  mopo the murderer he who vanished from the land after the death of my uncle dingaan gave you the little red assegai did he opener of roads  and but a few months ago that assegai which old sigananda knew again thrown by the hand of the inkosazanayzulu drew blood from my body after the white man macumazahn had severed its shaft with his bullet  now tell me opener of roads how did it pass from your keeping into that of the spirit nomkubulwana  at this question i distinctly saw a shiver shake the frame of zikali who realized too late the terrible mistake he had made yet as only the great can do he retrieved and even triumphed over his error  ohoho he laughed who am i that i can tell how such things happen  do you not know o king that the spirits leave what they will and take what they will whether it be but a blade of grass or the life of a manhere he looked at cetewayoor even of a people  sometimes they take the shadow and sometimes the substance since spirit or matter all is theirs  as for the little assegai i lost it years ago  i remember that the last time i saw it was in the hands of a woman named mameena to whom i showed it as a strange and bloody thing  after her death i found that it was gone so doubtless she took it with her to the underworld and there gave it to the queen nomkubulwana with whom you may remember this mameena returned from that underworld yonder in the bones  it may be so said cetewayo sullenly yet it was no spirit iron that cut my thigh but what do i know of the ways of spirits  wizard i would speak with you in your hut alone where no ear can hear us  my hut is the kings answered zikali yet let the king remember that those spirits of which he does not know the ways can always hear yes even the thoughts of men and on them do judgment  fear not said cetewayo amongst many other things i remember this also  then zikali turned and crept into the hut whispering as he passed me  lie silent for your life  and cetewayo having bidden his retinue to depart outside the fence and await him there followed after him  they sat them down on either side of the smouldering fire and stared at each other through the thin smoke there in the gloom of the hut  by turning my head that the foot of the king had brushed as he passed i could watch them both  cetewayo spoke the first in a hoarse slow voice saying  wizard i am in danger of my life and i have come to you who know all the secrets of this land that you may tell me in what place i may hide where the white men cannot find me  it must be told into my ear alone since i dare not trust the matter to any other at any rate until i must  they are traitors every man of them yes even those who seem to be most faithful  the fallen man has no friends least of all if he chances to be a king only the dead will keep his counsel  tell me of the place i need  dingaan who was before you once asked this same thing of me o king when he was flying from panda your father and the boers i gave him advice that he did not take but sought a refuge of his own upon a certain ghostmountain  what happened to him there that mopo of whom you spoke a while ago can tell you if he still lives  see nada the lilyeditor  surely you are an illomened nightbird who thus croak to me continually of the death of kings broke in cetewayo with suppressed rage  then calming himself with an effort added tell me now where shall i hide  would you know king  then hearken  on the south slope of the ingome range west of the ibululwana river on the outskirts of the great forest there is a kloof whereof the entrance which only one man can pass at a time is covered by a thicket of thorns and marked by a black rock shaped like a great toad with an open mouth or as some say like myself thethingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn  near to this rock dwells an old woman blind of one eye and lacking a hand which the black one cut off shortly before his death because when he killed her father she saw the future and prophesied a like death to him although then she was but a child  this woman is of our company being a witchdoctoress  i will send a spirit to her if you so will it to warn her to watch for you and your company o king and show you the mouth of the kloof where are some old huts and water  there you will never be found unless you are betrayed  who can betray me when none know whither i am going asked cetewayo  send the spirit send it at once that this onearmed witch may make ready  what is the hurry king seeing that the forest is far away yet be it as you will  keep silence now lest evil should befall you  then of a sudden zikali seemed to go off into one of his trances his form grew rigid his eyes closed his face became fixed as though in death and foam appeared upon his lips  he was a dreadful sight to look on there in the gloomy hut  cetewayo watched him and shivered  then he opened his blanket and i perceived that fastened about him by a loop of hide in such a fashion that it could be drawn out in a moment was the blade of a broad assegai the shaft of which was shortened to about six inches  his hand grasped this shaft and i understood that he was contemplating the murder of zikali  then it seemed to me that he changed his mind and that his lips shaped the wordsnot yet though whether he really spoke them i do not know  at least he withdrew his hand and closed the blanket  slowly zikali opened his eyes staring at the roof of the hut whence came a curious sound as of squeaking bats  he looked like a dead man coming to life again  for a few moments he turned up his ear as though he listened to the squealing then said  it is well  the spirit that i summoned has visited her of our company who is named onehand and returned with the answer  did you not hear it speaking in the thatch o king  i heard something wizard answered cetewayo in an awed voice i thought it was a bat  a bat it is o king one with wide wings and swift  this bat says that my sister onehand will meet you on the third day from now at this hour on the further side of the ford of the ibululwana where three milktrees grow together on a knoll  she will be sitting under the centre milktree and will wait for two hours no more to show you the secret entrance to the kloof  the road is rough and long i shall have to hurry when worn out with travelling said cetewayo  that is so o king  therefore my counsel is that you begin the journey as soon as possible especially as i seem to hear the baying of the white dogs not far away  by chakas head i will not growled cetewayo who thought to sleep here in peace this night  as the king wills  all that i have is the kings  only then onehand will not be waiting and some other place of hiding must be found since this is known to me only and to her also that spirit which i sent will make no second journey nor can i travel to show it to the king  yes wizard it is known to you and to myself  methinks it would be better were it known to me alone  i have a spoonful of snuff to share ie a bone to pick with you wizard  it would seem that you set my feet and those of the zulu people upon a false road yonder in the vale of bones causing me to declare war upon the white men and thereby bringing us all to ruin  mayhap my memory grows bad o king for i do not remember that i did these things  i remember that the spirit of a certain mameena whom i called up from the dead prophesied victory to the king which victory has been his  also it prophesied other victories to the king in a far land across the water which victories doubtless shall be his in due season for myself i gave no counsel to the king or to his indunas and generals  you lie wizard exclaimed cetewayo hoarsely  did you not summon the shape of the princess of heaven to be the sign of war and did she not hold in her hand that assegai of the black one which you have told me was in your keeping  how did it pass from your keeping into the hand of a spirit  as to that matter i have spoken o king  for the rest is nomkubulwana my servant to come and go at my bidding  i think so said cetewayo coldly  i think also that you who know the place where i purpose to hide would do well to forget it  surely you have lived too long o opener of roads and done enough evil to the house of senzangacona which you ever hated  so he spoke and once more i saw his hand steal towards the spearhead which was hidden beneath the blanket that he wore  zikali saw it also and laughed  oho he laughed forgetting all my warnings and that the day of my death will be his own the king thinks to kill me because i am old and feeble and alone and unarmed  he thinks to kill me as the black one thought as dingaan thought as even panda thought yet i live on to this day  well i bear no malice since it is natural that the king should wish to kill one who knows the secret of where he would hide himself for his own lifes sake  that spearhead which the king is fingering is sharp so sharp that my bare breast cannot turn its edge  i must find me a shield  i must find me a shield  fire you are not yet dead  awake make smoke to be my shield and he waved his long monkeylike arms over the embers from which instantly there sprang up a reek of thin white smoke that appeared to take a vague and indefinite shape which suggested the shadow of a man for to me it seemed a nebulous and wavering shadow no more  what are you staring at o king went on zikali in a fierce and thrilling voice  who is it that you see  who has the fire sent to be my shield  ghosts are so thick here that i do not know  i cannot tell one of them from the other  who is it  who who of all that you have slain and who therefore are your foes  umbelazi my brother groaned cetewayo  my brother umbelazi stands before me with spear raised he whom i brought to his death at the battle of the tugela  his eyes flame upon me his spear is raised to strike  he speaks words i cannot understand protect me o wizard  lord of spirits protect me from the spirit of umbelazi  zikali laughed wildly and continued to wave his arms above the fire from which smoke poured ever more densely till the hut was full of it  when it cleared away again cetewayo was gone  saw you ever the like of that said zikali addressing the kaross under which i was sweltering  tell me macumazahn  yes i answered thrusting out my head as a tortoise does when in this very hut you seemed to produce the shape also out of smoke i think of one whom i used to know  say how do you do it zikali  do it  who knows  perchance i do nothing  perchance i think and you fools see no more  or perchance the spirits of the dead who are so near to us come at my call and take themselves bodies out of the charmed smoke of my fire  you white men are wise answer your own question macumazahn  at least that smoke or that ghost saved me from a spear thrust in the heart wherewith cetewayo was minded to pay me for showing him a hidingplace which he desired should be secret to himself alone  well well i can pay as well as cetewayo and my count is longer  now lie you still macumazahn for i go out to watch  he will not bide long in this place which he deems haunted and illomened  he will be gone ere sunset that is within an hour and sleep elsewhere  then he crept from the hut and presently though i could see nothing for now the gate of the fence was shut i heard voices debating and finally that of cetewayo say angrily  have done  it is my will  you can eat your food outside of this place which is bewitched the girl will show us where are the huts of which the wizard speaks  a few minutes later zikali crept back into the hut laughing to himself  all is safe he said and you can come out of your hole old jackal  he who calls himself a king is gone taking with him those whom he thinks faithful most of whom are but waiting a chance to betray him  what did i say a king  nay in all africa there is no slave so humble or so wretched as this broken man  oh feather by feather i have plucked my fowl and by and by i shall cut his throat  you will be there macumazahn you will be there  i trust not i answered as i mopped my brow  we have been near enough to throatcutting this afternoon to last me a long while  where has the king gone  not far macumazahn  i have sent nombe to guide him to the huts in the little dip five spear throws to the right of the mouth of the kloof where live the old herdsman and his people who guard my cattle  he and all the rest are away with the cattle that are hidden in the ceza forest out of reach of the white men so the huts are empty  oh now i read what you are thinking  i do not mean that he should be taken there  it is too near my house and the king still has friends  why did you send nombe i asked  because he would have no other guide who does not trust my men he means to keep her with him for some days and then let her go and thus she will be out of mischief  meanwhile you and your friends can depart untroubled by her fancies and join the white men who are near  tomorrow you shall start  that is good i said with a sigh of relief  then an idea struck me and i added i suppose no harm will come to nombe who might be thought to know too much  i hope not he replied indifferently but that is a matter for her spirit to decide  now go macumazahn for i am weary  i also was weary after my prolonged seclusion under that very hot skin rug  for be it remembered i was not yet strong again and although this was not the real reason why i had stopped behind when the others went to the plateau i still grew easily tired my real reason was that of nombethat i thought they preferred to be alone  i looked about me and saw with relief that cetewayo and every man of his retinue were really gone  they had not even waited to eat the ox that had been killed for them but had carried off the meat with other provisions to their sleepingplace outside the kloof  having made sure of this i went to my hut and loosed lost that fortunately enough had been unable to gnaw through the thick buffalohide riem with which i had fastened him to the pole  he greeted me with rapture as though we had been parted for years  had he belonged to ulysses himself he could not have been more joyful  when one is despondent and lonesome how grateful is the wholehearted welcome of a dog which we are sometimes tempted to think is the only creature that really cares for us in the world  every other living thing has side interests of its own but that of a dog is centred in its master though it is true that it also dreams affectionately of dinner and rabbits  then with lost at my feet i sat outside the hut smoking and waiting for the return of anscombe and heda  presently i caught sight of them in the gloaming  their arms were around one another and in some remarkable way they had managed to dispose their heads forgetting that the sky was still light behind them in such fashion that it was difficult to tell one from the other i reflected that it was a good thing that at last we were escaping from this confounded kloof and country for one where they could marry and make an end and became afflicted with a sneezing fit  heda asked where nombe was and why supper was not ready for nombe played the part of cook and parlourmaid combined  i told her something of what had happened whereon heda who did not appreciate its importance in the least remarked that she nombe might as well have put on the pot before she went and done sundry other things which i forget  ultimately we got something to eat and turned in heda grumbling a little because she must sleep alone for she had grown used to the company of the everwatchful nombe who made her bed across the doorhole of the hut  anscombe was soon lost in dreams if he did dream but i could not sleep well that night  i was fearful of i knew not what and so i think was lost for he fidgeted and kept poking me with his nose  at last i think it must have been about two hours after midnight he began to growl  i could hear nothing although my ears are sharp but as he went on growling i crept to the doorhole and drew aside the board  lost slipped out and vanished while i waited listening  presently i thought i heard a soft footfall and a whisper also that i saw the shape of a woman which reminded me of nombe shown faintly by the starlight it vanished in a moment and lost returned wagging his tail as he might well have done if it were nombe who was attached to the dog  as nothing further happened i went back to bed reflecting that i was probably mistaken since nombe had been sent away for some days by zikali and would scarcely dare to return at once even if she could do so  shortly before daylight lost began to growl again in a subdued and thunderous fashion  this time i got up and dressed myself more or less  then i went out  the dawn was just breaking and by its light i saw a strange scene  about fifty yards away in the narrow nek that ran over some boulders to the site of our huts stood what seemed to be the goddess nomkubulwana as i had seen her on the point of rock in the vale of bones  she wore the same radiant dress and in the dim glow had all the appearance of a white woman  i stood amazed thinking that i dreamt when from round the bend emerged a number of zulus creeping forward stealthily with raised spears  they caught sight of the supernatural figure which barred their road halted and whispered to each other  then they turned to fly but before they went one of them as it seemed to me through sheer terror hurled his assegai at the figure which remained still and unmoved  in thirty seconds they were gone in sixty their footsteps had died away  then the figure wheeled slowly round and by the strengthening light i perceived that a spear transfixed its breast  as it sank to the ground i ran up to it  it was nombe with her face and arms whitened and her lifeblood running down the glittering feather robe    chapter xxii     the madness of nombe      the dog reached nombe first and began to lick her face its tongue removing patches of the white which had not had time to dry  she was lying her back supported by one of the boulders with her left hand she patted the dogs head feebly and with her right drew out the assegai from her body letting it fall upon the ground  recognizing me she smiled in her usual mysterious fashion and said  all is well macumazahn all is very well  i have deserved to die and i do not die in vain  dont talk let me see your wound i exclaimed  she opened her robe and pointed it was quite a small gash beneath the breast from which blood ebbed slowly  let it be macumazahn she said  i am bleeding inside and it is mortal  but i shall not die yet  listen to me while i have my mind  yesterday when mauriti and heddana went up to the plain i wished to go with them because i had news that zulus were wandering everywhere and thought that i might be able to protect my mistress from danger  mauriti spoke to me roughly telling me that i was not wanted  of that i thought little for to such words i am accustomed from him moreover they are to be forgiven to a man in love  but it did not end there for my lady heddana also pierced me with her tongue which hurt more than this spear thrust does macumazahn for i could see that her speech had been prepared and that she took this chance to throw it at me  she said that i did not know where i should sit that i was a thorn beneath her nail and that whenever she wished to talk with mauriti or with you macumazahn i was ever there with my ear open like the mouth of a gourd  she commanded me in future to come only when i was called all of which things i am sure mauriti had taught her who in herself is too gentle even to think themunless you taught her macumazahn  i shook my head and she went on  no it was not you who also are too gentle and having suffered yourself can feel for those who suffer which mauriti who has never suffered cannot do  still you too thought me a trouble one that sticks in the flesh like a hooked thorn or a tick from the grass and cannot be unfastened  you spoke to the master about it and he spoke to me  this time i nodded in assent  i do not blame you macumazahn indeed now i see that you were wise for what right has a poor black doctoress to seek the love or even to look upon the face of the great white lady whom for a little while fate has caused to walk upon the same path with her but yesterday i forgot that macumazahn for you see we are all of us not one self but many selves and each self has its times of rule  nombe alive and well was one woman nombe dying is another and doubtless nombe dead will be a third unless as she prays she should sleep for ever  macumazahn those words of heddanas were to me what gall is to sweet milk  my blood clotted and my heart turned sour  it was not against her that i was angry because that can never happen but against mauriti and against you  my spirit whispered in my ear  it said if mauriti and macumazahn were dead the lady heddana would be left alone in a strange land  then she would learn to rest upon you as upon a stick and learn to love the stick on which she rested though it be so rough and homely but how can i kill them i asked of my spirit and myself escape death  poison is forbidden to you by the pact between us answered my spirit yet i will show you a way who am bound to serve you in all things good or ill  then we nodded to each other in my breast macumazahn and i waited for what should happen who knew that my spirit would not lie  yes i waited for a chance to kill you both forgetting as the wicked forget in their madness that even if i were not found out soon or late heddana would guess the truth and then even if she had learned to love me a thousand times more than she ever could would come to hate me as a mother hates a snake that has slain her child  or even if she never learned or guessed in life after death she would learn and hunt me and spit on me from world to world as a traitoress and a murderer one who has sinned past pardon  here she seemed to grow faint and i turned to seek for help  but she caught hold of my coat and said  hear me out macumazahn or i will run after you till i fall and die  so thinking it best i stayed and she went on  my spirit which must be an evil one since zikali gave it me when i was made a doctoress dealt truly with me for presently the king and his people came  moreover my spirit brought it about that the king would have no other guide but me to lead him to the kraal where he slept last night and i went as though unwillingly  at the kraal the king sent for me and questioned me in a dark hut pretending to be alone but i who am a doctoress knew that two other men were in that hut taking note of all my words  he asked me of the inkosazanayzulu who appeared in the vale of bones and of the little assegai she held in her hand and of the magic of the opener of roads and many other things  i said that i knew nothing of the inkosazana but that without doubt my master was a great magician  he did not believe me  he threatened that i should be tortured very horribly and was about to call his servants to torment me till i told the truth  then my spirit spoke in my heart saying now the door is open to you as i promised  tell the king of the two white men whom the master hides and he will send to kill them leaving the lady heddana and you alone together  so i pretended to be afraid and told him whereon he laughed and answered  for your sake i am glad girl that you have spoken the truth besides it is useless to torture a witch since then the spirit in her only vomits lies  next he called aloud and a man came who it was i could not see in the dark  the king commanded him to take me to one of the other huts and tie me up there to the roofpole  the man obeyed but he did not tie me up he only blocked the hut with the doorboard and sat with me there in the dark alone  now i grew cunning and began to talk with him spreading a net of sweet words as the fowler spreads a net for cranes from which he would tear the crests  soon by his talk i found out that the king and his people knew more than i guessed  macumazahn they had seen the cart which still stands under the overhanging rock by the mouth of the cave  i asked him if that were all pretending that the cart belonged to my master to whom it had been brought from the field of isandhlwana that he might be drawn about in it who was too weak to walk  the man said that if i would kiss him he would tell me everything  i bade him tell me first swearing that then i would kiss him  yes macumazahn i whom no mans lips have ever touched fell as low as this  so he grew foolish and told me he told me that they had also seen a kappje such as white women wear hanging on the hut fence and i remembered that after washing the headdress of my mistress i had set it there to dry in the sun  he told me also that the king suspected that she who wore that kappje was she who had played the part of the inkosazana in the vale of bones  i asked him what the king would do about the matter at the same time denying that there was any white woman in the black kloof  he said that at dawn the king would send and kill these foreign rats whom the opener of roads kept in the thatch of his hut  now he drew near and asked his pay  i gave it to himwith a knifepoint macumazahn  oh that was a good thrust  he never spoke again  then i slipped away for all the others were asleep and was here a little after midnight  i thought i saw you nombe i said but was not sure so i did nothing  she smiled and answered  ah i was afraid that the watcherbynight would be watching by night also the dog ran up to me but he knew me and i sent him back again  now while i was coming home thoughts entered my heart  i saw as one sees by a lightning flash all that i had done  the king and his people were not sure that the master was hiding white folk here and would never have sent back to kill them on the chance  i had made them sure as indeed being mad i meant to do  moreover in throwing spears at the kites i had killed my own dove since it was on the false inkosazana who had caused them to declare war and brought the land to ruin that they wished to be avenged and perchance on him who taught her her part not on one or two wandering white men  i saw that when cetewayos people came and there were many more of them outside several hundreds i think they would shave the whole head and burn the whole tree  every one in the kloof would be killed  how could i undo the knot that i had tied and stamp out the fire that i had lit  that was the question  i bethought me of coming to you but without arms how could you help  i bethought me of going to the master but i was ashamed  also what could he do with but a few servants for the most of his people are away with the cattle  he is too weak to climb the steep path to the plain above nor was there time to gather folk to carry him  lastly even if there were time which there was not and we went thither they would track us out and kill us  for the rest i did not care nor for myself but that the lady heddana should be butchered who was more to me than a hundred lives and through my treacheryah for that i cared  i called on my spirit to help me but it would not come  my spirit was dead in me because now i would do good and not ill yet another spirit came that of one mameena whom once you knew she came angrily like a storm and i shrank before her  she said vile witch you have plotted to murder macumazahn and for that you shall answer to me before another sun has set over this earth of yours  now you seek a way of escape from your own wickedness  well it can be had but at a price  what price o lady of death i asked  the price of your own life witch  i laughed into that ghost face of hers and said  is this all  be swift and show me the way o lady of death and afterwards we will balance our account  then she whispered into the ear of my heart and was gone  i ran on for the dawn was near  i whitened myself with lime i put on the glittering cloak and powdered my hair with the sparkling earth  i took a little stick in my hand since i could find no spear and had no time to search and just as day began to break i crept out and stood in the bend of the path  the slayers came twelve or so of them but behind were many more  they saw the inkosazanayzulu barring their way and were much afraid  they fled but out of his fright one of them threw a spear which went home as i knew it would  he watched to see if i should fall but i would not fall  then he fled faster than the rest knowing himself accursed who had lifted steel against the queen of heaven and oh i am glad i am glad  she ceased exhausted yet with a great exultation in her beautiful eyes indeed at that moment she looked a most triumphant creature  i stared at her thrilled through and through  she had been wicked no doubt but how splendid was her end and thank heaven she was troubled with no thought of what might befall her after that end although i was sure she believed that she would live again to face mameena  i knew not what to do  i did not like to leave her especially as no earthly power could help her case since slowly but quite surely she was bleeding to death from an internal wound  by now the sun was up and zikalis people were about  one of them appeared suddenly and saw then with a howl of terror turned to fly away  fool  fool i cried go summon the lady heddana and the inkosi mauriti  bid them come swiftly if they would see the doctoress nombe before she dies  the man leapt off like a buck and within a few minutes i saw heda and anscombe running towards us half dressed and went to meet them  what is it she gasped  i have only time to tell you this i answered  nombe is dying  she gave her life to save you how i will explain afterwards  the assegai that pierced her was meant for your heart  go thank her and bid her farewell  anscombe stop back with me  we stood still and watched from a little distance  heda knelt down and put her arms about nombe  they whispered together into each others ears  then they kissed  it was at this moment that zikali appeared leaning on two of his servants  by some occult art or instinct he seemed to know all that had happened and oh he looked terrible  he crouched down in front of the dying woman and toadlike spat his venom at her  you lost your spirit did you he said  well it came back to me laden with the black honey of your treachery to me its home as a bee comes to its hive  it has told me everything and well for you witch it is that you are dying  but think not that you shall escape me there in the world below for thither i will follow you  curses on you traitress who would have betrayed me and brought all my plans to naught  ow in a day to come i will pay you back a full harvest for this seed of shame that you have sown  she opened her eyes and looked at him then answered quite softly  i think your chain is broken o zikali no more my master  i think that love has cut your chain in two and i fear you never more  keep the spirit you lent to me it is yours but the rest of me is my own and in the house of my heart another comes to dwell  then once more she stretched out her arms towards heda and murmuring sister forget me not sister who will await you for a thousand years she passed away   it was a good ending to a bad business and i confess i felt glad when it was finished  only afterwards i regretted very much that i had not found an opportunity to ask her whether or no she had masqueraded as mameena in the valley of bones  now it is too late   we buried poor nombe decently in her own little hut where she used to practise her incantations  zikali and his people wished apparently to throw her to the vultures for some secret reason that had to do with their superstitions  but heda who now that nombe was dead developed a great affection for her not unmixed with a certain amount of compunction for which really she had no cause withstood him to his face and insisted upon a decent interment  so she was laid to earth still plastered with the white pigment and wrapped in the bloodstained feather robe  i may add that on the following morning one of zikalis servants informed me solemnly that because of this she had been seen during the night riding up and down the rocks on a baboon as zulu umtagati are supposed to do  i have small doubt that as soon as we were gone they dug her up again and threw her to the vultures and the jackals according to their first intention  on this day we at length escaped from the black kloof and in our own cart for during the night our horses arrived mysteriously from somewhere in good condition though rather wild  i went to say goodbye to zikali who said little except that we should meet once more after many moons  anscombe and heda he would not see at all but only sent them a message to the effect that he hoped they would think kindly of him through the long years to come since he had kept his promise and preserved them safe through many dangers  i might have answered that he had first of all put them into the dangers but considered it wise to hold my tongue  i think however that he guessed my thought if one can talk of guessing in connection with zikali for he said that they had no reason to thank him since if he had served their turn they had served his adding  it will be strange in the times to be for the lady heddana to remember that it was she and no other who crumpled up the zulus like a frostbitten winter reed since had she not appeared upon the rock in the valley of bones there would have been no war  she did not do this you did it zikali i said making her your tool through love and fear  nay macumazahn i did not do it it was done by what you call god and i call fate in whose hand i am the tool  well say to the lady heddana that in payment i will hold back the ghost of nombe from haunting her if i can  say also that if i had not brought her and her lover to zululand they would have been killed   so we went from that hateful kloof which i have never seen since and hope i shall never see again two of zikalis men escorting us until we got into touch with white people  to these we said as little as possible  i think they believed that we were only premature tourists who had made a dash into zululand to visit some of the battlefields  indeed none of us ever reported our strange adventures and after my experience with kaatje we were particularly careful to say nothing in the hearing of any gentleman connected with the press  but as a matter of fact there were so many people moving about and such a continual coming and going of soldiers and their belongings that after we had managed to buy some decent clothes which we did at the little town of newcastle nobody paid any attention to us  on our way to maritzburg one amusing thing did happen  we met kaatje  it was about sunset that we were driving up a steep hill not far from howick  at least i was driving but anscombe and heda were walking about a hundred yards ahead of the cart when suddenly kaatje appeared over a rise and came face to face with them while taking an evening stroll or as i concluded afterwards making some journey  she saw she stared she uttered one wild yell and suddenly bundled over the edge of the road  never would i have believed that such a fat woman could have run so fast  in a minute she was down the slope and had vanished into a dense kloof where as night was closing in and we were very tired it was impossible for us to follow her  nor did subsequent inquiry in howick tell us where she was living or whence she came for some months before she had left the place she had taken there as a cook  such was the end of kaatje so far as we were concerned doubtless to her dying day she remained or will remain a firm believer in ghosts  anscombe and heda were married at maritzburg as soon as the necessary formalities had been completed  i could not attend the ceremony which was a disappointment to me and i hope to them but unfortunately i had a return of my illness and was laid up for a week  perhaps this was owing to the hot sun that struck me on the neck one afternoon coming down the town hill where i was obliged to hang on to the rear of the cart because the brakes had given out  however i was able to send heda a wedding gift in the shape of her jewels and money that i recovered from the bank which she had never expected to see again also to arrange everything about her property  they went down to durban for their honeymoon and some convenient opportunity arising sailed thence for england  i received an affectionate letter from them both which i still treasure thanking me very much for all i had done for them that after all was little enough  also anscombe enclosed a blank cheque begging me to fill it in for whatever sum i considered he was indebted to me on the balance of account  i thought this very kind of him and a great mark of confidence but the cheque remained blank  i never saw either of them again and though i believe that they are both living for the most part abroadin hungary i thinki do not suppose that i ever shall  when i came to england some years later after king solomons mines had made me rich i wrote anscombe a letter  he never answered it which hurt me at the time  afterwards i remembered that in their fine position it was very natural that they should not wish to renew acquaintance with an individual who had so intimate a knowledge of certain incidents that they probably regarded as hateful such as the deaths of marnham and dr rodd and all the surrounding circumstances  if so i daresay that they were wise but of course it may have been only carelessness  it is so easy for busy and fashionable folk not to answer a rather troublesome letter or to forget to put that answer in the post  or indeed the letter may never have reached themsuch things often go astray especially when people live abroad  at any rate perhaps through my own fault we have drifted apart  i daresay they believe that i am dead or not to be found somewhere in africa however i always think of them with affection for anscombe was one of the best travelling companions i ever had and his wife a most charming girl and wonder whether zikalis prophecy about their children will come true  good luck go with them  as it chances since then i passed the place where the temple stood though at a little distance  i had the curiosity however at some inconvenience to ride round and examine the spot  i suppose that heda had sold the property for a backveld boer who was absent at the time had turned what used to be rodds hospital into his house  close by grim and gaunt stood the burntout marble walls of the temple  the verandah was still roofed over and standing on the spot whence i had shot the pistol out of rodds hand i was filled with many memories  i could trace the whole plan of the building and visited that part of it which had been marnhams room  the iron safe that stood in the corner had been taken away but the legs of the bedstead remained  also not far from it over grown with running plants was a little heap which i took to be the ashes of his desk for bits of burnt wood protruded  i grubbed among them with my foot and riding crop and presently came across the remains of a charred human skull  then i departed in a hurry  my way took me through the yellowwood grove past the horns of the blue wildebeeste which still lay there past that mudhole also into which rodd had fallen dead  here however i made no more search who had seen enough of bones  to this day i do not know whether he still lies beneath the slimy ooze or was removed and buried  also i saw the site of our wagon camp where the basutos attacked us  but i will have done with these reminiscences which induce melancholy though really there is no reason why they should  tout lasse tout casse tout passeeverything wears out everything crumbles everything vanishesin the words of the french proverb that my friend sir henry curtis is so fond of quoting that at last i wrote it down in my pocketbook only to remember afterwards that when i was a boy i had heard it from the lips of an old scamp of a frenchman of the name of leblanc who once gave me and another lessons in the gallic tongue  but of him i have already written in marie which is the first chapter in the book of the fall of the zulus  that headed child of storm is the second  these pages form the third and last  ah indeed tout lasse tout casse tout passe    chapter xxiii     the kraal jazi      now i shall pass over all the zulu record of the next four years since after all it has nothing to do with my tale and i do not pretend to be writing a history  sir garnet wolseley set up his kilkenny cat government in zululand or the home government did it for him i do not know which  in place of one king thirteen chiefs were erected who got to work to cut the throats of each other and of the people  as i expected would be the case zikali informed the military authorities of the secret hidingplace in the ingome forest where he suggested to cetewayo that he should refuge  the exking was duly captured there and taken first to the cape and then to england where after the disgrace of poor sir bartle frere an agitation had been set on foot on his behalf  here he saw the queen and her ministers once more conquering as it had been prophesied that he would by her who wore the shape of mameena at the memorable scene in the valley of bones when i was present often i have thought of him dressed in a black coat and seated in that villa in melbury road in the suburb of london which i understand is populated by artists  a strange contrast truly to the savage prince receiving the salute of triumph after the battle of the tugela in which he won the kingship or to the royal monarch to whose presence i had been summoned at ulundi however he was brought back to zululand again by a british manofwar reinstalled to a limited chieftainship by sir theophilus shepstone and freed from the strangling embrace of the black coat  then of course there was more fighting as every one knew would happen except the british colonial office indeed all zululand ran with blood  for in england cetewayo and his rights or wrongs had like the boers and their rights or wrongs become a matter of party politics to which everything else must give way often i wonder whether party politics will not in the end prove the ruin of the british empire  well thank heaven i shall not live to learn  so cetewayo came back and fought and was defeated by those who once had been his subjects  now for the last scene that is all with which i need concern myself  at the beginning of february 1884 business took me to zululand it had to do with a deal in cattle and blankets  as i was returning towards the tugela who should i meet but friend goza he who had escorted me from the black kloof to ulundi before the outbreak of war and who afterwards escorted me and that unutterable nuisance kaatje out of the country  at first i thought that we came together by accident or perhaps that he had journeyed a little way to thank me for the blankets which i had sent to him remembering my ancient promise but afterwards i changed my opinion on this point  well we talked over many matters the war the disasters that had befallen zululand and so forth  especially did we talk of that night in the valley of bones and the things we had seen there side by side  i asked him if the people still believed in the inkosazanayzulu who then appeared in the moonlight on the rock  he answered that some did and some did not  for his part he added looking at me fixedly he did not since it was rumoured that zikali had dressed up a white woman to play the part of the spirit  yet he could not be sure of the matter since it was also said that when some of cetewayos people went to kill this white woman in the black kloof nomkubulwana the princess of heaven herself rose before them and frightened them away  i remarked that this was very strange and then quite casually asked him whom zikali had dressed up to play the part of the dead mameena upon that same occasion since this was a point upon which i always thirsted for definite intelligence  he stared at me and replied that i ought to be able to answer my own question since i had been much nearer to her who looked like mameena than any one else so near indeed that all present distinctly saw her kiss me as it was well known she had liked to do while still alive  i replied indignantly that they saw wrong and repeated my question  then he answered straight out  o macumazahn we zulus believe that what we saw on that night was not nombe or another dressed up but the spirit of the witch mameena itself  we believe it because we could see the light of zikalis fire through her not always but sometimes also because all that she said has come true though everything is not yet finished  i could get no more out of him about the matter for when i tried to speak of it again he turned the subject telling me of his wonderful escapes during the war  presently he rose to go and said casually  surely i grow old in these times of trouble macumazahn for thoughts slip through my head like water through the fingers almost i had forgotten what i wished to say to you  the other day i met zikali the opener of roads  he told me that you were in zululand and that i should meet youhe did not say where only that when i did meet you i was to give you a message  this was the messagethat when on your way to natal you came to the kraal jazi you would find him there also another whom you used to know and must be sure not to go away without seeing him since that was about to happen in which you must take your part  zikali i exclaimed  i have heard nothing of him since the war  i thought that by now he was certainly dead  oh no macumazahn he is certainly not dead but just the same as ever  indeed it is believed that he and no other has kept all this broth of trouble on the boil some say for cetewayos sake and some say because he wishes to destroy cetewayo  but what do i know of such matters who only desire to live in peace under whatever chief the english queen sends to us as she has a right to do having conquered us in war  when you meet the opener of roads at the kraal jazi ask him macumazahn  where the devil is the kraal jazi i inquired with irritation i never heard of such a place  nor did i therefore i cannot tell you macumazahn  for aught i can say it may be down beneath where dead men go  but wherever it is there certainly you will meet the opener of roads  now farewell macumazahn  if it should chance that we never look into each others eyes again i am sure you will think of me sometimes as i shall of you and of all that we have seen together especially on that night in the vale of bones when the ghost of the witch mameena prophesied to us and kissed you before us all  she must have been very beautiful macumazahn as indeed i have heard from those who remember her and i dont wonder that you loved her so much  still for my part i had rather be kissed by a living woman than by one who is dead though doubtless it is best to be kissed by none at all  again farewell and be sure to tell the opener of roads that i gave you his message lest he should lay some evil charm upon me who have seen enough evil of late  thus talking goza departed  i never saw him again and do not know if he is dead or alive  well he was a kindly old fellow if no hero   i had almost forgotten the incident of this meeting when a while later i found myself in the neighbourhood of the beautiful but semitropical place called eshowe which since those days has become the official home of the british resident in zululand indeed although the house was not then finished if it had been begun sir melmoth osborn already had an office there  i wished to see him in order to give him some rather important information but when i reached a kraal of about fifty huts some five hundred yards from the site of the present residency my wagon stuck fast in the boggy ground  while i was trying to get it out a quietfaced zulu whose name i remember was umnikwa informed me that malimati that is sir melmoth osborns native name was somewhere at a little distance from eshowe too far away for me to get to him that night  i answered very well i would sleep where i was and asked the name of the kraal  he replied jazi at which i started but only said that it was a strange name seeing that it meant finished or finished with joy  umnikwa answered yes but that it had been so called because the chief umfokaki or the stranger who married a sister of the king was killed at this kraal by his brother gundane or the bat  i remarked that it was an illomened kind of name to which the man replied yes and likely to become more so since the king cetewayo who had been sheltering there beneath the armpit of malimati the white lord for some months lay in it dying  i asked him of what he was dying and he replied that he did not know but that doubtless the father of the witchdoctors named zikali the opener of roads would be able to tell me as he was attending on cetewayo  he has sent me to bid you to come at once o macumazahn he added casually having had news that you were arriving here  showing no surprise i answered that i would come although goodness knows i was surprised enough and leaving my servants to get my wagon out of the bog i walked into the kraal with the messenger  he took me to a large hut placed within a fence about the gate of which some women were gathered who all looked very anxious and disturbed  among them i saw dabuko the kings brother whom i knew slightly  he greeted me and told me that cetewayo was at the point of death within the hut but like umnikwa professed ignorance of the cause of his illness  for a long while over an hour i should think i sat there outside the hut or walked to and fro  until darkness came i could occupy myself with contemplating the scenery of the encircling hills which is among the most beautiful in zululand with its swelling contours and rich colouring  but after it had set in only my thoughts remained and these i found depressing  at length i made up my mind that i would go away for after all what had i to do with this business of the death of cetewayo if in truth he was dying  i wished to see no more of cetewayo of whom all my recollections were terrific or sorrowful  i rose to depart when suddenly a woman emerged from the hut  i could not see who she was or even what she was like because of the gloom also for the reason that she had the corner of her blanket thrown over her face as though she wished to keep it hidden  for a moment she stopped opposite to me and said  the king who is sick desires to see you macumazahn  then she pointed to the doorhole of the hut and vanished shutting the gate of the fence behind her  curiosity overcame me and i crawled into the hut pushing aside the doorboard in order to do so and setting it up again when i was through  inside burned a single candle fixed in the neck of a bottle faintly illuminating that big and gloomy place  by its feeble light i saw a low bedstead on the left of the entrance and lying on it a man half covered by a blanket in whom i recognized cetewayo  his face was shrunken and distorted with pain and his great bulk seemed less but still without doubt it was cetewayo  greeting macumazahn he said feebly you find me in evil case but i heard that you were here and thought that i should like to see you before i die because i know that you are honest and will report my words faithfully  i wish you to tell the white men that my heart never really was against them they have always been the friends of my heart but others forced me down a road i did not wish to travel of which now i have come to the end  what is the matter with you king i asked  i do not know macumazahn but i have been sick for some days the opener of roads who came to doctor me because my wives believed those white medicinemen wished me dead says that i have been poisoned and must die  if you had been here at first you might perhaps have given me some medicine  but now it is too late he added with a groan  who then poisoned you king  i cannot tell you macumazahn  perhaps my enemies perhaps my brothers perhaps my wives  all wish to have done with me and the great one who is no longer wanted is soon dead  be thankful macumazahn that you never were a king for sad is the lot of kings  where then is the opener of roads i asked  he was here a little while ago  perhaps he has gone out to take the kings head ie to announce his death to malimati and the white men he answered in a faint voice  just then i heard a shuffling noise proceeding from that part of the hut where the shadow was deepest and looking saw an emaciated arm projected into the circle of the light  it was followed by another arm then by a vast head covered with long white hair that trailed upon the ground then by a big misshapen body so wasted that it looked like a skeleton covered with corrugated black skin  slowly like a chameleon climbing a bough the thing crept forward and i knew it for zikali  he reached the side of the bed and squatted down in his toadlike fashion then again like a chameleon without moving his head turned his deep and glowing eyes towards me  hail o macumazahn he said in his low voice  did i not promise you long ago that you should be with me at the last and are you not with me and another  it seems so zikali i answered  but why do you not send for the white doctors to cure the king  all the doctors white and black in the whole world cannot cure him macumazahn  the spirits call him and he dies  at his call i came fast and far but even i cannot cure himalthough because of him i myself must die  why i asked  look at me macumazahn and say if i am one who should travel well all come to their end at last even the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn  cetewayo lifted his head and looked at him then said heavily  perchance it would have been better for our house if that end had been sooner  now that i lie dying many sayings concerning you come into my mind that i had forgotten  moreover opener of roads i never sent for you whoever may have done so and it was not until after you came here that the great pain seized me  how did it happen he went on with gathering force that the white men caught me in the secret place where you told me i should hide  who pointed out that hidden hole to the white men  but what does it matter now  nothing at all o son of panda answered zikali even less than it matters how i escaped the spearhead hidden in your robe yonder in my hut in the black kloof where had it not been for a certain spirit that stood between you and me you would have murdered me  tell me son of panda during these last three days have you thought at all of your brother umbelazi and of certain other brethren of yours whom you killed at the battle of the tugela when the white man here led the charge of the amawombe against your regiments and ate up three of them  cetewayo groaned but said nothing  i think he had become too faint to speak  listen son of panda went on zikali in an intense and hissing voice  many many years ago before senzangacona your grandfather saw the lightwho knows how long beforea man was born of high blood in the dwandwe tribe which man was a dwarf chaka the black one conquered the dwandwe but this man of high blood was spared because he was a dwarf an abortion to whom chaka gave the name of the thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn keeping him about him to be a mock in times of peace and safety and because he was wise and learned in magic to be a counsellor in times of trouble  moreover chaka killed this mans wives and children for his sport save one whom he kept to be his sister  therefore for the sake of his people and his butchered wives and children this wizard swore an oath of vengeance against chaka and all his house  working beneath the ground like a rat he undermined the throne of chaka and brought him to his death by the spears of his brethren and of mopo his servant whom chaka had wronged  still working in the dark like a rat he caused dingaan who stabbed chaka to murder the boer retief and his people and thus called down upon his head the vengeance of the whites and afterwards brought dingaan to his death  then panda your father arose and his life this thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn spared because once panda had done him a kindness  only through the witch mameena he brought sorrow on him causing war to arise between his children one of whom was named cetewayo  then this cetewayo ruled first with his father panda and afterwards in his place and trouble arose between him and the english  son of panda you will remember that this cetewayo was in doubt whether to fight the english and demanded a sign of the thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn  he gave the sign causing the inkosazanayzulu the princess of heaven to appear before him and thereby lifting the spear of war  son of panda you know how that war went how this cetewayo was defeated and came to the thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn like a hunted hyena to learn of a hole where he might hide  you know too how he strove to murder the poor old doctor who showed him such a hole how he was taken prisoner and sent across the water and afterwards set up again in the land that had learned to hate him to bring its children to death by thousands  and you know how at last he took refuge beneath the wing of the white chief here in the kraal jazi and lived spat upon an outcast until at length he fell sick as such men are apt to do and the thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn was sent for to doctor him  and you know also how he lies dying within him an agony as though he had swallowed a red hot spear and before him a great blackness peopled by the ghosts of those whom he has slain and of his forefathers whose house he has pulled down and burned  zikali ceased and thrusting his hideous head to within an inch or two of that of the dying man he glowered at him with his fierce and fiery eves  then he began to whisper into the kings ear who quivered at his words as the victim quivers beneath the torturers looks  at that moment the end of the candle fell into the bottle which was of clear white glass and there burned for a little while dully before it went out  never shall i forget the scene illumined by its blue and ghastly light  the dying man lying on the low couch rocking his head to and fro the wizard bending over him like some grey vampire bat sucking the lifeblood from his helpless throat  the terror in the eyes of the one the insatiable hate in the eyes of the other  oh it was awful  macumazahn gasped cetewayo in a rattling whisper help me macumazahn  i say that i am poisoned by this zikali who hates me  oh drive away the ghosts drive them away  i looked at him and at his tormentor squatted by him like a mocking fiend and as i looked the candle went out  then my nerve broke the cold sweat poured from my face and i fled from the hut as a man might from a scene in hell followed by the low mocking laugh of zikali  outside the women and others were gathered in the gloom  i told them to go to the king who was dying and blundered up the slope to search for some white man  no one was to be found but a kaffir messenger by the office told me that malimati was still away and had been sent for  so i returned to my wagon and lay down in it exhausted for what more could i do   it was a rough night  thunder muttered and rain fell in driving gusts  i dozed off only to be awakened by a sound of wailing then i knew that the king was dead for this was the isililo the cry of mourning  i wondered whether the murderersfor that he was poisoned i had no doubtwere among those who wailed  towards dawn the storm rolled off and the night grew serene and clear for a waning moon was shining in the sky  the heat of that stiffing place oppressed me my blood seemed to be afire  i knew that there was a stream in a gorge about half a mile away for it had been pointed out to me  i longed for a swim in cool water who to tell truth had found none for some days and bethought me that i would bathe in this stream before i trekked from that hateful spot for to me it had become hateful  calling my driver who was awake and talking with the voorloopers for they knew what was passing at the kraal and were alarmed i told them to get the oxen ready to start as i would be back presently then i set off for the stream and after a longish walk scrambled down a steep ravine to its banks following a path made by kaffir women going to draw water  arrived there at last i found that it was in flood and rising rapidly at least so i judged from the sound for in that deep treehung place the light was too faint to allow me to see anything  so i sat down waiting for the dawn and wishing that i had not come because of the mosquitoes  at length it broke and the mists lifted showing that the spot was one of great beauty  opposite to me was a waterfall twenty or thirty feet high over which the torrent rushed into a black pool below  everywhere grew tall ferns and beyond these graceful trees from whose leaves hung raindrops  in the centre of the stream on the edge of the fall was a rock not a dozen feet away from me round which the water foamed  something was squatted on this rock at first i could not see what because of the mist but thought that it was a greyheaded baboon or some other animal and regretted that i had not brought a gun with me  presently i became aware that it must be a man for in a chanting voice it began to speak or pray in zulu and hidden behind a flowering bush i could hear the words  they were to this effect  o my spirit here where thou foundest me when i was young hundreds of years ago he said hundreds but i suppose he meant tens i come back to thee  in this pool i dived and beneath the waters found thee my snake and thou didst wind thyself about my body and about my heart here i understood that the speaker was alluding to his initiation as a witchdoctor which generally includes or used to include the finding of a snake in a river that coils itself about the neophyte  about my body and in my heart thou hast dwelt from that sun to this giving me wisdom and good and evil counsel and that which thou hast counselled i have done  now i return thee whence thou camest there to await me in the new birth  o spirits of my fathers toiling through many years i have avenged you on the house of senzangacona and never again will there be a king of the zulus for the last of them lies dead by my hand  o my murdered wives and my children i have offered up to you a mighty sacrifice a sacrifice of thousands upon thousands  o umkulukulu great one of the heavens who sentest me to earth i have done thy work upon the earth and bring back to thee thy harvest of the seed that thou hast sown a bloodred harvest o umkulukulu  be still be still my snake the sun arises and soon soon shalt thou rest in the water that wast thine from the beginning of the world   the voice ceased and presently a spear of light piercing the mists lit upon the speaker  it was zikali and about him was wound a great yellowbellied snake of which the black head with flickering tongue waved above his head and seemed from time to time to lick him on the brow  i suppose it had come to him from the water for its skin glittered as though with wet  he stood up on tottering feet staring at the red eye of the rising sun then crying finished finished with joy with a loud and dreadful laughter he plunged into the foaming pool beneath   such was the end of zikali the wizard opener of roads the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn and such was the vengeance that he worked upon the great house of senzangacona bringing it to naught and with it the nation of the zulus
